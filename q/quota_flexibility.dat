40|$|To explain over- and underuse of {{available}} quota, Buysse et al. (2007) have integrated the shadow {{cost of the}} quota constraint in a <b>quota</b> <b>flexibility</b> function in a positive mathematical programming model. This method and central hypothesis, formulated and tested for the case of Belgian sugar beet farms, is in current paper extended and confirmed for the cases of Flemish dairy quota and manure emission rights. Despite the different organisation, objectives and implementations of the diverse quota systems, the results are similar. A higher utilisation of quota is significantly driven by the quota rent, but farm characteristics are also important and the effect declines with increasing quota rent. Regardless the quota, the dairy <b>quota</b> <b>flexibility</b> behaviour of the sample of Flemish farms results in an output price elasticity of 0. 6 %.

40|$|Abstract. This work {{presents}} a Possibilistic Linear Programming (PLP) method of solving integrated Manufacturing and Distribution Planning Decisions (MDPD) problems with multiple imprecise goals in supply chains under uncertain environment. The model aims to minimize total net costs, total delivery time and total imperfect quality items {{with reference to}} available supply, machine capacities, labour levels, <b>quota</b> <b>flexibility,</b> cost budget, forecast demand, warehouse space at each destination, inspection cost at each source and imperfect quality items transported from origins to destinations. Triangular distribution numbers are used to represent imprecise numbers. An industrial case is used to demonstrate the application of PLP method for MDPD problem. LINGO software is used to solve the problem...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the vendor}} {{selection}} (VS) problem with fuzzy goals is considered. An interactive method is developed for solving multi-objective VS problems where fuzzy data {{are represented by}} using S-curve membership functions. The proposed method attempts simultaneously to minimize the total order costs, the number of rejected items {{and the number of}} late delivered items with reference to several constraints such as meeting buyers’ demand, vendors’ capacity, vendors’ <b>quota</b> <b>flexibility,</b> vendors’ allocated budget, etc. An interactive solution methodology is proposed to solve the multi-objective VS problem and to find a preferred compromise solution. Moreover, the performance of S-curve membership functions that represent uncertainty goals and constraints in VS problems with linear membership functions in an industrial case is compared...|$|E

Earlier version {{published}} in Proceedings of the 2005 North American Association of Fisheries Economists Forum FCRR, 2006; 14 (1) :pp. 77 - 86 Property rights regimes are increasingly recommended and implemented in fisheries management around the world. While theoretical examination and anecdotal evidence {{suggest that these}} regimes are successful at increasing both productivity and sustainability, the empirical evidence on their effects is limited. This paper provides an empirical examination {{of the effect of}} a move to a property rights system on productivity in the Norwegian coastal cod fishery. Using a unique vessel-level dataset I conduct a parallel analysis using a traditional productivity approach and an index number decomposition to establish the source of productivity changes. The strength of conducting a parallel analysis is to be comparable with previous studies while exploiting the power of the decomposition to identify the component effects of the policy. Determining the important components of productivity changes, such as transferability of <b>quota</b> and <b>flexibility</b> in when to harvest, allows for the refinement of management to mimic the effect of property rights systems even when their full implementation may not be possible. Results suggest that the introduction of individual vessel quotas in the coastal cod fisshery increased productivity. Stephanie F. McWhinni...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{pricing policy}} is a {{fundamental}} humanly devised theoretical and practical cornerstone {{in the fight against}} climate change. It involves short term and long term policies, theoretical and practical considerations. A quantitative global stabilisation target range for the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is needed, because it is an important and useful foundation in the shaping of a comprehensive climate pricing policy. A global stabilisation target range is obviously a long term policy to control climate change and events ensuing excessive increase in temperature. Setting long term objectives in the fight against climate change are substantial in avoiding catastrophic consequences therefore short term policies, which aim advances in emission reductions, have to be consistent with the pre-defined long term stabilisation goals. Short term policy reaction means using price-driven instruments like taxes and tradable quotas. These instruments allow broad flexibility in the parameters of emission reduction, and provide opportunities and incentives wherewith the cost of mitigation and abatement can be kept down. Taxes and tradable <b>quotas</b> give the <b>flexibility</b> in how, where and when emission reduction can be accomplished thereby reaching agreements between states and companies may result an appropriate and environment-conscious emission scheme, that can fit into the long term objectives...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate vendor {{selection}} and their optimum quota allocation {{has been an}} area of high importance in the effective management of a supply chain. The optimization of vendor-base is needed to identify better performing vendors in a supply chain. Secondly their quota allocations need to be optimized for the organization to remain competitive in the global scenario. The Supplier Quota Allocation (SQA) concept ‘Multi-Objective Linear Programming Vendor Selection Problem the mathematical formulation of which incorporates three important goals- cost- minimization, rejection-minimization (or quality-maximization) and minimization of late-delivery- with practical constraints imposed on: meeting the manufacturing organization’s annual aggregate demand, vendors ’ capacity, vendors ’ <b>quota</b> <b>flexibility,</b> vendors ’ rating etc. In FP formulation of a supply chain modeling, various input parameters are treated as vague with a linear membership function of fuzzy type...|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} various {{approaches}} are presented for supplier selection. For example, Weber et al. (1998) defined three methods for selecting and negotiating with sellers not yet selected. Additionally, they clarified how two multi-criteria analysis tools, MOP, {{as well as}} DEA can be used simultaneously for this process of selection and negotiation under some circumstances. Karpak et al. (2001) introduced one of the decision support systems which were ‘‘user friendly’’ with multiple criteria known as visual interactive goal programming (VIG). VIG makes the presentation of a decision support system for improvements in the decisions of supplier selection. Talluri and Narasimhan (2003) proposed a max–min productivity based method deriving variability measures of vendor performance, which are then used in a nonparametric statistical manner for the identification of groups of vendors to have an effective selection. Kumar et al. (2004) used fuzzy GP method. They formulated a vendor selection problem as a fuzzy mixed integer GP to include the imprecise aspiration levels of the objectives. This consists of three main goals: minimizing the net cost, reducing the net rejections, and minimizing the net late deliveries depending on realistic restrictions over customer’s demand, vendor’s capacity as well as <b>quota</b> <b>flexibility,</b> purchasing value of items, allocating the budget to the individual seller, etc. After specifying the weights of a selected rank, Liu and Hai (2005) made {{a comparison of the}} weighted sum of the selection number of rank vote. They proposed a fresh weighting technique instead of pairwise comparison of AHP for supplier selection. They introduced a simpler technique than AHP known as voting analytic hierarchy process. However, it does not miss the organized method of deriving the weights which are adopted and scored the suppliers’ performance. Saen (2007) suggested an original method for supplier selection when there are both ordinal and cardinal data. His method identified best suppliers whose efficiency score is equal to one and is not able to find most efficient supplier. Indeed, using his method, decision maker cannot decide which supplier is the best among other units. Ting and Cho (2008) offered a combined method using LP that blends AHP and LP. The procedure takes both tangible and intangible factors into account in the selection of the best suppliers and in giving them ideal order quantities. The aim is to maximize total purchasing value. Kokangul and Susuz (2009) proposed an integrated AHP with nonlinear integer and MOP. The approach is used under certain limitations including quantity discounts, capacity, and budget to specify the best suppliers and put the optimum order quantities among them. Toloo and Nalchigar (2011) propose an innovative integrated DEA model that can detect the most efficient supplier when there exist both cardinal and ordinal data.|$|E
40|$|A Landing Obligation (LO), or a {{requirement}} to land all catches of certain fish species, was introduced {{as part of}} the EU’s new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) in 2014. This DiscardLess policy brief focuses on initial experiences with LO implementation in the Baltic and Pelagic fisheries. It summarises the discard plans in these fisheries, presents stakeholder experiences from interviews, meeting attendance and literature review and highlights emerging issues relevant to all fisheries where the LO is being implemented. Background and main elements of the landing obligation. In March 2007, the Commission published a communication recognising the serious problem of discarding in European fisheries. A public consultation was held and discarding was subsequently highlighted in the Commission’s Green Paper on CFP reform. While a discard ban received significant support, industry recommended instead that discard reduction should be planned, on a fisheries basis, through creating incentives to enhance selectivity. An incident involving a UK trawler in Norwegian waters in 2008 generated public pressure to end discarding, which increased from August 2010 in response to a UK celebrity chef’s public campaign known as “Hugh’s Fish Fight”. In 2011 the Commission included an obligation to land catches of regulated species in its CFP reform proposal. The adopted CFP included a LO, which applied for Baltic and pelagic fisheries from January 2015. The main elements of the LO are as follows: Scope: The LO applies to all catches of species which are subjected to Total Allowable Catch (TAC) limits or, in the Mediterranean, to a minimum landing size (MLS). Species that are not subject to TACs or MLS can still be discarded. Minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) : The LO requires that fish under the MCRS are landed but prohibits their use for direct human consumption. Catches of all fish, including fish below the MCRS must be recorded and counted against quotas. Exemptions: The LO does not apply to species and fisheries with demonstrably high survival rates for discarded fish. Also up to 5 % of the total catch of species may be discarded in cases where selectivity increases are difficult to achieve or where handling of unwanted catches creates disproportionate costs (de minimis exemptions). Discard plans: In the absence of multiannual plans groups of member states organised at a regional level develop discard plans in consultation with advisory councils. These plans are submitted as “joint recommendations”, which detail the species {{to be included in the}} LO, at which times and also any exemptions. Following review of the joint recommendations by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) the plans are adopted by the European Commission either in full or with amendments. <b>Quota</b> <b>flexibility</b> The LO requires that fishermen have access to quotas to cover their catches or they have to cease fishing (see “choke species problem” below). Accordingly, there are rules that allow for conditional transfer of quota between years and between species...|$|E
