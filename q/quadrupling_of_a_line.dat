50|$|The {{station is}} located on the Amsterdam-Arnhem railway between Amsterdam and Utrecht, and was opened on 18 December 1843. Back then there were just two trains a day going to Abcoude. The line was doubled to 4 tracks in 2007 and the old station close with a new station opening a few hundred metres to the north. The old station stood next to the Gein with the line {{crossing}} the river by a bridge which was barely higher than the river level. During the <b>quadrupling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>line</b> <b>a</b> new underpass was built to take the railway under the river. This new underpass begins just after the current station and emerges back at ground level a good distance past the original station buildings.|$|R
