5000|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>answer</b> are {{selected}} by ballot {{a few days}} before the question time takes place and published. Ministers therefore have advance warning of the initial questions, but after each question has been answered, the MP in whose name it appears may ask a supplementary question on the same subject area for which no notice is given (unless the MP chooses to do so privately). The Speaker will usually call other MPs to ask further supplementary questions and this will often include Opposition front bench spokespersons. A second ballot enables MPs to put forward their names to ask a topical <b>question</b> <b>for</b> which no notice is required.|$|R
50|$|Questions are {{of three}} types—Starred, Unstarred and Short Notice. A Starred Question {{is one to}} which a member desires an <b>oral</b> <b>answer</b> in the House and which is {{distinguished}} by an asterisk mark. An unstarred Question is one which is not called <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>answer</b> {{in the house and}} on which no supplementary questions can consequently be asked. An answer to such a question is given in writing. Minimum period of notice <b>for</b> starred/ unstarred <b>question</b> is 10 clear days. If the questions given notice of are admitted by the Speaker, they are listed and printed for answer on the dates allotted to the Ministries to which {{the subject matter of the}} question pertains.|$|R
25|$|Unless a {{question}} is urgent and relates to {{a matter of}} public importance or to the arrangement of public business and the Speaker's permission has been obtained to ask it, to pose {{a question}} an MP must give not later than seven clear days' written notice before the sitting day on which the answer is required. An MP may ask up to five questions at any one time, not more than three of which may be <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> <b>answer.</b> Detailed rules govern the contents of <b>questions.</b> <b>For</b> instance, <b>questions</b> must not contain statements which the MP is not prepared to substantiate; or arguments, inferences, opinions, imputations, epithets or tendentious, ironical or offensive expressions; and a question must not be asked to obtain an expression of opinion, the solution of an abstract legal case or the answer to a hypothetical proposition.|$|R

A model <b>for</b> {{gathering}} <b>oral</b> <b>answers</b> as part {{of testing}} the speaker skills (i. e. command of language, native or foreign) is presented, {{as well as the}} software used in the experimentation. The research presented here is a result of more than six (6) months’ work with TESOL experts, based on 60 test subjects who gave 240 answers...|$|R
50|$|He is {{currently}} {{a member of the}} Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission and is the member of the committee responsible <b>for</b> <b>answering</b> <b>oral</b> <b>questions</b> in Parliament on behalf of the Electoral Commission. He assumed the role after Sir Peter Viggers stepped down during the MPs' expenses scandal. His own expenses for 2008/09 were £162,719, ranking 158th out of 647 MPs.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} types of question—Starred and non-starred. Starred <b>Questions</b> are those <b>for</b> which an <b>oral</b> <b>answer</b> is expected. The member is allowed to ask a {{supplementary}} question, {{with the permission of}} the Speaker, after the reply is obtained from the Minister concerned. Non-starred <b>questions</b> are those <b>for</b> which a written reply is expected. After the reply has been provided, no supplementary question can be asked. A notice period is to be given to the minister to reply to a question. However, if a Member seeks to ask a question urgently and cannot wait {{for the duration of the}} notice period, then the member can do so provided it is accepted by the Speaker. Such questions are called supplementary questions.|$|R
40|$|Imparting of knowledge, its {{verification}} {{and assessment}} represent {{the most important}} teacher’s tasks. The examination results are equally important for the student and for the teacher. On {{the basis of the}} results the teacher assesses if the teaching aims were achieved, if the knowledge was imparted correctly and plans their further work. The student assesses their learning progress. Nowadays there are several various ways for teachers to assess students’ knowledge; from classic oral and written assessment to the latest forms of computer based assessment of knowledge. With the use of the appropriate software the latter can save a considerable period of teacher`s time. The diploma paper presents how Microsoft Excel, one of the major programs of Microsoft Office, can be used by teachers. It describes how to compose crosswords, quizzes and linking exercises. It also provides how student’s initial, present and final knowledge can be assessed. The exercises can be composed {{in a way that the}} student gets the feedback about the correctness of the answer as soon as it has been chosen. The main purpose of the diploma paper was to program the didactic application ADEA (Assessment Didactic Excel Application) in programing language Visual Basic for Application (VBA) which works in Excel. The application helps teachers in composing <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> and writing examination, correcting and assessing the exams, copying out the results and also in making a random seating order. In the end the didactic characteristics of the application were evaluated by teachers with various computer skills. Teachers with the lack of computer skills would probably need more time while adopting the application ADEA since they firstly have to master the basics of Microsoft Office Excel. Eventually all the input time and effort would be refund frequently. ...|$|R
50|$|If {{a member}} desires <b>oral</b> <b>answer,</b> he is {{required}} to indicate the question by putting an asterisk mark (*) before it. The questions are answered in {{the order in which}} they are printed in the list of <b>questions</b> put <b>for</b> the day. Members are restricted to three such <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> any sitting day. The questions are asked in the order listed by the member who requested it. Supplementary questions can be asked for the purpose of eliciting further information on any matter of fact. The Speaker decides the number of supplementary questions according to the importance of a question.|$|R
50|$|No {{more than}} 22 questions, {{excluding}} urgent questions {{that may be}} permitted by the President, may be asked at any one meeting. Replies to questions may be given by designated public officers, usually secretaries, orally or in written form. <b>For</b> <b>questions</b> seeking <b>oral</b> replies, supplementary questions may be put by any member when called upon {{by the president of}} the council for the purpose of elucidating that answer. Where there is no debate on a motion with no legislative effect at a meeting, no more than ten questions requiring oral replies may be asked; otherwise, no more than six questions may require an oral reply.|$|R
40|$|Pictures {{are often}} {{integrated}} in digital learning materials {{with the purpose}} of enhancing learning. This mixed methods study uses quantitative eye-tracking data and qualitative data such as <b>oral</b> <b>answers</b> to discover whether characteristics of pictures influence patterns of text–picture transition in readers with (n= 10) and without (n= 14) dyslexia, and how reading comprehension is affected. Most participants attended to the picture with a “noncongruent with reality” motif early in the inspection process. Qualitative analysis of <b>oral</b> <b>answers</b> showed that retaining the gist of that specific picture led to more developed answers, even for the dyslexic group. Early attention to the picture thus gives readers a fair chance of starting with a holistic impression of the material to be processed...|$|R

50|$|The final {{competition}} {{consists of}} two parts: the final round and the championship round. Each of the ten finalists starts with a clean slate and is eliminated after two misses. This continues until the number of contestants drops from ten to two and a third-place finisher is determined. A player is not officially eliminated {{until the end of}} a series of questions, since if all but one competitor makes their second miss in that round, all the players stay in the competition. Again, a player may ask for a spelling or repeat on any question, but only once per question. Earlier in the round, questions may require <b>oral</b> <b>answers</b> or written answers from all the competitors at one time. Quite often, many of the earlier questions in this round contain visuals as part of the question, such as maps or pictures. Question examples in the past have included pictures of state quarters with the name rubbed off and maps of the US with national forests shown and numbered. Contestants, at the time, were given the name of the national forest and (he or she) must match states with trees. At the national level, competitions may include items such as flags, musical instruments, hats, and even live animals. After a certain round, all questions must require <b>oral</b> <b>answers</b> only.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} oral and/or peri-oral piercings in young adults based on a systematic review of the available literature. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The MEDLINE-PubMed, Cochrane-CENTRAL and EMBASE databases were comprehensively searched through April 2012 to identify appropriate studies. The prevalence of oral and/or peri-oral piercings was evaluated in the general population, {{as well as by}} gender and by anatomical site. RESULTS: An independent screening of 1711 unique titles and abstracts resulted in 13 publications that met the eligibility criteria. In total, 11 249 participants (mean age, 20. 6 years) were <b>questioned</b> and/or examined <b>for</b> <b>oral</b> and/or peri-oral piercings. In the studies that provided information concerning the presence of oral and/or peri-oral piercings, the prevalence varied from 0. 8 % to 12 %, resulting in a mean prevalence of 5. 2 %. When examined based on anatomical site, the most common sites were the tongue (a prevalence of 5. 6 %), followed by the lip (1. 5 %). Oral piercings were more prevalent in women (5. 6 %) than men (1. 6 %). CONCLUSION: Among the populations that were studied, oral and/or peri-oral piercings were observed in a relatively small percentage (5. 2 %) of young adults. The prevalence was approximately four times higher among females when compared with males. On the basis of the literature, the tongue was the most common <b>oral</b> site <b>for</b> a piercing. Dental care professionals are in an ideal position to offer information regarding safe piercings and to provide advice regarding oral hygiene, aftercare and possible complications...|$|R
