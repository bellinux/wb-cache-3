40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} the delignification mechanism of wheat straw pulping process. The lignin removal of pulping process {{is left in}} black liquor. The higher the black liquor lignin content is, the bigger the lignin of paper pulp is removed. The relations of black liquor lignin content and alkali concentration to pulping time are described in detail. The results show that delignification process {{is divided into two}} stages: quick and slow stage. The lignin removal rate in the first stage is much higher than the second, that is, lignin has been removed more sufficiently after <b>quick</b> <b>stage.</b> In first stage, reaction order of delignification is 1. 0, and 0. 7 with respect to OH-, the activation energy is 38. 62 kJ • mol- 1. The latter delignification also belongs to the first-order reaction and 4. 4 with respect to OH-, the activation energy is 75. 56 kJ • mol- 1. Apparently, slow stage needs to consume large amounts of energy to removal lignin...|$|E

50|$|Toll {{bridges and}} ferries were active at nearly all {{previously}} dangerous river crossings as the trail became not only safer but <b>quicker.</b> <b>Stage</b> coaches by changing teams at newly established stage stations about every ten to (16 km) twenty miles (32 km) and traveling day and night, {{could make a}} transit from the Missouri River to California in 25 to 28 days. After 1861, telegraph relay stations and their crews joined these stage stations along much of the route. Forts and army patrols helped protect these various stations from Indian attacks throughout the U.S. Civil War period and later. Regular wagon trains that only had one team per wagon and stopped at night cut their transit time from about 160 days in 1849 to 120 days in 1860. The tolls on the various bridges, ferries and toll roads typically averaged about $30.00 per wagon by 1860. All these toll bridges, roads and ferries shortened the journey west by about 40 days and made it much safer as bad parts of the trail were improved and dangerous river crossings were done now by ferries and toll bridges that cost money but were much safer and faster. Nearly all improvements were financed by tolls on the various roads, bridges and ferries.|$|R

Warfarin therapy is monitored by Prothrombin time (PT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR). The clotting assays are invasive and may carry infection and prosthetic valve endocarditis. We try to use human saliva as noninvasive diagnostic fluid to access anticoagulant state. Our study was done in Cardiothoracic Department in Ain Shams University Hospital on 132 Patients had prosthetic valve (MVR, AVR or DVR) and under Warfarin therapy. We measure salivary TF activity by <b>Quick</b> one <b>stage</b> method; then calculate TF activity ratio and TF activity log to 10. The therapeutic value of salivary TF ratio ranges from (2. 23 to 3. 60) and salivary TF log to 10 ranges from (2. 364 to 2. 560). There is strong positive correlation between both salivary TF ratio and salivary TF log to 10 with INR (2. 00 to 3. 50). Salivary TF activity ratio has wider range than TF log to 10, and needs each laboratory to make its control under standardized conditions.

In the present volume, we bring together and integrate {{a number of}} theoretical perspectives {{on the question of}} ‘how does money affect people’s mind, brain, and behavior?’ Importantly, we go beyond previous reviews by zooming in on the biological and psychological processes—triggered by money—that shape people’s experiences and behavior.

Second, researchers have studied the biological underpinnings of money, pinpointing the role of the reward circuit (e. g., the ventral striatum) in processing money. Third, researchers have studied how money inputs into meaning-making processes that help people {{to make sense of the}} situation they find themselves in. Classic and recent insights are discussed in the context of each of these themes, with a special focus on the link between money and behavioral outcomes (e. g., performance, decisions, cooperation).

40|$|The ovary of spotted seer {{passes through}} 10 finer {{maturity}} stages, A to J, besides a partly spent stage (S) and a <b>quick</b> transitory <b>stage</b> (Q') between stages G and H. There {{is only one}} batch of maturing ova in B to F stage ovaries, whereas G to I stage ovaries possess two batches. In all, 2. 23 batches of ova are spawned each season, 1 (first), 0. 23 (second) and 1 (third) at stages H, I and J, respectively. Stage C takes 90 days to attain stage G and 112 days to attain stage H. After spawning the first batch at stage H, the ovary assumes stage S, which resembles stage D. and takes 92 days to attain stage J for spawning the third batch. Each adult female thus takes about 204 days to complete the spawn-ing process. Gonad indices above the value of about 7 to 8 represent maturing ovaries, whereas those below this value represent immature or intermediate ovaries. First maturity is attained when the fish is about 400 mm in total length, i. e., when the age is about 20 months. Spawning extends from January to August, releasing a weak brood in January-February, a strong brood in March-July (peak in April-May) and another weak brood in August. Spawning takes place in areas between 20 m and 60 m depth in the northern Gulf of Mannar. The spent adults migrate to the central Gulf of Mannar coast by November-December. Spawning takes place around the full-moon period. Females far outnumber (60. 2 %) males (39. 5 %). Although the males are predominant in size groups between 361 mm and 481 mm, they are scarce or absent in size groups larger than 481 mm, suggesting early senility and death. No real difl ̂ erence in fecundity is observed among stages D, E, F and G.

40|$|Fiber {{models for}} beam and shell {{elements}} allow for relatively rapid {{finite element analysis}} of concrete structures and structural elements. This project aims at {{the development of the}} formulation of such elements and a pilot implementation. The reduction of calculation time and degrees of freedom and the few required input variables are advantages of the reduced models making them especially popular FEM options in the engineering practice. Standard nonlinear fiber beam formulations do not account for shear effects and cannot capture all failure modes (like shear failure) and hence cannot be used in the assessment of structures with shear problems, as it may result in large overestimations of ultimate carrying capacities. Solving this handicap would provide a tool for faster and simpler nonlinear analysis that is advantageous for pre- and <b>quick</b> scan assessment <b>stages.</b> The shear-sensitive beam model to be implemented in DIANA is based on the PhD work of D. Ferreira (2013) developed at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, BarcelonaTECH (UPC). The present report relates to the implementation of 2 D and 3 D shear-sensitive beam elements in DIANA software and its validation with various benchmarks. The case-studies include the ones previously analysed in Report # 1 ‘Calculation of benchmarks with a shear beam model’ (TUD/CITG/B&I/CM- 2015 - 13). The goal of this work is to capture shear effects with beam elements (2 D and 3 D). In this manner, transversal reinforcement is considered and the beam model is able to compute multiaxial strains and stresses in concrete, as well, as inclined cracking. Shear failures can be captured by failure of transversal reinforcement or crushing of the diagonal concrete strut. These capabilities enlarge the range of application of the standard beam elements, which were limited to bending problems. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
5000|$|Hughes {{became an}} actress {{during a period}} of great change in English drama. English drama had {{suffered}} greatly during the English Civil War and the Interregnum, being banned by the Puritan Long Parliament in 1642. This ban was finally lifted upon the Restoration of King Charles. Charles was a keen theatre-goer, and promptly gave two royal patents to Sir Thomas Killigrew and Sir William Davenant. During the Renaissance women had been almost exclusively banned from appearing as actresses on the stage, and there was a history of embarrassing incidents occurring for male actors in female roles. One famous incident occurred when a play which King Charles II was watching suddenly stopped. When he sent servants to see what the problem was {{it was found that the}} male that was supposed to play one of the female parts was still shaving. There were also concerns over this practice encouraging [...] "unnatural vice", i.e., homosexuality, which added to Charles' decision to issue a royal warrant in 1662 declaring that all female roles should be played only by female actresses. Killigrew and Davenant were casting women almost immediately following the Restoration and, once women began appearing professionally on the stage in the early 1660s, they won <b>quick</b> acceptance. Killigrew <b>staged</b> an all-female-cast production of his own play The Parson's Wedding in 1664 and again in 1672.At the age of 30, Margaret marked theatre history by becoming the first woman to perform on an English stage at the Vere Street theatre. The occasion of her first performance was on 8 December 1660, in a production of Shakespeare's play Othello, when she played the role of Desdemona in a production by Thomas Killigrew's new King's Company at their Vere Street theatre. Some historians identify Anne Marshall as the first actress to step onto the English stage. However, there has been much analysis of the early recollections of John Downes, whose memories of the 1660s form a key part of Hughes' claim in this regard.|$|R
