5000|$|Metal {{quenching}} is {{a transient}} heat transfer process {{in terms of}} the Time Temperature Transformation (TTT). It is possible to manipulate the cooling process to adjust the phase of a suitable material. For example, appropriate quenching of steel can convert a desirable proportion of its content of austenite to martensite, creating a very tough product. To achieve this, it is necessary to quench at the [...] "nose" [...] (or eutectic) of the TTT diagram. Since materials differ in their Biot numbers, the time it takes for the material to quench, or the Fourier number, varies in practice. In steel, the quenching temperature range is generally from 600 °C to 200 °C. To control the <b>quenching</b> <b>time</b> and to select suitable quenching media, it is necessary to determine the Fourier number from the desired <b>quenching</b> <b>time,</b> the relative temperature drop, and the relevant Biot number. Usually, the correct figures are read from a standard nomogram. By calculating the heat transfer coefficient from this Biot number, one can find a liquid medium suitable for the application.|$|E

In this paper, we extend the multiplication-assisted diffusion avalanche model to include convection from a Lorentzian force caused by a strong magnetic field. Simulations imply that the avalanche is still expected to propagate at a speed of 2 D/τ, although from a point moving at a velocity given by the convection process. Sim-ulations of <b>quench</b> <b>time</b> differences are compared to experimental results at multiple temperatures and magnetic fields. There is an absolute mismatch between simulations and experimental results of roughly 35 %, although the simulations are able to predict the relative shift in <b>quench</b> <b>times</b> ranging from roughly 140 ps at − 50 ◦C to 210 ps at + 50 ◦C.

40|$|Low energy {{physics of}} quasi-one-dimensional ultracold atomic gases is often {{described}} by a gapless Luttinger liquid (LL). It is nowadays routine to manipulate these systems by changing their parameters in time but, no matter how slow the manipulation is, it must excite a gapless system. We study a smooth change of parameters of the LL (a smooth "quench") with a variable <b>quench</b> <b>time</b> and find that the excitation energy decays with an inverse power of the <b>quench</b> <b>time.</b> This universal exponent is - 2 at zero temperature, and - 1 for slow enough quenches at finite temperature.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{formation}} of defects in a Bose-Einstein condensate as is described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. The mechanism describes {{the formation of}} defects when a second order phase transition is crossed at a finite rate. This is done by shock cooling or quenching {{the last part of}} the evaporative cooling process where the transition into the condensed state is made. This allows for the study of the amount of solitons formed as a function of the <b>quench</b> <b>time</b> with the ultimate goal of determining the critical exponents of the phase transition. The amount of solitons is predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism to scale as the <b>quench</b> <b>time</b> to the power alpha, which we attempted to measure. The dynamics of solitons are also studied in order to determine the time scale on which they decay. This turns out to be in the order of 0. 29 seconds, and thus an important factor, since we consider <b>quench</b> <b>times</b> in the order of seconds. When correcting for the decay on this timescale, it turns out that alpha is extremely sensitive to variations in the decay time and therefore we were not able to give conclusive evidence on a value for the exponent. Instead we estimate the value of alpha to be between 0. 5 and 2, based on our measurements...|$|R

We characterize the defect density {{as a function of}} the <b>quench</b> <b>time</b> and the noise strength, and demonstrate that the defect productions for three quench protocols with different scaling exponents exhibit the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, whereby slower driving results in more defects. The protocols are quenching through the boundary line between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, quenching across the isolated multicritical point and along the gapless line, respectively. We also show that the optimal <b>quench</b> <b>time</b> to minimize defects scales as a universal power law of the noise strength in all the three cases. Furthermore, by using quantum simulation of the quench dynamics in the spin system with well-designed Landau-Zener crossings in pseudo-momentum space, we propose an experimentally feasible scheme to test the predicted anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of this noisy transverse-field XY chain with two-level systems under controllable fluctuations.
