5|$|Julius II, having secured his own {{control of}} the Papal armies by arresting and imprisoning Cesare, first in Rome and later in Madrid, quickly moved to re-establish Papal control over the Romagna by {{demanding}} that Venice return the cities she had seized. The Republic of Venice, although willing to acknowledge Papal sovereignty over these port cities along the Adriatic coast and willing to pay Julius II an annual tribute, refused to surrender the cities themselves. In response, Julius concluded an alliance with France and the Holy Roman Empire against Venice; the death of Isabella I of Castile and the resulting collapse of relations between the parties soon dissolved the alliance, but not before Venice had been induced to abandon several of the cities. Julius, although unsatisfied with his gains, did not himself possess sufficient forces to fight the Republic; {{for the next two}} years he instead occupied himself with the reconquest of Bologna and Perugia, which, located between Papal and Venetian territory, had in the meantime assumed a status of <b>quasi-independence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after its}} secession, South Kasaian and Congolese troops clashed after the Congolese central {{government}} ordered an offensive against it. The offensive, {{planned to be}} the first act of an offensive against Katanga, was accompanied by widespread massacres of Baluba and a refugee crisis termed a genocide by some contemporaries. The state was rapidly overrun by Congolese troops. The violence in the suppression of Kasai provided much legitimacy to Joseph Kasa-Vubu's deposition of Patrice Lumumba from the office of Prime Minister in late 1960 and Lumumba's later arrest and assassination. As a result, South Kasai remained on relatively good terms with the new Congolese government from 1961. Its leaders, including Kalonji himself, served in both the South Kasaian government and the Congolese parliament. South Kasai continued to exercise <b>quasi-independence</b> while Congolese and United Nations troops were able to move through the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian gendarmerie. In April 1961, Kalonji took the royal title Mulopwe ("King of the Baluba") to tie the state more closely to the pre-colonial Luba Empire. The act divided the South Kasaian authorities and Kalonji was disavowed by the majority of South Kasai's parliamentary representatives in Léopoldville. In December 1961, Kalonji was arrested on a legal pretext in Léopoldville and imprisoned. UN and Congolese troops occupied South Kasai. In September 1962, shortly after his escape from prison and return to South Kasai, Kalonji was ousted by a military coup d'état which forced him into exile and brought the secession to an end.|$|E
25|$|The Unfederated Malay States, on {{the other}} hand, {{maintained}} their <b>quasi-independence,</b> had more autonomy, and instead of having a Resident they were required only to accept a British Advisor, though in reality they were still bound by treaty to accept the advice. The British undertook far less economic exploitation as they primarily wished to just keep these states in line. Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu were surrendered by Siam after the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909. Independent Johor, meanwhile, had to surrender Singapore to the British earlier on. Despite the Sultan's political effort, {{he was forced to}} accept an advisor in 1914, becoming the last Malay state to lose its sovereignty (British involvement in Johor actually began as early as 1885).|$|E
60|$|Jerusalem, {{which has}} always been rather the symbol than the centre of Judaism, {{was taken by the}} Romans in 65 B.C.; and after various vicissitudes of <b>quasi-independence</b> and revolt was besieged by them in 70 A.D. and {{captured}} after a stubborn struggle. The Temple was destroyed. A later rebellion in 132 A.D. completed its destruction, and the Jerusalem we know to-day was rebuilt later under Roman auspices. A temple to the Roman god, Jupiter Capitolinus, stood in the place of the Temple, and Jews were forbidden to inhabit the city.|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile, a {{succession}} of three great men--Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Iyeyasu--had succeeded in unifying Japan, destroying the <b>quasi-independence</b> of the feudal nobles, and establishing that reign of internal peace which lasted until the Restoration--period of nearly {{two and a half}} centuries. It was possible, therefore, for the Central Government to enforce whatever policy it chose to adopt with regard to the foreigners and their religion. The Jesuits and the Friars between them had made a considerable number of converts in Japan, probably about 300,000. Most of these were in the island of Kyushu, the last region to be subdued by Hideyoshi. They tended to disloyalty, not only on account of their Christianity, but also on account of their geographical position. It was in this region that the revolt against the Shogun began in 1867, and Satsuma, the chief clan in the island of Kyushu, has had great power in the Government ever since the Restoration, except during its rebellion of 1877. It is hard to disentangle what belongs to Christianity and what to mere hostility to the Central Government in the movements of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. However that may be, Iyeyasu decided to persecute the Christians vigorously, if possible without losing the foreign trade. His successors were even more anti-Christian and less anxious for trade. After an abortive revolt in 1637, Christianity was stamped out, and foreign trade was prohibited in the most vigorous terms:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The {{negotiations}} proceeded, if negotiation be {{the right}} word. The Boers disbanded, a powerful British force was encamped on the frontier, no Boer representative sat on the commission, and the terms of final agreement were in fact, as the Boers afterwards alleged, dictated and imposed. Mr. Gladstone watched with a closeness that, considering the tremendous load of Ireland, parliamentary procedure, and the incessant general business of a prime minister, is amazing. When the Boers were over-pressing, he warned them {{that it was only}} “the unshorn strength” of the administration that enabled the English cabinet, rather to the surprise of the world, to spare them the sufferings of a war. “We could not,” he said to Lord Kimberley, “have carried our Transvaal policy, unless we had here a strong government, and we spent some, if not much, of our strength in carrying it.” A convention was concluded at Pretoria in (M20) August, recognising the <b>quasi-independence</b> of the Transvaal, subject to the suzerainty of the Queen, and with certain specified reservations. The Pretoria convention of 1881 did not work smoothly. Transvaal affairs were discussed {{from time to time in}} the cabinet, and Mr. Chamberlain became the spokesman of the government on a business where he was destined many years after to make so conspicuous and irreparable a mark. The Boers again sent Kruger to London, and he made out a good enough case in the opinion of Lord Derby, then secretary of state, to justify a fresh arrangement. By the London convention of 1884, the Transvaal state was restored to its old title of the South African Republic; the assertion of suzerainty in the preamble of the old convention did not appear in the new one;(31) and various other modifications were introduced—the most important of them, in the light of later events, being a provision for white men to have full liberty to reside in any part of the republic, to trade in it, and to be liable to the same taxes only as those exacted from citizens of the republic.|$|E

50|$|The actual end of {{the empire}} came in several steps. The Peace of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost {{complete}} independence.

The Habsburg Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|According to Liutprand of Cremona, when Hugh forbade Lambert of Tuscany to {{call himself}} a {{half-brother}} of the king, the margrave challenged Hugh to a judicial duel, which he won. In {{order to obtain}} the march of Tuscany for himself, Boso convinced Hugh to arrest Lambert; who was subsequently blinded in prison. A more likely explanation than Liutprand's is that Lambert refused give up his <b>quasi-independence</b> {{and as a result}} Tuscany was taken from him.|$|E
50|$|On 8 June 1738, Turenne {{was sold}} to Louis XV to pay the {{gambling}} debts of Charles Godfrey, {{the last of the}} Viscounts of La Tour d'Auvergne family. Thus ended the <b>quasi-independence</b> of this last French stronghold. The Viscounty's subjects became subjects of Louis XV and were forced to pay taxes. The king also ordered the dismantling of the fortress of Turenne. As of the Revolution, Turenne was more like a seat of a royal provost.|$|E

The king instead tried to leave control of the region, at least in part, to his children. When he died in 60 AD, the Romans seized control, prompting a second Iceni rebellion under Prasutagus' wife Boudica. Following suppression of Boudica's revolt, the Romans simply administered the territory as part of Britannia.|$|E

In so doing, he divided the power base between Herat and his own government in Kabul, a division which was to remain in place for a century. Kabul was the primary base of power, while Herat maintained a state of <b>quasi-independence.</b> Kandahar was fought over for the spoils.|$|E

He {{was the son}} of Richard of Brittany and the {{grandson}} of Duke John IV. A recurring theme in Francis' life would be his quest to maintain the <b>quasi-independence</b> of Brittany from France. As such, his reign was characterised by conflicts with King Louis XI of France and with his daughter, Anne of France, who served as regent during the minority of her brother, Charles VIII. The armed and unarmed conflicts between 1484-1488 have been called the Mad War (la Guerre Folle) and also the War of the Public Weal.|$|E
50|$|The 24 tandem ankyrin repeats are {{responsible}} for the recognition {{of a wide range of}} membrane proteins. These 24 repeats contain 3 structurally distinct binding sites ranging from repeat 1-14. These binding sites are quasi-independent of each other and can be used in combination. The interactions the sites use to bind to membrane proteins are non-specific and consist of: hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions. These non-specific interactions gives ankyrin the property to recognise a large range of proteins as the sequence doesn't have to be conserved just the properties of the amino acids. The <b>quasi-independence</b> means that if a binding site is not used, it won't have a large effect on the overall binding. These two properties in combination give rise to large repertoire of proteins ankyrin can recognise.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} no widely {{accepted}} definition of feudalism, key conclusions {{can be drawn from}} the definition at its broadest. Generally speaking, feudalism was the structuring of society based upon hierarchical relationships whereby the holding of land was exchanged in return for service, generally military, or labor. In addition to military service or labor, the lord would require dues, in either coinage, as is generally the case between the monarch and his vassals, or in-kind payment - which was the standard between a lord and the peasantry. In Scotland, this payment was referred to as cáin. The cáin was generally paid {{in the form of the}} area’s main produce. The term denotes both the regular exaction of an area’s revenue by the king, like the Scottish king’s exaction of payment in the Southern Uplands, as well as irregular tribute to a superior authority, as was the case in Moray during its period of <b>quasi-independence</b> prior to the mid-11th century.|$|E
50|$|Gurak or Ghurak was {{a medieval}} Sogdian ruler in Central Asia {{during the period}} of the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. In 710, he was {{installed}} as king (Sogdian: ikhshid) of Samarkand after the populace overthrew his predecessor, Tarkhun, due to his pro-Muslim stance. The Umayyad governor, Qutayba ibn Muslim, campaigned against Samarkand but in the end confirmed Gurak as its ruler. Gurak was a cautious and intelligent ruler, and managed, through shifting alliance between the Muslims and the Turgesh, to remain on his throne. Some time after the Muslim defeat at the Battle of the Defile in 731, he managed to recover his capital, Samarkand, and achieve a <b>quasi-independence</b> which he maintained until his death in 737 or 738. His realm was then divided among his relatives (known from Chinese sources): Tu-ho, formerly prince of Kabudhan, received Samarkand, Me-chu'o was king of Mayamurgh, while a certain Ko-lopu-lo who was king of Ishtikhan in 742 may perhaps be identified with Gurak's brother Afarun.|$|E

[...] Khaznadar was minister of finance and foreign affairs and was assisted by the interior, defence, and naval ministers.

He followed a policy of reforms, that is, of economic development, aimed at improving the infrastructure {{as well as the}} means of communication, the armed forces, and so on. The Tunisian economy did not, however, provide enough money to pay for it all, at least not after deduction of government expenses. Central administration, however, was weak. Tax collection was devolved onto tax-farmers, and only one-fifth of the revenues ever reached the national treasury. Many hill tribes and desert nomads lived in <b>quasi-independence.</b> Economic conditions deteriorated through the 19th century, as foreign fleets curbed corsairs, and droughts perennially wreaked ill effect on production of cereals and olives. Because of accords with foreign traders dating back to the 16th century, custom duties were limited to 3 per cent of the value of imported goods; yet manufactured products from overseas, primarily textiles, flooded Tunisia and gradually destroyed local artisan industries.|$|E

As for the Gaussian approximation, its violation is related to the increase of noise intensity, but the actual condition for failure can be cast in qualitative, rather than quantitative terms.
