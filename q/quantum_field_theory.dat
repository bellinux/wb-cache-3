5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory,</b> string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E

5|$|In the AdS/CFT correspondence, one considers, in {{addition}} to a theory of quantum gravity, a certain kind of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> called a conformal field theory.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} define the higher {{dimensional}} analogues of vertex algebras. In other words we define algebras which we hope have the same relation to higher dimensional <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> that vertex algebras have to one dimensional <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories</b> (or to ``chiral halves'' of two dimensional <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories).</b> The main idea is to define "vertex groups". Then classical vertex algebras {{turn out to be}} the same as "associative commutative algebras" over the simplest nontrivial example of a vertex group. We investigate commutative algebras over higher dimensional vertex groups, some of which seem to be closely related to (free) <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> Comment: Plain tex, 31 pages, references added and minor misprints correcte...|$|R
5|$|One {{approach}} to formulating M-theory and studying its properties {{is provided by}} the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that M-theory is in some cases equivalent to a <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory.</b> In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure of string and M-theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Goldstone's theorem in <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> {{states that}} in a system with broken {{continuous}} symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone bosons.

5|$|In <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory,</b> one {{typically}} computes the {{probabilities of}} various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E

5|$|Renormalizability {{has become}} an {{essential}} criterion for a <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> to {{be considered as a}} viable one.

5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> to {{arbitrarily}} high energy. The coupling constant runs to infinity at finite energy, signalling a Landau pole. The problem is essentially that QED appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues.

40|$|We {{construct}} a colored operad whose category of algebras is canonically isomorphic to {{the category of}} algebraic <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> This is achieved by a construction {{that depends on the}} choice of a category, whose objects provide the operad colors, equipped with an additional structure that we call an orthogonality relation. This allows us to describe different types of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories,</b> including theories on a fixed Lorentzian manifold, locally covariant theories and also chiral conformal and Euclidean theories. Moreover, because the colored operad depends functorially on the orthogonal category, we obtain adjunctions between categories of different types of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> These include novel and physically very interesting constructions, such as time-slicification and local-to-global extensions of <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theories.</b> We compare the latter to Fredenhagen's universal algebra.

5|$|The {{study of}} phase {{transition}} {{and the critical}} behavior of observables, termed critical phenomena, was a major field {{of interest in the}} 1960s. Leo Kadanoff, Benjamin Widom and Michael Fisher developed the ideas of critical exponents and widom scaling. These ideas were unified by Kenneth G.

5|$|Attempts {{to generalize}} {{ordinary}} quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, {{so as to}} include gravity have led to serious problems. Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (<b>quantum)</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> of gravity. At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power ("perturbative non-renormalizability").|$|E
5|$|Following Maldacena's insight in 1997, {{theorists have}} {{discovered}} many different realizations of the AdS/CFT correspondence. These relate various conformal field theories to compactifications of string theory and M-theory in various numbers of dimensions.

5|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the quantum aspects of gravity in our four-dimensional universe, some physicists have considered a lower-dimensional mathematical model in which spacetime has only two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this setting, the mathematics describing the gravitational field simplifies drastically, and one can study quantum gravity using familiar methods from <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory,</b> eliminating the need for string theory or other more radical approaches to quantum gravity in four dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic <b>quantum</b> <b>field</b> <b>theory</b> of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter interact {{and is the}} first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved.

5|$|The ABJM theory {{appearing}} in {{this version of}} the correspondence is also interesting for a variety of reasons.
