The sky is strangely dark and, just before the murder, crows gather inexplicably on the {{overhead}} wires and railings of the nearby park as if in foreboding of something evil. No one pays much attention to the news of the murder the next morning and among those who do; many feel that there are too many beggars in Kolkata anyway. In any case, the story is hardly noticed as it is featured in a small unnoticeable corner in one of the back pages. Such murders are common enough occurrences in big cities to merit much attention; the only thing uncommon being the murder weapon: a porcupine <b>quill</b> <b>driven</b> clean through the heart of the victim from the back! ...|$|R
50|$|From {{the outset}} the largest problem was {{torsional}} vibration of the crankshaft, {{at one time}} necessitating a ban on using below 4000rpm on the bench. The vibration often caused one or other of the cranks to shear itself off the central spur gear, resulting in the engine becoming two aphasic flat-8s, or the parallel <b>quill</b> shaft (<b>driven</b> at 0.8 times the crank speed, located below crank, and in turn driving the flywheel and ancillaries) overheated and disintegrated.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{other systems}} were devised as the {{electric}} locomotive matured. [...] The Buchli drive was a fully spring-loaded system, {{in which the}} weight of the driving motors was completely disconnected from the driving wheels. First used in electric locomotives from the 1920s, the Buchli drive was mainly used by the French SNCF and Swiss Federal Railways. The <b>quill</b> <b>drive</b> was also developed about this time and mounted the traction motor above or {{to the side of the}} axle and coupled to the axle through a reduction gear and a hollow shaft - the quill - flexibly connected to the driving axle. The Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 locomotive used a <b>quill</b> <b>drive.</b> Again, as traction motors continued to shrink in size and weight, quill drives gradually fell out of favour.|$|E
2500|$|Twelve [...] GEA-627-A1 {{traction}} motors drove the GG1's [...] diameter driving wheels on six axles using a <b>quill</b> <b>drive.</b> Four unpowered leading/trailing wheels were mounted on {{each end of}} the locomotive. The {{traction motors}} were six-pole, 400 volts, 25Hz rated at , with the 12 motors mounted in pairs over each of the six driving axles. Each motor was geared to what is called a [...] "quill," [...] a shroud around the axle itself, and the quill was connected to the drivers by means of a spring and cup arrangement. The motors were mounted on each frame which provided a flexible suspension system to provide full and equal traction for each of the drivers regardless of track condition. Using Whyte notation for steam locomotives, each frame is a 4-6-0 locomotive, which in the Pennsylvania Railroad classification system is a [...] "G". The GG1 has two such frames back to back, 4-6-0+0-6-4. The related AAR wheel arrangement classification is 2-C+C-2.

5000|$|Early {{designers}} of steam turbine locomotives {{did not understand}} the need for reduction gearing or sprung suspensions. [...] Once these problems were understood, jackshafts emerged as one alternative for linking the output gearbox of the turbine to the driving wheels. Giuseppe Belluzzo, of Italy, was granted several US patents on variations of this idea. [...] Alternatives to jackshaft drives included use of a <b>quill</b> <b>drive</b> with the turbine above the drive axle, or a combination of a <b>quill</b> <b>drive</b> with a gearbox suspended horizontally between a locomotive driving axle and the turbine shaft.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{consideration}} {{was given}} to placing both engines back-to-back {{at one end of}} the train, but concerns were raised over excessive buckling forces when pushing the train at high speeds with the tilt feature active. So, finally, the design team chose to place the engines back-to-back in the center of the train. The two engines would be identical and both would carry a pantograph to pick up power, but in normal operation only the rear of the two engines would raise its pan, and the other engine would be fed power through a coupling along the roof. Power was converted to direct current by ASEA thyristors, supplying four [...] DC traction motors mounted in each power car. The traction motors were moved from their former location in the car body to be mounted on the bogies, thereby reducing unsprung weight. The motors transmitted their power through internal gearboxes, cardan shafts and <b>quill</b> final <b>drives.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On {{the second}} anniversary of her father's death, Tanya is visited by an {{apparition}} of him, imploring her to take his hand and bond their souls across space and time. She questions the apparition out the possibility of hallucination; she doubts everything when he has legitimate memories of her and himself. He says he if she goes with him she will find closure and be relieved of her grief. Throughout East London, alien vines emerging from the spacetime tear at Coal Hill are capturing Londoners with images of dead loved ones. Even Miss Quill is visited by an entity that claims to be her sister; however, Quill is much more skeptical and doesn't believe what she is seeing. During a video call with April, Ram gets a visitation from Rachel, his late girlfriend. But he flees from her and meets April outside. On the streets, Ram finds the alien has already claimed victims everywhere, with people covered in green slimy vines in shops and the end of streets. April joins him eventually, they investigate together and grow closer; April tells Ram about how her mum ended up in her wheelchair. When she was 8 her dad attempted to drive off a bridge, with her and her mum inside. Ram and April then kiss. Matteusz and Charlie take their relationship to the next level after Matteusz is kicked out of home by his parents. Charlie allows him to live with him; that night they confess their love each other and have sex. Quill confirms her suspicions of her too-nice [...] "sister", learning it is really a projection of a hungry alien creature called the Lan Kin that feeds on the grief of creatures whilst killing them in the process. Quill gets Charlie to stab it in the hand with a screwdriver, which destroys her branch of the Lan Kin. Quill, Charlie, and Matteusz then go outside to help defeat the creature. Ram and April find the Lan Kin has grown out of a tear in space at the front of Coal Hill. They spot one main tentacle and direct themselves to where it ends which turns out to be Tanya's house. As Tanya and the Lan Kin continue to talk, the more aggressive the Lan Kin gets, proving Tanya's theory of it being a trap. Just in time Ram and April arrive at her house, her Mother and brothers have been attacked during their sleep leaving Tanya's the only one awake. But Tanya ends up ignoring them and grasps the Lan Kin. The Lan Kin is tricked by Tanya, being poisoned by her high amount of anger for her father instead of her grief. But this doesn't weaken it enough. Matteusz and Charlie try to cut the vines from outside her flat but fail as they continue to regenerate. <b>Quill</b> <b>drives</b> a double decker bus straight through the main vine of the Lan Kin, yanking the apparition of Tanya's dad out of her bedroom, destroying her window, ultimately stopping the creature in its tracks. Everyone on the streets is returned with no one harmed, but their memories of what happened are gone. The group confines and discusses what happened, whilst Quill watches feeling slightly left out but put off by the comfort they show. Back at her house she gets out her broken gun and promises herself to get it back.|$|R
6000|$|When {{she came}} back to England, telling me she had got all the {{continent}} could give her, Leolin was a broad-shouldered, red-faced young man, with an immense wardrobe and an extraordinary assurance of manner. She was fondly obstinate about her having taken the right course with him, and proud of all that he knew and had seen. He was now quite ready to begin, and a little while later she told me he HAD begun. He had written something tremendously clever, and it was coming out in the Cheapside. I believe it came out; I had no time to look for it; I never heard anything about it. I took for granted that if this contribution had passed through his mother's hands it had practically become a specimen of her own genius, and it was interesting to consider Mrs. Stormer's future in the light of her having to write her son's novels as well as her own. This was not the way she looked at it herself; she took the charming ground that he would help her to write hers. She used to tell me that he supplied passages of the greatest value to her own work--all sorts of technical things, about hunting and yachting and wine--that she couldn't be expected to get very straight. It was all so much practice for him and so much alleviation for her. I was unable to identify these pages, for I had long since ceased to [...] "keep up" [...] with Greville Fane; but I was quite able to believe that the wine-question had been put, by Leolin's good offices, on a better footing, for the dear lady used to mix her drinks (she was perpetually serving the most splendid suppers) in the queerest fashion. I {{could see that he was}} willing enough to accept a commission to look after that department. It occurred to me indeed, when Mrs. Stormer settled in England again, that by making a shrewd use of both her children she might be able to rejuvenate her style. Ethel had come back to gratify her young ambition, and if she couldn't take her mother into society she would at least go into it herself. Silently, stiffly, almost grimly, this young lady held up her head, clenched her long teeth, squared her lean elbows and made her way up the staircases she had elected. The only communication she ever made to me, the only effusion of confidence with which she ever honoured me, was when she said: [...] "I don't want to know the people mamma knows; I mean to know others." [...] I took due note of the remark, for I was not one of the [...] "others." [...] I couldn't trace therefore the steps of her process; I could only admire it at a distance and congratulate her mother on the results. The results were that Ethel went to [...] "big" [...] parties and got people to take her. Some of them were people she had met abroad, and others were people whom the people she had met abroad had met. They ministered alike to Miss Ethel's convenience, and I wondered how she extracted so many favours without the expenditure of a smile. Her smile was the dimmest thing in the world, diluted lemonade, without sugar, and she had arrived precociously at social wisdom, recognising that if she was neither pretty enough nor rich enough nor clever enough, she could at least in her muscular youth be rude enough. Therefore if she was able to tell her mother what really took place in the mansions of the great, give her notes to work from, the <b>quill</b> could be <b>driven</b> at home to better purpose and precisely at a moment when it would have to be more active than ever. But if she did tell, it would appear that poor Mrs. Stormer didn't believe. As regards many points this was not a wonder; at any rate I heard nothing of Greville Fane's having developed a new manner. She had only one manner from start to finish, as Leolin would have said.|$|R

50|$|Swedish {{engineer}} Fredrik Ljungström {{designed a}} number of steam turbine locomotives, {{some of which were}} highly successful. His first attempt in 1921 was a rather odd-looking machine. Its three driving axles were located under the tender, and the cab and boiler sat on unpowered wheels. As a result, {{only a small portion of}} the locomotive's weight contributed to traction. In the mid-1920s, Ljungström filed a patent on a <b>quill</b> <b>drive</b> for a steam turbine locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The bogies were a {{fabricated}} steel design, with coil spring primary suspension.

In many respects the design resembled the earlier, lighter P5, but with an extra driving axle and lower axle loads.|$|E
50|$|Based on the Eurosprinter concept the ES 64 U was {{developed}} as a universal electric locomotive with {{a top speed of}} 230 km/h.

Unlike the F series, all U series are equipped with <b>quill</b> <b>drive</b> instead, thus reducing the track forces. The ÖBB assigned the protected name Taurus to Class 1016 (and later to the Classes 1116 and 1216); since then all ES 64 U+ series are widely known as 'Taurus' locos.|$|E
50|$|The Shay, Climax and Heisler locomotives, all {{introduced}} in the late 19th century, used quill drives to couple power from a centrally mounted multi-cylinder engine {{to each of the}} trucks supporting the engine. On each of these geared steam locomotives, one end of each drive shaft was coupled to the driven truck through a universal joint while the other end was powered by the crankshaft, transmission or another truck through a second universal joint. A <b>quill</b> <b>drive</b> also has the ability to slide lengthways, effectively varying its length. This is required to allow the bogies to rotate when passing a curve.|$|E

They only served on the Norwegian lines until 1949, after which they were where put into through trains to Kiruna. In 1950 LKAB decided to increase the mine output, requiring trains now to haul 3,100 t. In 1953-54 the locomotives were rebuilt to three triple-engine sets and supplemented with eight El 12.

50|$|Quill drives {{have been}} {{extensively}} used in railroad electric locomotives to connect between frame-mounted traction motors and the driven wheels. The two are linked by a flexible drive which allows {{a degree of}} radial motion and possibly {{a small amount of}} axial motion. This smooths the drive from the motors and isolates them from mechanical shock as well, while decreasing the weight borne directly by the wheels, without interposing springs (unsprung weight), thus decreasing wear on the track. Quill drives were used by many electric locomotives in the United States, particularly those of the Pennsylvania Railroad - their long-lasting GG1 design being perhaps the best known. Many locomotives built in France, Germany, and Italy used quill drives as well, allowing higher locomotive speed. The English Electric built NZR ED class used a <b>quill</b> <b>drive,</b> but was found to be hard on the track.|$|E
5000|$|Usually, the {{traction}} motor is three-point suspended between the bogie frame and the driven axle; this {{is referred to}} as a [...] "nose-suspended {{traction motor}}". The problem with such an arrangement is that a portion of the motor's weight is unsprung, increasing unwanted forces on the track. In the case of the famous Pennsylvania Railroad GG1, two bogie-mounted motors drove each axle through a <b>quill</b> <b>drive.</b> The [...] "Bi-Polar" [...] electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Milwaukee Road had direct drive motors. The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels. In the case of French TGV power cars, a motor mounted to the power car’s frame drives each axle; a [...] "tripod" [...] drive allows a small amount of flexibility in the drive train allowing the trucks bogies to pivot. By mounting the relatively heavy traction motor directly to the power car's frame rather than to the bogie, better dynamics are obtained allowing better high-speed operation.|$|E
5000|$|An initial {{order of}} 35 EP-1 {{locomotives}} were supplied 1905-1907. The design {{was similar to}} No 9 above, with two two-axle trucks and a Westinghouse gearless <b>quill</b> <b>drive,</b> which supported the motor on the truck frame and reduced the unsprung weight. The locos weighed 102 tons and were 37 ft 6½in long.

A second order of six supplied in 1908 had design changes, including guide wheels at each end to obviate “nose” or oscillation at high speed. The highly successful class operated to 1947, although some were retired from 1936.|$|E
