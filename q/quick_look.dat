5|$|An eighth, fragmentary {{specimen}} {{was discovered}} in 1990, not in Solnhofen limestone, but in somewhat younger sediments at Daiting, Suevia. Therefore, it {{is known as the}} Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsdörfer in 2009. It was on display {{for the first time with}} six other original fossils of Archaeopteryx at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. A first, <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> by scientists indicates that this specimen might represent a new species of Archaeopteryx. It was found in a limestone bed that was a few hundred thousand years younger than the other finds.|$|E

25|$|In summary, {{the article}} 'A <b>Quick</b> <b>Look</b> at Lesbians by Dilys Rowe' (Winter 1962–1963) {{was based on}} an {{interview}} with three self-confessed 'homosexual women' and a female doctor who specialised in marriage guidance. The article focused on the largely invisible lives of lesbians in society at the time and their relationships with their mother and father. It proposed that lesbians reported growing up in families where they had a weak father and a dominant mother and that they had failed to emotionally bond with their fathers during their formative years.|$|E

It allows for dynamic previews of files, including videos and multi-page documents without opening any other applications. Spotlight, a file searching technology which has been integrated into the Finder since version 10.4, allows rapid real-time searches of data files; mail messages; photos; and other information based on item properties (metadata) and/or content. macOS makes use of a Dock, which holds file and folder shortcuts as well as minimized windows.|$|E
25|$|In April 1967, the Air Force began fitting {{its entire}} EC-121 fleet with the QRC-248 IFF {{transponder}} interrogator. The QRC-248 {{had been developed}} to surveil Soviet-export aircraft flown by the Cuban Air Force. The SRO-2 transponders installed in Soviet export MiGs enabled Cuban ground-controlled interception (GCI) radars to identify and control their fighters. A testbed EC-121 called <b>Quick</b> <b>Look</b> had flown with College Eye in January 1967 to test the QRC-248 and found that North Vietnamese MiGs used the same transponder. QRC-248 accurately discriminated MiG radar returns from the myriad returns picked up during a mission, and extended the range of low-altitude detection to more than 175 miles, covering virtually all important North Vietnamese target areas.|$|E
25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at the desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|E

[...] Although it would appear condemning in the present day, it discussed serious issues with interviews and quotations, and it prompted an interest in research into lesbian (and bisexual) lives. This research concept continued throughout {{the existence of the}} Minorities Research Group, which also provided a central point for formerly disparate individuals and information. Ultimately, the MRG provided education, support and opportunities to socialise for lesbians nationwide.|$|E

5000|$|Giant Bomb {{soon became}} notable for its podcast, the [...] "Giant Bombcast", {{as well as}} several of the video series they produce, {{including}} <b>Quick</b> <b>Looks,</b> Endurance Runs and several livestreams including Unprofessional Fridays. The Giant Bombcast, hosted originally by Ryan Davis until his death and now hosted by Brad Shoemaker, unites the San Francisco Office's senior Staff to talk about their week, discuss news and answer e-mails. With over one-hundred thousand downloads weekly, it is the most popular feature of the site, consistently being placed in the top ten most downloaded gaming podcasts globally on iTunes. <b>Quick</b> <b>Looks</b> are usually long unedited videos of two or more staff members playing through part(s) of a game, usually at the beginning. One of the most relevant video series was the Persona 4 Endurance Run, which featured Vinny Caravella and Jeff Gerstmann playing Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4 from start to finish during almost 100 hours, its success gaining the acknowledgement of Atlus USA itself, to which Gerstmann comically thanked them for, [...] "not having their legal team get in touch with us." [...] Davis was the presenter on the This Ain't No Game feature, in which he reviewed films that are based on video games. Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon commented on Davis's review of Mortal Kombat Annihilation, stating that his overly negative review was still, [...] "a bit too kind to it." ...|$|R
