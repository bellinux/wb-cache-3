2500|$|Murray {{started the}} project, {{working in a}} {{corrugated}} iron outbuilding called the [...] "Scriptorium" [...] which was lined with wooden planks, book shelves, and 1,029 pigeon-holes for the <b>quotation</b> <b>slips.</b> He tracked and regathered Furnivall's collection of <b>quotation</b> <b>slips,</b> which were found to concentrate on rare, interesting words rather than common usages. For instance, there were ten times as many quotations for abusion as for abuse. [...] He appealed, through newspapers distributed to bookshops and libraries, for readers who would report [...] "as many quotations as you can for ordinary words" [...] and for words that were [...] "rare, obsolete, old-fashioned, new, peculiar or used in a peculiar way". Murray had American philologist and liberal arts college professor Francis March manage the collection in North America; 1,000 <b>quotation</b> <b>slips</b> arrived daily to the Scriptorium and, by 1880, there were 2,500,000.|$|R
25|$|In 1933, Oxford {{had finally}} put the {{dictionary}} to rest; all work ended, and the <b>quotation</b> <b>slips</b> went into storage. However, the English language continued to change and, {{by the time}} 20 years had passed, the dictionary was outdated.|$|R
25|$|On 12 May 1860, Coleridge's {{dictionary}} {{plan was}} published and research was started. His {{house was the}} first editorial office. He arrayed 100,000 <b>quotation</b> <b>slips</b> in a 54 pigeon-hole grid. In April 1861, the group published the first sample pages; later that month, Coleridge died of tuberculosis, aged 30.|$|R
50|$|In 1749 the {{botanist}} Peter Collinson inherited {{an estate}} {{which is now}} part of Mill Hill School, here he created a botanical garden. The lexicographer James Murray started work on the first Oxford English Dictionary in 1879, whilst teaching at Mill Hill School. He had a building built in the school grounds to house the <b>quotation</b> <b>slips</b> and his small editorial staff. Murray called this building his scriptorium, when the project moved to Oxford the building was used by the school as a reading room.|$|R
50|$|Richard Chenevix Trench (1807-1886) {{played the}} {{key role in}} the project's first months, but his Church of England {{appointment}} as Dean of Westminster meant that he could not give the dictionary project the time that it required. He withdrew and Herbert Coleridge became the first editor.On 12 May 1860, Coleridge's dictionary plan was published and research was started. His house was the first editorial office.

2500|$|The Society {{ultimately}} {{realized that}} the number of unlisted words would be far more than the number of words in the English dictionaries of the 19th century, and shifted their idea from covering only words that were not already in English dictionaries to a larger project. Trench suggested that a new, truly comprehensive dictionary was needed. On 7 January 1858, the Society formally adopted the idea of a comprehensive new dictionary. [...] Volunteer readers would be assigned particular books, copying passages illustrating word usage onto <b>quotation</b> <b>slips.</b> Later the same year, the Society agreed to the project in principle, with the title A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles (NED).|$|R
50|$|In his twenties, {{while he}} was still living in Kendal, Whitwell became a {{prolific}} voluntary contributor to the OED, submitting some 17,000 <b>quotation</b> <b>slips</b> between 1879 and 1884; by the time the first volume was published in 1888, his slip total was the 7th highest at 33,000. His academic life was, however, based at Oxford University, where he received a B.Litt. from Corpus Christi before becoming associated with New College. In 1901, he was Honorary Secretary of the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society, and in 1907 he was listed as a tutor in Modern History with colleagues including H. W. C. Davis, G. Baskerville, F. Madan, R. L. Poole, R. Rait, and A. L. Smith.|$|R
50|$|The {{collections}} {{on which}} Norsk Ordbok are based were started in 1930, and comprise some 3.2 million literary excerpts and dialect <b>quotations.</b> The <b>slip</b> archives are now digitised, and supplied with a corpus of Nynorsk from 1850 onwards. The collections are accessible through Norsk Ordbok 2014 Search page.|$|R
25|$|Furnivall {{believed}} that, {{since many}} printed texts from earlier centuries were not readily available, {{it would be}} impossible for volunteers to efficiently locate the quotations that the dictionary needed. As a result, he founded the Early English Text Society in 1864 and the Chaucer Society in 1868 to publish old manuscripts. Furnivall's preparatory efforts lasted 21 years and provided numerous texts for the use and enjoyment of the general public, as well as crucial sources for lexicographers, but they did not actually involve compiling a dictionary. Furnivall recruited more than 800 volunteers to read these texts and record quotations. While enthusiastic, the volunteers were not well trained and often made inconsistent and arbitrary selections. Ultimately, Furnivall handed over nearly two tons of <b>quotation</b> <b>slips</b> and other materials to his successor.|$|R
