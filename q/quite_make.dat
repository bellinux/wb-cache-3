25|$|During the 2012 season, Somerset were {{ravaged by}} {{injuries}} {{to the extent}} that on two occasions the county were reduced to their last 11 available players, with members of the coaching and support staff having to fill in as 12th men. Despite this it was another successful season with Somerset again finishing runners-up in the Championship, though they finished 24 points behind the winners, only losing one match all year. Nick Compton carried a batting lineup that at times missed key players such as Trescothick and Craig Kieswetter due to injury, averaging an incredible 99.25. In one-day competitions, Somerset couldn't <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> up for a poor start in the CB40, losing their first 4 games, before winning their next 6 completed matches and narrowly missing out on the semi-finals. In the reformatted t20, Somerset topped their group and won the home quarter-final against Essex to send them on another trip to finals day, only to fall short to Hampshire in the semi-final.|$|E

500|$|In the Australian drama Adore, Watts co-starred with Robin Wright, playing two {{childhood}} {{friends who}} {{fall in love}} with each other's sons. The movie premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival as Two Mothers, and later opened in selected cinemas. It received a mixed feedback from critics, who concluded that Watts and co-star Wright [...] "give it their all, but they can't <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> Adores trashy, absurd plot believable". She obtained the FCCA Award for Best Actress in 2014, for her role. Her next [...] release was Movie 43, an independent anthology black comedy film that featured 14 different storylines, with each segment having a different director. Watts' segment, titled [...] "Homeschooled", was directed by Will Graham and revolved around two devoted parents (Watts and Liev Schreiber) attempting to replicate their son's whole high school experience. This marked Watts' second collaboration with Schreiber, following the 2006 drama The Painted Veil. The portmanteau film was universally panned by critics, with Richard Roeper calling it [...] "the Citizen Kane of awful".|$|E
500|$|Both Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune and Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune {{felt that}} Morgan gave [...] "his {{best and most}} {{believable}} performance of the season" [...] in [...] "Devil's Trap", with the latter adding, [...] "He was really on fire in that scene, and it brought a whole new intensity to his performance." [...] Diana Steenbergen of IGN found him [...] "menacing, with his low voice and the cruel words... trying to tear them apart emotionally before tearing Dean apart literally", and enjoyed the sadistic and [...] "vicious humor" [...] that makes the character [...] "more sinister". However, she believed that Azazel having a family was an unnecessary parallel with the Winchesters that [...] "doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> sense". After viewing the episode, Brian Tallerico of UGO gave his opinion that the series should follow Buffy the Vampire Slayer format of having a different recurring villain each season. [...] "If the firestarting demon is the Big Bad {{for the first two}} seasons, that's fine", he commented, [...] "but don't drag it out longer than that. Fans will get bored.

Describing the character, Natasha Norton from AfterEllen stated [...] "She comes across at first as a touch flighty, as if she can't <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> up her mind as to who she wants to be, but it soon becomes abundantly clear that Lana's carefully constructed façade has a purpose." [...] Following her arrival in Erinsborough, Lana befriended Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). They both learned that they had been taken advantage of by [...] "sleazy" [...] photographer Chris Cousens (Simon Mallory). Serena's cousin, Sky, took an instant dislike to Lana. Sky had learned that Lana had flirted with her boyfriend, leaving her [...] "less than impressed". During a game of basketball, Sky began feuding with Lana, and they started a brawl on the court. Of filming the fight, Neval stated, [...] "We wanted to make it look spontaneous, and really gritty and brawly. It {{was a lot of fun}} learning how to choreograph a fight and how to be aware of the other actor and not actually hurt them." ...|$|E

500|$|The Stripped Mixes {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave The Stripped Mixes {{two out of}} five stars, stating that he felt that [...] "the logic of what is left behind doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> sense", pointing out that [...] "I Want You Back" [...] and [...] "ABC" [...] have no drums and [...] "feel a little tipsy and top-heavy"; [...] "Ben" [...] and [...] "With a Child's Heart" [...] have echoes of strings in the background, {{making it hard to}} identify the songs as being [...] "stripped". He added that since the genius lies in the arrangements, [...] "having so much of the arrangement absent" [...] means that the music [...] "just sounds awkward and incomplete, as if it was waiting for the final round of mixing and overdubs." [...] Erlewine's overall opinion on the album was [...] "if the purpose of this disc is to draw attention to Michael's vocals, The Stripped Mixes does its job, but just because his voice is pushed front and center does not mean that this is the best place to appreciate his genius." ...|$|E
500|$|Waltrip, {{who failed}} {{to qualify for the}} Daytona 500 after {{crashing}} on lap 52, said he felt he had let everyone down but was thankful his team and his sponsor Aaron's had given him an opportunity to race in the Duels. Patrick, who was hit by Almirola on the final lap and crashed heavily into the wall, said, [...] "It sucks [...] You just have to brace yourself. I guess in these situations, I just have to be glad that I'm a small driver and that I've got room. Kinda hug it in and let it rip." [...] She also said the crash was [...] "a blessing in a big disguise". Patrick, along with Gilliland, Montoya and Menard, were required to drive their backup cars for the Daytona 500. After the wreck on lap nine, Gilliland cut his thumb on his helmet; the thumb required one stitch but he was confident about driving his backup car. According to Menard, who was involved in the lap nine wreck, [...] "Somebody turned (David) Gilliland; I saw him get sideways underneath me. I was three lanes up and I tried to clear him and didn’t <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> it.” It took 56 minutes and 34 seconds to complete the first race; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E
500|$|Diana Steenbergen of IGN also praised [...] "Devil's Trap", deeming {{it to be}} {{the episode}} that [...] "moved Supernatural from the list of {{television}} shows that [...] liked to the 'must-see' list". Like Peterson, she cheered the twist ending, and was [...] "completely taken by surprise". Steenbergen also felt that Jim Beaver as hunter Bobby Singer was [...] "an excellent addition to the cast", and applauded Ackles, Padalecki, and Morgan for their performances in the episode's climactic confrontation between Azazel and the brothers. She found the possessed Morgan to be [...] "menacing", and enjoyed his sadistic sense of humor; Padalecki to have done a [...] "good job embodying the newfound strength" [...] Sam develops in defying his father's order to kill him in order to stop the demon; and Ackles' defenselessness to be [...] "affecting". However, she believed that Azazel's reference to having a family [...] " [...] <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> sense", and noted that it seemed implausible for Sam and Deanhaving been raised as huntersto not have known that Meg was a demonically-possessed girl. Brian Tallerico of UGO also had issues with the plot, though mainly with the episode's outcome. He felt that the writers should have followed Buffy the Vampire Slayers pattern of killing off the season's foe, as [...] "fans don't like villains to be strung out for too long". He also would have liked for John Winchester to have died in order to [...] "free the brothers up for a little second season revenge and a little less family angst".|$|E

500|$|For the collaboration, Fraser McAlpine from BBC Radio 1 {{reviewed}} the song negatively, writing: [...] "So anyway, this {{brings me to}} 'Video Phone' – and {{what exactly is the}} point of Gaga featuring in this song? I know Beyoncé fans won't like me saying this, but I can't help but think that in this instance it's a case of 'if you can't beat em, join em' [...] For someone as naturally brilliant as Beyoncé (and a better singer than Gaga and Rihanna put together), perhaps she should actually stop trying so hard and do what she does best - singing proper songs." [...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because the lack of a video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's.

[...] The New York Times Jon Caramanica commented that [...] "Video Phone" [...] and [...] "Telephone", [...] "promised a new direction, but all Beyoncé did was show up to prove she could out-Gaga Gaga, then return to her comfort zone."

This collaboration, completed before Clarke's death last March, would've made a better solo project for either author." [...] The Washington Post said that [...] "The Last Theorem {{reads like a}} dog-eared album of favorite themes from yesteryear", referring to Clarke and Pohl topics from the authors' earlier works. Thomas M. Wagner at SF Reviews wrote that [...] "The Last Theorem is a book I really resent not liking, because there's so much about it that deserves to be liked." [...] He said that the first two-thirds is [...] "so good ... it almost, but doesn't <b>quite,</b> <b>make</b> up for the nonsense that overtakes the whole affair at the climax." [...] Wagner felt that the meeting of [...] "two disparate storytelling sensibilities" [...] was [...] "far less harmonious and compatible" [...] than Clarke and Pohl may have imagined. Wagner summed up by saying that [...] "The Last Theorem is not simply an uneven novel. It's a deeply disjointed one, a book that introduces a host of wonderful ideas and sympathetic, believable characters, only to decide it doesn't trust them to carry off {{the story in the}} end, ultimately falling back – disastrously – on dated and dubious formula." [...] Sheila Merritt at SciFi Dimensions said that while it should have been [...] "a fine tribute and a fitting farewell to this master of science fiction", {{it turned out to be}} an [...] "easy book to put down." [...] She said that the plot [...] "meanders in fits and starts" [...] and that the book is too long for the story it tells. Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the first third of the book, but said that for the rest, its [...] "winning and winking self-consciousness evaporates." [...] He wondered how stable the manuscript was when it was published, and added that it does nothing to [...] "burnish the legacy of either of its authors." ...|$|E

2500|$|C. S. Lewis {{argues that}} {{when talking about}} omnipotence, {{referencing}} [...] "a rock so heavy that God cannot lift it" [...] is nonsense {{just as much as}} referencing [...] "a square circle"; that it is not logically coherent in terms of power to think that omnipotence includes the power to do the logically impossible. So asking [...] "Can God create a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?" [...] is just as much nonsense as asking [...] "Can God draw a square circle?" [...] The logical contradiction here being God's simultaneous ability and disability in lifting the rock: the statement [...] "God can lift this rock" [...] must have a truth value of either true or false, it cannot possess both. This is justified by observing that for the omnipotent agent to create such a stone, it must already be more powerful than itself: such a stone is too heavy for the omnipotent agent to lift, but the omnipotent agent already can create such a stone; If an omnipotent agent already is more powerful than itself, then it already is just that powerful. This means that its power to create a stone that’s too heavy for it to lift is identical to its power to lift that very stone. While this doesn’t <b>quite</b> <b>make</b> complete sense, Lewis wished to stress its implicit point: that even within the attempt to prove that the concept of omnipotence is immediately incoherent, one admits that it is immediately coherent, and that {{the only difference is that}} this attempt is forced to admit this despite that the attempt is constituted by a perfectly irrational route to its own unwilling end, with a perfectly irrational set of 'things' included in that end.|$|E
