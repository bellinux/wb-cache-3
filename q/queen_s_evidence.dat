40|$|Commonly called “bubblegum coral’, Paragorgia is a genus of cold-water gorgonian coral {{that has}} a broad global {{distribution}} and is eurybathic from depths of meters to kilometers. Such ecological breadth, however, may be confounded {{by the presence of}} cryptic species. In this study we compare the genetic distances of various Paragorgia spp. across their distribution and depth range along the Canadian mid-Atlantic margin using 18 S ribosomal DNA sequences.   Morphometric and 18 <b>S</b> <b>evidence</b> show that although appearing similar, only one species of cold-water Paragorgia, called P. arborea, predominates in this region.   However, 18 <b>S</b> <b>evidence</b> from corals collected at deep depths located at one site, called the Stone Fence, indicate that a significant amount of divergence exists and other species may also be present.   Such new light provides a need for further genetic testing using alternative methods (e. g. microsatellites), which could reveal new lineages that may have considerable ecological and/or taxonomic importance. </p...|$|R

A large proportion of this discussion has focused on removing child witnesses from the courtroom and developing alternative arrangements by which children can give evidence (e. g., videotaped statements used as evidence-in-chief, closed-circuit television). There is no doubt that these arrangements have {{played a major role in}} reducing children 2 ̆ 7 s feelings of uncertainty and intimidation, and they have increased the ability of children 10 tell their stories and answer questions reliably (Cashmore 2002; Eastwood & Patton 2002).

While Nash bargaining is sufficient to capture the labor share countercyclicality, we show that countercyclical markups are key to address the overshooting...|$|R
