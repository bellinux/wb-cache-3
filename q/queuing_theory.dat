Simulations of organized traffic frequently involve <b>queuing</b> <b>theory,</b> stochastic processes and equations of mathematical physics applied to traffic flow.|$|E
2500|$|One {{important}} difference is service recovery. [...] When an error occurs in service delivery, the recovery must be delivered {{on the spot}} by the service provider. [...] If a waiter in a restaurant spills soup on the customer's lap, then the recovery could include a free meal and a promise of free dry cleaning. [...] Another difference is in planning capacity. [...] Since the product cannot be stored, the service facility must be managed to peak demand which requires more flexibility than manufacturing. Location of facilities must be near the customers and scale economics can be lacking. Scheduling must consider the customer can be waiting in line. [...] <b>Queuing</b> <b>theory</b> has been devised to assist in design of service facilities waiting lines. [...] Revenue management is important for service operations, since empty seats on an airplane are lost revenue when the plane departs and cannot be stored for future use.|$|E

40|$|<b>Queueing</b> <b>theory</b> {{has enjoyed}} a {{prominent}} place among the modern analytical techniques of OR. However, the emphasis thus far has been on developing a descriptive mathematical <b>theory.</b> Thus, <b>queueing</b> <b>theory</b> is not directly concerned with achieving the goal of OR: optimal decision making. Rather, it develops information {{on the behavior of}} <b>queueing</b> systems. This <b>theory</b> provides part of the information needed to conduct an OR study attempting to find the best design for a queueing system. This chapter discusses the application of <b>queueing</b> <b>theory</b> in the broader context of an overall OR study. It begins by introducing three examples that will be used for illustration throughout the chapter. Section 18. 2 discusses the basic considerations for decision making in this context. The following two sections then develop decision models for the optimal design of queueing systems.

40|$|<b>Queueing</b> <b>Theory</b> {{has been}} {{attacked}} on two fronts. Some theoreticians say that <b>Queueing</b> <b>Theory</b> is closed. Some practitioners {{feel that there}} is very little in it for use. In view of this, it seems that after six decades of development it is time for stock taking. It is hoped that a discussion of the problems, achievements and the shortcomings of <b>Queueing</b> <b>Theory</b> will be helpful for both theorists and practitioners by putting things in proper perspective. This paper reviews some of the major strides taken by <b>Queueing</b> <b>Theory</b> with respect to its three constituent problems: (i) Behavioral, (ii) Statistical, and (iii) Operational. If one looks at the general picture of the developments in these areas it is hard not to conclude that, in spite of the practitioners' accusations, the systems studied have become more and more realistic over the years. This review makes an attempt to bring this out. An extensive bibliography which is directive in nature rather than exhaustive should be helpful to an interested researcher or a practitioner in identifying the articles of his interest. A discussion of the future of <b>Queueing</b> <b>Theory</b> concludes the paper. ...|$|R

40|$|Network {{calculus}} is a <b>theory</b> {{dealing with}} <b>queueing</b> type problems encountered in computer networks, with particular focus on {{quality of service}} guarantee analysis. <b>Queueing</b> <b>theory</b> is the mathematical study of queues, proven to be applicable to a wide area of problems, generally concerning about the (average) quantities in an equilibrium state. Since both network calculus and <b>queueing</b> <b>theory</b> are analytical tools for studying queues, a question arises naturally as is if and where network calculus and <b>queueing</b> <b>theory</b> meet. In this paper, we explore queueing principles that underlie network calculus and exemplify their use. Particularly, based on the network calculus queueing principles, we show that for GI/GI/ 1, similar inequalities in the <b>theory</b> of <b>queues</b> can be derived. In addition, we prove that the end-to-end performance of a tandem network is independent {{of the order of}} servers in the network even under some general settings.
