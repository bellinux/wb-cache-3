40|$|We study empirically the {{macroeconomic}} {{effects of}} an explicit "de jure" quantitative goal for monetary policy. Quantitative goals take three forms: exchange rates, money growth rates, and inflation targets. We analyze the effects on inflation of both having a <b>quantitative</b> <b>target</b> and hitting a declared target. Our empirical work uses an annual data set covering 42 countries between 1960 and 2000, and takes account of other determinants of inflation (such as fiscal policy, the business cycle, and openness to international trade) and the endogeneity of the monetary policy regime. We find that both having and hitting quantitative targets for monetary policy is systematically and robustly associated with lower inflation. The exact form of the monetary target matters somewhat (especially for the sustainability of the monetary regime) but {{is less important than}} having some <b>quantitative</b> <b>target.</b> Successfully achieving a quantitative monetary goal is also associated with less volatile output.

We evaluate the costs of onshore wind power projects in the pipeline and their potential {{to contribute to the}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>target</b> of adding new renewable electricity generation corresponding to 26. 4 TWh per year by 2020. We present relevant theory on electricity certificate markets and available data on the Swedish-Norwegian electricity certificate market. We show how several features of the policy design are likely to result in high risk and uncertainty to potential investors. In particular, there is a risk of overshooting the <b>quantitative</b> <b>target,</b> resulting in certificate price spoilage, {{due to a lack of}} information regarding the supply and demand for electricity certificates over the duration of the scheme. The large electricity generation potential of the projects in the pipeline reinforces the risk of overinvestment. Risk and uncertainty is likely to contribute to high riskpremiums and increase the capital costs of new investment. These costs, which ultimately are covered by the electricity consumers in Norway and Sweden, have the potential to weaken the cost-effectiveness of the policy. Improved systems for information in the market, increased transparency in electricity certificate trade and more frequent corrections of demand deviation are suggested as viable measures that the regulators can take in order to reduce risk and uncertainty faced by the market participants. nhhma...|$|E
40|$|Conservation {{planning}} and biodiversity assessments need <b>quantitative</b> <b>targets</b> to optimize planning options {{and assess the}} adequacy of current species protection. However, targets aiming at persistence require population-specific data, which limits their use in favor of fixed and non-specific targets, likely leading to unequal distribution of conservation efforts among species. Here we propose a method to derive equitable population <b>targets,</b> which are <b>quantitative</b> <b>targets</b> of population size that ensure equal probabilities of persistence across a set of species, and can be easily inferred from species-specific traits. We applied population dynamics models {{across a range of}} life-history traits representative for mammals, and estimated minimum viable population targets intrinsically related to species body mass. Our approach provides a compromise between pragmatic non-specific targets, and detailed context-specific estimates of population viability for which only limited data is available. It enables a first estimation of species-specific population targets based on a readily available trait, and thus allows setting equitable targets for population persistence in large-scale and multispecies conservation assessments and planning...|$|R

The model predicts that a proper combination of civil engineering countermeasure and change of farming method can reduce the sediment yield from the watershed by 74 %.

30|$|This {{result can}} hardly be {{overlooked}} {{and it may have}} some important policy implications. As low participation is mainly involuntary, policymakers have a set of policies {{that can be used to}} raise participation and employment rates. The first option is related to selective migration.
