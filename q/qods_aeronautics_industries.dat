40|$|The {{development}} {{of the world economy}} and the globally accelerated diversification of production led to the need of widening the economic cooperation. The need of cooperation increased in various sectors of the global economy, such as the transport industry, IT and commercial sector. The <b>aeronautics</b> <b>industry</b> is a representative sector of cooperation, where the exchange of knowledge and technology, the cooperation between universities, industries, research organizations, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), etc. and the free flow of ideas are crucial factors for the implementation and sustainability of a unique innovation system.

40|$|This article {{intends to}} analyze the {{possibilities}} of applying strategies based upon the value net to the <b>aeronautics</b> <b>industry.</b> To do so, we have employed the dimensions suggested by the Delta Model since this typology of strategy considers not only the company, its customers and suppliers, but also its complementors. By studying a single although highly representative case in the global <b>aeronautics</b> <b>industry,</b> we have found out that strategies focused on the value net strongly support the business model of the company under investigation. Moreover, these strategies are {{the means by which}} the organization studied obtains and sustains competitive advantages. Strategies focused on the value net seem to fit well into the risk-sharing business model employed by Embraer, and the effective management of the value net simultaneously allows each participant {{to get the most out}} of the system and strongly contribute to increase system performance. Besides providing all participants with above average economic returns, strategies based upon the value net strengthen the bonding among them while locking them in and competitors out...|$|R

40|$|The <b>aeronautics</b> <b>industry</b> and {{aviation}} community {{served by}} NASA R&D investments in aeronautics is large, diverse and varied in {{their interests and}} priorities for technology. The stakeholders of NASA research and technology include: the <b>aeronautics</b> <b>industry</b> (both commercial and military), including subsystems suppliers and venders {{as well as the}} airframers and engine manufacturers; DoD; FAA; the airlines; aircargo companies; other commercial and private aircraft owners and operators, including rotocraft; and, indirectly, the traveling public, recipients of aircargo and US residences in general from the positive impact on the balance of foreign trade. To determine the total payoff of NASA research and technology investments, one would have to quantify the benefits to each of these stakeholders derived from each of the resulting technologies. The task of determining the highest payoff areas is somewhat easier, because it is only necessary to develop measures, of the relative potential benefits resulting from R&D investments and not the absolute benefits to all stakeholders. Selecting the best metrics to apply across the diversity of NASA’s program is the real challenge. How does one rank the benefits of flight safety for the traveling public vs increased market share for US transport manufacturers, or rank the benefi...|$|R
