40|$|The need {{to improve}} {{relations}} between company and supplier suggests that the dyad partnership and credibility must be enhanced {{in order to maximize}} gains for both parties that would otherwise not take place. This study demonstrates that companies and suppliers feel the need to review the results achieved by both parties and to influence the way they treat their relationships in the supply of goods and services. This study highlights the need to explore two aspects: firstly, the focus of the importance of supplier partnership for improvement of the company and, secondly, the need to create links based in credibility for the improvement of relations between company and supplier, in order to establish a win-win process in their purchasing and supplying activities. This research applied a questionnaire to 154 elements of various industrial segments. The results confirm the widespread perception on the part of elements of the companies of the need for deepening the partnership between company and supplier, but it verified, however, less openness with regard to the sharing of knowledge, which can be an obstacle to the realization of this deepening. The analysis is done under the perspective of the <b>qualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers...</b>|$|E
40|$|Most {{companies}} in the Chemical, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare industry have a procurement performance below average, which in turn means a disadvantage compared to other industries. These companies {{are not able to}} realize their existing cost reduction potentials in procurement. Additional short term potentials will not be fully exploited, for example these due to the financial crisis. A large fraction of companies from this industry has neither a relevant procurement strategy nor a procurement controlling. It is easy to see, that companies neglecting these basic elements have no chance to achieve a high procurement performance and optimize potentials. One specific problem is that the industry lacks of sufficient qualified procurement personnel. At the same time important positions in procurement departments, especially in strategic procurement, were vacant. In general procurement in the Chemical, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare industry has a strong operational focus. Highest prioritized topics are analysis of prices and offers, calculation and planning of demands and management of supply shortages. In comparison to other industries each of these topics has relevance above-average. The major topics in strategic procurement are evaluation of suppliers, tendering and <b>qualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> as well as searching for new suppliers. Especially tendering seems to be more relevant for {{companies in}} the Chemical, Pharmaceutical and Healthcare industry than for companies in other industries.

Thereby, a bridge is provided between the pure self-interest of ‘market driven competition among profit-driven firms’ and the concern for wellbeing in society and the triple bottom line. Moreover, universities need to provide more flexible entrepreneurial research, education and learning contexts for SMEs. The research has to consider the point of origin {{in the interests of the}} SMEs and the requirements for BMI. Organisational learning in the required fields provides important new knowledge for SMEs ready for application by the SME suppliers when needed. Thereby, learning creates value and provides opportunities for more widespread applicability and communication. The SMEs need to provide themselves time for participation in such network activities, which can give them value both on the short- and long-term horizon. SME participants must create space for both network activities, as well as reflection on information and learning and for concrete BMI in their own organisation and with collaborative partners. Furthermore, the larger essential actors within the offshore wind farm industry must provide time for discussion with networking SMEs to share both specific and strategic knowledge on applications. This activity will probably not have an immediate impact on their own business. However, in the long term, BMI and <b>qualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers</b> can help considerably regarding the challenges for innovation and a reduction in LCOEs. In general, an agenda has been set for bridging the different interests of enterprises, governmental bodies and universities to enable sustainable innovation.|$|E
40|$|Sustainable development, {{after all}} these years development, has already been {{accepted}} as one of the themes of 21 st century, especially after the reveal of some serious environmental problems, such as global warming, resource exhaustion, etc. Construction industry, although being considered as one of the traditional industries of which the development speed is slowing down, is currently still playing {{an important role in the}} society and economy system. Meanwhile, it is also an industry that relies heavily on resources and energy consumption, especially the construction manufacturing industry. As a result, the pursuit of sustainability within the construction industry seems to be inevitable. In order to stimulate and push for the green transitioning in the construction industry in Europe, the European Commission issued the Green Public Procurement policy to motivate manufacturers of building products to develop green products and technologies. As a gesture of support, many member states quickly issued their own GPP policies which are more tailored for their specific situations. However, many challenges stand in the way toward fully implementation, and one of which is the shortage of qualified suppliers. Many existing literatures elaborate on the possibility of solving this challenge from the perspective of public authorities. This research, however, looks at this challenge from a different angle, the perspective of manufacturers of building products. This research studies into the flooring industry and intends to develop some suggestions for manufacturers who plan to develop green products based on the successful experiences of some frontrunners. To realize this objective, research questions are developed in this study: 1) What are the GPP requirements for flooring products in public construction projects and how are they evaluated? 2) What are the enablers and barriers during the development of green products? How do these factors get influenced by GPP policy? 3) Given the enablers and barriers, how can manufacturers of building products adjust their product development strategies to meet GPP criteria? What green attributes should be emphasized on during green product development? A literature review was conducted to find answers for the first research question. The EU GPP criteria are made for general terms of building products with no specification for each category. Two sets of criteria are contained in the EU GPP criteria, the core criteria and the comprehensive criteria which are built on the former. The main requirements of the core criteria are that products compete for public tenders should either be eco-labeled or provide detailed LCA reports to prove their environmental performance during life cycles, and if the products are wooden based, then the wooden materials are supposed to be responsibly sourced. The comprehensive criteria, based on the core criteria, add two more requirements regarding the recyclability of the products and the amount of recycled materials that should be contained in the products. In public tenders, the core criteria work as selection criteria for the <b>qualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>suppliers,</b> while the comprehensive criteria act as award criteria. Apart from the general EU GPP criteria, eco-label criteria can also be used as evaluation references. The eco-label criteria, comparing to the EU GPP criteria, are more detailed and specified. Three subgroups for the flooring products are made by the eco-label criteria, namely hard flooring, textile flooring, and wooden flooring. These criteria consider every stage and aspect in the life cycle of products, and only products fulfill all of them get to wear the labels. Case studies were conducted to research into question 2 and 3. Three frontrunner companies in the flooring industry who have successful experiences in marketing green products were interviewed, in order to identify the enabler and barriers of green product development process as well as some recognizable green product attributes. Main findings on enablers and barriers are listed Table A. As for the influence of the GPP policy, interviewees claimed it to be limited, mostly because they developed green products before or along with the development of the GPP policy. Enablers: 1) Motivations: concern for the sustainable development of the company; concern for the competitiveness of products; concern for the image of the company; market requirement. 2) Success factors: partnership; in-house knowledge base; government subsidies. Barriers: 1) worries about future uncertainty: high price perception of customers; low functional performance perception of customers; future uncertainty (policy change, market requirement change, etc.). 2) Practical difficulties: difficult to sell at competitive prices; development cost; need for extra knowledge and expertise; loss of government subsidies; stringent public scrutiny. Some of the most mentioned green product attributes by the interviewees are: - Toxin-free raw materials - Containment of recycled contents in products - Recyclability of products - Reduction of production wastes - Use of renewable energies - Closed-loop water recycling systems. Based on these findings, some recommendations are given for manufacturers of flooring products who plan to develop their own green products in the near future: For enablers: - Bring the plan of developing green products up to schedule to meet future market demand. - Build stable and cooperative relationships with main raw material suppliers and lead clients. - Start to cultivate in-house knowledge base for green product development. - Look out for government subsidy plans, and build project based on that. For barriers: - Consider long tern return on investment when setting prices for green products. - Try various ways to gather the initial investment, such as loan, partner investment, government subsidies, etc. - When choosing what green certificates to apply, consider the zone of influence of the certificates and the market area and supplying sector of the focal company. For green attributes: - Use toxin-free materials in the products. If greener alternative is not available yet, then keeping the toxic materials below safe limits is necessary. - Contain certain amount of recycled materials in the products. - The design of the products should enable recycling. - LCA assessment report shall be provided. - Use green packaging. - Use renewable energy in production. If not possible, then energy saving plans shall be applied. - Consider using water in closed loops. If not possible, then waste water should be processed before discharging to keep certain materials below required limits. - Consider reutilizing production wastes and by products.

40|$|Partner {{selection}} {{is an important}} aspect of all outsourcing processes. Traditional partner selection, typically involves steps to determine the criteria for outsourcing, followed by a <b>qualification</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>suppliers</b> and concluding with a final selection of partner(s). Reverse auctions (RAs) have widely been used for partner selection in recent times. However, RAs, although proven successful in initial price reduction strategies for product and service provision, can suffer from reduced effectiveness as the number of executions increases. This paper illustrates Dell’s experience of such diminishing returns for its outsourced after sales product repair service and presents the development, of a new partner selection methodology which incorporates a new process improvement stage to be executed in combination with the final selection phase. This new methodology is underpinned by the development of a computer based simulation supply partner selection decision support tool for service provision. The paper highlights the significant additional cost saving benefits achievable and improvement in service through the use of advanced simulation based decision supports. ...|$|R
