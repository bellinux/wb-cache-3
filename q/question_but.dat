5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} questions. They can use as many lifelines as desired per <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> each lifeline can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{surviving}} sources contemporary {{with the}} rule of Tiberius comes from Velleius Paterculus, who served under Tiberius for eight years (from AD4) in Germany and Pannonia as praefect of cavalry and legatus. Paterculus' Compendium of Roman History spans a period from the fall of Troy {{to the death of}} Livia in AD29. His text on Tiberius lavishes praise on both the emperor and Sejanus. How much of this is due to genuine admiration or prudence remains an open <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> it has been conjectured that he was put to death in AD31 as a friend of Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|The Department of Justice started {{keeping a}} list of {{organizations}} that it deemed subversive beginning in 1942. This list was first made public in 1948, when it included 78 items. At its longest, it comprised 154 organizations, 110 of them identified as Communist. In {{the context of a}} loyalty review, membership in a listed organization was meant to raise a <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> not to be considered proof of disloyalty. One of the most common causes of suspicion was membership in the Washington Bookshop Association, a left-leaning organization that offered lectures on literature, classical music concerts and discounts on books.|$|E

5|$|The first {{finished}} {{train was}} unveiled {{to the press}} on 14 October 1994, and the first two trainsets started their regular test traffic on 27 November 1995 between Helsinki and Turku on the coastal track. Test traffic was stopped only after three months, {{at the end of}} February 1996, due to technical difficulties with the trains. Testing later resumed, and VR announced in 1997 that it would start normal operations with the Pendolino despite electrical problems. The ability of the train to cope with the Finnish winter was put into <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> VR denied that coldness had been a factor in the electrical failures.|$|E
5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that <b>question.</b> <b>But</b> it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley stayed at home in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E
5|$|Phaedrus was {{suspected}} of having alluded to Sejanus in his Fables and received some unknown punishment short of death (Cf. Fables I.1, I.2.24, and I.17). Velleius Paterculus was a historian and contemporary of Sejanus, whose two-volume The Roman History details a history of Rome from the fall of Troy until the death of Livia Augusta in AD 29. In his work he praised Tiberius and Sejanus, even defending the latter's high position in the government, despite not ranking higher than equestrian. How much of Paterculus' writing is due to genuine admiration, prudence or fear remains an open <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> it has been conjectured that he was put to death {{as a friend of}} Sejanus.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} believe supernatural events {{cannot be}} reconstructed using empirical methods, and thus consider the resurrection a non-historical <b>question</b> <b>but</b> instead a philosophical or theological question.|$|E
25|$|There is no <b>question</b> <b>but</b> that Birtism... has {{had some}} terrible results. On the other hand, the BBC had to change. Now it has to produce {{programmes}} {{no one else can}} do. Otherwise, forget the licence fee.|$|E
25|$|Kitchener {{advised the}} Dardanelles Committee (21 October) that Baghdad be seized {{for the sake}} of {{prestige}} then abandoned as logistically untenable.

25|$|Imperial Russia {{had been}} {{multi-ethnic}} for many centuries, and this situation continued throughout the Soviet period, and continues still. Throughout history, several ethnic stereotypes have developed, often {{in common with}} those views by other ethnicities (usually except for the ethnicity in <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> not always).|$|E
25|$|Stallard {{protested that}} the airfields and car {{circuits}} {{which were the}} only place that the NCU would allow massed racing had been taken by the Army and RAF. Chamberlin was not impressed and replied at the end of January to say that the NCU had considered the <b>question</b> <b>but</b> considered it unwise.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{believed}} that to {{know the name of}} a particular fairy could summon it to you and force it to do your bidding. The name could be used as an insult towards the fairy in <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> it could also rather contradictorily be used to grant powers and gifts to the user.|$|E

25|$|This schema {{constitutes}} a basic {{framework of the}} overlapping behavioural fields of ethology, behavioural ecology, comparative psychology, sociobiology, evolutionary psychology, and anthropology. It was in fact Julian Huxley who identified the first three questions, Niko Tinbergen gave only the fourth <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> Julian Huxley's questions failed to distinguish between survival value and evolutionary history, so Tinbergen's fourth question helped resolve this problem.|$|E
25|$|In {{suits against}} private parties, the United States {{is not a}} {{necessary}} party. Similarly, historically, a court of equity could not set aside fraudulent transfers of aboriginal title unless all parties to the fraud were before it. Old lower court decisions have expressed the view that aboriginal title is a political, non-justiciable <b>question.</b> <b>But,</b> this view was subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court in Oneida II.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on January 5, 2015; Tsarnaev {{pleaded not guilty}} to all thirty charges laid against him. The {{proceedings}} were led by Judge George O'Toole. Tsarnaev's attorney Judy Clarke admitted in her opening statement that Tsarnaev committed the acts in <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> sought to avert the death penalty by showing that his brother Tamerlan was the mastermind behind the acts. Counter terrorism expert Matthew Levitt also gave testimony.|$|E

25|$|Several {{papers were}} {{inspired}} by a question of M. Berry (called the Berryâ€“Robbins problem), who asked {{if there is a}} map from the configuration space of n points in 3-space to the flag manifold of the unitary group. Atiyah gave an affirmative answer to this <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> felt his solution was too computational and studied a conjecture that would give a more natural solution. He also related the question to Nahm's equation, and introduced the Atiyah conjecture on configurations.|$|E
25|$|These {{services}} allow a user to text {{a question}} to a central database and receive a reply using text. A usage example would be a user that wants {{to know the answer}} to a very specific <b>question</b> <b>but</b> is not in front of his/her computer. Most mobile 'Q' services are powered by human researchers and are therefore a type of organic search engine. A new approach by AskMeNow and MobileBits is to use Semantic Web technology to automate the process.|$|E
25|$|The Compromise Committee {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} included seven constitutional amendments and relied on Henry Clay's Missouri Compromise as a framework. Under the committee's proposal, 36Â°30' north latitude would continue to divide slave and free territory in the United States, and no more territory would be annexed except {{with the consent of}} equal representation from both slave and free states. The delegates to the convention presented this idea to Congress on February 27, 1861 and asked them to call a national convention to consider the <b>question,</b> <b>but</b> Congress rejected this report.|$|E
