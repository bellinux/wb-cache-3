Another use is to type more symbols than {{appear to be}} available, for instance the apostrophe key is accompanied with a <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> on the top. If one wants to type the <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> but pressed that key alone, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe. The <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> will only appear if both the required key and the Shift key are pressed.|$|E
25|$|The {{apostrophe}} represents sounds {{resembling the}} glottal {{stop in the}} Turkic languages and in some romanizations of Semitic languages, including Arabic. In typography, this function may be performed by the closing single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b> In that case, the Arabic letter ‘ayn (ع) is correspondingly transliterated with the opening single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{typewriter}} keyboards, {{the curved}} <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> were not implemented. Instead, to save space, the straight <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> were invented as a compromise. Even {{in countries that}} did not use curved <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> angular <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> were not implemented either.|$|R
50|$|The curved <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (“…”) usage was {{exported}} to some non-Latin scripts, notably {{where there was}} some English influence (for instance, in Indian scripts). The angular <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> («…») usage was {{exported to}} some non-Latin scripts, like Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic and Ethiopic. The Far East angle brackets <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (《…》) are also a development of the in-line angular <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Because {{most of the}} {{computer}} keyboards lack keys to directly enter typographic <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> much typed writing has vertical <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> The [...] "smart quotes" [...] feature in some computer software can convert vertical <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> to curly ones, although sometimes imperfectly.|$|R
25|$|The {{typewriter}} apostrophe (') was inherited {{by computer}} keyboards, {{and is the}} only apostrophe character available in the (7-bit) ASCII character encoding, at code value 0x27 (39). As such, it is a highly overloaded character. In ASCII, it represents a left single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark,</b> right single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark,</b> apostrophe, vertical line or prime (punctuation marks), or an acute accent (modifier letters).|$|E
25|$|The Grade 2 single opening <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> is also retained, but {{the closing}} {{equivalent}} is changed.|$|E

50|$|In Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian, angled <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> {{are used}} without spaces. In case of quoted {{material}} inside a quotation, rules and most noted style manuals prescribe {{the use of}} different kinds of <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> However, some of them allow to use the same <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> for quoted material inside a quotation, and if inner and outer <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> fall together, then one of them should be omitted.|$|R

The double <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are used when {{embedded}} within single quotation marks: [...] In vertical text, <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are rotated 90° clockwise ( [...] (U+FE41 , U+FE42 [...] )).|$|R

25|$|Some {{standard}} transliterations, such as DIN 31635, transliterate {{it with a}} modifier letter right {{half ring}} ʾ and others such as ALA-LC with the modifier letter apostrophe ʼ and sometimes substituted with the Right Single <b>Quotation</b> <b>Mark</b> ’.|$|E
25|$|In many languages, such as Polish, the em dash {{is used as}} {{an opening}} <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b> There is no {{matching}} closing quotation mark; typically a new paragraph will be started, introduced by a dash, for each turn in the dialog.|$|E
5000|$|In most cases, {{quotations}} {{that span}} multiple paragraphs {{should be set}} as block quotations, and thus do not require <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> <b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are used for multiple-paragraph quotations in some cases, especially in narratives. The convention in English is to give opening <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> to the first and each subsequent paragraph, using closing <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> only for the final paragraph of the quotation, as in the following example from Pride and Prejudice: ...|$|R
5000|$|... ‘…’ and “…”, {{are known}} as typographic, curly, curved, book, or [...] "smart" [...] <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> The {{beginning}} marks are commas raised {{to the top of}} the line and rotated 180°. The ending marks are commas raised {{to the top of the}} line. Curved <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are used mainly in manuscript, printing and typesetting. Type cases (of any language) always have the correct <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> metal types for the respective language and never the vertical <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> metal types.|$|R
50|$|In Portugal, {{the angular}} <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (ex. «quote») are {{traditionally}} used. They are the Latin tradition <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> used normally by typographers.

25|$|The {{form of the}} {{apostrophe}} {{originates in}} manuscript writing, as a point with a downwards tail curving clockwise. This form was inherited by the typographic apostrophe (’), {{also known as the}} typeset apostrophe, or, informally, the curly apostrophe. Later sans-serif typefaces had stylised apostrophes with a more geometric or simplified form, but usually retaining the same directional bias as a closing <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
25|$|In XML and XHTML, {{characters}} can {{be expressed}} as hexadecimal numeric character references using the notation &#xcode;, where the x denotes that code is a hex code point (of 1- to 6-digits) assigned to the character in the Unicode standard. Thus &#x2019; represents the right single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> (’), Unicode code point number 2019 in hex, 8217 (thus &#8217; in decimal).|$|E
25|$|Many earlier (pre-1985) {{computer}} {{displays and}} printers rendered the ASCII apostrophe as a typographic apostrophe, and rendered the ASCII grave accent (`) U+0060 as a matching left single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark.</b> This allowed a more typographic appearance of text: ``Ican't would appear as ‘‘Ican’t’’ on these systems. This {{can still be}} seen in many documents prepared at that time, and is still used in the TeX typesetting system to create typographic quotes.|$|E
50|$|Although the {{standard}} notation for mentioning a term in philosophy and logic {{is to put}} the term in <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> issues arise when the mention is itself of a mention. Notating using italics might require a potentially infinite number of typefaces, while putting <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> within <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> may lead to ambiguity.|$|R
5000|$|To make typographic <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> {{easier to}} enter, {{publishing}} software often automatically converts typewriter <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (and apostrophes) to typographic form during text entry (with {{or without the}} user being aware of it). These are known as smart quotes (“ ”). Straight <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are also retronymically called dumb quotes (" [...] ").|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} results of an {{experimental}} study which targets prosodic correlates of subclausal <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> We found that written sentences containing passages enclosed by <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> were read aloud in a manner that significantly differs in prosody from spoken realizations of corresponding disquoted counterparts. However, we also observed that such prosodic <b>marking</b> of subclausal <b>quotation</b> wasn’t strong enough to survive subsequent back-translation into written language: there was no correlation between the presence/absence of <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> in the original written examples, and the presence/absence of <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> in corresponding back-translations from oral renditions. We investigated three different kinds of uses of <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> and found no systematic difference between them with respect to prosodic marking...|$|R
25|$|Such {{conversion}} is {{not always}} done {{in accordance with the}} standards for character sets and encodings. Additionally, many such software programs incorrectly convert a leading apostrophe to an opening <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> (e.g., in abbreviations of years: ‘29 rather than the correct ’29 for the years 1929 or 2029 (depending on context); or ‘twas instead of ’twas as the archaic abbreviation of it was). Smart quote features also often fail to recognise situations when a prime rather than an apostrophe is needed; for example, incorrectly rendering the latitude 49°53′08″ as 49°53’08".|$|E

50|$|Other authors {{claim that}} the reason for this was an aesthetical one. The {{elevated}} <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> created an extra white space before and after the word that was considered unaesthetical, while the in-line <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> helped to maintain the typographical color, since the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> had the same height and were aligned with the lower case letters. Nevertheless, while other languages do not insert a space between the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> and the word(s), the French usage does insert them, even if it is a narrow space.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are ambiguous, {{although}} the conventional rules that govern their different uses {{are similar in}} that they contain quantifications over quotable expressions. Pure uses are governed by a simple rule: by enclosing any expression within <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> one gets a singular term, the quotation, that stands for the enclosed expression. Impure uses are far less simple. In a series of uses the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> conventionally indicate that (part of) the enclosed expression is a contextually appropriate version of expressions uttered by some relevant agent. When the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> have this meaning, {{it is tempting to}} think of them as contributing that indication to the truth-conditional content of the utterance. I adopt a cautious attitude towards this hypothesis, for the evidence in its favor is inconclusive. In other uses the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> conventionally indicate that the enclosed expression should be used not “plainly ” but in some broadly speaking “distanced ” way, or that it is being so used by the utterer, and typically context makes clear the exact nature of the “distance ” at stake. In these cases the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> do not even appear to contribute that indication to the truth-conditional content of the utterance. I <b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are used for a variety of purposes. One that is especially significant is the purpose of referring to expressions.
