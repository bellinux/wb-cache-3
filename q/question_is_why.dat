25|$|Only certain subsets of swallowtails {{practice}} mimicry. Species {{differ in}} whether {{one or both}} sexes is mimetic, and whether the mimicry is monomorphic or polymorphic. A phenomenon which has received particular attention is female-limited polymorphism, in which only the females of a species are mimetic and polymorphic, often mimicking different, distantly-related aposematic butterflies. This polymorphism is seen in Papilo dardanus, the African swallowtail butterfly, whose females have three different morphs for wing color pattern: a black-and-white pattern for Batesian mimicry, a black-and-yellow pattern that resembles the males of the species, and a pattern with orange patches that resembles the elderly males of the species. Given that the males of the species, which do not have Batesian mimicry, are preyed upon much more frequently by predators than the females, an ongoing <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> females would exhibit the non-mimetic wing pattern, which would seemingly lower their fitness compared to the mimicry form.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, AI founder Marvin Minsky asked [...] "So the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> didn't we get HAL in 2001?" [...] Minsky {{believed}} {{that the answer is}} that the central problems, like commonsense reasoning, were being neglected, while most researchers pursued things like commercial applications of neural nets or genetic algorithms. John McCarthy, on the other hand, still blamed the qualification problem. For Ray Kurzweil, the issue is computer power and, using Moore's Law, he predicted that machines with human-level intelligence will appear by 2029. Jeff Hawkins argued that neural net research ignores the essential properties of the human cortex, preferring simple models that have been successful at solving simple problems. There were many other explanations and for each there was a corresponding research program underway.|$|E
500|$|Another <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> Mars {{came out}} so small {{compared}} with Earth. A study by Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, published June 6, 2011 (called the Grand Tack Hypothesis), proposes that Jupiter had migrated inward to 1.5AU. After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated {{back to their}} present positions. Jupiter thus would have consumed much of the material that would have created a bigger Mars. The same simulations also reproduce {{the characteristics of the}} modern asteroid belt, with dry asteroids and water-rich objects similar to comets. [...] However, it is unclear whether conditions in the solar nebula would have allowed Jupiter and Saturn to move back to their current positions, and according to current estimates this possibility appears unlikely. Moreover, alternative explanations for the small mass of Mars exist.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} month, {{a controversy}} arose after the Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) {{issued a report}} calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% — a stark difference from the official figure of 18.9%, used by politicians to justify the retention or revival of the NEP. One local analyst suggested that [...] "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely the next <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>why</b> the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present." [...] The report's methodology was criticised for using market value instead of par value for its calculations of equity, and limiting its scope to a thousand publicly listed companies. It also included government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned companies. Some, however, criticised the government, alleging that par value did not accurately reflect {{the value of the}} enterprises studied, and claimed that a portion of GLC equity should be considered Bumiputra-held. The report was later withdrawn, but the controversy continued after an independent media outlet cited a study following the government methodology that indicated Bumiputra equity had passed the 30% mark in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|The {{question}} of Tibet's social history is therefore highly politicized, and Chinese claims {{in this respect}} are intrinsic to {{the functioning of the}} PRC, and not some free act of intellectual exploration. They have accordingly to be treated with caution. From a human rights point of view, the {{question of}} whether Tibet was feudal in the past is irrelevant. A more immediate <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>why</b> the PRC does not allow open discussion of whether Tibet was feudal or oppressive.

2500|$|In 2006, a major dispute arose {{when the}} Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) {{issued a report}} calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% – a stark {{difference}} from the official figure of 18.9%. The report's publication triggered a relatively vocal public debate {{about the status of}} the NEP and its related policies, with many from UMNO questioning the methodology used by ASLI. One strongly disputed issue was ASLI's decision to consider government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned, inflating the calculated figure of Bumiputra equity. Although ASLI later withdrew the report, citing unspecified errors in its methodology, the debate did not die down. One political analyst suggested that [...] "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely the next <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>why</b> the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present." [...] Others have argued that the debate over inter-ethnic disparities has obscured intra-ethnic inequities, citing the increased Gini coefficient for Bumiputras (from 0.433 in 1999 to 0.452 in 2004), Chinese (0.434 to 0.446) and Indians (0.413 to 0.425).|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 Mark Katz's article [...] "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," [...] {{stated that}} [...] "very few women [...] battle; the matter {{has been a}} topic of {{conversation}} among hip-hop DJs for years." [...] In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states [...] "the male-centricity of EDM culture" [...] contributes to [...] "a marginalisation of women in these [...] spaces." [...] While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as [...] "male technophilia." [...] Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: [...] "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field … is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put {{the burden of proof}} entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values.

6000|$|Although John, {{following}} his practice of showing Jesus's skill as a debater, makes him play a less passive part at his trial, he still gives substantially the same account {{of it as}} all the rest. And the question that would occur to any modern reader never occurs to him, {{any more than it}} occurred to Matthew, Mark, or Luke. That <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>Why</b> on earth did not Jesus defend himself, and make the people rescue him from the High Priest? He was so popular that they were unable to prevent him driving the money-changers out of the temple, or to arrest him for it. When they did arrest him afterwards, they had to do it at night in a garden. He could have argued with them as he had often done in the temple, and justified himself both to the Jewish law and to Caesar. And he had physical force at his command to back up his arguments: all that was needed was a speech to rally his followers; and he was not gagged. The reply of the evangelists would have been that all these inquiries are idle, because if Jesus had wished to escape, he could have saved himself all that trouble by doing what John describes him as doing: that is, casting his captors to the earth by an exertion of his miraculous power. If you asked John why he let them get up again and torment and execute him, John would have replied that {{it was part of the}} destiny of God to be slain and buried and to rise again, and that to have avoided this destiny would have been to repudiate his Godhead. And that is the only apparent explanation. Whether you believe with the evangelists that Christ could have rescued himself by a miracle, or, as a modern Secularist, point out that he could have defended himself effectually, the fact remains that according to all the narratives he did not do so. He had to die like a god, not to save himself [...] "like one of the princes." [...] * ...|$|E
