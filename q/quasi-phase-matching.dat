50|$|The {{other method}} is <b>quasi-phase-matching.</b> In this method the {{frequencies}} involved are not constantly locked in phase with each other, instead the crystal axis is flipped at a regular interval Λ, typically 15 micrometres in length. Hence, these crystals are called periodically poled. This {{results in the}} polarization response of the crystal to be shifted back in phase with the pump beam by reversing the nonlinear susceptibility. This allows net positive energy flow from the pump into the signal and idler frequencies. In this case, the crystal itself provides the additional wavevector k = 2π/Λ (and hence momentum) to satisfy the phase-matching condition. <b>Quasi-phase-matching</b> can be expanded to chirped gratings to get more bandwidth and to shape an SHG pulse like it is done in a dazzler. SHG of a pump and self-phase modulation (emulated by second-order processes) of the signal and an optical parametric amplifier can be integrated monolithically.|$|E

50|$|One {{undesirable}} {{effect of}} angle tuning {{is that the}} optical frequencies involved do not propagate collinearly with each other. This {{is due to the}} fact that the extraordinary wave propagating through a birefringent crystal possesses a Poynting vector that is not parallel to the propagation vector. This would lead to beam walk-off, which limits the nonlinear optical conversion efficiency. Two other methods of phase matching avoid beam walk-off by forcing all frequencies to propagate at a 90° with respect to the optical axis of the crystal. These methods are called temperature tuning and <b>quasi-phase-matching.</b>|$|E
50|$|Periodically-poled {{lithium niobate}} (PPLN) is a domain-engineered lithium niobate crystal, used mainly for {{achieving}} <b>quasi-phase-matching</b> in nonlinear optics. The ferroelectric domains point alternatively to the +c and the −c direction, with {{a period of}} typically between 5 and 35 µm. The shorter periods of this range are used for second harmonic generation, while the longer ones for optical parametric oscillation.

50|$|<b>Quasi-phase-matching</b> is a {{technique}} in nonlinear optics which allows a positive net flow of energy from the pump frequency to the signal and idler frequencies by creating a periodic structure in the nonlinear medium. Momentum is conserved, as is necessary for phase-matching, through an additional momentum contribution corresponding to the wavevector of the periodic structure. Consequently, in principle any three-wave mixing process that satisfies energy conservation can be phase-matched. For example, all the optical frequencies involved can be collinear, can have the same polarization, and travel through the medium in arbitrary directions. This allows one to use the largest nonlinear coefficient of the material in the nonlinear interaction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quasi-phase-matching</b> {{ensures that}} there is {{positive}} energy flow from the pump frequency to signal and idler frequencies even though all the frequencies involved are not phase locked with each other. Energy will always flow from pump to signal {{as long as the}} phase between the two optical waves is less than 180 degrees. Beyond 180 degrees, energy flows back from the signal to the pump frequencies. The coherence length is the length of the medium in which the phase of pump and the sum of idler and signal frequencies are 180 degrees from each other. At each coherence length the crystal axes are flipped which allows the energy to continue to positively flow from the pump to the signal and idler frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Second {{harmonic}} generation occurs in three types, denoted 0, I and II. In Type 0 SHG two photons having extraordinary polarization {{with respect to}} the crystal will combine to form a single photon with double the frequency/energy and extraordinary polarization.

In Type II SHG, two photons having orthogonal polarizations will combine to form one photon with double the frequency and extraordinary polarization. For a given crystal orientation, only one of these types of SHG occurs. In general to utilise Type 0 interactions a <b>quasi-phase-matching</b> crystal type will be required, for example periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN).|$|E
50|$|His {{scientific}} interests lied {{mainly in}} the area to nonlinear optics. He was {{one of the founders of}} modern theoretical nonlinear optics. He obtained, in particular, a number of pioneering results on self-focusing and parametric interactions, which were later confirmed in experiments. In a series of works on self-focusing (since 1966) he has developed for the first time the aberration-free theory of wave self-action, found exact solutions for ray patterns accounting for nonlinear aberrations, and numerically investigated different regimes of spatial resonant self-focusing. Many of his theoretical predictions have been confirmed in experiments: aberrational structures due to wave self-focusing in nematics, limited lifetime of spatial solitons in media with relaxation-type nonlinearity, dynamics of thermal defocusing in the presence of forced and free convection, self-deflection of beams in nonlinear moving media, laser-induced transparency of a cloudy medium and an ozone layer, adaptive compensation of beam distortions in nonlinear media. Anatoly Sukhorukov has derived the general paraxial equation describing beam diffraction in anisotropic crystals, and originated the paraxial theory for three-wave interactions of beams and pulses under the presence of phase- and group-velocity mismatches, diffraction, and group velocity dispersion. He has developed a spatio-temporal analogy between optical beams and pulses, and predicted the effect of diffraction-dispersion incoherence for modulated waves, which limits the efficiency of frequency conversion and results in parametric mutual focusing in quadratic media. He has also predicted the phenomenon of anomalous diffraction in the parametric amplifier, and determined the optimal conditions for high-efficiency generation of the second and third harmonics in focused laser beams. He has first investigated the possibility of total energy conversion in the process of double phase-matched interaction between three frequency harmonics. He has developed the theory of up- and down parametric frequency conversion under the presence of group velocity mismatch, described the formation of three-frequency optical dissipative solitons, parametric pi - pulses, a giant parametric pulse (confirmed experimentally), calculated the modes of the parametrical amplifier with a pulsed pump, developed the theory of stimulated Raman scattering taking into account the relaxation time and group velocity mismatch, found the <b>quasi-phase-matching</b> conditions for slow and fast modes in 3D photonic crystals. He has predicted the existence of a new class of localized structures - parametric three-frequency solitons in media with quadratic nonlinearity (results published in 1974, confirmed experimentally in 1995), also discovered a new type of wave self-focusing, namely, mutual - focusing of just three beams at different frequencies in quadratic media. He has investigated the walk-off effect on quadratic solitons, analyzed dynamics of spatial soliton trapping and interactions in bulk media, in cavities (based on the full round-trip model), in gratings (model for counter-propagating waves); proposed parametric soliton model based on the analogy with coupling of three quasi-particles; considered the tunneling of slow parametric solitons through a bounded grating. He has analyzed the quasi-phase-matched hybrid interactions in periodically polled crystals (layer model), asymmetric modes of parametric solitons, properties of ultra-narrow quadratic solitons, propagation of ultra-short optical pulses inducing plasma generation, and parametric interactions of two non-axial vortices, methods of spatio-temporal vortices generation and recording, all-optical switching with parametric refraction and reflection. He developed the theory of dispersion managed interactions of few-cycle pulses in quadratically nonlinear layered media. He has investigated the nonlinear refraction, total internal reflection and scattering of optical beams and pulses in defocusing media with Kerr, cascaded quadratic, photorefractive, and thermal nonlinearities.|$|E
