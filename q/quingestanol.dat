50|$|<b>Quingestanol</b> acetate (INN, USAN) (brand names Demovis, Pilomin, Riglovis, Unovis), {{also known}} as {{norethisterone}} acetate 3-cyclopentyl enol ether, is a steroidal progestin of the 19-nortestosterone group with additional weak androgenic and estrogenic activity which is used as an oral, once-a-month, or postcoital hormonal contraceptive. It is a prodrug of norethisterone, with both <b>quingestanol</b> and norethisterone acetate serving as intermediates in the transformation. The drug was patented in 1963 and marketed in Italy in 1972.|$|E
50|$|Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera) entered {{clinical}} use and became widely marketed, largely superseding the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone esters. A variety of analogues of medroxyprogesterone acetate, such as chlormadinone acetate, cyproterone acetate, and megestrol acetate, were subsequently developed and introduced as well. Progestogen esters {{of other groups}} of progestins have also been introduced, including the 19-norprogesterone derivatives gestonorone caproate, segesterone acetate (nestorone), nomegestrol acetate, and norgestomet (11β-methyl-17α-acetoxy-19-norprogesterone), and the 19-nortestosterone derivatives etynodiol diacetate, norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, and <b>quingestanol</b> acetate.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and <b>quingestanol</b> acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include desogestrel, etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Although esters of steroidal androgens and estrogens are {{generally}} inactive themselves {{and act as}} prodrugs, the same is not true for many progestogen esters. For instance, esters of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivatives, such as hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate, are highly active themselves (and in fact far more active than their unesterified forms) and are not prodrugs, forming little or none of their parent compounds (in the cases of the examples given, hydroxyprogesterone, medroxyprogesterone, and cyproterone, respectively). On the other hand, esters of 19-nortestosterone derivatives such as etynodiol diacetate, norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, and <b>quingestanol</b> acetate are all prodrugs.|$|E
