30|$|The method {{adopted by}} Machado and Mata (2005) {{as well as}} Melly (2005) is to {{estimate}} counterfactual income distribution {{on the basis of}} conditional <b>quantiles,</b> but the elemental rate of returns estimated by conditional <b>quantiles</b> is only a function of conditional <b>quantiles.</b> <b>Quantiles</b> are nonlinear functions of the variables of characteristics, thus the rate of returns is not the result of the direct influence on the <b>quantiles</b> of incomes distribution by corresponding variables of characteristics. The RIF decomposition method developed by Firpo, et. al (2009) on the basis of unconditional quantiles’ regression enlarges the decomposition from average value to the whole salary distribution and replaces the regression of conditional <b>quantiles</b> through unconditional <b>quantiles,</b> in order to decompose the characteristics’ gap and the structural gaps of elemental rate of returns to the variable of various characteristics.|$|R
50|$|A rankit plot {{is a kind}} of Q-Q plot - it plots {{the order}} {{statistics}} (<b>quantiles)</b> of the sample against certain <b>quantiles</b> (the rankits) of the assumed normal distribution. Q-Q plots may use other <b>quantiles</b> for the normal distribution, however.|$|R
25|$|In using {{a normal}} {{probability}} plot, the quantiles one uses are the rankits, the <b>quantile</b> {{of the expected}} value of the order statistic of a standard normal distribution.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, z'x has a {{slightly}} different interpretation in the formula below: it has its ordinary meaning of 'the xth <b>quantile</b> of the standard normal distribution', rather than being a shorthand for 'the (1 - x)-th quantile'.|$|E
25|$|For {{the normal}} distribution, {{the lack of}} an {{analytical}} expression for the corresponding <b>quantile</b> function means that other methods (e.g. the Box–Muller transform) may be preferred computationally. It is often the case that, even for simple distributions, the inverse transform sampling method can be improved on: see, for example, the ziggurat algorithm and rejection sampling. On the other hand, it is possible to approximate the <b>quantile</b> function of the normal distribution extremely accurately using moderate-degree polynomials, and in fact the method of doing this is fast enough that inversion sampling is now the default method for sampling from a normal distribution in the statistical package R.|$|E
30|$|Finally, in Group E {{we present}} {{countries}} {{with a total}} difference which is roughly constant across <b>quantiles</b> (e.g. Latvia), or with a positive difference and a positive slope across <b>quantiles</b> (Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania).

For Latvia, despite the constant difference across <b>quantiles,</b> the difference in coefficients (unexplained) is much higher at the lowest <b>quantiles.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{approach}} used by Machado and Mata (2005) and Melly (2005) is {{to estimate the}} distribution of counterfactual income {{on the basis of}} conditional <b>quantiles.</b> However, the elemental rate of returns for estimating the equations of conditional <b>quantiles</b> can only affect conditional <b>quantiles.</b> The differentials among conditional <b>quantiles</b> belong to those on income distribution with certain characteristics, while differentials among unconditional <b>quantiles</b> are the reflections of those among real income distribution. The <b>quantiles</b> of real income are not only affected by equations of conditional <b>quantiles,</b> thus the size of rate of returns is not a direct function of conditional variables. <b>Quantiles</b> are nonlinear functions comparing corresponding variables of characteristics with income distribution. Unconditional <b>quantiles</b> need to be estimated by integrals. Firpo (2009) uses the concepts of recentered influence function (RIF decomposition) in statistics to develop a decomposition method based on the regression of unconditional <b>quantiles.</b> This method enlarges the decomposition method of Oaxaca-Blinder, making decomposition of the differential on the unconditional distribution of income distribution possible. The core of decomposition is to estimate the income’s role in determining the characteristics of equations and rate of returns and to use the rate of returns in competition industries as well as the characteristics of monopoly industries to estimate the counterfactual income of monopoly industries, dividing the differentials of the income distribution in monopoly industries into two parts—reasonable characteristics’ effects and unreasonable structural effects.|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{the effects}} of worker {{characteristics}} on wages in Panama at different points of the conditional wage distribution are investigated. Public sector employment increases wages relatively more at lower <b>quantiles.</b> Within the public sector, employment in that sector increases wages of the median worker and reduces wage inequality. Presence of a labor union increases relatively more private sector wages at lower <b>quantiles.</b> Unions reduce wage inequality within the union private sector and increase average wages within that sector. In the public sector, {{the presence of a}} labor union increases wages of men at lower <b>quantiles</b> at a lower rate than in the private sector. Self-employment decreases wages at lower <b>quantiles</b> and increases wages at higher <b>quantiles.</b> Urban location affects wages in a U-shaped pattern as one moves from lower to higher <b>quantiles.</b> Rates of return to experience are higher for men at higher <b>quantiles.</b> Experience increases men's wage inequality.

25|$|Each {{of the two}} populations being {{compared}} should follow a normal distribution. This can be tested using a normality test, such as the Shapiro–Wilk or Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, {{or it can be}} assessed graphically using a normal <b>quantile</b> plot.|$|E
25|$|Here FX is the {{cumulative}} distribution function of X, and the integral is of the Riemann–Stieltjes kind. If random variable X has a probability density function fX, then the characteristic function is its Fourier transform with sign reversal in the complex exponential, and the last formula in parentheses is valid. QX(p) is the inverse {{cumulative distribution function}} of X also called the <b>quantile</b> function of X.|$|E
25|$|In general, many {{alternative}} functional forms {{can appear}} {{to follow a}} power-law form for some extent. Also, researchers usually {{have to face the}} problem of deciding whether or not a real-world probability distribution follows a power law. As a solution to this problem, Diaz proposed a graphical methodology based on random samples that allow visually discerning between different types of tail behavior. This methodology uses bundles of residual <b>quantile</b> functions, also called percentile residual life functions, which characterize many different types of distribution tails, including both heavy and non-heavy tails.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{class of}} <b>quantiles</b> {{lies at the}} heart of extreme-value theory and is one of the basic tools in risk management. The {{alternative}} family of expectiles is based on squared rather than absolute error loss minimization. It has recently been receiving a lot of attention in actuarial science, econometrics and statistical finance. Both <b>quantiles</b> and expectiles can be embedded in a more general class of M-quantiles by means of Lp optimization. These generalized Lp <b>quantiles</b> steer an advantageous middle course between ordinary <b>quantiles</b> and expectiles without sacrificing their virtues too much for p∈[1, 2]. In this paper, we investigate their estimation from the perspective of extreme values in the class of heavy-tailed distributions. We construct estimators of the intermediate Lp <b>quantiles</b> and establish their asymptotic normality in a dependence framework motivated by financial and actuarial applications, before extrapolating these estimates to the very far tails. We also investigate the potential of extreme Lp <b>quantiles</b> as a tool for estimating the usual <b>quantiles</b> and expectiles themselves.

25|$|There {{are various}} {{approaches}} to constructing random {{samples from the}} Student's t-distribution. The matter depends on whether the samples are required on a stand-alone basis, or are to be constructed by application of a <b>quantile</b> function to uniform samples; e.g., in the multi-dimensional applications basis of copula-dependency. In the case of stand-alone sampling, {{an extension of the}} Box–Muller method and its polar form is easily deployed. It has the merit that it applies equally well to all real positive degrees of freedom, ν, while many other candidate methods fail if ν is close to zero.|$|E
25|$|In linear regression, the {{relationships}} are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. Most commonly, the conditional mean of y given {{the value of}} X {{is assumed to be}} an affine function of X; less commonly, the median or some other <b>quantile</b> of the conditional distribution of y given X is expressed as a linear function of X. Like all forms of regression analysis, linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of y given X, rather than on the joint probability distribution of y and X, which is the domain of multivariate analysis.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{computing}} a p-value {{requires a}} null hypothesis, a test statistic (together with deciding whether the researcher is performing a one-tailed test or a two-tailed test), and data. Even though computing the test statistic on given data may be easy, computing the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis, and then computing its {{cumulative distribution function}} (CDF) is often a difficult problem. Today, this computation is done using statistical software, often via numeric methods (rather than exact formulae), {{but in the early}} and mid 20th century, this was instead done via tables of values, and one interpolated or extrapolated p-values from these discrete values. Rather than using a table of p-values, Fisher instead inverted the CDF, publishing a list of values of the test statistic for given fixed p-values; this corresponds to computing the <b>quantile</b> function (inverse CDF).|$|E
