5|$|The Supreme Court {{directed}} {{the circuit court}} for the District of New Jersey to grant Jackalow a new trial. The Court held that, while the trial court should determine {{the description of the}} boundaries of New York and Connecticut, the ascertainment of their actual boundaries, and the application of those boundaries to the crime in <b>question,</b> <b>should</b> have been a question of fact for the jury. Jackalow was not retried and was released.|$|E

And the decision of the supreme court, and their order in the premises, shall be remitted to the circuit court, and be there entered of record, and shall have effect according to the nature of the said judgment and order: Provided, that nothing herein contained shall prevent the cause from proceeding, if, in the opinion of the court, farther proceedings can be had without prejudice to the merits: and provided also, that imprisonment shall not be allowed, nor punishment in any case be inflicted, where the judges of the said court are divided in opinion upon the question touching said imprisonment or punishment.|$|E

5000|$|Survey {{researchers}} should carefully construct {{the order of}} questions in a questionnaire. For questionnaires that are self-administered, the most interesting <b>questions</b> <b>should</b> be {{at the beginning of}} the questionnaire to catch the respondent’s attention, while demographic <b>questions</b> <b>should</b> be near the end. Contrastingly, if a survey is being administered over the telephone or in person, demographic <b>questions</b> <b>should</b> be administered {{at the beginning of the}} interview to boost the respondent’s confidence. Another reason to be mindful of question order may cause a survey response effect in which one question may affect how people respond to subsequent questions as a result of priming.|$|R
50|$|Leading <b>questions</b> <b>should</b> {{not be used}} on {{the direct}} {{examination}} of a witness except as may be necessary to develop the witness' testimony.

25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic.

25|$|Previously, {{under section}} 56A of the Subordinate Courts Act ("SCA"), when a {{constitutional}} question arose in proceedings before the Subordinate Courts, the Courts could refer {{the question to}} the High Court and, meanwhile, stay the proceedings.

Public Prosecutor (2008), the High Court held that the Subordinate Courts may decide such questions where the relevant constitutional principles have already been set out by superior courts. Where the principles have not been decided, the <b>question</b> <b>should</b> be referred to the High Court.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the February Revolution in Russia, Finland received a new Senate, and a coalition Cabinet with the same power distribution as the Finnish Parliament. Based on the general election in 1916, the Social Democrats had a small majority, and the Social Democrat Oskari Tokoi became prime minister. The new Senate was willing to cooperate with the Provisional government of Russia, but no agreement was reached. Finland considered the personal union with Russia to be over after the dethroning of the Tsar—although the Finns had de facto recognized the Provisional government as the Tsar's successor by accepting its authority to appoint a new Governor General and Senate. They expected the Tsar's authority to be transferred to Finland's Parliament, which the Provisional government refused, suggesting instead that the <b>question</b> <b>should</b> be settled by the Russian Constituent Assembly.|$|E

Research <b>questions</b> <b>should</b> be meaningful, interesting, and challenging for the students, providing them with opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge, skills, and abilities and also encouraging them to exercise their critical and creative thinking (Chin and Kayalvizhi 2002). To answer the research questions, they must be appropriate to the student’s cognitive developmental level and the procedures should be accessible and manageable to the student (Keys 1998). Students’ research <b>questions</b> <b>should</b> be investigable within the limitations of time and materials. The inquiry process that is required to answer research <b>questions</b> <b>should</b> not be too expensive, complicated, or dangerous to perform (Chin and Kayalvizhi 2002).

25|$|On April 28, 2008, at Amway Arena, the Magic {{eliminated}} the Raptors with a 4–1 series {{victory in the}} first round. It was the first playoff series victory for the Magic in 12 years after 6 straight first round exits. The run of success didn't last long as they fell 4–1 to the experienced Detroit Pistons in the second round. With the Magic already down in the series, controversy erupted after the Pistons' Game 2 victory. At {{the conclusion of the}} 3rd quarter, Chauncey Billups of the Pistons made a three-point shot giving the Pistons a three-point lead. However, the clock had stopped just as the play began. NBA rules prohibit officials from using instant replay or any timing device to determine how much time has elapsed when a clock malfunctions, nor is a replay allowed to be viewed {{from the time of the}} malfunction to when the play ends, when the game clock has not expired. Because of the rule, the officials then estimated that the play took 4.6 seconds, and because there were 5.1 seconds remaining when play began, the field goal was allowed to be counted. The NBA later admitted that the play actually took 5.7 seconds and the basket in <b>question</b> <b>should</b> not have counted. The Pistons went on to win Game 2. The Magic were able to win Game 3, with the Pistons' Chauncey Billups out for most of the game with an injury, but were unable to take advantage of his absence and defeat the Pistons in Games 4 and 5, which ended the Magic's playoff run in 2008.|$|E

500|$|Samuel Johnson {{pointed out}} that an appeal to {{conscience}} should not allow the law to bring unjust suffering upon another. Conscience, according to Johnson, {{was nothing more than}} a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided; in questions of simple unperplexed morality, conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted. But before conscience can conclusively determine what morally should be done, he thought that the state of the <b>question</b> <b>should</b> be thoroughly known.

500|$|Francis tried {{a variety}} of methods to raise money, but {{concentrated}} on a lawsuit against Charles III, Duke of Bourbon. [...] The Duke of Bourbon had received the majority of his holdings through his marriage to Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon, who had died shortly {{before the start of the}} war. Louise of Savoy, Suzanne's sister and the king's mother, insisted that the territories in <b>question</b> <b>should</b> pass to her because of her closer kinship to the deceased. [...] Francis was confident that seizing the disputed lands would improve his own financial position sufficiently to continue the war and began to confiscate portions of them in Louise's name. Bourbon, angered by this treatment and increasingly isolated at court, began to make overtures to Charles V to betray the French king.|$|E
500|$|Guidance as to {{the scope}} of {{fundamental}} rules of natural justice was provided in Haw Tua Tau. First, the Privy Council said that rules of natural justice are not stagnant and may change with the times. Secondly, they {{should be considered in}} the local context, in light of the entire system as a whole and {{from the perspective of the}} people operating the system. Further, in order to satisfy the rules of natural justice, the law in <b>question</b> <b>should</b> not be [...] "obviously unfair". In its view, under a system of justice in which the court is invested with partly inquisitorial functions, compelling an accused to answer questions put to him by a judge cannot be regarded as contrary to natural justice. The Court of Appeal later ruled in Public Prosecutor v. Mazlan bin Maidun (1992) that the privilege against self-incrimination was not a fundamental rule of natural justice, and thus not a constitutional right.|$|E
500|$|The US National Kidney Foundation {{said they}} were [...] "deeply {{concerned}} about recent allegations regarding the procurement of organs and tissues through coercive or exploitative practices" [...] and that [...] "any act which calls the ethical practice of donation and transplantation into <b>question</b> <b>should</b> be condemned by the worldwide transplantation community." [...] A 2008 petition signed by 140 Canadian physicians urged the Canadian Government to [...] "issue travel advisories warning Canadians that organ transplants in China are sourced almost entirely from non-consenting people, whether prisoners sentenced to death or Falun Gong practitioners". Canadian Member of Parliament Borys Wrzesnewskyj, [...] {{based on the findings}} of the Kilgour–Matas report, introduced a 2008 bill that would make it illegal for Canadians to get an organ transplant abroad if the organ was taken from an unwilling victim.

500|$|In June 1952, two lecturers in {{veterinary}} {{science at}} the University of Sydney, Doug Blood and Jim Steel, {{wrote a letter to}} the Australian Veterinary Journal complaining of their university's placement of animal husbandry as a subordinate topic within veterinary science. [...] They argued that the field of animal husbandry included [...] "the procurement of maximum production from the available animals, compatible with their continued health and the maintenance of the natural resources of the land on which they live" [...] and was worthy of its own profession. [...] McClymont saw the letter and responded with his own missive to the journal in June 1953. [...] In his letter, McClymont opined that the field in <b>question</b> <b>should</b> instead be called [...] "animal production" [...] and that it should, [...] "be defined as the integration of animal husbandry and agronomy (the science of pasture and crop production), or in more general terms, manipulation of the soil-plant-animal complex, for the purpose of economic production of animal products." [...] He added that the university-level training in the field should include, [...] "extension work, research, and commercial applications." [...] McClymont concluded that university graduates in such a field of study would be prepared to blend veterinary (animal) and agricultural (plant) production sciences to optimize farm animal output.|$|E
