2500|$|The Younger Lady is the {{informal}} name {{given to a}} mummy discovered in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, in tomb KV35 by archeologist Victor Loret in 1898.. p100. Thames & Hudson. 1997. (Reprint) [...] Through recent DNA tests this mummy {{has been identified as}} the mother of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun, and a daughter of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye. The mummy also has been given the designation KV35YL ("YL" [...] for [...] "Younger Lady") and 61072, p.117 Duckworth Publishers, 2000 and currently resides in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Early speculation was that this mummy was the remains of Queen Nefertiti, which remains plausible, but DNA tests have not confirmed this and <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> possibility remain.|$|E
2500|$|Critics' {{reviews of}} From the Sky Down were mixed. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film an {{enthusiastic}} review, describing it as [...] "one {{of the most}} transcendent close-up looks at {{the process of creating}} rock & roll I've ever seen." [...] In his opinion, the film was a [...] "stirring testament to what it really means when four people in this world can create magical things because they band together." [...] Hank Steuver of The Washington Post called it an [...] "intriguing" [...] documentary that [...] "becomes a revealing and even enlightening meditation on the mystery of why some bands stay together and some don't." [...] The reviewer said the film is [...] "refreshingly blunt and beautifully assembled" [...] and praised Guggenheim for asking the band tough <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> period in their history. Brad Wheeler of The Globe and Mail gave the film a three-out-of-four star rating, calling it an [...] "essential companion piece" [...] to the reissue of Achtung Baby. Wheeler wrote that [...] "the process of U2 dreaming itself a new fashion while struggling to get its joy back is tightly and adroitly explored". Radio broadcaster Alan Cross wrote that the viewer will [...] "come out with a new appreciation of {{what it takes to be}} U2". Cross enjoyed the scenes in which the band revisit old DAT tapes demonstrating the evolution of the songs [...] "Mysterious Ways" [...] and [...] "One", along with the animated scenes. Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that the documentary is not a [...] "complete record" [...] of Achtung Babys conception, but that it [...] "offers fans a rare glimpse at the process behind U2's music, and for non-fans, it attempts to set a context in which they can appreciate what it is that U2 accomplished". Like other reviewers, he highlighted the scene in which the band revisits the recording of [...] "One" [...] as one of the film's most important. McWeeny ended his review by saying, [...] "This may not be everything I wanted from the movie, but it's solid, and the glimpse we get of real creative alchemy is impressive, indeed." ...|$|E

60|$|He was gloomy at first; grudged me, I think, {{every moment}} {{that was to}} be mine at Lyme Regis.

6000|$|Why, {{that simple}} old Laxart sat {{up there and}} droned out the most tedious and empty tale one ever heard, and neither he nor Papa D'Arc ever gave a thought to the badness of the {{etiquette}} of it, or ever suspected that that foolish tale was anything but dignified and valuable history. There was not an atom of value in it; and whilst they thought it distressing and pathetic, {{it was in fact}} not pathetic at all, but actually ridiculous. At least it seemed so to me, and it seems so yet. Indeed, I know it was, because it made Joan laugh; and the more sorrowful it got the more it made her laugh; and the Paladin said that he could have laughed himself if she had not been there, and Noel Rainguesson said the same. It was about old Laxart going to a funeral there at Domremy two or three weeks back. He had spots all over his face and hands, and he got Joan to rub some healing ointment on them, and while she was doing it, and comforting him, and trying to say pitying things to him, he told her how it happened. And first he asked her if she remembered that black bull calf that she left behind when she came away, and she said indeed she did, and he was a dear, and she loved him so, and was he well?--and just drowned him in <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> creature. And {{he said it was a}} young bull now, and very frisky; and he was to bear a principal hand at a funeral; and she said, [...] "The bull?" [...] and he said, [...] "No, myself"; but said the bull did take a hand, but not because of his being invited, for he wasn't; but anyway he was away over beyond the Fairy Tree, and fell asleep on the grass with his Sunday funeral clothes on, and a long black rag on his hat and hanging down his back; and when he woke he saw by the sun how late it was, and not a moment to lose; and jumped up terribly worried, and saw the young bull grazing there, and thought maybe he could ride part way on him and gain time; so he tied a rope around the bull's body to hold on by, and put a halter on him to steer with, and jumped on and started; but it was all new to the bull, and he was discontented with it, and scurried around and bellowed and reared and pranced, and Uncle Laxart was satisfied, and wanted to get off and go by the next bull or some other way that was quieter, but he didn't dare try; and it was getting very warm for him, too, and disturbing and wearisome, and not proper for Sunday; but by and by the bull lost all his temper, and went tearing down the slope with his tail in the air and blowing in the most awful way; and just in the edge of the village he knocked down some beehives, and the bees turned out and joined the excursion, and soared along in a black cloud that nearly hid those other two from sight, and prodded them both, and jabbed them and speared them and spiked them, and made them bellow and shriek, and shriek and bellow; and here they came roaring through the village like a hurricane, and took the funeral procession right in the center, and sent that section of it sprawling, and galloped over it, and the rest scattered apart and fled screeching in every direction, every person with a layer of bees on him, and not a rag of that funeral left but the corpse; and finally the bull broke for the river and jumped in, and when they fished Uncle Laxart out he was nearly drowned, and his face looked like a pudding with raisins in it. And then he turned around, this old simpleton, and looked a long time in a dazed way at Joan where she had her face in a cushion, dying, apparently, and says: ...|$|E

5000|$|Over the years, the New London School {{explosion}} received {{relatively little}} attention, given {{the magnitude of}} the event.

50|$|This {{result has}} had many {{important}} extensions. It can be recast {{to read that}} a certain natural morphism, the period mapping, from the moduli space of curves of a fixed genus, to a moduli space of abelian varieties, is injective (on geometric points). Generalizations are in two directions. Firstly, to geometric <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> morphism, for example the local Torelli theorem. Secondly, to other period mappings. A case that has been investigated deeply is for K3 surfaces (by Vik. S. Kulikov, Pyatetskii-Shapiro, Shafarevich and Bogomolov) and hyperkähler manifolds (by Verbitsky, Markman and Huybrechts).|$|E
