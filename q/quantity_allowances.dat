40|$|Recently, the Navy {{instituted a}} new model (known as. 5 FLSIP Plus) for {{determining}} the <b>allowance</b> <b>quantities</b> for shipboard spare parts inventories; and as a result, {{is now in the}} process of re-stocking ship's storerooms using the new inventory allowance list. The Navy has estimated the amount of savings from this allowance change by developing a cost savings model. This thesis involves evaluation of the cost savings model. It evaluates the reapplication savings estimates projected by the cost savings model by focusing on the actual experience of one ship during its conversion to the new spare parts <b>allowance</b> <b>quantities.</b> Using data developed by Ships Parts Control Center, a thorough analysis and explanation of the Navy's cost savings model is presented. Using the data generated by the Integrated Logistics Overhaul team during the ship's overhaul, a methodology for comparing components of the model's projected reapplication savings is developed. Potential explanations and justifications for deviations between actual and projected results are provided. The results should provide an approach for improving the accuracy of cost savings projections of future inventory model conversions.

40|$|The “Climate {{action and}} {{renewable}} energy package” proposed by the European Commission {{in the beginning of}} 2008 suggests auctioning as basic principle for allocation for the upcoming third trading phase of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme that runs from 2013 to 2020. Overall, it is estimated that at least two third of the total <b>quantity</b> of <b>allowances</b> will be auctioned in 2013, to be increased to 100 % by 2020. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of a properly chosen auction design as the significantly higher auction share, compared to the past and current trading phase, is expected to yield a thin secondary market for CO 2 allowances. We elaborate main criteria that a viable auction design is supposed to fulfil and propose a specific auction design for the third trading phase. The auction we recommend is a simultaneous dynamic uniform double auction...|$|R

40|$|The EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) for CO 2 -emissions from {{energy and}} {{industry}} installations reflects {{a paradigm shift}} towards market-based in-struments for environmental policy in the EU. The centerpieces of the EU ETS are National Allocation Plans (NAPs), which individual Member States (MS) de-sign for each phase. NAPs state the total <b>quantity</b> of <b>allowances</b> available in each period (ET-budget) and determine how MS allocate allowances to individ-ual installations. The NAPs thus govern investments and innovation in energy efficient technologies and the energy sector. In terms of distribution, they prede-termine winners and losers. In this paper we analyze and evaluate 25 NAPs submitted to the European Commission (EC) for phase 2 (2008 - 2012) of the EU ETS. At the macro level, we assess whether the submitted ET-budgets are stringent, and whether they imply a cost-efficient split of the required emission reductions between the EU ETS sectors (energy and industry) and the remaining sectors (transportation...|$|R

40|$|The European Union’s (EU) {{emissions}} trading scheme (ETS) started on 01 January 2005. The ETS covers CO 2 emissions from large emitters {{in the power}} and heat generation industry and selected energy-intensive industrial sectors. The EU member states have developed national allocation plans (NAP) stating the total <b>quantity</b> of <b>allowances</b> and how they propose to allocate them. This study analyzes available NAPs to examine whether EU countries require less from its ETS sectors than its non-ETS sectors and whether some ETS sectors have been favored in the allocation. Allocations are compared against three reference points (projected emissions, historical emissions and a calculated Kyoto Protocol CO 2 target). The NAP analysis indicates that the relative generous allocations are {{likely to result in}} minor steps towards meeting the countries’ commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Available data indicates that sectors exposed to international competition have been favored in terms of allocations. Therefore, non-ETS sectors in many countries have to substantially reduce their emissions to meet the Kyoto targets unless JI and CDM are used extensively...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{searches}} and evaluates {{the factors that}} determine the outcome of competition between European emissions exchanges trading different kinds of emissions allowances. Since {{the beginning of the}} scheme in 2005, various exchanges have listed these allowances as traded products offering different kinds contracts for them. Currently, one of these exchanges dominates the market by approximately 90 % market share in all exchange traded emissions contracts. Classical theories on competition suggest that the market outcome is mostly determined by prices (the cost of trading), production costs and <b>quantities.</b> As <b>allowance</b> holders are allowed to trade anywhere at will, according to common theories they should trade where-ever it is the most inexpensive. Yet, traders also seek for high liquidity that ensures fast execution of orders. It seems like that the trader specific attributes might determine what different aspect she seeks from an exchange, and makes the choice accordingly. This might lead to a situation where some traders choose to use local exchanges as others find it more profitable to use international exchanges – often located in world financial centers – that might offer higher liquidity, wider product scope or greater trader heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|From an {{analysis}} of the available national allocation plans for the first period (2005 - 2007) of the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), it can be inferred that (i) the total allocation to installations covered under the EU ETS is rather generous and (ii) most EU Member States ban the transfer of allowances (banking) into the second period (2008 - 2012). In this article, we explore the cost-efficiency issues associated with such a generous allocation of allowances to the trading sectors in combination with the ban on banking. It is argued that allocation to the trading sectors is higher than implied by a cost-minimization approach. Moreover, due to the reduced level of flexibility, a ban on banking increases overall compliance costs. In addition, the results of a simulation game conducted with real company participants and with a student control group suggest that a generous primary allocation in the first phase combined with a ban on banking also leads to a cost-inefficient choice of abatement measures within periods. The results of the simulations are also consistent with the conjecture that forward markets and auctioning off a part of the total <b>quantity</b> of <b>allowances</b> result in more reliable price signals and more cost-efficient outcome...|$|R
40|$|The “American Power Act ” {{proposed}} by Sen. John Kerry and Sen. Joseph Lieberman {{would establish a}} broad-based U. S. cap-and-trade system. Using an input-output model we estimate the distributional cost of the cap-and-trade portions of the bill to households by income, age group, U. S. region and family type, {{as well as the}} value of various industry subsidies granted by the bill. In a typical year (2020), households would face a gross annual burden of $ 125. 9 billion per year or $ 1, 042 per household, with costs disproportionately borne by low-income households. On a net basis, the large <b>quantity</b> of <b>allowances</b> distributed freely to companies leads households in the top income quintile to benefit financially, redistributing to these households roughly $ 12. 3 billion per year from the bottom 80 percent of earners. Overall, we estimate the bill would reduce U. S. employment by roughly 522, 000 jobs in 2015, rising to over 5. 1 million jobs by 2050. Finally, we explore two theoretical issues: (1) we offer microeconomic evidence that shareholders rather than households are most likely to benefit from the bill’s free allowances to electricity and natural gas utilities; and (2) we show how the bill’...|$|R
40|$|Global {{efforts to}} prevent climate change has been a {{catalyst}} {{for the emergence of}} many innovative ideas to mitigate this phenomenon.

This work analyses the behaviour of firms and a relation between the European Union <b>Allowances</b> <b>quantity</b> and their price on the Czech market. Furthermore, possible consequences of the EU emission trading system policy on the Czech emission and energy market are analyzed. To do so, we develop equilibrium model which uses an innovative concept of the Cournot-Nash-Walras equilibrium. The model estimates 25 and 14 percent increase in emission allowances price between years 2014 - 2015, and 2014 - 2020, respectively. We also find that non-innovating firm can lose significant market share...|$|R
40|$|In December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, setting {{limits on}} the {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions of industrialized countries. The European Union agreed to reduce its emissions of GHG by 8 % during the period 2008 – 2012 in comparison to their 1990 levels. Subsequently, in a scheme known as “burden-sharing”, Portugal was allowed to increase its emissions by 27 % in the same period. Large industrial facilities are responsible for a significant share of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions and are object of a European Directive (2003 / 87 /EC) establishing the scheme for GHG emission allowance trading within the European Union, launched {{with the purpose of}} allowing the reduction of GHG emissions cost-effectively. According to the Directive, Member States shall develop a National Allocation Plan (NAP) stating the total <b>quantity</b> of <b>allowances</b> that each one intends to allocate and how it proposes to allocate them among the activities included in the trading scheme. In this work, an analysis of the Portuguese industry is performed, focused on the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions levels in the period 1990 – 2001 and on the estimation of the two parameters for the period 2002 – 2012, considering different economic growth scenarios and investments on energy reduction technologies. Results show that all the analysed sectors present a significant growth in CO 2 emissions, exceeding the limit established in the frame of the Kyoto Protocol, and that measures other than cost-effective energy technologies will have to be implemented...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the rules}} {{provided}} in the National Allocation Plans of the EU Member States (MS) for the first period (2005 - 2007) of the EU emission trading system (EU-ETS) {{with respect to their}} impact on energy efficiency and innovation and on technology variety. The allocation rules considered are total <b>quantity</b> of <b>allowances</b> allocated, allocation methods (auction versus grandfathering), rules for banking of left-over allowances into the second period (2008 - 2012), allocation to newcomers and closures of installations, and information about future allocation. Since the overall allocation appears rather generous, allowance prices are expected to be low, in particular since almost all MS prohibit banking into the second period. Thus, price-induced innovation effects will be weak. Similarly, the auction shares are too small to have any innovation effects. Closures result in a stop of further allocation, providing disincentives for innovation. In several MS these disincentives are softened because allowances may be transferred to new installations. However, new entrants typically receive allowances for free based on specific emissions and projected output. These specific values are either based on benchmarks for homogenous product groups or depend on best available technologies. In some countries a plethora of benchmarks within the same product categories threaten to thwart the flexibility provisions of the EU-ETS. Finally, future allocation rules are vastly unknown, amplifying the uncertainty about the benefits of new investments. In conclusion, existing allocation rules provide only modest incentives for innovation...|$|R

At the macro level, we assess whether the submitted ET-budgets are stringent, and whether they imply a cost-efficient split of the required emission reductions between the EU ETS sectors (energy and industry) and the remaining sectors (transportation, tertiary and households). Comparing the submitted ET-budgets with those already approved by the EC suggests that the EC's decisions significantly improved the effectiveness and economic efficiency of the EU ETS. But given the high share of Kyoto Mechanisms companies are allowed to use, the EU ETS is unlikely to require substantial emission reductions within the EU. At the micro level, we assess (across countries and phases) the allocation methods for existing and new installations, for closures and for clean technologies. A comparison of the NAPs for the second phase and the first phase (2005 - 2007) provides insights into the (limited) adaptability and flexibility of the scheme.

30|$|The EU Directive for {{the period}} 2013 – 2020 [8], as it was agreed in December 2008, aims at {{improving}} and extending the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system of the Community. Due to its broader nature, it adopts regulations for all sectors included {{in the system and}} very few aviation-specific rules. It is understood that most of the regulations for {{the first year of the}} inclusion of aviation into the EU-ETS which are described above will be further applied. However, the total <b>quantity</b> of emission <b>allowances</b> to be allocated to aircraft operators shall then be equivalent to only 95 % of the historical aviation emissions, multiplied by the number of years in the eight-year period. The use of the project based Kyoto instruments “Joint Implementation” and “Clean Development Mechanism” will be lowered significantly for aircraft operators. In the period 2013 until 2020, aircraft operators may use emission permits from “Joint Implementation” and “Clean Development Mechanism” only up to 1.5 % of the amount of allowances they are required to surrender per year (in 2012 : 15 %). However, purchasing emissions permits from stationary sources is possible without limitations.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis research effort involves {{a comparison between}} the actual repair parts demand data generated by the forklifts at Naval Supply Center, Oakland, California, during calendar year 1975 and the <b>allowance</b> <b>quantities</b> of the applicable allowance parts lists (API's). The comparison is accomplished from three perspectives: the first perspective evaluates the degree of correlation between line items demanded and the line items appearing in the APL's; the second perspective provides a projection {{of the effect of}} increased forklift operating hours on the quantities demanded among those demands for line items allowed by the APL's; and the third perspective identifies those line items for which demand generated rendered the quantities demanded significantly different from the quantities allowed by the APL's. As a result of these comparisons and the low correlation between demand data and allowance projections, it is hypothesized that the crucial variable contributing to this low correlation is the low utilization of the equipments in terms of annual operating hours. The conclusion reached is that APL's for forklifts, as presently formulated, are a support planning document of dubious value in situations of low equipment utilization such as observed in this study.
