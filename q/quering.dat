40|$|Objectives: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) {{can cause}} serious complications such as nephropathy in long term. One {{of the factors}} of diabetic nephropathy pathogenesis is the increase of oxidant stress. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the effect of quercetin, a powerful antioxidant agent, on renal functions in streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus and the change in balance of oxidant-antioxidant capacity in this process. Methods: Five groups of rats were used: Control, DM 8 and 16 -week (DM 8, DM 16), DM 8 and 16 -week + quercetin (<b>QUER</b> 8, <b>QUER</b> 16). Rats in <b>QUER</b> 8 and <b>QUER</b> 16 were treated with IP quercetin (15 mg/kg/day) until the end of the experiment. Results: Malondialdehyte increased in the DM 8 and DM 16 groups. On the contrary, it decreased in the groups which were given quercetin. Accordingly, increase in NADPH oxidase activity, and decrease in superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in diabetic rats were determined. In the <b>QUER</b> 8 and <b>QUER</b> 16 groups, NADPH oxidase activity decreased while antioxidant enzyme activities increased. Functional kidney parameters were considerably corrupted in the diabetic rats. Sodium and water excretion via urine and plasma creatinine level in the <b>QUER</b> 16 group were lower than in the DM 16 group. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the administration of quercetin attenuated renal dysfunction and totally prevented the increase of kidney oxidant damage in DM...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Often astronomers of the Observatório Nacional {{are asked}} {{about how the}} shadow cast from a {{building}} or a tower to be built will impact crowded areas; in which way they would interfere with the wellfare by depriving population from sunlight. The same problem arises when agronomers plan areas for cultures when topographical accidents may cast shadows in a geographic region. My colleages usually answer these questions by delivering spherical trigonometry formulae and the sun equations of movement, and therefore they transfer the responsability of the conclusions back to the engineers and agronomers. What we didn?t realize is the possible and even probable difficulties that these professionals could be facing, since fundamental astronomy and astronomical object positioning knowledge is needed {{to figure out how}} the sun moves in the celestial sphere. Shadow projection and its mapping on a ground plan also requires specific knowledge. This paper intends to introduce solutions that will offer professionals, teachers and students conditions of better understanding this problem and, possibly, at least in some cases, bypass the need for <b>quering</b> astronomers...|$|E

Using XLink hyperlinks, a docu-ment can refer different portions {{of information in}} different documents into the Web. With XLink hyperlinks the XML documents in the Web can be investigated from querying point of view not just while browsing these docu-ments. There are few implementations regarding XLink recommendation and just two implementations regarding <b>quering</b> XML documents using XPath/XQuery expressions in presence of XLink hyperlinks. On the other side XPath/XQuery has many implementations and wide support from IT leaders in the world. In this paper it is shown another way of using XPath/XQuery to query XML documents in presence of hyperlinks. The paper shows a model and its implementation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to hypermedial computer aided architectural design environments. The concept is to create a whole CAAD hypermedia environment based on object oriented approach. This was probably a dream in the past but new technologies make this possible. To introduce the subject let us think to a system based on an object oriented environment, with hypermedia capabilities and dynamic creation of data structures, all these things may be managed by a single application using OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) technology provided by MS Windows. Some years ago we were waiting for a universal browser able to manage all kind of data and formats such as text, images, movies and sounds. Let us think to an object oriented file system, we can store all objects and save relations amongst them, then we can use a browsing or <b>quering</b> template to read and retrieve data. Three cases of study developed by Diset are discussed in this paper: HyperMedia Design Kit, De Architectura and On Line Architectural Sites Projects...|$|E
40|$|Peer data {{management}} systems (Pdms) {{consist of a}} dynamic set of autonomous and heterogeneous peers connected with schema mappings. Queries submitted at a peer are answered with data residing at that peer and by recursively passing the query along the mappings to neighboring peers. Due to massive redundancy in mapping paths from the <b>quering</b> peer to any peer in the network, Pdms {{tend to be very}} inefficient if the complete query result is to be computed. Additionally, information loss is cumulated along mapping paths due to selections and projections specified in the mappings. Users usually accept concessions on the completeness of query answers in large-scale data sharing settings. Our approach turns completeness into an optimization goal and thus trades off benefit and cost of query answering. To this end, we propose several strategies that guide peers in their decision about which further mappings the query should be sent. In effect, the peers prune mappings that are expected to contribute less data. To estimate the potential data contribution of mappings, we adopted self-tuning histograms for cardinality estimation. We developed techniques that ensure sufficient query feedback to adapt these statistics to massive changes in the Pdms...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{most of the}} {{companies}} have problems with sales information optimization due to large amount of sales‘ data. For this reason information technologies companies are always creating new applications of Business Intelligence or trying to renew the older one.

40|$|The {{integration}} of data-oriented (structural), behavioral and deductive aspects {{is necessary in}} next generation information systems. Therefore the deductive object-oriented database paradigm offers a very promising {{starting point for the}} implementation of these kinds of information systems. So far {{in the context of this}} paradigm a big problem has been the lack of a query language suitable to an ordinary end user. Typically in existing proposals for deductive object-oriented databases the user has to master well both logic-based rule formulation and object-oriented programming. In this paper we introduce a set of high-level <b>quering</b> primitives which increases the degree of declarativeness compared to deductive object-oriented query languges proposed so far. In terms of these primitives it is possible to offer for end users such application-specific concepts and structures whose interpretation is obvious to users but whose specification is too demanding for them. By combining these primitives in queries the user can integrate data-oriented, behavioral and deductive aspects with each other in a concept-oriented way. Our query language approach is based on the incorporation of deductive aspects to object-orientation. Among others this means that deductive aspects of objects are inherited in the specialization/generalization hierarchy like any other properties of objects...|$|E
40|$|The main {{question}} {{of this research}} is: What is the potential and performance of a geo-DBMS to structure, index, query and visualize spatiotemporal points clouds of moving objects? Some researchers have been developing spatiatemporal data structures. These structures have some disadvantages. For instance, the model made by Vazirgiannis and Wolfson is especially made for road networks and anoter data model (developed by Wolfson) is relatively complicated {{and can be used}} for objects that move freely in space like aircrafts. Some approaches have been the disadvantage that they a lot of redundant storage. To overcome these disadvantages, a new approach is introduced. Thi smodel could be used for every purpose that deals with moving point object data (this makes it generic) and it does noet contain any redundant storage. An efficient indexing method makes <b>quering</b> of the data in a DBMS faster. For many query tpes, indexing methods are available. In moving point object cases, most of these indexin gmethods are based on the R-tree. Often it is not known in advance whih queries are going to be done on a data set and which structure and which indexing methods are going to be chosen. So it needs to be investigated which indexing methods give the fastes access to the data. The main principle of this generix model is choosing a base table, from which, by using (materialized) views, three other data representations (based n different geometric data types) easily could be derived. In this way a set of four data representations is available for <b>quering.</b> These four data types are 2 D points, 3 D points, 2 D lines and 3 D lines. In the 2 D representations time is regarded as an attribute. From tbis set, many queries cold be formulated, like the objects speed, direction or acceleration. After the model is introduced, an efficient querying and indexing needs to be found. BEcause in Oracle 9 i Spatial only the 2 D and the 3 D R-tree are implemented, the only way to manipulate the efficiency of accessing the data by the user is by formulating efficient queries. To demonstrate that this generic model is fast and flexible, two chase studies have been done. In the first case, the data has been collected in advance and being analyzed afterwards. So, the data set is static. The second case deals with real-time data. The main conclusion is that the generic data model for storing moving point data in a geo-DBMS is flexible and efficient. The data can be accessed in a fast way, {{depending on the type of}} query and the moethod used for indexing. GIS technologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{is to add}} a new {{dimension}} to Internet-Searching and that is to apply semantic aspects towards it. An essential requirement of this work is one has to recognize the difference between what a user might say or do and what she or he actually meant or intended. In more simple words, “the search must be what user wish, not what he/she types”. <b>Quering</b> the search engine for any particular topic would retrieve the results from the internet and presented to the web users. Since there are large number of web pages on the internet and thus result obtained are also vast. User gets more than enough web links as a result produced by search engine and wastes their precious time in navigating through unwanted links, searching the needed one. The main {{reason for this is that}} the Search Engine do the indexing of the pages on the basis of text entered by user. In order to overcome this shortcoming we need to implement a method that will allow the user to find the relevant words, starting from the few words that they may actually know [5]. In other words, we need to focus on the semantic of words entered by user and for this purpose a new approach that is based on some algorithms which considers semantic aspects should be included. One of such technique for the semantic analysis is the Latent Semantic analysis and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: Cellular {{processes}} cause {{changes over}} time. Observing and measuring those {{changes over time}} allows insights into the how and why of regulation. The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by microarray technology. However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting time course data {{is still very much}} an issue under investigation. The inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance. Results: We propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for the horizontal dependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the prevalent errors and missing values. The HMMs are used within a model-based clustering framework. We are given a number of clusters, each represented by one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models. Partially supervised learning—adding groups of labeled data to the initial collection of clusters—is supported. A graphical user interface allows <b>quering</b> an expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic approach to automate determination of the number of clusters. We evaluate the method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets, and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves method...|$|E
40|$|As known, {{the most}} {{greater part of}} the systems GISs that come {{projected}} today {{have the ability to}} use for the data management the Geodatabases, or rather spatial database whose principal characteristic is that to model the geographical data using the object paradigm. Unfortunately such type of modeling, able to maintain the bank dates consistent and efficient, it is implemented in the various softwares GeoDB alone in the layer of representation (and with limited functionality), or of user interface; on the contrary, in data storage, you deals with DBMS servers using a relational approach. This choice not only implies an important fall in the system performances, but the representation inside a GIS of the contexts endowed with notable dynamism becomes complex, in fact in such cases the data management (population and <b>quering)</b> you must have effected to every level through operational interfaces endowed with a tall degree of abstraction. In consideration of these facts, we develop an alpha OODBMS server, named "Kosmos", oriented to GeoDatabases, differently from all other DBMS softwares. Kosmos making passes through a preliminary step in which we are going to define an algebraic structure and a rigorous formal model to describe GIS objects and functional operators acting on these objects. Kosmos, thanks to these characteristics, it allows a simple management and at the same efficient time of database geographical spatio-temporal, is for instance possible to effect some operations of geoprocessing (intersect, union, etc…) multi layers- multi temporal, tracking areale and to define some relationships spatio-temporal between features. Software design follows the Open Source philosophy; in particular, Kosmos is released under GPL license and anyone can take part in its coding. 1...|$|E
