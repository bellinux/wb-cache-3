40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{separate}} students with high causal attributions and low causal attributions of mainstream and religious sectors and to find out the effect of these causal attributions on students’ subsequent academic achievement. Sample of the study was 490 students of grade X from Rawalpindi and Islamabad districts of Pakistan. Out of these 490 students 260 belonged to mainstream schools and 230 came from religious schools. The design of study was causal comparative. The statistical techniques of frequency distribution, mean, standard <b>deviation,</b> median, <b>quartile</b> <b>deviations</b> and t-test were used for analysis. The main conclusion drawn from the study was that there was significant difference between the academic achievement of intrinsically motivated students with high causal attributions and that of extrinsically motivated students with low causal attributions thus confirming Weiner’s attribution theory. *Address for correspondence...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{remotely}} sensed {{images to}} map continuous biophysical variables, such as those related to terrestrial vegetation amount, sea surface temperature, and many other targets of NASA s Earth Observing System (EOS), includes variable, parametric, positional, spatial support and structural sources of uncertainty. A complete description of uncertainty {{will lead to a}} probability distribution at each location, allowing the exploration of the spatial dimension of uncertainty, that is, where the field is not well quantified. To achieve this purpose, convenient visualization tools are required. We have produced such a tool, called PDFVis, that facilitates the display of probability density functions (pdfs) on a per-grid-cell basis. The density estimate from Monte-Carlo generated realizations is interactively displayed as well as parametric and non-parametric summaries of the pdf field (such as mean, median, <b>quartiles,</b> standard <b>deviation,</b> number of modes, and locations of modes). Shaded surface renderings of pdfs along a transect can also be projected onto a plane. This tool will become more useful as richer descriptions of spatial uncertainty become available...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{inventory}} {{data were}} used to develop a stand-age-driven, stochastic predictor of unit-area, frequency-weighted lists of breast high tree diameters (DBH). The average of mean statistics from 40 -simulation prediction sets of an independent 78 -plot validation dataset differed from the observed validation means by 0. 5 cm for DBH, and by 12 trees/h for density. The 40 -simulation average of standard <b>deviation,</b> <b>quartile</b> range, maximum value and minimum value differed from the validation dataset, respectively, by 0. 3, 1. 3, 0. 6 and 1. 5 cm for DBH, and 10, 42, 29, and 54 trees/h for density. In addition, test statistics were also computed individually {{for each of the}} 40 single simulations of the 78 -plot validation dataset. In all cases, the test statistics supported the null hypothesis of no difference between simulated and observed DBH lists. When power of these hypothesis test statistics was set to 80 %, the calculated minimum detectable differences were still reasonably small at 2. 7 cm for mean DBH and 90 trees/h for stocking. Also, the shape and dispersion of simulated mean-DBH/density scatter graphs were similar to the same scatter graph from the observed, validation dataset...|$|R

The Excel tools that I use are histograms, mean, median, <b>quartiles,</b> and standard <b>deviation.</b> Correlation also can determine how dependent a response variable is to an explanatory variable. The correlation between year and average temperature was 0. 098 for July and - 0. 141 for December. This indicates a weak relationship between average temperature and year. The most likely average temperatures for July are ~ 74. 1 oF and ~ 33 oF for December. Some of our average temperatures might be outliers whcich affect mean, median, and standard deviation. With the outliers omitted, the mean and median values were the same for both months respectively, indicating a symmetric distribution. I also performed an analysis on decadal average temperatures for July and December. The error bars vary based on {{the spread of the}} data.

30|$|Statistical {{analyses}} were performed using the software R 3.1. 0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We first performed a descriptive analysis by computing the frequencies and the percents for categorial data; means or medians, standard <b>deviations,</b> <b>quartiles</b> and extreme values for continuous data. We also checked for the normality of the continuous data distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk tests. The univariate analysis was performed using two-tailed Student’s t test for continuous variables, Fisher and Chi-square tests for categorial variables or two-tailed Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon test when appropriate. The areas under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and their confidence interval (CI) were calculated using the method of DeLong. The optimal threshold value was set for each ROC curve through the Youden index (corresponding to the maximum of the sum sensitivity + specificity). CIs for sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated by bootstrap (2000 bootstrap samples). The most relevant variables including urine output, serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urea and creatinine generation rate and 24 -h urinary urea and creatinine obtained by logistic regression were included in multivariate models. The urea and creatinine kinetics {{in the two groups}} of patients were modeled using mixed models. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R

We also checked for the normality of the continuous data distribution using the Shapiro–Wilks tests. We compared septic to non-septic patients and patients with and without sCAP for Presepsin, CRP and PCT measurements. The univariate analysis was performed using two-tailed Student’s t test, or two-tailed Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon’s test when appropriate. Results were adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s method. Levels of significance for all tests were set at p <  0.05. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of Presepsin and PCT for the diagnosis of sepsis and pneumonia were calculated using final diagnosis categorization based on clinical data, clinical scores and routinely used biomarkers levels. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for each of the biomarkers, and their diagnostic performance for sepsis and for other pathological condition was compared. The optimal threshold value was set for each ROC curve through the Youden Index (corresponding to the maximum of the sum “sensibility + specificity”). Mortality was displayed as Kaplan–Meier (log-rank test) plots according to the quartiles of Presepsin levels.|$|R

Parametric or nonparametric tests were used {{according to the}} distribution of variables. Differences in categorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-square or the Fisher exact test or the McNemar test for matched patients, as appropriate. Continuous variables were compared using the Student’s t test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the corresponding paired tests for matched patients, as appropriate. The relationship between the variable “no ARDS risk factor” and hospital mortality was assessed by the Kaplan–Meier method (patients were considered alive at day- 60 if they were discharged alive before day- 60) and by logistic regression. In-ICU and hospital mortality were compared between propensity-matched ARDS patients having one or more common risk factor identified or not. Covariates presumed {{to be associated with}} the presence of one or more ARDS risk factor or with hospital mortality were included in a multivariable analysis with “identification of ≥ 1 ARDS risk factor” as the dependent variable to determine the propensity score of this variable for each patient (see Additional file 1). Propensity score methods are usually used to reduce the bias in estimating treatments effects and the likelihood of confounding when analyzing non-randomized observational data [9]. In the current study, we used a propensity score method in order to assess the impact of the lack of ARDS risk factor on patient outcomes. Patients with one or more identified risk factor were thus matched with other patients according to the propensity score, using a 1 : 1 matching procedure. The relative change in the hazard of the ICU and hospital mortality were then assessed by regressing survival on the identification of a risk factor by using a univariate Cox proportional hazards model accounting for the matched nature of the sample.

ObjectivesThis study investigated whether CsA improved ST-segment resolution in a randomized, multicenter phase II study. MethodsThe authors randomly assigned 410 patients from 31 cardiac care units, age 63 ± 12 years, with large ST-segment elevation MI within 6 h of symptom onset, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) flow grade 0 to 1 in the infarct-related artery, {{and committed to}} primary percutaneous coronary intervention, to 2. 5 mg/kg intravenous CsA (n = 207) or control (n = 203) groups. The primary endpoint was incidence of ≥ 70 % ST-segment resolution 60 min after TIMI flow grade 3. Secondary endpoints included high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) on day 4, left ventricular (LV) remodeling, and clinical events at 6 -month follow-up. ResultsTime from symptom onset to first antegrade flow was 180 ± 67 min; a median of 5 electrocardiography leads showed ST-segment <b>deviation</b> (<b>quartile</b> [Q] 1 to Q 3 : 4 to 6); 49. 8 % of MIs were anterior. ST-segment resolution ≥ 70 % was found in 52. 0 % of CsA patients and 49. 0 % of controls (p = 0. 55). Median hs-cTnT on day 4 was 2, 160 (Q 1 to Q 3 : 1, 087 to 3, 274) ng/l in CsA and 2, 068 (1, 117 to 3, 690) ng/l in controls (p = 0. 85). The 2 {{groups did not differ}} in LV ejection fraction on day 4 and at 6 months. Infarct site did not influence CsA efficacy. There were no acute allergic reactions or nonsignificant excesses of 6 -month mortality (5. 7 % CsA vs. 3. 2 % controls, p = 0. 17) or cardiogenic shock (2. 4 % CsA vs. 1. 5 % controls, p = 0. 33). ConclusionsIn the CYCLE (CYCLosporinE A in Reperfused Acute Myocardial Infarction) trial, a single intravenous CsA bolus just before primary percutaneous coronary intervention had no effect on ST-segment resolution or hs-cTnT, and did not improve clinical outcomes or LV remodeling up to 6 months.

40|$|Fuzzy models {{generally}} {{provide an}} output characterised by vagueness, which is expressed through a solution fuzzy set. In many applications, {{the response of}} the model is transformed in a crisp value through some defuzzification methods for solution fuzzy region, thus losing its fuzziness. Only to preserve a few indications of its vagueness, some indices summarizing the spread of the output membership function could be used to associate them with the crisp output, such as its standard deviation, the <b>quartile</b> <b>deviation,</b> the coefficients of skewness and kurtosis. The behaviour of such indices is examined in a large number of possible, though unlikely, output solutions and in an application of a fuzzy inference system for evaluating university teaching activity. The results seem to suggest that the 20 - 80 mid-percentile range could be a good measure of the vagueness dispersion, while the coefficient of skewness could provide a useful indication about the asymmetry of the solution's shape. Moreover, a rough estimate of dispersion was obtained from a triangle approximating the solution fuzzy region because the results were straightforwardly deduced from formulae involving the abscissae of its vertices. The results generally appear to underestimate the true values of the standard deviations; the 15 - 85 mid-percentile range of the approximating triangle seemed to be a more suitable rough appraisal of fuzzy output dispersion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{specific}} formula for the purpose of assessing skeletal age in a sample of Italian growing infants and children by measuring carpals and epiphyses of radio and ulna. A sample of 332 X-rays of left hand-wrist bones (130 boys and 202 girls), aged between 1 and 16 years, was analyzed retrospectively. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was applied to study how sex affects the growth of the ratio Bo/Ca in the boys and girls groups. The regression model, describing age as a linear function of sex and the Bo/Ca ratio for the new Italian sample, yielded the following formula: Age = - 1. 7702 + 1. 0088 g + 14. 8166 (Bo/Ca). This model explained 83. 5 % of total variance (R 2 = 0. 835). The median of the absolute values of residuals (observed age minus predicted age) was - 0. 38, with a <b>quartile</b> <b>deviation</b> of 2. 01 and a standard error of estimate of 1. 54. A second sample test of 204 Italian children (108 girls and 96 boys), aged between 1 and 16 years, was used to evaluate the accuracy of the specific regression model. A sample paired t-test was used to analyze the mean differences between the skeletal and chronological age. The mean error for girls is 0. 00 and the estimated age is slightly underestimated in boys with a mean error of - 0. 30 years. The standard deviations are 0. 70 years for girls and 0. 78 years for boys. The obtained results indicate that there is a high relationship between estimated and chronological ages...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer {{mortality}} in most countries. The adrenal glands are common sites of metastatic lung cancer as approximately 40 % of subjects with stage 4 bronchogenic carcinoma have adrenal metastases. The prevalence of biochemical hypoadrenalism is, however, remarkably poorly documented. Objectives. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of primary hypoadrenalism, as defined by a subnormal cortisol response to the 250 µg adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, in patients with stage 3 and 4 lung cancer. Methods. Thirty patients with stage 3 and 4 bronchogenic carcinoma were prospectively recruited from the bronchus clinic. Demographic data and electrolytes were recorded and each patient had a 250 µg ACTH stimulation test to determine the prevalence of overt adrenal insufficiency, defined as a + 30 minute cortisol of less than 550 nmol/l. Results. The median age and <b>quartile</b> <b>deviation</b> was 62 (10) years and the median basal cortisol was 429. 5 (321) nmol/l. The median peak cortisol was 828. 5 (342) nmol/l (range 536 - 1 675 nmol/l). Twenty-eight patients (93. 3 %) had an appropriate rise of cortisol to greater than 550 nmol/l following 250 µg ACTH stimulation. Two patients (6. 7 %) had mild primary adrenal failure with a peak cortisol between 500 and 550 nmol/l associated with a raised plasma ACTH concentration (131. 4 and 10. 5 pmol/l, normal 2. 2 - 10 pmol/l). Twenty-eight patients (92. 9 %) were normonatraemic, while the two hyponatraemic patients had biochemical evidence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Conclusion. In conclusion, despite evidence that the adrenal glands of patients with disseminated bronchogenic carcinoma are frequently affected by metastatic disease, biochemical evidence of clinically significant hypoadrenalism is relatively uncommon and is not accurately predicted by electrolyte abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) with 18 F- 2 -fluoro- 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) is widely {{applied to the}} study of gliomas. The histology of most gliomas is regionally heterogeneous. The relationship between histologic features and glucose metabolism evaluated by PET with FDG may therefore vary within the limits of the tumor. PET with FDG integrated in the planning of stereotactic brain biopsy allows precise comparison between local FDG uptake and histology. Using this approach, the authors investigated whether glucose metabolism of gliomas is related to anaplasia, and whether PET with FDG detects metabolic heterogeneity that parallels histologic heterogeneity of gliomas. METHODS: A total of 161 biopsy samples collected from 20 PET-guided procedures performed in patients with gliomas (8 low grade astrocytomas, 8 anaplastic astrocytomas, 1 anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, and 3 glioblastomas) were analyzed for {{the presence or absence of}} 8 histologic features. Stereotactic coordinates were used to calculate the metabolic rate of glucose (MRGlu) in the region of each biopsy sample. Gray and white matter MRGlu were used to define four metabolic grades that were compared with local histology. RESULTS: The difference in MRGlu expressed as micromoles per 100 g per minute was highly significant between anaplastic and nonanaplastic samples; the median +/- <b>quartile</b> <b>deviation</b> was 23 +/- 16 in anaplastic samples and 18 +/- 5 in nonanaplastic samples (P < 0. 005). Even more significant differences were found when MRGlu was normalized to the cortex or to the white matter. Metabolic grades were different in anaplastic and nonanaplastic samples (P < 0. 0001). Approximately 75 % of samples metabolically graded 3 or 4 demonstrated signs of anaplasia, compared with 10 % of samples graded 0 or 1.

Air embolisms were produced by air infusion through an inserted pulmonary artery catheter. The threshold air volume under TMP administration was significantly attenuated compared with control (without TMP); these median ± <b>quartile</b> <b>deviation</b> (Q.

There was no significant diffesence in the threshold air volume under NCP administration. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) was significantly decreased after TMP administration; these mean ± standard deviation (S.

40|$|Abstract Background Studies of drug-related {{mortality}} rarely describe fatal injuries due to {{psychoactive drug}} intoxication (FIUI). The main {{aim of this}} study was to determine the nature, extent and pattern of FIUI. Methods This observational study covered the period January 1999 to December 2001. Data were provided by members of a study panel of coroners in England using a standard protocol. Sources of data for this study included autopsy protocols, death certificates, hospital records, police reports, toxicology reports and inquest transcripts. Inclusion criteria for this were (i) the mention of one or more psychoactive substances as contributing to fatality; and (ii) the presence of a Controlled Drug at post mortem. Results A total of 3, 803 drug-related deaths of persons aged 16 – 64 years were reported by the study panel during the three-year period. The study panel accounted for 86 % of drug-related deaths in England in this period. There were 147 FIUI cases (119 males, 28 females), giving a proportionate mortality ratio of approximately 4 %. The majority of FIUI cases (84 %) were aged 16 – 44 years, with a median age at death of 33 years (<b>Quartile</b> <b>deviation</b> = 7). Fifty-six percent of FIUI occurred in urban areas of England. The population of the study jurisdictions aged 16 – 64 years contributed 49, 545, 766 person-years (py) to the study, giving an annual crude rate of 3 / 1, 000, 000 person-years (py). Rates for male and females were 4. 9 and 1. 1 / 1, 000, 000 py respectively, giving a male/female rate ratio of 4. 5 (95 %CI = 2. 9 – 6. 8). The rates of intentional and unintentional FIUI were 2 and 1 / 1, 000, 000 py respectively. The leading mechanism for intentional FIUI was suffocation while the predominant mechanisms in unintentional FIUI were road traffic accidents and falls. There is a significant difference in the pattern of drug-specific risk between FIUI and fatal poisoning. Risks of intentional FIUI are elevated among Black and Minority Ethnic groups. Conclusion There are differences in the nature, extent and pattern of intentional and unintentional FIUI that should necessitate targeted prevention strategies. Also, there is an opportunity for cross-discipline collaboration between injury prevention specialists and substance abuse/mental health specialists. </p...|$|E

Using hyperbolic position fixing, which exploits time differences of arrival of a signal between pairs of hydrophone receivers, we obtained source location estimates for whistles with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR ≥ 10 dB) and not polluted by other sounds and back-calculated their apparent source levels (ASL). Combining with the masking levels (including simultaneous noise levels, masking tonal threshold, and the Sousa auditory threshold) and the custom made site-specific sound propagation models, we further estimated their active communication space (ACS). Results. Humpback dolphins produced whistles with average root-mean-square ASL of 138. 5 ± 6. 8 (mean ± standard deviation) and 137. 2 ± 7. 0 dB re 1 µPa in PRE (N = 33) and BG (N = 209), respectively. We found statistically significant differences in ASLs among different whistle contour types. The mean and maximum ACS of whistles were estimated to be 14. 7 ± 2. 6 (median ± <b>quartile</b> <b>deviation)</b> and 17. 1 ± 3. 5 m in PRE, and 34. 2 ± 9. 5 and 43. 5 ± 12. 2 m in BG. Using just the auditory threshold as the masking level produced the mean and maximum ACSat of 24. 3 ± 4. 8 and 35. 7 ± 4. 6 m for PRE, and 60. 7 ± 18. 1 and 74. 3 ± 25. 3 m for BG. The small ACSs were due to the high ambient noise level. Significant differences in ACSs were also observed among different whistle contour types. Discussion. Besides shedding some light for evaluating appropriate noise exposure levels and information for the regulation of underwater acoustic pollution, these baseline data can also be used for aiding the passive acoustic monitoring of dolphin populations, defining the boundaries of separate groups in a more biologically meaningful way during field surveys, and guiding the appropriate approach distance for local dolphin-watching boats and research boat during focal group following...|$|E

BACKGROUND: Studies of drug-related mortality rarely describe fatal injuries due to psychoactive drug intoxication (FIUI). The main aim of this study was to determine the nature, extent and pattern of FIUI. METHODS: This observational study covered the period January 1999 to December 2001. Data were provided by members of a study panel of coroners in England using a standard protocol. Sources of data for this study included autopsy protocols, death certificates, hospital records, police reports, toxicology reports and inquest transcripts. Inclusion criteria for this were (i) the mention of one or more psychoactive substances as contributing to fatality; and (ii) the presence of a Controlled Drug at post mortem. RESULTS: A total of 3, 803 drug-related deaths of persons aged 16 - 64 years were reported by the study panel during the three-year period. The study panel accounted for 86 % of drug-related deaths in England in this period. There were 147 FIUI cases (119 males, 28 females), giving a proportionate mortality ratio of approximately 4 %. The majority of FIUI cases (84 %) were aged 16 - 44 years, with a median age at death of 33 years (<b>Quartile</b> <b>deviation</b> = 7). Fifty-six percent of FIUI occurred in urban areas of England. The population of the study jurisdictions aged 16 - 64 years contributed 49, 545, 766 person-years (py) to the study, giving an annual crude rate of 3 / 1, 000, 000 person-years (py). Rates for male and females were 4. 9 and 1. 1 / 1, 000, 000 py respectively, giving a male/female rate ratio of 4. 5 (95 %CI = 2. 9 - 6. 8). The rates of intentional and unintentional FIUI were 2 and 1 / 1, 000, 000 py respectively. The leading mechanism for intentional FIUI was suffocation while the predominant mechanisms in unintentional FIUI were road traffic accidents and falls. There is a significant difference in the pattern of drug-specific risk between FIUI and fatal poisoning. Risks of intentional FIUI are elevated among Black and Minority Ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: There are differences in the nature, extent and pattern of intentional and unintentional FIUI that should necessitate targeted prevention strategies. Also, there is an opportunity for cross-discipline collaboration between injury prevention specialists and substance abuse/mental health specialists...|$|E

Background. Knowledge of species-specific vocalization characteristics and their associated active communication space, the effective range over which a communication signal can be detected by a conspecific, is critical for understanding the impacts of underwater acoustic pollution, as well as other threats. Methods. We used a two-dimensional cross-shaped hydrophone array system to record the whistles of free-ranging Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) in shallow-water environments of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and Beibu Gulf (BG), China. Using hyperbolic position fixing, which exploits time differences of arrival of a signal between pairs of hydrophone receivers, we obtained source location estimates for whistles with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR  ≥ 10 dB) and not polluted by other sounds and back-calculated their apparent source levels (ASL). Combining with the masking levels (including simultaneous noise levels, masking tonal threshold, and the Sousa auditory threshold) and the custom made site-specific sound propagation models, we further estimated their active communication space (ACS). Results. Humpback dolphins produced whistles with average root-mean-square ASL of 138. 5 ± 6. 8 (mean ± standard deviation) and 137. 2 ± 7. 0 dB re 1 µPa in PRE (N = 33) and BG (N = 209), respectively.
