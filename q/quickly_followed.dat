Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, <b>quickly</b> <b>followed</b> by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was {{that the spirit of}} liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E

5|$|French {{zoologist}} Henri Filhol was {{the first}} to scientifically describe a species of Pachylemur; he named Lemur insignis and Lemur intermedius in 1895 {{on the basis of a}} few subfossil bones. Descriptions of other species now placed in Pachylemur <b>quickly</b> <b>followed.</b> In 1899, Guillaume Grandidier named a new genus and species, Palaeochirogalus jullyi, on the basis of two teeth from Antsirabe, central Madagascar, which he thought similar to dwarf lemurs (Cheirogaleus). In 1903, Grafton Elliot Smith placed this species in the genus Lemur (as Lemur jullyi), and in 1905, Grandidier himself considered the species a synonym of Lemur insignis.|$|E

The loss of the left wing caused the aircraft to roll left, whereupon the fuselage and the right horizontal stabilizer collided with the separated wing. The initial separation was caused either by a wind gust in excess of operating velocity, or a similar lower-velocity gust after the material had become fatigued.|$|E

The design was <b>quickly</b> <b>followed</b> by Type 'C2', which differed from the 'C1' in {{that it had a}} lower front edge and was fitted with Timken roller bearings. Only two 'C2's were built and they were coupled to the last two of the class, Nos. 6256 and 6257.|$|E

Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Austen's novels {{appeared}} in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of Pride and Prejudice, <b>quickly</b> <b>followed</b> by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen {{was not well}} known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works {{as part of the}} English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.|$|E
