25|$|During the {{earliest}} parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted that homosexuality was non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> {{ought to be}} changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed that homosexuality was pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing homosexuality was largely pessimistic. Those forms of homosexuality that were considered perversions were usually held to be uncurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition {{of the difficulty of}} achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.|$|E
25|$|The University of Montana Law Review {{published}} three articles {{addressing this}} topic in its winter 2007 issue. David K. DeWolf, John G.

Peter Irons responded to the DeWolf et al. article, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned, and that it marks the end to legal efforts by the intelligent design movement to introduce creationism in public schools. It had been {{an essential part of the}} ruling to consider whether ID was a legitimate scientific theory as claimed by its proponents, and DeWolf, et al. had implicitly recognised this by citing the Lemon test, which would have been irrelevant if ID were legitimate science.

25|$|The above {{examples}} of mono-monostatic objects are necessarily inhomogeneous, that is, {{the density of}} their material varies across their body. The <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is possible to construct a three-dimensional body which is mono-monostatic but also homogeneous and convex was raised by Russian mathematician Vladimir Arnold in 1995. The requirement of being convex is essential as it is trivial to construct a mono-monostatic non-convex body (an example would be a ball with a cavity inside it). Convex means that any straight line between two points on a body lies inside the body, or, in other words, that the surface has no sunken regions but instead bulges outward (or is at least flat) at every point. It was already well known, from a geometrical and topological generalization of the classical four-vertex theorem, that a plane curve has at least four extrema of curvature, specifically, at least two local maxima {{and at least two}} local minima (see right figure), meaning that a (convex) mono-monostatic object does not exist in two dimensions. Whereas a common anticipation was that a three-dimensional body should also have at least four extrema, Arnold conjectured that this number could be smaller.|$|E

500|$|As {{some critics}} have noted, Psycho-Pass explores {{societal}} and psychological themes, such {{as the price of}} living without stress, and without fear of crime. Indeed, the Sibyl System targets individuals who are considering performing actions that might cause stress to others. But this raises the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is morally and socially acceptable to charge individuals with crimes they have not yet committed. For example, in the first episode, a woman is kidnapped, and the resultant trauma causes her Psycho-Pass to become clouded. According to Sibyl's instructions, the police are therefore prepared to kill her. But Akane steps in, refusing to accept Sibyl's verdict, and manages to bring the woman's Psycho-Pass level back to the acceptable range by speaking gently to her. Consequently, this challenges the notion that the potential to commit a crime necessarily correlates with actually committing the crime. According to Anime News Network, [...] "We are all capable of doing bad things at timesshould we be punished because we thought of hurting someone before we act on it? Or because we were victims? It really all comes back to that first episode and Akane's reaction to the victim who presented as a violent criminal".|$|E

The text of the Cylinder is very specific, listing places in Mesopotamia and the neighboring regions. It does not describe any general release or return of exiled communities but focuses on the return of Babylonian deities to their own home cities. It emphasises the re-establishment of local religious norms, reversing the alleged neglect of Nabonidus – a theme that Amélie Kuhrt describes as [...] "a literary device used to underline the piety of Cyrus as opposed to the blasphemy of Nabonidus." [...] She suggests that Cyrus had simply adopted a policy used by earlier Assyrian rulers of giving privileges to cities in key strategic or politically sensitive regions {{and that there was no}} general policy as such. Lester L. Grabbe, a historian of early Judaism, has written that [...] "the religious policy of the Persians was not that different from the basic practice of the Assyrians and Babylonians before them" [...] in tolerating – but not promoting – local cults, other than their own gods.|$|E
500|$|Other aspects {{grew out}} of basic {{concepts}} or ideas. For the episode [...] "Skin", writer Shiban felt that the shapeshifting villain had to change {{into one of the}} lead characters. The character chosen was Dean, and the writers decided not to clear his name of attempted murder {{at the end of the}} episode. Though they at first feared that having one of the main characters be a wanted man would later ruin the show, the writers eventually felt it was [...] "a great layer to add", opening up new potential storylines and characters. Dean's reputation is addressed again in [...] "The Benders", and catches up to him in the second and third seasons. Another element that would influence future episodes came about in [...] "Hook Man" [...] when writers Milbauer and Burton realized that shotguns shoot salt, a weakness for spirits. Kripke deemed it the [...] "perfect combination of occult element", as it brought together a [...] "folkloric repellent of evil" [...] with the [...] "blue-collar aspect of shotguns". The episode [...] "Asylum" [...] later established iron as another weapon against ghosts. [...] "Faith", on the other hand, stemmed from the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> truly was wrong to heal good people of their illnesses at the cost of the lives of strangers. Kripke noted, [...] " [...] really a great girl and she deserves to live, and some stranger you don't even know will die... and maybe that's worth it." [...] Reapers were not in the original script of the episode, but were added later to give the writers a chance to create [...] "scary" [...] sequences and to explain the faith healer's ability.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the often sterile and {{circular}} debates over relationships between poverty and deforestation. These debates revolve around <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> forest loss causes poverty or poverty contributes to forest encroachment, and <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is loss <b>of</b> access to forests or dependence on forest-based livelihoods that cause poverty. We suggest that a way beyond the impasse is to set such debates {{within the context of}} agrarian change. Livelihoods of those who live in or near forests depend considerably on a rapidly changing agriculture, yet agrarian contexts receive only background attention in popular, political and academic discourse over poverty and forests. Moreover, to the extent that agriculture is considered, little heed is paid to social, technical and economic change. We therefore address agriculture’s changing relationships with the wider economy, otherwise referred to as the agrarian transition, and with the natural resource base on which it depends. The paper draws on the experience of Thailand to illustrate our key argument, and more specifically addresses the situation on the resource periphery through a look at the agriculture-forest interface...|$|R
