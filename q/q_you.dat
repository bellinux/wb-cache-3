5000|$|In the Einsatzgruppen trial, Sandberger {{was charged}} with crimes against humanity, war crimes, and {{membership}} in a criminal organization, that is, the SS. At his trial, Sandberger denied responsibility for the killings described in the 15 October report and sought to blame the German field police and Estonian home guard. This {{was rejected by the}} tribunal, which found that the Estonian home guard was under Sandberger's jurisdiction and control for specific operations, as shown by the same report. Similarly, Sandberger claimed he had arrested the Jews sent to Pskov to protect them, hoping that during the internment the Führer order might be revoked or meliorated and he was not in general responsible for their execution at the Pskov detention camp. Sandberger said he was responsible for [...] "only a fraction" [...] of the killings. Sandberger placed this [...] "fraction" [...] at 300 to 350 persons. Q. The sum total of Communists seized runs to about 14,500; do you see that? A. Yes, 14,500, yes. Q. That means 1,000 were shot? A. Yes, I get that from the document. <b>Q.</b> <b>You</b> know it. Did you know of it? Do you remember it?A. The report must have been submitted to me. Q. Then at one time, at least, you knew of it? A. Yes. Q. Were you in Estonia then? A. Yes, but they were not shot on my own responsibility. I am only responsible for 350.Q. You are responsible for 350? A. That is my estimate. Sandberger claimed the execution of the Jews at Pskov happened in his absence and without his knowledge. The tribunal found that Sandberger's own testimony convicted him: [...] <b>Q.</b> <b>You</b> collected these men in the camps?A. Yes. I gave the order.Q. You knew that at some future time they could expect nothing but death? A. I was hoping that Hitler would withdraw the order or change it.Q. You knew that the probability, bordering on certainty, was that they would be shot after being collected? A. I knew that there was this possibility, yes.Q. In fact, almost a certainty, isn't that right? A. It was probable. [...] <b>Q.</b> <b>You</b> collected these Jews, according to the basic order, didn't you, the Hitler Order? A. Yes. Q. And then they were shot; they were shot; isn't that right?A. Yes. Q. By members of your command? A. From Estonian men who were subordinated to my Sonderkommando leaders; that is also myself then. Q. Then, in fact, they were shot by members under your command?A. Yes. Q. Then, {{as a result of the}} Fuehrer Order, these Jews were shot?A. Yes.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a spin chain model by numerically solving the exact model {{to explore the}} non-perturbative dynamical decoupling regime, where an important issue arises recently (J. Jing, L. -A. Wu, J. <b>Q.</b> <b>You</b> and T. Yu, arXiv: 1202. 5056.). Our study has revealed a few universal features of non-perturbative dynamical control irrespective {{of the types of}} environments and system-environment couplings. We have shown that, for the spin chain model, there is a threshold and a large pulse parameter region where the effective dynamical control can be implemented, in contrast to the perturbative decoupling schemes where the permissible parameters are represented by a point or converge to a very small subset in the large parameter region admitted by our non-perturbative approach. An important implication of the non-perturbative approach is its flexibility in implementing the dynamical control scheme in a experimental setup. Our findings have exhibited several interesting features of the non-perturbative regimes such as the chain-size independence, pulse strength upper-bound, noncontinuous valid parameter regions, etc. Furthermore, we find that our non-perturbative scheme is robust against randomness in model fabrication and time-dependent random noise...|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{failure occurs}} when a subject’s e-based {{justification}} for p cannot provide her with justification to believe q, {{despite the fact that}} q is one of p’s known entailments. According to the Bayesian explana-tion, transmission failure occurs because P (qje) < P (q). I argue that the Bayesian explanation is extensionally inadequate: the condition it identi-fies is neither necessary nor sufficient for transmission failure. 1 Transmission failure Typically, when you gain justification for believing p and recognize that p en-tails <b>q,</b> <b>you</b> thereby also gain justification for believing q. But in some cases, your justification for believing p can “fail to transmit ” to q; i. e., recognizing that q is entailed by your justified belief in p is not a way of gaining justification to believe q. 1 Let us distinguish the idea that justification is closed under known entail-ment from the idea that justification always transmits across known entail-ment. Here is a statement of the closure principle: Closure. If S has justification to believe p, and recognizes that p entails q, then S has justification to believe q...|$|E

40|$|In the {{encryption}} we’ve {{been doing}} so far, the sender and the recipient needed to preagree on a key. This is traditionally called “symmetric ” or “secret-key ” encryption. The idea of {{public key encryption}} is that I can walk into a room, announce my key, and everybody in the room can send secret messages to me by simply shouting them out so that everyone can hear them. In other words, we can communicate secretly by publishing messages for everyone to see, even if we never pre-agreed on a shared secret value unknown to others. This sounds impossible, but can actually be done. The idea was first proposed by Diffie and Hellman [DH 76]. 5. 2 Public Key Encryption Using the Squaring Function First Attempt We know that squaring modulo n = pq is easy, while taking square roots is hard (as hard as factoring n). On the other hand, taking square roots modulo p and modulo q is easy, and so is recombining them using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. So this gives us an idea for the public-key encryption scheme. Let p � = q be two primes, n = pq, p ≡ q ≡ 3 (mod 4). Let the public key PK be n, and the secret key SK be (p, q). For m ∈ QRn, define the encryption of m as c = m 2 mod n. Note that if you just see c, n, it’s hard to find m, because it’s hard to find square roots (as we proved last time). However, if you know p and <b>q,</b> <b>you</b> can take the square root of c modulo p and modulo q (as shown on HW 2), and combine them usin...|$|E
