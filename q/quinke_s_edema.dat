40|$|During laryngomicroscopy, the {{superficial}} layers of vocal fold epithelium can {{be examined in}} vivo and in situ by contact endoscopy. Methylene blue is applied initially to stain the epihelial cells of the vocal folds. When in contact with mucosal tissue, this endoscope provides 60 and 150 times magnification and clear visualization of cellular patterns of {{the superficial}} epithelial layers. For {{the first time in}} our laryngological clinical practice, we confirmed a number of previously established parametars such as regularity and arrangement of the epithelium, nucleus contour, and nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, what all enable recognition and easy evaluation of different clinical conditions such as chronic laryngitis, Reinke. <b>s</b> <b>edema,</b> papiloma dyspiasia or vocal fold carcinoma.

40|$|POEMS {{syndrome}} {{is defined by}} the presence of a peripheral neuropathy (P), a monoclonal plasma cell disorder (M), and other paraneoplastic features, the most common of which include organomegaly (O), endocrinopathy (E), skin changes (<b>S),</b> papilledema, <b>edema,</b> effusions, ascites, and thrombocytosis. Virtually all patients will have either sclerotic bone lesion(s) or co-existent Castleman’s disease.

40|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD), often caused by mutations in the PKD 1 gene, is associated with life-threatening vascular abnormalities that are commonly attributed to the frequent occurrence of hypertension. A previously reported targeted mutation of the mouse homologue of PKD 1 {{was not associated with}} vascular fragility, leading to the suggestion that the vascular lesion may be of a secondary nature. Here we demonstrate a primary role of PKD 1 mutations in vascular fragility. Mouse embryos homozygous for the mutant allele (Pkd 1 L) exhibit <b>s.</b> c. <b>edema,</b> vascular leaks, and rupture of blood vessels, culminating in embryonic lethality at embryonic day 15. 5. Kidney and pancreatic ductal cysts are present. The Pkd 1 -encoded protein, mouse polycystin 1, was detected in normal endothelium and the surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells. These data reveal a requisite role for polycystin 1 in maintaining the structural integrity of the vasculature as well as epithelium and suggest that the nature of the PKD 1 mutation contributes to the phenotypic variance in ADPKD...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is {{well known}} as a highly toxic {{environmental}} chemical threat. Prolonged exposure to H 2 S {{can lead to the}} formation of pulmonary edema. However, the mechanisms of how H 2 <b>S</b> facilitates <b>edema</b> formation are poorly understood. Since edema formation can be enhanced by an impaired clearance of electrolytes and, consequently, fluid across the alveolar epithelium, it was questioned whether H 2 S may interfere with transepithelial electrolyte absorption. Electrolyte absorption was electrophysiologically measured across native distal lung preparations (Xenopus laevis) in Ussing chambers. The exposure of lung epithelia to H 2 S decreased net transepithelial electrolyte absorption. This was due to an impairment of amiloride-sensitive sodium transport. H 2 S inhibited the activity of the Na +/K+-ATPase as well as lidocaine-sensitive potassium channels located in the basolateral membrane of the epithelium. Inhibition of these transport molecules diminishes the electrochemical gradient which is necessary for transepithelial sodium absorption. Since sodium absorption osmotically facilitates alveolar fluid clearance, interference of H 2 S with the epithelial transport machinery provides a mechanism which enhances edema formation in H 2 S-exposed lungs...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND. Evening edema of {{the legs}} is a {{physiologic}} phenomenon occurring after sitting and standing. OBJECTIVE. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate which compression pressure is necessary to prevent leg swell-ing. METHODS. In 12 volunteers, the volume of both lower legs was measured in the morning and 7 h later, the difference being defined as evening edema (mL). The procedure was carried out for 4 days, in which the subjects wore below-knee stockings of different compression levels alternatively on one leg only in a random order. Compression pressure was assessed using the HATRA device. RESULTS. The average evening edema of the noncompressed legs was 62. 4 mL on the left side and 94. 4 mL on the right side (n. <b>s.).</b> Evening <b>edema</b> was significantly reduced to 40. 3 mL by light support stockings, to 34. 1 mL by compression class A, to 39. 6 by compression class I, and to 59. 1 mL by compression class II. Mainly stockings exerting a pressure above 10 mmHg improved subjective symptoms. CONCLUSION. Calf-length compression stockings with a pres-sure range between 11 and 21 mmHg are able to reduce or totally prevent evening edema and may therefore be recom-mended for people with a profession connected with long periods of sitting or standing...|$|R

40|$|Pressure ulcers {{continue}} to be a nationwide healthcare issue. According to evidence-based practice guidelines, the identification of at-risk individuals using risk assessment tools is a crucial and integral part of preventing this adverse health outcome. Given the need for further refinement of existing risk assessment methods, {{this study was designed to}} answer the question, “What is the best model to support clinicians 2 ̆ 7 decision-making in predicting hospital-acquired pressure ulcers?” The purpose of this study was to (a) obtain a better understanding of contributing factors to pressure ulcer development; and (b) examine the best predictive model to identify at-risk patients admitted to a hospital setting. A one-to-one case control study was conducted on a pre-existing dataset created from electronic patient records. As an analytic approach, the knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process was employed using univariate, multivariate statistical analyses and decision tree induction techniques. The best model and predictors identified from ten subsets of the pre-existing dataset were evaluated using ten additional validation datasets. The best components for predicting pressure ulcer development consisted of eight. Five predictors were routinely collected through electronic patient records—the need for a nurse 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> accompaniment, <b>edema</b> of cardiovascular system, a foley catheter, nutrition consult, and use of wheelchairs. The remaining three predictors were derived from the Braden subscales—activity, friction/shear, and sensory perception.

40|$|Gnas is an {{imprinted}} gene with multiple gene products resulting from alternative splicing of different first exons onto a common exon 2. These products include stimulatory G protein α-subunit (Gsα), the G protein required for receptor-stimulated cAMP production; extralarge Gsα (XLαs), a paternally expressed Gsα isoform; and neuroendocrine-specific protein (NESP 55), a maternally expressed chromogranin-like protein. Gsα undergoes tissue-specific imprinting, being expressed {{primarily from the}} maternal allele in certain tissues. Heterozygous mutation of exon 2 on the maternal (E 2 m-/+) or paternal (E 2 +/p-) allele results in opposite effects on energy metabolism. E 2 m-/+ mice are obese and hypometabolic, whereas E 2 +/p- mice are lean and hypermetabolic. We now studied the effects of Gsα deficiency without disrupting other Gnas gene products by deleting Gsα exon 1 (E 1). E 1 +/p- mice lacked the E 2 +/p- phenotype and developed obesity and insulin resistance. The lean, hypermetabolic, and insulin-sensitive E 2 +/p- phenotype appears to result from XLαs deficiency, whereas loss of paternal-specific Gsα expression in E 1 +/p- mice leads to an opposite metabolic phenotype. Thus, alternative Gnas gene products have opposing effects on glucose and lipid metabolism. Like E 2 m-/+ mice, E 1 m-/+ mice had <b>s.</b> c. <b>edema</b> at birth, presumably due to loss of maternal Gsα expression. However, E 1 m-/+ mice differed from E 2 m-/+ mice in other respects, raising the possibility {{for the presence of}} other maternal-specific gene products. E 1 m-/+ mice had more severe obesity and insulin resistance and lower metabolic rate relative to E 1 +/p- mice. Differences between E 1 m-/+ and E 1 +/p- mice presumably result from differential effects on Gsα expression in tissues where Gsα is normally imprinted...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Congestive {{physical}} findings such as pulmonary rales {{and third}} heart sound (S 3) are hallmarks of acute heart failure (AHF). However, {{their role in}} outcome prediction remains unclear. We sought to investigate the association between congestive physical findings upon admission, steady-state biomarkers {{at the time of}} discharge, and long-term outcomes in AHF patients. METHODS: We analyzed the data of 133 consecutive AHF patients with an established diagnosis of ischemic or non-ischemic (dilated or hypertrophic) cardiomyopathy, admitted to a single-center university hospital between 2006 and 2010. The treating physician prospectively recorded major symptoms and congestive physical findings of AHF: paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, pulmonary rales, jugular venous distension (JVD), <b>S</b> 3, and <b>edema.</b> The primary endpoint was defined as rehospitalization for HF. RESULTS: Majority (63. 9 %) of the patients had non-ischemic etiology and, at the time of admission, S 3 was seen in 69. 9 % of the patients, JVD in 54. 1 %, and pulmonary rales in 43. 6 %. The mean follow-up period was 726 ± 31 days. Patients with pulmonary rales (p < 0. 001) and S 3 (p  =  0. 011) had worse readmission rates than those without these findings; the presence of these findings was also associated with elevated troponin T (TnT) levels at the time of discharge (odds ratio [OR] 2. 8; p  =  0. 02 and OR 2. 6; p  =  0. 05, respectively). CONCLUSION: Pulmonary rales and S 3 were associated with inferior readmission rates and elevated TnT levels on discharge. The worsening of the readmission rate owing to congestive physical findings may be a consequence of on-going myocardial injury...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary pathologies {{including}} adult respiratory distress syndrome {{are characterized}} by disruption of pulmonary integrity and edema compromising respiratory function. Sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) is a lipid mediator synthesized and/or stored in mast cells, platelets, and epithelial cells, with production up-regulated by the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 and TNF. S 1 P administration via the airways but not via the vasculature induces lung leakage. Using receptor-null mice, we show that S 1 P, acting on S 1 P 3 receptor expressed on both type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells but not vascular endothelium, induces pulmonary edema by acute tight junction opening. WT but not S 1 P 3 -null mice showed disruption of pulmonary epithelial tight junctions {{and the appearance of}} paracellular gaps between epithelial cells by electron microscopy within 1 h of airways exposure to S 1 P. We further show by fluorescence microscopy that S 1 P induced rapid loss of ZO- 1 reactivity, an essential component of the cytoplasmic plaque associated with tight junctions, {{as well as of the}} tetraspannin Claudin- 18, an integral membrane organizer of tight junctions. S 1 P shows synergistic activity with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF, showing both pulmonary edema and mortality at subthreshold S 1 P doses. Specifically, preexposure of mice to subthreshold doses of TNF, which alone induced no lung <b>edema,</b> exacerbated <b>S</b> 1 P-induced <b>edema</b> and impaired survival. S 1 P, acting through S 1 P 3, regulates epithelial integrity and acts additively with TNF in compromising respiratory barrier function. Because S 1 P 3 -null mice are resistant to S 1 P-induced pulmonary leakage, either alone or in the presence of TNF, S 1 P 3 antagonism may be useful in protecting epithelial integrity in pulmonary disease...|$|R
