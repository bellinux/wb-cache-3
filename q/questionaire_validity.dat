40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to create {{students}} 2 ̆ 7 worksheet based on characters through scientific approach of statistical fluid material, to examine the feasibility of worksheet according for experts, teachers and students, to investigate the effectiveness of the development of students 2 ̆ 7 character and skills of the students in doing practical work after using worksheet. This research uses design R & D with model Dick and Carey. The research procedure includes four stages, which is analizing, designing, creating, and evaluating stage. The feasibility of worksheet was examined using a questionaire. Based on the result <b>questionaire</b> <b>validity</b> tested by the experts, the worksheet was declared to be valid and it is apliable to be used and tested,, whereas the response of the teachers and students about the worksheet, it stated that the worksheet categorized as a very good one. Meanwhile the data of character development and students skill on doing practical work that gained from the observation sheet. Analysis of the character development shows that the character of the students are in the category began to evolve become as a habit (culture of the students), while the influence of worksheet to the students 2 ̆ 7 skill on doing practical are in good criteria...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} an approach for segmenting sporting event volunteers according {{to differences in}} their motives. Empirical data were obtained from a sample of 1169 volunteers who registered for the 2014 European Athletics Championships in Zürich. They completed the ‘Volunteer Motivation Scale for International Sporting Events’ (VMS-ISE) <b>questionaire.</b> The <b>validity</b> of the VMS-ISE was replicated by confirmatory factor analysis and the data were cluster analysed to identify distinct motivation-based volunteer profiles. These segmented volunteers {{on the basis of}} mutually exclusive motivational characteristics. The external validity of the four motivation-based types (‘community supporters’, ‘material incentive seekers’, ‘social networkers’ and ‘career and personal growth orienteers’) was confirmed with socio-economic, sport-related and volunteer activity-related variables. It is concluded that motivation-based segmentation represents a useful way of gaining a clearer understanding of the patterns underlying the heterogeneity of sporting events volunteers...|$|R

This study is Ex-post Facto in nature that is characterized by correlational description using quantitative approach. The subject of the study are 34 second year students of Audio Video Engineering major at SMK Negeri 3 Yogyakarta. The data {{in this study is}} collected by using documentations, tests and <b>questionaires.</b> The <b>validity</b> of the instrument is provided by using items analysis by Product Momentformula and the realibilty is checked by using Alpha Cronbach formula. Hypothesis testing is done by using product moment corellation analysis and double regressions analysis. Before that,the condition analysis testing is done including normality testing, linieritytesting and multicolinierity testing. The result of the study shows that motivation, environment and discipline have positive effects on the students’ achievement. It is showed by coefficient r: 0, 888, r hitungis bigger than r tabel (0, 888 > 0, 339). Determinantcoefficient(r 2) is 0, 789 or 78, 9...|$|R
