30|$|Market {{information}} {{is an important}} factor influencing the imitation and innovation activities of enterprises. Enterprises can imitate and improve mature products in the market and thereby realize an imitation innovation effect with the help of market information. In areas where domestic trade is more active, market information and market demand can spread to businesses easier and quicker due to faster economic cycles, and thus act on imitation innovation (Sjöholm, 1996). In addition, innovative products can be tested by the market in a timely manner, which is conducive to making adjustments or carrying out secondary innovation according to market feedback. In this process, foreign trade plays the role of information sources. Contrastingly, in areas where foreign trade is developed, the overseas <b>qualified</b> <b>product</b> information, as well as technical information, can flow in a timely manner to the local enterprises. Thus, local enterprises can learn from foreign technology or products and implement a reverse crack on them, through which innovation costs can be reduced and innovation efficiency can be improved.|$|E

40|$|Summary Prospects in {{introducing}} GM {{plants in the}} Italian agricultural production system (JEL: Q 18) The {{purpose of the present}} study is to evaluate the willingness of the Italian farmers and consumers respectively, to cultivate GM plants and to buy GM foods. In Italy is not allowed, at the moment, the cultivation of GM plants. Notwithstanding GM foods are normally present on the Italian market, which is strongly dependant from foreign markets especially for soy bean based foodstuffs primarily containing GMO. The study indicates that only 18 % of the Italian farmers are interested in cultivating GMO, mainly in the cereal and livestock sector where GM products are strongly utilized as feeding stuffs for animals. The consumers that declare to be favorable to GMO are 3 % while 8 % consider Italian agriculture to be somehow affected by GM presence. To the majority of the Italian consumers, particularly when buying beef filet and chicken food, it is more important the information regarding the fact that animals have been raised and fed with GMO – free feeding stuffs rather than the price of the products itself. Within this framework, the opportunity and consequent choice of not cultivating GM plants seems, therefore, sustainable when considered on an overall supply chain approach aiming to offer a highly <b>qualified</b> <b>product</b> or, as in the case of animal feed stuffs, obtained without utilizing GMO...|$|E

40|$|The Westinghouse Science and Technology Center has {{undertaken}} {{a program to}} develop nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for characterizing the internal structure of SiC particle-reinforced aluminum matrix composites at critical stages during fabrication [1 – 5]. Because of {{the large number of}} processing variables in the manufacture of metal matrix composites (MMC), the likelihood of having detrimental discontinuities is high. The detection of potential defects early in the processing cycle would increase the overall system yield, lower costs, and enhance final product quality [4]. The aim of this investigation was to develop and conduct NDE at various stages of MMC fabrication, correlate the results with microstructural characterization, and establish <b>qualified</b> <b>product</b> quality assurance processes. A large-scale billet was fabricated specially using powder metallurgy techniques to facilitate this objective. The billet contained implanted silicon-carbide particle and aluminum powder clusters as inspection targets. The billet was subsequently extruded into a primary cylindrical extrusion, and finally into a flat plate. The NDE objectives included evaluating the detectability and mapping the implanted defects through each of the processing steps. Comprehensive evaluation of MMC structures requires the use of multiple NDE techniques, including ultrasonic, eddy current, and radiographic testing. This paper concentrates on the results of the ultrasonic investigations. Our experimental approach was: (1) fabricate a MMC billet with intentionally placed inhomogeneities; (2) develop and implement NDE techniques to characterize the MMC internal structure; (3) extend the NDE techniques to intermediate processing and final product forms; and (4) correlate the NDE data with microstructural characterization and mechanical testing results...|$|E
