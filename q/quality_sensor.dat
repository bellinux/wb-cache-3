40|$|The most {{important}} mechanism {{to occur in}} biological distributed sensory networks (DSNs) is called lateral inhibition, (LI). LI relies on one simple principle. Each sensor strives to suppress its neighbors in proportion to its own excitation. In this study, LI mechanism is exploited to localize the unknown position of a light source that illuminated the photosensitive sensory network containing high and low <b>quality</b> <b>sensors.</b> Each photosensitive sensor was then calibrated to accurately read {{the distance to the}} light source. A series of experiments were conducted employing both <b>quality</b> <b>sensors.</b> Low <b>quality</b> array was allowed to take advantage of LI, whereas the high quality one was not.

40|$|Raw sensor {{observations}} {{often have}} low data quality and reliability due to {{both internal and}} external factors including low quality of cheap sensors, dynamicity of network conditions, and harshness of the deployment environment. Use of low <b>quality</b> <b>sensor</b> data in any data analysis and decision making process will not only negatively impact analysis results and decisions made but also waste huge amount of valuable and limited network resources such as energy, as many incorrect values are transmitted. Low <b>quality</b> <b>sensor</b> data also prevents WSNs to fulfill their promises in terms of reliable real-time situation-awareness, as the low <b>quality</b> <b>sensor</b> data may generate large number of false alarms. Motivated by the need to improve quality of data analysis and decision making, enhance efficiency of using WSNs resources by preventing unnecessary transmission of erroneous sensor observations, and increase effectiveness of monitoring and situation-awareness capabilities of the WSNs, in this thesis we focus on online identification of outliers whenever and wherever they occur. Outliers in WSNs are those observations that represent erroneous values (errors) or indicate particular phenomenal changes (events). Our outlier detection techniques, which are based on distributed in-network data processing, identify sensor observations that do not conform to normal behavior of sensor data without using a pre-defined threshold or triggering conditions. Our main research objective is to design and implement effective and efficient outlier detection techniques for WSNs to identify outliers in an online and distributed manner and distinguish between errors and events with high accuracy and low false alarm, while maintaining the communication, computation and memory complexity low. Main contributions of this thesis can be summarized as: 1. 	Providing a technique-based taxonomy and a guideline for outlier detection techniques for WSNs. 2. 	Design and comparison of data labelling techniques for performance evaluation of outlier detection techniques. 3. 	Proposing statistical-Based outlier detection techniques for WSNs. 4.

40|$|Biofouling {{presents}} a significant {{obstacle to the}} long-term use of electrochemical sensors in complex media. Drinking water biofilms reduce performance of sensors by insulating electrode surfaces by inter alia inhibiting mass transport. Boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes are relatively resistant to biofouling and inert at high potentials. These qualities can be exploited to create a drinking water <b>quality</b> <b>sensor</b> that resists biofouling to meet performance criteria for longer, and to enable electrochemical cleaning of the sensor surface in situ using high potentials without disconnecting or disassembling the sensor. A purpose-built BDD wall-jet sensor was compared with a glassy carbon (GC) sensor in ability to determine free chlorine, detect biofilm and remove biofilm in situ. It {{was found that the}} BDD produced accurate and reliable readings with a 4. 86 % standard error and a LOD of 0. 18 ppm. The BDD could be electrochemically cleaned in situ whereas this was less successful with the GC electrode. The BDD electrode could also detect electroactive pyocyanin, secreted in the biofilm of the drinking water biofilm indicator organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, potentially enabling biofouling and non-biological fouling such as scaling to be distinguished. Observed changes in flow sensitivity and current-voltage curves that correspond to fouling provide multiple fouling detection methods, resulting in an accurate, sensitive, water <b>quality</b> <b>sensor</b> that can be cleaned without disassembly or replacement of parts and can identify when cleaning is required...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} work evaluates the <b>quality</b> of the <b>sensor</b> to perform measurements and documents {{its effects on}} the performance of the system. It also evaluates if this performance changes due to the environments and other system parameters. These environments and parameters include vibration, system friction, structural resonance, and dynamic system input. The analysis is done by modeling a gimbal camera system that requires angular measurements from inertial sensors and gyros for stabilization. Overall, modeling includes models for four different types of gyros, the gimbal camera system, the drive motor, the motor rate control system, and the angle position control system. Models for friction, structural resonance, and vibration are analyzed, respectively. The system is simulated, for an ideal system, and then includes the more realistic environmental and system parameters. These simulations are run with each of the four types of gyros. The performance analysis depicts that for the ideal system; increasing gyro quality provides better system performance.
