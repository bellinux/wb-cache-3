Quinupristin-dalfopristin was as active as vancomycin against three strains that were susceptible to its streptogramin B component <b>quinupristin,</b> including one strain that was inducibly resistant to erythromycin, but had a significantly decreased activity against two strains that were resistant to <b>quinupristin,</b> for all quinupristin-dalfopristin regimens tested (P < 0. 05). The area under the concentration-time curve for quinupristin-dalfopristin in plasma divided by the MIC of <b>quinupristin</b> was the only parameter retained by multilinear regression that predicted the in vivo activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (P = 0. 0001), emphasizing the importance of determining the susceptibility to <b>quinupristin</b> in order to predict the in vivo activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin against S. aureus...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the activities of}} quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), alone or in combination with rifampin, against three strains of Staphylococcus aureus susceptible to rifampin (MIC, 0. 06 μg/ml) and to Q-D (MICs, 0. 5 to 1 μg/ml) but displaying various phenotypes of resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics: S. aureus HM 1054 was susceptible to <b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin (MICs of 8 and 4 μg/ml, respectively); for S. aureus RP 13, the MIC of dalfopristin was high (MICs of <b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin for strain RP 13, 8 and 32 μg/ml, respectively); and S. aureus HM 1054 R was obtained after conjugative transfer of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin B constitutive resistance to HM 1054, and the MIC of <b>quinupristin</b> for this strain was high (MICs of <b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin, 64 and 4 μg/ml, respectively). In vitro time-kill curve studies showed no difference between Q-D and rifampin, at a concentration of four times the MIC, against the three strains. Rabbits with aortic endocarditis were treated 4 days with Q-D, rifampin, or their combination. In vivo, the combination was highly bactericidal and synergistic against strains susceptible to <b>quinupristin</b> (HM 1054 and RP 13) and sterilized 94 % of the animals. In contrast, the combination was neither synergistic nor bactericidal against the quinupristin-resistant strain (HM 1054 R) and did not prevent the emergence of mutants resistant to rifampin. We conclude that the in vivo synergistic and bactericidal activity of the combination of Q-D and rifampin against S. aureus is predicted {{by the absence of}} resistance to <b>quinupristin</b> but not by in vitro combination studies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{compared}} the in vitro activity of dalfopristin and <b>quinupristin</b> combined with five intravenous antibiotics in a 3 -dimensional model.

That synergy was even better against erythromycin-resistant strains. In combination with tigecycline or fosfomycin, the antibacterial activity could be consistently enhanced with the same decrease of inhibitory concentrations. A synergy was also observed, less regularly and at a lower level, with rifampin, gentamicin or vancomycin.

40|$|RP 59500 {{is a new}} {{injectable}} streptogramin {{composed of}} two synergistic components (<b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin) which are active against erythromycin-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. The present experiments compared the therapeutic efficacy of RP 59500 with that of vancomycin against experimental endocarditis due to either of two erythromycin-susceptible or two constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RP 59500 had low MICs for the four test organisms {{as well as for}} 24 additional isolates (the MIC at which 90 % of the isolates were inhibited was or = 6 h for <b>quinupristin),</b> since successful treatment was restored by artificially prolonging the dalfopristin levels for 6 h. Thus, RP 59500 is a promising alternative to vancomycin against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections, provided that pharmacokinetic parameters are adjusted to afford prolonged levels of both of its constituents in serum.

In vitro, intracellular replication of tachyzoites was inhibited by synercid {{and each of}} its two components. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations of synercid, <b>quinupristin,</b> and dalfopristin were 1. 6, 2. 7, and 6. 3 μg/ml, respectively. Thus, synercid was markedly more active than its components. Treatment of acutely infected mice with 100 or 200 mg of synercid per kg of body weight per day administered intraperitoneally for 10 days resulted in survival of 50 % (P = 0. 0002) and 100 % (P < 0. 0001) of infected mice, respectively, whereas all control mice died by day 18. In contrast, treatment with 200 mg of either <b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin per kg per day alone resulted in only 20 % survival; treatment with 50 mg of either drug per kg per day resulted only in the prolongation of time to death.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{of resistance to}} the streptogramin antibiotics <b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin was studied in a Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate selected under quinupristin-dalfopristin therapy, in four derivatives of S. aureus RN 4220 selected in vitro, and in a mutant selected in a model of rabbit aortic endocarditis. For all strains the MICs of erythromycin, <b>quinupristin,</b> and quinupristin-dalfopristin were higher than those for the parental strains but the MICs of dalfopristin and lincomycin were similar. Portions of genes for domains II and V of 23 S rRNA and the genes for ribosomal proteins L 4 and L 22 were amplified and sequenced. All mutants contained insertions or deletions in a protruding β hairpin {{that is part of the}} conserved C terminus of the L 22 protein and that interacts with 23 S rRNA. Susceptible S. aureus RN 4220 was transformed with plasmid DNA encoding the L 22 alteration, resulting in transformants that were erythromycin and <b>quinupristin</b> resistant.

40|$|The {{influence}} of inducible cross-resistance to macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramin B (MLS(B)) type antibiotics (inducible MLS(B) phenotype) on {{the activity of}} quinupristin-dalfopristin was investigated against Enterococcus faecium in vitro and in rabbits with experimental endocarditis. In vitro, quinupristin-dalfopristin displayed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against a MLS(B) -susceptible strain similar to those against two strains with the inducible MLS(B) phenotype. In addition, induction of the two MLS(B) -resistant strains with <b>quinupristin</b> (0. 016 to 1 microg/ml) or quinupristin-dalfopristin (0. 08 to 0. 25 microg/ml) increased the MICs of <b>quinupristin</b> from 8 microg/ml to 32 to > 128 microg/ml, but did not modify the MIC of dalfopristin (2 microg/ml) or quinupristin-dalfopristin (0. 5 microg/ml). In a rabbit endocarditis model, quinupristin-dalfopristin was as active as amoxicillin against the MLS(B) -susceptible E. faecium strain. In contrast, the activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was significantly decreased in animals infected with {{either of the two}} inducible MLS(B) -resistant strains (P < 0. 05), although no mutants resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin were detected. Against the clinical strain with the inducible MLS(B) phenotype, quinupristin-dalfopristin was not effective and was less active than amoxicillin (P < 0. 001); however, the activity of the combination of amoxicillin and dalfopristin-quinupristin was superior to that of amoxicillin (P < 0. 01). The different impact of the inducible MLS(B) phenotype in E. faecium on the activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin in vitro and in experimental endocarditis {{may be related to the}} reduced diffusion of dalfopristin compared with that of <b>quinupristin</b> into cardiac vegetations that we previously reported.

40|$|The semisynthetic {{streptogramin}} antibiotic quinupristin/dalfopristin (trade name Synercid, Aventis Pharma) is {{a mixture}} of the A-type streptogramin dalfopristin and the B-type streptogramin <b>quinupristin,</b> a capped hexapeptide macrolactone. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was developed to combat multidrug resistant pathogens, but suffers from its own problems with drug resistance. Virginiamycin B lyase (Vgb) inactivates the <b>quinupristin</b> component of Synercid by lactone ring opening. Remarkably, the enzyme promotes this reaction by intramolecular β-elimination without the involvement of a water molecule. Recently, structures of S. aureus Vgb in the presence and absence of substrate were reported and used together with detailed mutagenesis data to suggest a catalytic mechanism. Here, we report an independent determination of the S. cohnii Vgb crystal structure and a biochemical characterization of the enzyme. As expected, the S. cohnii and S. aureus Vgb structures and active sites are very similar. Moreover, both enzymes catalyze <b>quinupristin</b> lactone ring opening with similar rate constants, albeit perhaps with different dependencies on divalent metal ions. Replacement of the conserved active site residues His 228, Glu 268, or His 270 with alanine reduces or abolishes S. cohnii Vgb activity.

We found here that the background fluorescence of unbound <b>quinupristin</b> is 10 -fold lower than that of unbound virginiamycin S, a natural group B molecule often used experimentally. The association constants were found (i) to be similar for the binding of the two group B molecules to tightly coupled 70 S ribosomes {{in the absence of the}} group A molecules (quinupristin: 3. 5 x 10 (7) M- 1; virginiamycin S: 2. 8 x 10 (7) M- 1) and (ii) to similarly increase about 20 -fold in the presence of the corresponding group A molecule (<b>quinupristin</b> + dalfopristin: 69 x 10 (7) M- 1; virginiamycin S + virginiamycin M: 60 x 107 M- 1). Similar results were obtained with 50 S ribosomal subunits.

The authors describe the role of the lactococcal secondary multidrug transporter LmrP in the resistance to a broad range of clinically important antibiotics. Cells expressing LmrP display an increased resistance to the lincosamide, streptogramin, tetracycline and 14 - and 15 -membered macrolide antibiotics. The streptogramin antibiotic <b>quinupristin,</b> present in the fourth-generation antibiotic RP 59500, can inhibit LmrP-mediated Hoechst 33342 transport, but is not transported by LmrP, indicating that <b>quinupristin</b> acts as a modulator of LmrP activity. LmrP-expressing Lactococcus lactis cells in which a protonmotive force is generated accumulate significantly less tetracycline than control cells without LmrP expression. In contrast, LmrP-expressing and control cells accumulate equal amounts of tetracycline in the absence of metabolic energy. These findings demonstrate that the increased antibiotic resistance in LmrP-expressing cells {{is a result of the}} active extrusion of antibiotics from the cell...|$|E

The pharmacokinetic profiles of single intravenous doses of this combination streptogramin antibiotic of 7. 5 mg/kg of body weight were characterized for eight noninfected patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Comparison was made to pharmacokinetic profiles determined for eight healthy volunteers matched by age, sex, and race. Drug was measured in dialysate up to 6 h following the dose. Plasma and dialysate were assayed for parent compounds and metabolites. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters were compared between groups. No statistically significant differences were observed between groups for maximal concentrations in plasma, times to maximal concentration, areas under the curve, distribution volumes, rates of total body clearance, or half-lives in plasma for <b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin. No statistically significant differences were observed in maximal concentrations in plasma, times to maximal concentration, areas under the curve, or half-lives for cysteine, the glutathione conjugates of <b>quinupristin,</b> or the pristinamycin IIA metabolite of dalfopristin. The measurements in dialysate of the parent and most metabolites were below the expected MICs. Dialysis clearance was insignificant. Quinupristin-dalfopristin was well tolerated in both groups, causing only mild adverse events that resolved prior to discharge from the study.

Circumstantial evidence suggested {{that at least some}} M. abscessus isolates might be inducibly resistant to macrolides. Thus, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the macrolide phenotype of M. abscessus clinical isolates. Inducible resistance to clarithromycin (MIC > 32 μg/ml) was found for 7 of 10 clinical isolates of M. abscessus previously considered susceptible; the remaining 3 isolates were deemed to be susceptible (MIC ≤ 0. 5 μg/ml). Inducible resistance was conferred by a novel erm gene, erm(41), which was present in all 10 isolates and in an isolate of Mycobacterium bolletii (M. abscessus type II). However, the erm(41) alleles were nonfunctional in the three susceptible M. abscessus isolates. No evidence of erm(41) was found in Mycobacterium chelonae, and an isolate of Mycobacterium massiliense appeared to be an erm(41) deletion mutant. Expression of erm(41) in M. abscessus conferred resistance to clarithromycin and erythromycin and the ketolide HMR 3004.

Mutants selected in the presence of clindamycin and telithromycin harbored a single amino acid change (H 70 R or H 70 L, respectively) in ribosomal protein L 4, whereas insertions of one, two, or three adjacent glycines at position 60 (M. pneumoniae numbering) were selected in the presence of both streptogramin combinations. Telithromycin was the sole antibiotic that selected for substitutions (P 112 R and A 114 T) and deletions (111 IPRA 114) in ribosomal protein L 22. Three sequential mutational events in 23 S rRNA and in both ribosomal proteins were required to categorize the strain as resistant to the ketolide. Azithromycin and erythromycin A were the only selector antibiotics that remained active (MICs, 0. 06 and 1 μg/ml, respectively) on their mutants selected after 50 passages...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Treatment {{of chronic}} or {{recurrent}} Staphylococcus aureus infections may require using antibiotics with activity against intracellular multiresistant organisms. Quinupristin/dalfopristin (3 : 7) has been {{examined in this}} context. Methods <b>Quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin were used separately or mixed. Strains used were: (i) methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA); (ii) one vat(B) MSSA and msr(A/B) MRSA; (iii) erm(A) (+) [MSSA, MRSA, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) ]; and (iv) one erm(A/B) (+) cfr(+) MRSA resistant to <b>quinupristin,</b> dalfopristin and their combination. Assessment of activity was determined by: (i) MICs (CLSI method); and (ii) concentration-response curves in broth and after phagocytosis by THP- 1 macrophages, with descriptors of the model (E(min)) and the pharmacodynamic response [maximal relative efficacy (E(max)), relative potency (EC(50)) and apparent static concentration (C(static)) ]. Results erm(A) -positive strains were all susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin (except strain CM 05), with MICs not adversely influenced by acid pH or by the MRSA, VISA or VRSA character of the strain. In concentration-response experiments, quinupristin/dalfopristin showed similar patterns for all strains (except strain CM 05), with a > 3 log(10) cfu decrease in broth and a 1. 3 [erm(A) strain] to 2. 6 [fully susceptible, vat(B) and msr(A/B) strains] log(10) cfu decrease for intracellular bacteria at the maximal extracellular concentration tested (25 mg/L). Maximal extracellular and intracellular activity was obtained for a quinupristin/dalfopristin ratio of 3 : 7. For strain CM 05, quinupristin/dalfopristin was static in all conditions. Conclusions Based on historical comparisons with rifampicin, fluoroquinolones, lipoglycopeptides and other antistaphylococcal drugs with a large accumulation in eukaryotic cells, quinupristin/dalfopristin appears {{to be one of}} the most active antibiotics against intracellular S. aureus studied in this model so far, largely irrespective of its resistance phenotype...|$|E
40|$|During 2005 - 2006, a {{total of}} 865 Enterococcus faecium {{isolated}} from patients from eight Greek hospitals were tested for susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D). Among them, 250 genetically unrelated strains (28. 9 %) {{were found to be}} intermediate-resistant to Q/D (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1. 5 - 4 mg/L); all were resistant to dalfopristin (MIC = 16 - 64 mg/L), whilst 69 % were resistant to <b>quinupristin,</b> carrying the ermB gene. No strain was found to carry any of the known genes, such as vatE and vatD, involved in Q/D resistance, indicating that a non-transferable undetermined mechanism is responsible for the expression of low-level Q/D resistance. The high percentage of Q/D-intermediate-resistant E. faecium in Greece was not associated with prior consumption of the agent or with the veterinary use of virginiamycin. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.

40|$|Objectives: (i) To {{determine}} the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of ABT- 773, a novel keto-lide, against sensitive and erythromycin-resistant pneumococci; (ii) to subdivide erythromycin-resistant pneumococci into resistance phenotypes, more extensive than the conventional M and MLSB groups, by assessing susceptibilities to, and interactions between, erythromycin (14 -membered macrolide), clindamycin (lincosamide), rokitamycin (16 -membered macrolide), ABT- 773 (ketolide), <b>quinupristin</b> (streptogramin B) and dalfopristin (streptogramin A). Methods: MICs and MBCs of ABT- 773 were determined for 165 strains of pneumococci (113 resistant to erythromycin). Extended phenotypes for the erythromycin-resistant strains were {{described in terms}} of intrinsic susceptibility to, and induction of resistance by, the anti-biotics listed above. Results: Erythromycin-resistant strains could be divided into 10 extended phenotypes (desig-nated II–XI), two of which (II and IX) predominated. ABT- 773 at 0. 12 mg/L inhibited 109 strains (median 0. 03 mg/L). MICs for the other four strains (of phenotypes X and XI) were 0. 25 – 1 mg/L. MICs were only slighter higher when measured on agar in CO 2 than by the NCCLS method (in broth in air). MBCs were usually ≤ 2 × MIC, but for 10 strains (eight of phenotype X, one each o...|$|E
40|$|RP 59500, a {{combination}} of the streptogramins <b>quinupristin</b> and dalfopristin, and sparfloxacin are new antibiotics with good in vitro activities against Enterococcus faecium, which is an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen with resistance to multiple antimicrobials. Since fluoroquinolones and related macrolides have displayed high intracellular concentrations inside host cells, we evaluated the intracellular activities of these agents inside neutrophils against three strains each of vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEF) and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VREF). At concentrations equal to four times the MIC, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin decreased the number of intracellular VSEF organisms, while both antibiotics were at best bacteriostatic against intracellular VREF strains. At concentrations equal to one-fourth of the MIC, both antibiotics were bacteriostatic against intracellular VSEF strains but were ineffective in inhibiting the growth of VREF strains. Despite their anticipated markedly higher intracellular human neutrophil (PMN) concentrations, RP 59500 and sparfloxacin activities in medium alone were equal to or greater than those inside PMNs against almost all strains. We conclude that the intracellular PMN concentrations of these antibiotics may not be directly related to their intracellular activities in our assay. The reason for the differences in their activities against VSEF versus VREF remains undefined...|$|E
