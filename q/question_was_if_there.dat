40|$|ICD- 10 and DSM-IV {{differ in}} their {{definitions}} of delirium. The DSM-IV definition centers around a disorder of attention and cognitive functions, whereas ICD- 10 describes delirium as a broader neuropsychological and psychopathological syndrome, e. g. hallucinations, emotional and psychomotor disorder. When neuropsychological and psychopathological symptoms of delirium are assessed simultaneously, our <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are core symptoms of delirium, i. e. neuropsychological and psychopathological symptoms. The approach is to identify core symptoms of delirium 1. by a high interrelation, 2. and furthermore core symptoms of delirium should show this interrelation consistently across different etiological groups of delirium. There are consistent correlations between psychopathological symptoms of delirium and neuropsychological findings of cognitive deficits. These consistent correlations seem to be largely restricted to {{the domain of the}} disorder of awareness and reagibility and are not found in a systematic way for symptoms in the fields of associated features of delirium like emotional, vegetative or circadiane disorders...|$|E

The {{objective of the}} present study was to evaluate the damage modes and the extent of damage observed on CFR-PEEK hinge mechanism articulation components after in vivo service in a rotating hinge knee (RHK) system and to compare the results with corresponding components subjected to in vitro wear tests. Key <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were any similarities or differences between in vivo and in vitro damage characteristics. Twelve retrieved RHK systems after an average of 34. 9 months in vivo underwent wear damage analysis with focus on the four integrated CFR-PEEK components and distinction between different damage modes and classification with a scoring system. The analysis included visual examination, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, as well as surface roughness and profile measurements. The main wear damage modes were comparable between retrieved and in vitro specimens (n= 3), whereby the size of affected area on the retrieved components showed a higher variation. Overall, the retrieved specimens seemed to be slightly heavier damaged which was probably attributable to the more complex loading and kinematic conditions in vivo...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we tried to answer the {{question}} what the effect is of quality of the sibling relation (warmth/closeness, relative status/power and conflict) on externalizing problem behaviour of early adolescents. An additional <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> were differences between gender combinations (sisters, brothers and mixed-sex sibling pairs) in these effects. The research showed that relative status/power has a negative connection with externalizing problem behaviour. Conflict has a positive connection with externalizing problem behaviour. Sisters scored the highest on warmth/closeness, which means that they have a warmer sibling relationship than brothers and mixed-sex sibling pairs. Furthermore, brothers had a significant higher score on conflict than sisters. There are differences between the three gender combinations with regard to the effect of quality of the sibling relation on externalizing problem behaviour. Firstly, the effect of relative status/power on externalizing problem behaviour is higher for brothers than for sisters and mixed-sex sibling pairs. Secondly, the effect of conflict on externalizing problem behaviour is higher for brothers and sisters than for mixed-sex sibling pairs. 	The results of this research show that quality of the sibling relation is an important predictor of externalizing problem behaviour.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{conference of the}} Swedish Network for European Legal Studies in Stockholm on March 22 and 23 was to detect and {{evaluate}} general principles of European community law. The conference was a follow up to the 1999 Malmö conference on the subject and the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> had been any new development. In 1999 general principles of Community law was discussed {{from the perspective of}} human rights and administrative law. This time the purpose was broadened and included consequences of the enlargement of the Union and if general principles were emerging, which could impact the sphere of private law. The discussion on general principles has primarily been driven by lawyers specialized in Constitutional and European law. The fact that this time “less experienced” (in the field!) private law lawyers and lawyers from new Member States participated, added new dimensions, perspectives and questions: What is a general principle, how does it develop and what impact does it have. This article argues that the question of general principles is not just a question of detecting important principles of Community law, but that the development signifies an ongoing convergence of interpretation of the law, which will harmonize understanding between civil and common law countries. First of all, the article will define the general principles in private law. Secondly, it will analyze the impact of the general principles on private law within the European Court of Justice (ECJ) case-law...|$|E

In this study the maximum aerobic performance (defined as V_O 2 max) of people working on a moving floor was established compared to the maximal aerobic performance on a non-moving floor. The main <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was any difference in maximal aerobic performance determined on a moving floor versus a non-moving floor? It was also interesting {{to know whether the}} efficiency on moving plat-form decreased versus the efficiency of work on a non-moving floor? Eight physically fit subjects participated in this study. In a balanced design the subjects started either with an incremental maximal performance test on a cycle ergometer in moving or a non-moving ship motion simulator (SMS). The maximal aerobic performance expressed as the maximum oxygen consumption (V_O 2 max) was decreased in the moving SMS. There {{was no significant difference in}} maximal attained power and heart rate however. Also the efficiency did not differ significantly between both conditions. The conclusion is that maximal performance on a moving platform under moving conditions showed a tendency to decrease and this was attained with a significantly decreased V_O 2 max. Such a result was not expected, because additional muscle work for maintaining balance should show an equal or increased V_O 2 max. The decrease is proba-bly the result of an increase in the anaerobic metabolism for maintaining the balance during ship motions. Although an increase in blood lactate was not found...|$|E

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1990 {{droppings}} of a population of Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis were collected that {{could be attributed to}} observed geese. The observations revealed whether droppings were produced by males, females and young and to which family they belonged. In the zoological laboratory in Haren of the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen faecal analyses of the droppings of 10 selected families were executed during 1993. The diet composition of the geese were deduced by means of the data thus deduced. Subsequently several questions were examined with the aid of computational models of plant-ecology. The questions whether there are differences between the composition of the diets of males,females and juveniles was confirmed. Juveniles eat far more horsetail than the adults do. This difference was so big that it was even significant for the period of 3 July up to 17 August whereas this difference was actually solely caused by the difference in the period of 3 July up to 12 July. Juveniles eat on the contrary less Mosses than the adults do. The second question whether there is a trend in the course of time is also positively answered. The percentage of Salix decreases for adults and young, the percentage of Mosses decreases for adults and the percentage of Equisetum decreases for young. The percentages of Graminoids and the Rest group increases over the season for young and the percentage of Graminoids for adults is highest at the end of July. The third <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a difference between the diets of large families and the diet of small families. The adults in small families eat far more Mosses than the adults in the larger families do. The juveniles of the large families eat much more of the rest group than the juveniles of the small families. Both differences seem to be of benefit for the geese. ...|$|E
40|$|Individuals need {{to adapt}} to their local {{environment}} in order to survive. When selection pressures differ in local populations, polymorphism can evolve. Colour polymorphism {{is one of the}} most obvious polymorphisms since it is readily observable. Different sources of colouration exist, but melanin-based colouration {{is one of the most}} common in birds. The melanocortin system produces this colouration and because the melanocortin system has pleiotropic effects on behavioural and physiological traits, it is a good candidate to be an underlying mechanism to explain the maintenance of colour polymorphism. In this thesis I studied three different raptors which all display melanin-based colouration; barn owls (Tyto alba), tawny owls (Strix aluco) and Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus). The main <b>question</b> <b>was</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> was a relationship between melanin-based colouration and individual behavioural differences. The underlying hypothesis is that colour could be a signal of certain adaptive traits. Our goal was to find evolutionary explanations for the persistence of colour polymorphism. I found that nestling kestrels and barn owls differ in anti-predatory behaviour, with respect to their melanic colouration (chapters 1 and 2). Darker individuals show less reaction to human handling, but in kestrels aggression and colouration are related in opposite ways than in barn owls. More reddish barn owls travel greater distances in natal dispersal and this behaviour is repeatable between parents and same sex offspring (chapter 3). Dark reddish tawny owls defend their nests more intensely against intruders and appear to suffer less from nest predation (chapter 4). Finally I show that polymorphism in the Melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC 1 R), which is strongly correlated with reddish colouration in the barn owl, is related to natal dispersal distance, providing a first indication for a genetic basis of the relation between this behaviour and colouration (chapter 5). My results demonstrate a clear link between melanin-based colouration and animal personality traits. I demonstrated this relation in three different species, which shows there is most likely a general underlying mechanism responsible. Different predation pressures might have shaped the reactions to predation, but also differences in sex-related colouration. Male-like and female-like colouration might signal more or less aggressive behaviour. Fluctuating environmental conditions might cause different individual strategies to produce equal reproductive success. The melanocortin system with its pleiotropic effects might be an underlying mechanism, as suggested by the results from the genetic polymorphism, the similar results found in these three species and by the similar relations reported in other species. This thesis demonstrates that colouration and individual differences are correlated and it provides the first glimpse of an underlying system. We can now conduct a more directed search for underlying mechanisms and evolutionary explanations with the use of quantitative genetic methods...|$|E

Epigenetische Modifikationen bieten eine {{plausible}} Verbindung zwischen der Umwelt und Veränderungen in der Genexpression. Besonderes Interesse gilt den Methyldonatoren, die eine funktionelle Gruppe abgeben, und dadurch die Histonmodifikationen und die Chromatinstruktur beeinflussen können.

Epigenetics is a {{young and}} increasing field of Research, and provides the possibility to change the epigenome through certain nutritional influences, like Methyldonors. Methyldonors are Folic acid, Vitamin B 6, Betaine, Choline and Vitamin B 12. Without a doubt, {{there is a relationship}} between these nutritional factors. It has been proven that Methyldonors can modify the DNA-Sequence without altering the DNA itself. That rises the intrest, that certain nutritional influences can change the DNA - Sequenz through modifying the Chromatinstrucuture and Histontails, because a Methyldonor can provide the Methylgroup in the One Carbon Metabolism and influences therefore the Genexpression. Methyldonors are admitted through Food products, and can even be supplemented.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the present}} paper is to perform a {{comprehensive}} study of the covariance structures in balanced linear models containing random factors which are invariant with respect to marginal permutations of the random factors. We shall focus on model formulation and interpretation rather than the estimation of parameters. It is proven that permutation invariance implies a specific structure for the covariance matrices. Useful results are obtained for the spectra of permutation invariant covariance matrices. In particular, the reparameterization of random effects, i. e., imposing certain constraints, will be considered. There are many possibilities to choose reparameterization constraints in a linear model, however not every reparameterization keeps permutation invariance. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> natural restrictions on the random effects in a given model, i. e., such reparameterizations which are defined by the covariance structure of the corresponding factor. Examining relationships between the reparameterization conditions applied to the random factors of the models and the spectrum of the corresponding covariance matrices when permutation invariance is assumed, restrictions on the spectrum of the covariance matrix are obtained which lead to “sum-to-zero” reparameterization of the corresponding factor...|$|R
