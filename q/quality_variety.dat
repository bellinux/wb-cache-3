The Salamino and Sorbara varieties tend to produce the most acidic wines. One of the reasons why Sorbara tends to produce the highest quality Lambrusco is the tendency of the vine to drop its flowers, which reduces fruit yields and concentrates flavors.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} dynamic general {{equilibrium}} model of education, <b>quality</b> and <b>variety</b> innovation, and scale-invariant growth. The early endogenous innovation-based growth models incorporate a scale e?ect predicting that larger economies are characterized by higher per capita growth rates.

In contrast to the predecessor models, this paper argues that endogenous human-capital accumulation rather than an exogenously given continuing increase {{of the population is}} decisive for per capita growth. The consequence of the proposed integration of human capital accumulation into a two-R&D-sector model of <b>quality</b> and <b>variety</b> innovation is that education and innovation appear as twin-engines of growth and that steady state growth rates can be enhanced by subsidizing education. - education; <b>quality</b> and <b>variety</b> innovation; scale-invariant growt...|$|R

The monopolist uses variety to increase the profitability of price discrimination across product lines of different qualities, by increasing the likelihood consumers choose high price products among products yielding the same utility. We show that the number of varieties offered by the monopolist is greater than the social optimum. The predictions of the model are supported by an analysis of the market for cars.
