In May 2004, the Fifty-seventh World Health Assembly supported the creation of the World Alliance for Patient Safety which aims to coordinate, spread and accelerate improvements in patient safety worldwide. The <b>Forward</b> <b>Programme</b> 2005 of the World Alliance for Patient safety sets out an important and comprehensive programme of international work in areas such as reporting and learning, patient involvement and safety solutions. The experience of other high risk industries, suggests that patient safety problems are primarily a function of deficiencies in system design, organization and operation. Understanding and improving the design of processes, structures and culture of health care delivery is therefore central to making care safer. A number of core challenges emerge across many European countries including the need to continue to build strong political will and commitment to address patient safety problems, stronger engagement and leadership from health care professionals, and promoting positive cultural changes with health care...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{establish}} that there exist suitable objective functions for mathematical programming formulations of dynamic user equilibrium assignment in the sense of Wardrop (1952). Recently, Lin and Lo (2000) showed that we cannot necessarily calculate a dynamic user equilibrium assignment by minimising the integral over time of Beckmann's objective function that is widely used to solve for static user equilibrium assignment. In the present paper, two distinct objective functions are presented that result from formulations of assignment either as a variational inequality or as an infinitesimal optimisation: each of these formulations can be solved as a <b>forward</b> dynamic <b>programme.</b> With these formulations and solution approaches, we solve an example based upon Lin and Lo's one correctly. ...|$|R
