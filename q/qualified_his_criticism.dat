5000|$|Brian Collins of Badass Digest starts {{by saying}} he was {{disappointed}} with the episode [...] "aping one of the series' best" [...] but then <b>qualified</b> <b>his</b> <b>criticism</b> by saying Dan Harmon undertook this sequel as a [...] "fuck you" [...] to NBC, who hated the original episode in Season 2. [...] Collins recounts Harmon's interview in Rolling Stone where Harmon [...] "admits that the episode was not organic, difficult to write, {{and it would be}} all his fault if it was the worst episode ever." [...] Despite this qualification, Collins said how this episode [...] "never really gelled" [...] for him. He initially praised the episode for delivering on enough laughs, but said the lack of a real conflict and a lukewarm resolution soured the episode for him. He said the stakes were not high enough when compared to the original, and found it difficult to become invested in a vague conflict between Hickey and his son. Unlike many other reviews, Collins was not amused by the Dean and Jeff's subplot saying it was [...] "rather annoying" [...] where the Dean [...] "takes his role as Jeff's son a bit too seriously." [...] He calls the Hickey interrogation of an NPC as a [...] "fun bit," [...] hedging that statement by saying that [...] "scattered moments aren't enough to overcome the fact that the episode has no reason to exist beyond 'let's do D&D again.'" [...] Despite his harsh treatment of the episode, Collins said that the episode [...] "LOOKS good," [...] praising the direction of Joe Russo, who infused the battle [...] "scenes some much needed energy, with his soaring and oft-moving camera giving us a few peeks at previously unseen areas at their apartment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, in {{the context}} of <b>his</b> <b>criticism</b> of {{morality}} and Christianity, expressed, among others works, in On the Genealogy of Morals and in The Antichrist, Nietzsche often criticized humanitarian feelings, detesting how pity and altruism were ways for the [...] "weak" [...] to take power over the [...] "strong". However, he <b>qualified</b> <b>his</b> critique of Christianism as a [...] "particular case" [...] of <b>his</b> <b>criticisms</b> of free will. Along with the rejection of teleology, this critique of free will is one of the common points he shared with Spinoza, whom he qualified as a [...] "precursor". To the [...] "ethics of compassion" [...] (Mitleid, [...] "shared suffering") exposed by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche opposed an [...] "ethics of friendship" [...] or of [...] "shared joy" [...] (Mitfreude).|$|R
