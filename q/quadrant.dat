5|$|By 1973, {{construction}} was progressing {{on the western}} <b>quadrant</b> between I-15 in Murray and SR-201 (at the time US-40A/US-50A). Land acquisition was also taking place {{for the rest of}} the southeastern <b>quadrant</b> between 300 East in Murray and 4600 South in Holladay. However, a citizens' group named Cottonwood Inc. halted right-of-way acquirements due to the lack of an environmental impact statement (EIS). Also controversial was a proposed cloverleaf interchange at 2000 East. By mid-1975, an EIS was released with four main alternatives: a no-build alternative which would leave a gap in the southeast <b>quadrant,</b> building the road along the modern-day path (at about 6400 South), moving the southern portion southwest through Fort Union and Midvale to 7200 South, or extending the eastern portion further south to Sandy and then west along 9000 South. Cottonwood Inc. filed a lawsuit challenging the EIS. Meanwhile, I-215 from SR-201 in the western <b>quadrant</b> to 280 East in Murray opened in November 1976.|$|E
5|$|In {{the pilot}} episode of Voyager, while the crew on the Val Jean seek to evade a Cardassian vessel captained by Gul Evek (Richard Poe) in the Badlands, the vessel is transported some 70,000 light years across the galaxy into the Delta <b>Quadrant</b> by the {{creature}} {{known as the}} Caretaker. After the Federation starship USS Voyager is also trapped in the Delta <b>Quadrant</b> and Tuvok was revealed to be a Starfleet agent, Chakotay agrees with Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) {{to work together to}} find two of their missing crew. Following an attack by the Kazon, Chakotay destroyed the Val Jean to save Voyager and the Maquis crew joined the Federation ship. Chakotay was given a provisional rank of commander and named executive officer, the second-in-command of the vessel and the crew seeks to return home to the Alpha <b>Quadrant.</b>|$|E

Apart from the obvious nationalistic considerations, the Paris meridian was also a sound choice for practical scientific reasons: a portion of the <b>quadrant</b> from Dunkerque to Barcelona (about 1000km, or one-tenth of the total) could be surveyed with start- and end-points at sea level, and that portion was roughly {{in the middle of the}} <b>quadrant,</b> where the effects of the Earth's oblateness were expected to be the largest.|$|E

5|$|A belt route around Salt Lake City {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1955, with the Utah Highway Department (the predecessor to the present-day Utah Department of Transportation) holding hearings concerning construction beginning in early 1958. The southeast <b>quadrant</b> {{of the route}} was originally placed from a junction at proposed I-15 in Murray northeasterly through Murray and Holladay, eventually reaching the east bench at 3900 South. From there, it would have run north toward the mouth of Parley's Canyon at proposed I-80 (at the time US-40). Almost immediately, this plan was met with opposition among local residents in the area. The proposed route would have bisected the primarily residential Holladay suburb, {{as well as the}} southern portion of Murray. After more than two years of hearings and widespread opposition from residents, the Highway Department released their proposed routing in June 1960, which placed the southeast <b>quadrant</b> where it runs today. While quelling criticism from some, others remained in opposition, saying the route was still too intrusive along residential areas. The western <b>quadrant</b> was also admonished for being placed to close to other major arterials. In November 1963, a small, two-lane portion of the northwest <b>quadrant</b> of the belt route opened from Redwood Road (SR-68) in Davis County west and south to 2100 North, north of the Salt Lake City International Airport. This portion of road was extended east to I-15 in North Salt Lake and upgraded to freeway standards by 1969.|$|E

5|$|In the Star Trek universe, {{prior to}} the arrival of Voyager in the Delta <b>Quadrant,</b> {{hostilities}} between the Trabe and the Kazon led to the Trabe keeping them subjugated. Violence between the Kazon was encouraged to limit the risk of them rising up against the Trabe. Before being conquered by the Trabe, the Kazon were the most advanced society in the <b>quadrant.</b> On stardate 2346, Jal Sankur united the sects into the Kazon Order or the Kazon Collective to overthrow the Trabe. The Kazon stole the Trabe's technology and ships and, rather than settle on a new homeworld, became a nomadic species. After achieving independence from the Trabe, the Kazon continued to fight among themselves for control of resources and technology.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose To {{find any}} {{influence}} on prognostic factors of index tumor according to predominant location. Materials and Methods Prostate surgical specimens from 499 patients submitted to radical retropubic prostatectomy were step-sectioned. Each transverse section was subdivided into 2 anterolateral and 2 posterolateral <b>quadrants.</b> Tumor extent was evaluated by a semi-quantitative point-count method. The index tumor (dominant nodule) was recorded as the maximal number of positive {{points of the}} most extensive tumor area from the <b>quadrants</b> and the predominant location was considered anterior (anterolateral <b>quadrants),</b> posterior (posterolateral <b>quadrants),</b> basal (<b>quadrants</b> in upper half of the prostate), apical (<b>quadrants</b> in {{lower half of the}} prostate), left (left <b>quadrants)</b> or right (right <b>quadrants).</b> Time to biochemical recurrence was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier product-limit analysis and prediction of shorter time to biochemical recurrence using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model. Results Index tumors with predominant posterior location were significantly associated with higher total tumor extent, needle and radical prostatectomy Gleason score, positive lymph nodes and preoperative prostate-specific antigen. Index tumors with predominant basal location were significantly associated with higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen, pathological stage higher than pT 2, extra-prostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion. Index tumors with predominant basal location were significantly associated with time to biochemical recurrence in Kaplan-Meier estimates and significantly predicted shorter time to biochemical recurrence on univariate analysis but not on multivariate analysis. Conclusions The study suggests that index tumor predominant location is associated with prognosis in radical prostatectomies, however, in multivariate analysis do not offer advantage over other well-established prognostic factors...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the effects of four specific sit-up exercises on muscular activity of the rectus abdominis. Pairs of surface electrodes were placed unilaterally on four <b>quadrants</b> of the rectus abdominis, delimited by tendinous inscriptions, in four male subjects. Electromyographic (EMG) recordings were taken while the subjects performed four different abdominal exercises. Each abdominal exercise was hypothesized to have a specific effect on one of the four <b>quadrants</b> of the rectus abdominis. The four exercises analyzed were: 1) long lying crunch, 2) bent knee crunch, 3) leg raise, and 4) vertical leg crunch. Analysis of the standardized EMG recordings demonstrated no significant differences in the mean muscle activity between the four different <b>quadrants,</b> in the mean muscle activity between the four different exercises, and in interactions between the exercises and the <b>quadrants</b> of the rectus abdominis. We conclude that none of the four abdominal exercises studied are specific for strengthening individual muscle <b>quadrants</b> of the rectus abdominis...|$|R
