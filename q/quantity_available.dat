Sites include Chuquicamata in Chile, Bingham Canyon Mine in Utah, United States and El Chino Mine in New Mexico, United States.

Copper can also be recovered through the in-situ leach process. Several sites {{in the state of}} Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method.

It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be profit-maximizers, meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.|$|E

The Kriegsmarine was caught unprepared for war, having expected that war would break out in 1945, instead of 1939. The Z Plan was tailored for this assumption, calling for a balanced fleet with a greatly increased number of surface capital ships, including several aircraft carriers. At the time the war began, Dönitz's force included only 57 U-boats, many of them short-range, and only 22 oceangoing Type VIIs. He made do with what he had, while being harassed by Raeder and with Hitler calling on him to dedicate boats to military actions against the British fleet directly. These operations had mixed success; the aircraft carrier [...] and battleship [...] were sunk, battleships [...] damaged and [...] sunk {{at a cost of}} some U-boats, diminishing the small <b>quantity</b> <b>available</b> even further.

Three scenarios were studied where the available biomass was converted to different energy carriers; heat, electricity and vehicle fuel. Two levels of biomass supply were studied for each scenario: 1) potential biomass <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> for energy conversion received from forestry, non-forest land, forest industry and municipality; 2) the same quantities as in case 1 plus the potential biomass <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> for energy conversion received from agriculture.

The maximum amounts of hydrogen or methanol which may be produced via gasification of the same biomass amounts excluding black liquor were 241. 5 PJ/year (67. 1 TWh/year) or 197. 2 PJ/year (54. 8 TWh/year) respectively.

A high degree of market transparency can result in disintermediation due to the buyer's increased knowledge of supply pricing.|$|E
