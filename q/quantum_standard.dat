40|$|Precision {{measurements}} of the quantum Hall resistance with alternating current (ac) in the kHz range were performed on epitaxial graphene {{in order to assess}} its suitability as a <b>quantum</b> <b>standard</b> of impedance. The quantum Hall plateaus measured with alternating current were found to be flat within one part in 10 ^ 7. This is much better than for plain GaAs quantum Hall devices and shows that the magnetic-flux-dependent capacitive ac losses of the graphene device are less critical. The observed frequency dependence of about - 8 x 10 ^- 8 /kHz is comparable in absolute value to the positive frequency dependence of plain GaAs devices, but the negative sign is attributed to stray capacitances which we believe can be minimized by a careful design of the graphene device. Further improvements thus may lead to a simpler and more user-friendly <b>quantum</b> <b>standard</b> for both resistance and impedance...|$|E

40|$|It is {{theoretically}} {{possible to}} combine several Hall bars in arrays to define new <b>quantum</b> <b>standards</b> with perfectly quantized resistance values. We have thus, {{for the first}} time, developed and fabricated novel Quantum Hall Array Resistance Standards (QHARS) made {{of a large number}} N (N= 100, 50) of Hall bars placed in parallel using a triple connections technique. The Hall resistance of these <b>quantum</b> <b>standards</b> is found to be very well quantized. On the i= 2 Hall plateau, the resistance of specific good arrays stays equal to RK/ 2 N within 5 parts in 10 ^ 9 for supplying currents up to 2 mA at a 1. 3 K temperature. The mean longitudinal resistance of the Hall bars which constitute the arrays has been determined through the analysis of the array equivalent electrical circuit. This measurement shows that the carrier transport in the Hall bars is dissipation-less. This work therefore demonstrates the efficiency of the multiple connections technique and consequently that QHARS are likely to extend the QHE metrological applications.

The study of the highest or lowest records constitute the study of extreme values. This paper represents an exploration of record statistics for certain aspects of the classical and <b>quantum</b> <b>standard</b> map. For instance the momentum square or energy records is shown to behave like that of records in random walks when the classical standard map is in a regime of hard chaos. However different power laws is observed for the mixed phase space regimes. The presence of accelerator modes are well-known to create anomalous diffusion and we notice here that the record statistics is very sensitive to their presence.

40|$|A {{continuous}} complex {{rotation of}} time t t-iθ {{is shown to}} smooth out the huge fluctuations that characterise chaotic tunnelling. This is illustrated in the kicked rotor model (<b>quantum</b> <b>standard</b> map) where {{the period of the}} map is complexified: the associated chaotic classical dynamics, if significant for θ= 0, is blurred out long before the Wick rotation is completed (θ=π/ 2). The influence of resonances on tunnelling rates weakens exponentially as θ increases from zero, all the more rapidly the sharper the fluctuations. The long range fluctuations can therefore be identified in a deterministic way without ambiguity. When the last ones have been washed out, tunnelling recovers the (quasi-) integrable exponential behaviour governed by the action of a regular instanton. Comment: 4 figure...|$|E
