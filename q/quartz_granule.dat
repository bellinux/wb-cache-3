40|$|Abstract. Different dosages of BN-B 4 C {{compound}} additive {{have been}} introduced for preparing specimen with fused <b>quartz</b> <b>granule</b> (d 50 = 10 µm). Fused quartz ceramic materials were fabricated in reduction atmosphere at various temperatures for 1 h. The characterizations were carried out by thermal expansion ratio, apparent porosity, cold modulus of rupture (CMOR) and SEM {{as well as by}} X-ray diffraction (XRD). The effect of BN-B 4 C on the sintering, crystallization and properties of fused quartz was investigated. The result reveals that with increase of the temperature, the apparent porosity and CMOR of specimens decrease. The specimen C sintered at 1300 °C possessed a maximum CMOR (22. 31 MPa). The specimen C sintered at 1350 °C has more compact microstructure. The lowest thermal expansion ratio of the specimens sintered at various temperatures was obtained when the dosages of compound additive is 3 %. With increasing BN-B 4 C content, the role on inhibiting crystallization was improved. The specimens containing 3 wt % BN-B 4 C had obvious effect on inhibiting crystallization of the specimens sintered at various temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The Cambrian Mt. Simon Sandstone (MSS) is a {{possible}} unconventional gas reservoir in the Illinois, Michigan, and Appalachian Basins, but comparatively {{little is known about}} the unit. This study used core and well logs from two deep exploratory wells to interpret the depositional environment of the MSS under western Ohio, where the MSS is about 120 m thick and found 1060 m below ground surface. In western Ohio, the MSS unconformably overlies the Precambrian Middle Run Formation, is conformably overlain by the Cambrian Eau Claire Formation, and has a distinctive gamma-ray log-signature. In well DGS- 2627, the MSS consists of tan, friable, moderately sorted, rounded, coarse- to very coarse-grained siliceous quartz arenite with minor heterolithic sandstone-mudstone couplets (rhythmites) and <b>quartz</b> <b>granule</b> conglomerate. Features indicative of tidally-influenced, shallow marine settings include tidal rhythmites, lenticular-, flaser-, and wavy-bedding, herringbone cross-bedding, mud-drapes, tidal bundles, reactivation surfaces, intraclasts, and bioturbation. The unit generally coarsens- and thickens-upward, and is interpreted as migration of a tidally-influenced transgressive barrier sequence. A subsurface facies model for the MSS is developed by interpreting geophysical logs and cores from DGS- 2627 l, and this model is semi-quantitatively tested by first interpreting well BP- 4 using geophysical logs alone, then confirming the results using core...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fused <b>quartz</b> <b>granule</b> (d 50 = 0. 033 mm) {{was used}} as raw material, Pr 6 O 11, Sm 2 O 3, Gd 2 O 3, Dy 2 O 3 and Ho 2 O 3 were used as {{additives}} with dosage of 2 % each. Fused quartz ceramic materials were fabricated in reduction atmosphere at 1300 °C, 1400 °C and 1500 °C for 1 h. Samples were examined apparent porosity, bending strength, thermal expansion rate (RT~ 1200 °C), and analyzed by XRD and SEM. The results indicated that additives Pr 6 O 11, Sm 2 O 3 and Dy 2 O 3 had a bit inhibiting effect on crystallization of fused quartz sintered at 1300 °C and 1400 °C, Ho 2 O 3 and Gd 2 O 3 had more inhibiting effect on crystallization in samples sintered at various temperatures, sample containing Ho 2 O 3 had least thermal expansion rate. Pr 6 O 11, Sm 2 O 3 and Dy 2 O 3 had few facilitating effect on sintering, Gd 2 O 3 and Ho 2 O 3 had more facilitating effect on sintering of fused quartz ceramic materials, samples with Gd 2 O 3 and Ho 2 O 3 had lower apparent porosity and higher bending strength and more compact microstructure. It can be deduced that Gd 2 O 3 and Ho 2 O 3 play the excellent role as the crystallization inhibitor to fused quartz materials...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Silurian and Devonian {{rocks are}} exposed for {{approximately}} 8 square kilometers inthe KootenayArc structural province of northeastem Washington. These Middle Paleozoic rocks overlie the Upper Cambrian Metaline Limestone and the Ordovician Ledbetter Formation, which includes slates, siltstones, and limestones. Two Silurian units crop {{out in this}} area. Unit A is composed of Lower Silurian graptolitic argillites and siltstones and Upper Silurian siltstones and fossiliferous limestone. These lithologies represent a trend towards shallower water conditions than those operative during deposition of the Ledbetter Formation. Above Unit A lies the <b>quartz</b> <b>granule</b> conglomerate Unit. This unit consists of a silica rich granule conglomerate with associated beds of slate and is interpreted as an inner submarine fan deposit. Devonian rocks are found locally at Limestone Hill. The polymictic Givetian limestone conglomerate crops out {{at the base of}} the bill. This conglomerate contains limestone clasts of Lower and lower Middle Devonian rocks, thereby documenting a break in the sedimentary record. The Givetian limestone occurs as float fragments of dark-gray limestone, which preserve a diverse conodont fauna. On the crest of Limestone Hill lies the Frasnian massive and bedded lime stones, which are believed to represent a reef build-up. The post-Paleozoic sedimentary record consists of Quaternary glacial deposits. An olivine trachybasalt of probable Tertiary age crops out for a short distance in the central portion of the map area. The region has undergone several periods of deformation of probable Mesozoic age. The structure is dominated by northeast and northerly trending folds, and northeast and northerly trending steeply dipping normal faults...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{procedure}} for the purification, recovery, and determination of isotopic abundances of silicon from biogenic and lithogenic particulate matter and dissolved silicic acid is reported. Purification involves {{the reaction of}} acid molybdate with dissolved silicon in natural waters or that produced by the dissolution of particulate silica by hydrofluoric acid. The resulting silicomolybdic acid is then quantitatively precipitated by reaction with triethylamine hydrochloride. The silicon is recovered as silicon dioxide through stepwise combustion of the dried precipitate. Fluorination of the product for isotopic analysis is accomplished by laser heating under pure fluorine generated by the decomposition of a fluorine-based salt. The resulting silicon tetrafluoride is separated from hydrogen fluoride and other fluorination byproducts cryogenically using a variable-temperature cold trap. Yields for silicon recovery are 99. 9 % for precipitation and greater than 95 % for the purification /fluorination procedure. Reproducibility of the isotopic composition for pure <b>quartz</b> <b>granules</b> processed through the procedure is +_ 0. 1 ‰ for d 30 Si...|$|R
50|$|The Kittatinny Ridge {{was created}} about four {{hundred million years}} ago when a small {{continent}} that was long and thin collided with proto North America. The strike caused folding and faulting which cause the Silurian Shawnagunk conglomerate which is made mostly of quartz, to rise out of a shallow sea. The heat from pressure caused the quartz to bend, and silica melted the <b>quartz</b> <b>granules</b> together along with other stone. Millions of years of erosion from rain, wind, snow, ice shaped the mountain and valley to its present configuration. The Wisconsin glacier which started to form around 21,000 BC and started to melt in 13,000 BC left boulder fields, end moraines and a terminal moraine which starts north of Belvidere and goes east to just south of Great Meadow and continues east to just north of Budd Lake and continues east to Denviile where it goes southeast toward Morristown and goes around {{the south end of}} Great Swamp.|$|R
50|$|The main {{evidence}} for the Alvarez hypothesis that a single impact resulted in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event that killed the dinosaurs {{has come from the}} presence around the world of shocked <b>quartz</b> <b>granules,</b> glass spherules and tektites embedded in a layer of clay with extremely high levels of iridium, all signs of an asteroid impact. Keller's research found layers where the glass spherules and the iridium clay are found separated by as much as 8 ft of sandstone and other material. Supporters of the Alvarez theory believe that the sandstone {{is the result of a}} massive tsunami that sandwiched the sand from the massive waves triggered by the impact between the shocked quartz layer and the iridium clay. Keller's analysis of the strata between the spherules and iridium clay contain signs that the material was laid down over as much as 300,000 years based on signs of plankton, worms and weathering found on the intervening material.|$|R

Fused quartz ceramic materials were fabricated in reduction atmosphere at 1250 °C, 1300 °C, 1350 °C and 1400 °C for 1 h. The apparent porosity, bending strength and thermal expansion ratios of the samples were examined and they were analysed by means of XRD and SEM.

When N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) -stimulated leukocytes were ex-posed to quartz at 3 7 #{ 176 }C,CR 1 was down-regulated but CR 3 was not affected. This was a direct effect on granulo-cytes because it occurred {{in a similar fashion}} when mixed leukocyte suspensions and isolated granulocyte popula-tions were used as targets for quartz. The observed down-regulation by quartz was not affected by the microfilament-disrupting agent cytochalasin B and the total detectable pool of CR! was reduced after quartz ex-posure. When protease inhibitors, such as aprotinin or phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, were present during quartz exposure, the down-regulation of CR! was less pronounced, but {{this was not the case}} not when protease inhibitors such as EDTA-Na 2 and pepstatin were present. Exposure to quartz was not accompanied by a pronounced release of / 3 -glucoronidase (marker for the primary granules) or vitamin B 12 binding protein (mar-ker for the secondary granules). In contrast to quartz, ex-posure to alumina did not affect the expression of CR! and CR 3.
