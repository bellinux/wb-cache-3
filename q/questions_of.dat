5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
