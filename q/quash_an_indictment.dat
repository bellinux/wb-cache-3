25|$|In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court-era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a final judgment had been entered.

6000|$|Mr. Walpole said,--"Those learned gentlemen [Lord Wintoun's counsel] seem {{to forget}} in what court they are. They {{have taken up}} so much of your Lordships' time in quoting of authorities, and using {{arguments}} to show your Lordships what would <b>quash</b> <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> in the courts below, that they seemed to forget they {{are now in a}} Court of Parliament, and on an impeachment of the Commons of Great Britain. For, should the Commons admit all that they have offered, it will not follow that the impeachment of the Commons is insufficient; and I must observe to your Lordships, that neither of the learned gentlemen have offered to produce one instance relative to an impeachment. I mean to show that the sufficiency of an impeachment was never called in question for the generality of the charge, or that any instance of that nature was offered at before. The Commons don't conceive, that, if this exception would <b>quash</b> <b>an</b> <b>indictment,</b> it would therefore make the impeachment insufficient. I hope it never will be allowed here as a reason, that what quashes an indictment in the courts below will make insufficient an impeachment brought by the Commons of Great Britain." ...|$|E
5000|$|United States v. Wurzbach, 280 U.S. 396 (1930), is a {{unanimous}} {{ruling by the}} US Supreme Court that the term [...] "political purpose," [...] as used in the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, was not impermissibly vague. The Supreme Court reversed the district court, which had <b>quashed</b> <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> under the Act.|$|R
40|$|In United States v. Gooding, the Supreme Court <b>quashed</b> <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> against John Gooding for {{engaging}} in international slave trading, {{a violation of the}} Slave Trade Act of 1818. The Slave Trade Act of 1818 modified the penalties {{for engaging}} the in slave trading, and switched the burden of proof to the defendant, to disprove the presumption that the defendant had engaged in the slave trade. This article looks at how United States v. Gooding stands as a step backwards toward condoning and legitimizing the international slave trade. This paper also examines the moral relativism expressed in the United States’ social and legal positions on both domestic and international slave trading, while exploring the uniqueness of Baltimore, Maryland’s role in the domestic and international slave trade...|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Rodriguez {{approached}} ex-convict Louis Fess Taylor to {{help him}} <b>quash</b> <b>a</b> narcotics <b>indictment.</b> Rodriguez asked for $100,000 and promised to fix the case. Taylor talked to the D.A.'s office about the offer, and at the next meetings carried a recording device. On July 27, Rodriguez was indicted for attempted extortion. On November 8, Rodriguez {{was elected to the}} New York State Senate (29th D.), but he did not take his seat in the 177th New York State Legislature. His trial opened on December 12. He asked his chauffeur Antonio Maldonado and one José Sierra to kill Taylor to prevent him from testifying at the trial. On January 13, 1967, Rodriguez was convicted of perjury and attempted grand larceny. On February 14, he was sentenced to one and a half to four years in jail, and thus vacated his Senate seat. On February 27, he pleaded guilty to have conspired to murder Taylor. On March 2, he was sentenced to one and a half to four years in jail for conspiracy to commit murder, to be served concurrently with the sentence for perjury. On April 4, 1967, he was disbarred by the Appellate Division. He was released from Clinton Correctional Facility on December 24, 1969.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{intervening}} statutory {{developments that}} decreased {{the likelihood of}} division in the circuit courts, the Chase Court heard seventeen of its thirty-six criminal cases on certificates of division. In Ex parte Milligan (1866), the Court held that habeas petitions in the circuit courts could {{be a source of}} certified questions to the Supreme Court. But, in United States v.

50|$|The {{court also}} {{rejected}} Perry's claims on the tolling issue. The case he had {{cited as a}} precedent, where the Tennessee Supreme Court had <b>quashed</b> <b>a</b> felony nonsupport <b>indictment</b> of <b>a</b> Texas man who had never visited, much less lived in, Tennessee, was inapposite since unlike that man, Perry had committed his crime in Tennessee and then left the state. The U.S. Supreme Court's Jones v. Helms, in fact, had upheld tolling in a similar non-support case where the defendant had left his original state of residence, just as Perry had. More generally, the state's compelling interest in prosecuting crimes allows the encumbrance {{of the right to}} travel created by the tolling; since it applied to anyone who committed crimes in Tennessee and then left the state regardless of whether they lived in Tennessee or not it met the equal protection burden. Nor had Perry shown any evidence that it was enforced against him prejudicially.|$|R
25|$|In United States v. Simmons (1877), the Court {{assessed}} the sufficiency of <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> charging {{the production of}} untaxed alcohol. The Court held that <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> must either name the defendant or state that the defendant's name is unknown.|$|R

50|$|In S v Nathaniel, {{the court}} did indeed <b>quash</b> <b>an</b> <b>indictment</b> without giving the State an {{opportunity}} to amend the charge or supplement the further particulars. The present court held, however, that, assuming such an approach was permissible, it should only be adopted where the indictment was so patently unsalvageable that no purpose would be served in giving the prosecutor an opportunity to cure the defects. The court held that, in casu, the charge was not unsalvageable and that the State {{should be given the}} opportunity to rectify the situation. The request for the quashing of the charge was dismissed.|$|E
