40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between writing and alterity in three recent novels written by J. M. G. Le Clézio, Désert (1980), Onitsha (1991) and La <b>quarantaine</b> (1995), which deal with the encounter between the so-called primitive cultures and Western society. The first chapter contains a more general discussion on the discourse of alterity in literature and the French exotic contemporary novel. In order to place this study in a critical context, this chapter includes a survey of the main critical works concerning alterity in Le Clézio’s novels. In the second chapter, each of the three novels is analysed according to a general scheme, emphasis being put on narrative techniques, thematic aspects and stylistic features. Particular attention is paid to the connection between History, on the one hand, and different myths and legends belonging to the primitive culture, on the other hand. The analysis reveals a number of writing strategies adopted by the novelist in telling about the Other and the confrontation between the primitive world and the West. These strategies rely partly on the polysemic nature of the text, partly on changes in the possibilities to represent the described objects and space. Intertextuality is pointed out as one of the main sources of polysemy in Le Clézio’s novels, especially in La <b>quarantaine.</b> In a broader perspective, the last chapter links the results of the analysis to the interaction between the text and its Western reader. Relevant aspects here are the relations between understanding and interpreting, the reader’s competence and different ways of reading. The study takes into consideration the reading effects produced by these novels (especially when the reader is confronted with symbols foreign to the Western culture), their appeal to the reader’s interpreting activity and the reader’s attitude towards the ethical values proposed by Le Clézio’s fiction. The study concludes with a suggestion as to the ideal reading of these novels, a reading which could conciliate their lyricism and dream-like atmosphere with their pronounced opening towards the socio-historical dimensions of reality. This ideal reading would allow the reader to form an image of the Other that respects the complexity of Le Clézio’s writing...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} I address Jacques Rivette's 1970 s work through 12 key elements. At the {{generative}} heart of Out 1 : Noli me tangere (1971), Out 1 : Spectre (1972), Céline et Julie vont en bateau: Phantom Ladies Over Paris/Céline and Julie go Boating (1974), Duelle (une <b>quarantaine)</b> and Noroît (both 1976) is what I call the web. Such a key organising principle powers this caché of experimental feature films, a treasure-chest long hidden or difficult to access but now finally {{brought into the}} digital light. A loose term encapsulating their much-discussed internal conspiracy theme and the key organisational principle of Rivette's cinema, the web also evokes networks of a less exotic nature, including the banal but vital pursuit of connections between people driven by desire for external meaning and continuity. But it just as easy results in withdrawal and disconnection. The subtitle added to Out 1 's long version upon Rivette's definitive 1990 edit, Noli me tangere, is a Latin term meaning "touch me not", "don't tread on me", or more prosaically, "don't come too close. " This is an appropriate phrase (with mythic origins attributed to Jesus speaking to Mary Magdalene following his resurrection) signaling Out 1 's story of people coming into close proximity and association before moving away without confirmation of ongoing connection. Throughout these five films, the web's alienating, oppressive, and sometimes sinister dimension exists alongside its playful, connective, and creative potential.

30|$|Logistic and taxonomic {{support for}} this joint study between Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (Kew) and Illinois College was {{facilitated}} by Kew Madagascar Conservation Centre (KMCC) and Parc Botanique et Zoologique de Tsimbazaza (PBZT). During the 5 -year project, more than 40 taxa spanning 24 genera were selected for study involving collection and movement of live material (roots, seeds) from Madagascar to labs in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (USA). Root samples were shared between the two partners to ensure that live material could be processed {{in a timely manner}} leading to the isolation of Rhizoctonia-like fungi from root pelotons. To facilitate the legal collection and international transport of orchid material from Madagascar to the UK (Kew) and USA (Illinois), a CITES permit was obtained which allowed three tubes, each containing seedlings and mature roots per species, to be collected. The rarity of plants in the wild necessitated further restrictions, namely that collections be limited to three each of juvenile and mature plants. Depending on the species and its availability, 1 – 5 roots per specimen were collected. These were accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate which was secured prior to departure from Madagascar. The CITES permit and phytosanitary certificate were delivered by the Direction Generale des Forets (DGF Nanisana Antananarivo) and Service de la <b>Quarantaine</b> et de I’Inspection Nanisana, respectively. For import of root samples into the USA, an additional permit (PPQ 526) was obtained from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), as the US Government regards all orchid endophytes in the Rhizoctonia complex to be plant pathogens. Samples entering the UK were accompanied by a Phytosanitary Certificate issued in Madagascar, and a UK Letter of Authority.|$|E

The number of mammals in the collection during the period 1967 - 1973 varied between 729 and 858 belonging to 172 to 208 species. In birds these figures were 1571 and 1803 specimens of 391 to 520 species (table I). The average percentage of deaths in mammals was 12. 4 % (table II) and in birds 13 % (table III). The causes of death (tables IV and V) are arranged under 15 headings for mammals and under 18 for birds; both numbers and percentages are given. During 1967, 1968, and 1969 there were many cases of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis in the nocturnal house. The troubles only stopped after vaccination of all animals already present {{in the house and}} of the new ones before housing them. Cases of non-identified infections in psittacine birds (53 victims) and penguins (19 victims) are provided. The same holds true for a skin disease in apes and diabetes in ruminants. A rather detailed report is given on cowpox in indian elephants in 1973. The three females of different age were affected; the male stayed free. All animals recovered after periods ranging from 17 to 57 days. One elephant had serious foot troubles in the same period, the most serious at the left forefoot. It took about 6 weeks before all animals recovered completely. The survival rate of newborn mammals fluctuated between 59 % and 66 %, at a number of births fluctuating from 164 to 249 a year (table VI). The low rate of 56 % for wild ruminants could be raised to 67 % by feeding extra minerals to pregnant and nursing females. In birds hatched (table VII) the survival rates varied between 49 % and 75 %. The low figure is caused by the very bad results with ducks (in 1969 only 25 % survival).

40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{positioned}} at {{the confluence of}} literature on gender, professions and identity and aims {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the processes of identity construction of women public accountants. The empirical data presented in this dissertation is based on over forty semi-structured biographic interviews with women and men, CPAs and trainees. My method was built progressively as a result of my immersion in the field and of my personal experience as a woman and professional accountant. Based on my findings, I highlighted the existence of an approved organizational path characterized by linear, constant upward mobility and submitted to organizational norms. This professional model, constructed as masculine, does not appeal to a majority of women, and especially mothers, who decide to have recourse to alternative professional models. Although promoted by the firms, these models lack the legitimacy of approved routes and often imply a derailment of women’s careers right from the early days because previous choices may limit the range of choices available in the future. My study is focused on the construction of women CPA’s professional identity and of its interaction with motherhood. I show that in constructing their identity women dwell on socially defined roles and organizationally available discourses that may be in contradiction with each other. Thus, women attempting to construct themselves as both good professional and mother may experience identity tensions. Nevertheless, their identities are not fragmented, but are the result of a continuous effort to integrate contradictory discourses in an ongoing biography. In addition, I highlight two types of strategies that women professional accountants use: strategies concerning family and strategies concerning work. Their analysis allow me to draw the conclusion that women CPA impose new work practices that are mostly adaptive practices and do not aim to alter the current ones.

40|$|À partir d’un questionnement {{concernant}} le faible investissement des PME en formation, cet article tente de démontrer l’importance de l’environnement institutionnel {{par rapport}} aux seuls effets de taille. Par une analyse systémique de divers facteurs pouvant expliquer la formation dans une <b>quarantaine</b> de PME, l’article met en relief l’existence de trois configurations d’entreprises ayant des rapports différenciés à la formation; celles-ci vont de l’entreprise familiale qui offre peu de formation à l’entreprise indépendante offrant une formation structurée en passant par diverses formes d’entreprises qui, sur la base de leur insertion sous des bannières ou franchises ou encore de l’action des comités sectoriels ou d’organismes régionaux, accordent une importance de plus en plus grande à la formation et la structurent en conséquence. L’article conclut sur la nécessité d’une prise en compte « systémique » des dispositifs institutionnels pour {{la mise en place}} de politiques publiques adéquates. Since {{the economic crisis}} of the 1980 s, the SMB has increasingly become a focus of concern, displacing the large business that was the figurehead of the Fordist model during the Glorious Thirty Years. With SMBs now being seen as the sine qua non condition for economic growth, the training of their work force takes on an even greater importance. And yet, the first evaluations of the Law on the Development of Workforce Training in Quebec (Quebec, MESS, 2000 and 2002) reveal that, as is the case around the world, small businesses invest less than large business in workforce training. This article aims to reconsider the explanation for the low investment made by SMBs in terms of this being only an effect of size; we link this consideration to other factors which, taken together, determine {{the context in which the}} link of SMBs with training exists, and gives its meaning. Our starting-point is the idea that the social-economic environment of businesses (their status of sectional or territorial membership and the institutional mechanisms that surround them (laws, standards, etc.) are, along with individual characteristics (size, ownership, business structure), among the main factors which explain the relationship of businesses to training. A review of studies on this subject allows us first of all, to go beyond the idea that the propensity of businesses to provide training is “determined” only by the size of the business: other factors may play a role in the relationship the business has with training. For methodology, our research has chosen as its example a study carried out by the CEREQ in France (Bentabet, Michun and Trouvé, 1999). This study set out to establish configurations of small businesses through linking a set of criteria to explain the relation of these businesses with training. As was the case for this ground-breaking study, by using as our basis Weber’s ideal types obtained through accentuating the main traits observed in reality, we bring to light several typical figures for small and medium businesses, taking into account both their environment (sector, territory, laws and standards), their size, their ownership and their structure (independent businesses, concessions, banners, franchises, etc.) and also their production and workforce management to finally link these elements into the relationship with training. In all, among the 40 cases studied, our analysis leads us to identify three main configurations for SMBs in relationship to training: (1) the more traditional businesses which are based on the “family” model and give little training, or mostly informal training within the business – on-the-job training which is usually given by the manager; (2) on the other hand, more structured businesses (subsidiaries of large business groups or franchised businesses) which offer more structured training similar to large businesses and (3) between these two configurations, SMBs which are becoming structured and which are trying to review their organization, and beginning to give a higher priority to staff training. Even though a qualitative analysis of 40 businesses does not allow us to measure the influence of each of the factors taken into consideration, our analysis does allow us to at least reject the idea that SMBs form a homogenous group of businesses all having a low tendency to invest in training, and limiting themselves to only unstructured training provided a the work station. As well, on the practical level, the results of our investigation make it possible to understand how a SMB is led to structure itself and to modify its relation to training. If a SMB’s structure may sometimes be the result of individual decisions made by managers (for instance, to place oneself under a banner with a view to company growth), it is nonetheless true that the individual actors are prevented from or encouraged to act by environmental factors. From this point of view, the change in training within SMBs could not only be the result of the action of individual actors any more than it could be the result of the rules imposed at an institutional level. The change in the relationship of SMBs with training would be, instead, the result of an interaction between individual choices and the institutional context. It would be more precisely the result of a transaction between the demand for training on the part of firms, and the institutional framework for offering training. Therefore, we can state that business training practices are a “social construction,” that is to say, the needs of businesses, and their demand for training, do not exist in and of themselves; rather they are the result of the interplay between different institutional actors such as government organizations, sectional worker committees, local and regional organizations, including education establishments which, by means of their employment analysis, their analysis of the job situation or by their definition of training context and their service offer interact on the training relationship. Among the set of institutions, the intermediary organizations (sectional, local or regional) seemed more and more to us to play a leading role in initiating the structuring of training within businesses. These organizations could also be seen, according to our analysis, as the level at which the individual actors are put into relationship with the institutions in the negotiation of institutional compromise and new game rules. Thus, our conclusions are in line with the institutionalist approach in which the organizational choices made by companies do not only depend on the managers themselves, but these choices are “influenced” or even “constrained” by the characteristics of their institutional environment which establishes the framework within which the managers make their decisions. If our analysis has enabled us to show the importance which institutional mechanisms take on at all levels to stimulate training in SMBs, it also shows the necessity of a “systemic” consideration of the various institutional mechanisms, not only in the analysis but in the proposal of government policies. For this reason, if our analysis shows that the institutional context may increase the tendency of businesses to train or to improve the management of their training, this will not be achieved, according to our analysis, by reinforcing only one institutional mechanism. Laws, standards, intermediary organizations, and various levels of training mechanisms are all part of an overall system of manpower training in Quebec and all contribute together to provide a framework for the actions taken by businesses in worker training. This is what some have called “institutional complementarity. ”A partir de un cuestionamiento respecto a la poca inversión de las EPM en la formación, este artículo intenta demostrar la importancia del contexto institucional en cuanto al efecto de talla. Mediante un análisis sistemático de estos diversos factores en cuarenta EPM, el articulo hace resaltar la existencia de tres configuraciones de empresas con un comportamiento diferenciado respecto a la formación ; estas configuraciones van de la empresa familiar que ofrece poca formación hasta la empresa independiente que ofrece una formación estructurada, pasando por diversas formas de empresa que, sobre la base de su inserción con el uso de franquicias o con la acción de comités sectoriales o de organismos regionales, dan una importancia cada vez mas grande a la formación y la estructuran en consecuencia.
