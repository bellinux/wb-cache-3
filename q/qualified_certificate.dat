50|$|In court, a {{qualified}} electronic signature provided {{the highest level of}} probative value, which makes it difficult to refute its authorship.

50|$|While an {{advanced}} electronic signature is legally binding under eIDAS, a qualified electronic signature which has been created by a qualified trust service provider carries a higher probative value when used as evidence in court. Because the signature’s authorship is considered non-repudiable, {{the authenticity of the}} signature cannot be easily challenged. EU member states are obligated to accept qualified electronic signatures that have been created with <b>qualified</b> <b>certificate</b> from other Member states as valid. According to the eIDAS Regulation, i.e. Article 24 (2), a signature created with a <b>qualified</b> <b>certificate</b> has the same legal value as a handwritten signature in court.|$|E

50|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, similar {{concepts}} have been created to define standards for electronic signatures. In Switzerland, the digital signing standard ZertES has comparable standards that address the conformity and regulation of trust service providers who product digital certificates. However, in the United States, the current version NIST DSS (Digital Signature Standard) does not provide a comparable standard for regulating qualified certificates that would address non-repudiation of a signatory’s <b>qualified</b> <b>certificate.</b> An amendment to NIST DSS is currently being discussed that would be more in-line with how eIDAS and ZertES handle trusted services.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to note that creating a qualified electronic signature is more than merely adding a <b>qualified</b> <b>certificate</b> to an advanced electronic signature. The signature must also be created using a qualified signature creation device (QSCD).

In addition, a qualified trust service provider manages the signature creation data that is produced. The signature creation data must remains unique, confidential and protected from forgery ...|$|E
5000|$|... eIDAS {{requires}} that no electronic signature should be denied legal effect or admissibility as evidence {{solely on the}} grounds that it is in an electronic form or that it does not meet the requirements for qualified electronic signatures. The qualified electronic signature shall have the equivalent legal effect as a handwritten signature. Its evidentiary value depends on the circumstances, but will normally be considered very high. All EU member states are required to recognize a qualified electronic signature as valid, as long as it has been created with a <b>qualified</b> <b>certificate</b> that has been issued by another Member state.|$|E
