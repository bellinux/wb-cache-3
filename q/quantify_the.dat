5|$|D mode {{is present}} in all graphite-like carbons and {{originates}} from structural defects. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} G/D modes is conventionally used to <b>quantify</b> <b>the</b> structural quality of carbon nanotubes. High-quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{methods for}} {{measuring}} convergence incorporate ratios of phenotypic and phylogenetic distance by simulating evolution with a Brownian motion model of trait evolution along a phylogeny. More recent methods also <b>quantify</b> <b>the</b> strength of convergence. One drawback {{to keep in}} mind is that these methods can confuse long-term stasis with convergence due to phenotypic similarities. Stasis occurs when there is little evolutionary change among taxa.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences for the}} county were more difficult to <b>quantify.</b> <b>The</b> financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} to move product through this line. Workers income, property taxes, and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service. The impact on tourism was not as bad as predicted and thousands of workers involved in the cleanup appear to have benefited some hotels.|$|E

50|$|When {{interpreted}} in ecological terms, {{each one of}} these indices corresponds to a different thing, and their values are therefore not directly comparable. Species richness <b>quantifies</b> <b>the</b> actual rather than effective number of species. The Shannon index equals log(qD), and in practice <b>quantifies</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty in the species identity of an individual that is taken at random from the dataset. The Simpson index equals 1/qD and <b>quantifies</b> <b>the</b> probability that two individuals taken at random from the dataset (with replacement of the first individual before taking the second) represent the same species. The Gini-Simpson index equals 1 - 1/qD and <b>quantifies</b> <b>the</b> probability that the two randomly taken individuals represent different species.|$|R

5|$|Attempts to <b>quantify</b> <b>the</b> {{economic}} impact {{of growth in the}} air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to <b>quantify</b> <b>the</b> environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E
