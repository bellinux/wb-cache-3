5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} long-abandoned gardens were replanted {{in a style}} {{sympathetic}} to the Tudor period. The knot garden was planted in 1972, to a design taken from Leonard Meager's Complete English Gardener, published in 1670. The intricate design of the knot {{can be seen from}} one of the two original viewing mounds, common in 16th-century formal gardening, one inside the moat and the other to the southwest. Other features of the grounds include a yew tunnel and an orchard growing fruits that would have been familiar to the house's Tudor occupants– apples, pears, <b>quinces</b> and medlars.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for sweeteners of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, <b>quinces,</b> and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E

5|$|The orchard {{contains}} {{fruit trees}} such as <b>quinces,</b> medlars, crab {{apples and pears}} are underplanted with spring-flowering meadow plants such as snakeshead fritillaries, camassias, narcissus, cowslips and lady's smock. The orchard is crossed by wide mown paths meeting at a central sundial. Originally four weeping elms were situated at {{the four corners of}} the garden, but they succumbed to Dutch elm disease in the early seventies and were replaced in 1973 by four weeping ash trees which make inviting 'houses'. The orchard can be viewed from the raised walk on its east side, another idea copied from Avebury Manor. A main path known as the Long walk is based on the Long Walk at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire, although it is on a smaller scale. It is a plain grassed walkway connecting the Raised Walk with the Pond Garden.|$|E

Furthermore, <b>quince</b> HW suppressed these cytokine expressions of mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), a normal mast cell model. Leukotriene C 4 and prostaglandin D 2 production in BMMCs after 1 and 6  h of stimulation, respectively, were also reduced by treating the cells with <b>quince</b> HW.
