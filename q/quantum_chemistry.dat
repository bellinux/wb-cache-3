50|$|Visualizing DFT functionals to be a {{succession}} of ladder steps, Perdew formulated the Jacob's Ladder strategy for constructing improved density functionals for the exchange-correlation energy.

25|$|This is why {{the real}} forms are {{extensively}} used in basis functions for <b>quantum</b> <b>chemistry,</b> as the programs don't then need to use complex algebra. Here, {{it is important to}} note that the real functions span the same space as the complex ones would.|$|E
25|$|Applied <b>quantum</b> <b>chemistry,</b> specifically, orbital {{hybridization}} best describes chemical bonding in nanotubes. The chemical bonding of nanotubes involves entirely sp2-hybrid carbon atoms. These bonds, {{which are}} similar to those of graphite and stronger than those found in alkanes and diamond (which employ sp3-hybrid carbon atoms), provide nanotubes with their unique strength.|$|E

25|$|A {{particularly}} important objective, called computational thermochemistry, is to calculate thermochemical quantities {{such as the}} enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy. Chemical accuracy is the accuracy required to make realistic chemical predictions and is {{generally considered to be}} 1kcal/mol or 4kJ/mol. To reach that accuracy in an economic way it is necessary to use a series of post-Hartree–Fock methods and combine the results. These methods are called <b>quantum</b> <b>chemistry</b> composite methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{conjugation}} of 1,3-butadiene {{was first}} evaluated by Kistiakowsky, a conjugative contribution of 3.5 kcal/mol was found {{based on the}} energetic comparison of hydrogenation between conjugated species and unconjugated analogues. Rogers who used the method first applied by Kistiakowsky, reported that the conjugation stabilization of 1,3-butadiyne was zero, as the difference of ΔhydH between first and second hydrogenation was zero.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{photodissociation}} <b>chemistry</b> of a <b>quantum</b> degenerate gas of bosonic triatomic $ABC$ molecules, assuming two open rearrangement channels ($AB+C$ or $A+BC$). The {{equations of motion}} are equivalent to those of a parametric multimode laser, resulting in an exponential buildup of macroscopic mode populations. By exponentially amplifying a small differential in the single-particle rate-coefficients, Bose stimulation leads to a nearly complete selectivity of the collective $N$-body process, indicating a novel type of ultra-selective <b>quantum</b> degenerate <b>chemistry.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

50|$|The quantum {{pendulum}} {{is fundamental}} in understanding hindered internal rotations in <b>chemistry,</b> <b>quantum</b> features of scattering atoms, {{as well as}} numerous other quantum phenomena.

25|$|Claude Shannon's {{development}} of Information theory in 1948 {{gave rise to}} the entropy view of randomness. In this view, randomness is the opposite of determinism in a stochastic process. Hence if a stochastic system has entropy zero it has no randomness and any increase in entropy increases randomness. Shannon's formulation defaults to Boltzmann's 19th century formulation of entropy in case all probabilities are equal. Entropy is now widely used in diverse fields of science from thermodynamics to <b>quantum</b> <b>chemistry.</b>|$|E
25|$|Theoretical {{chemistry}} {{is the study}} of chemistry via fundamental theoretical reasoning (usually within mathematics or physics). In particular the application of quantum mechanics to {{chemistry is}} called <b>quantum</b> <b>chemistry.</b> Since the end of the Second World War, the development of computers has allowed a systematic development of computational chemistry, which is the art of developing and applying computer programs for solving chemical problems. Theoretical chemistry has large overlap with (theoretical and experimental) condensed matter physics and molecular physics.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, José Enrique Moyal, who had derived it independently, {{recognized}} it as the quantum moment-generating functional, and thus {{as the basis of}} an elegant encoding of all quantum expectation values, and hence quantum mechanics, in phase space (cf. phase space formulation). It has applications in statistical mechanics, <b>quantum</b> <b>chemistry,</b> quantum optics, classical optics and signal analysis in diverse fields such as electrical engineering, seismology, time–frequency analysis for music signals, spectrograms in biology and speech processing, and engine design.|$|E

40|$|The adaptively {{compressed}} exchange (ACE) method {{provides an}} efficient way for solving Hartree-Fock-like equations in <b>quantum</b> physics, <b>chemistry,</b> and materials science.

In this paper, we present a detailed study of the adaptive compression operation and establish rigorous convergence properties of the adaptive compression method {{in the context of}} solving linear eigenvalue problems. Our analysis also elucidates the potential use of the adaptive compression method {{in a wide range of}} problems. Comment: 41 page...|$|R
