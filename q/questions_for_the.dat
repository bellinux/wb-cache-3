5|$|Though Thomas Higgins's {{death by}} {{apparent}} dysentery raised no <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attending doctor, Higgins's brother Patrick {{was surprised to}} hear that his brother, who had been strong and in good general health, could have succumbed so easily to illness. When he also discovered that his brother has been insured with five different burial societies, which left his widow with a profit of around £100, he pursued the matter with the authorities. A postmortem examination was ordered on Higgins's body. To the surprise of mourners, the coroner arrived at the home to perform the examination during the wake being held there for Higgins. Catherine Flannagan, upon hearing that a full autopsy was to be performed, fled the home.|$|E
5|$|Foxgrover {{remained}} {{involved in}} the Millennium Park restaurant after she recused herself from contract negotiations in May, 2002. In October 2003, Foxgrover spoke {{in favor of the}} restaurant getting a liquor license before a Chicago City Council committee while O'Malley owed Foxgrover at least $5,000. On the same day, Foxgrover worked to get O'Malley's Clock Tower Cafe a liquor license. In one July 2003 e-mail, Foxgrover, then the acting director of park services, said that if O'Malley's contractor had any <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Park District, she will be the point person. In August 2003, Horan sent out an e-mail mentioning a discussion Horan had with Foxgrover, in which Horan asked Foxgrover if the Park District would waive a form of insurance on the restaurant's construction. A provision in the Park Grill contract allows the restaurant to arrange a series of summer concerts on the Millennium Park ice-skating rink, drawing crowds that bolster food and drink sales. In summer 2004, O'Malley and his partners asked Clear Channel-owned WNUA Radio to conduct the concerts. In February 2005, Foxgrover led a five-member Park District committee that chose Clear Channel over JAM Productions to operate the new concert venue at Northerly Island on the former site of Meigs Field.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two <b>questions.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E

25|$|Non-verbal {{behaviors}} {{are particularly important}} to forming first impressions when meeting a business acquaintance. Specifically, components of social expressivity, such as smiling, eyebrow position, emotional expression, and eye contact are emphasized.

Other impression management tactics {{in the business world}} include researching the organization and interviewers beforehand, preparing specific <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> interviewer, showing confidence, and dressing appropriately.|$|E

Students are able to choose from many different roles, including assistant genre editor, managing editor, or copy editor. The course revolves around many tasks, such as reviewing literary pieces received from the genre editor, voting for or against a piece being published in the upcoming issue, or even preparing interview <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> authors of accepted pieces. Students are able to serve in one of the three genres: fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.|$|E

25|$|The quiz is {{the primary}} device of {{eliminating}} contestants across all series. Traditionally between ten and twenty questions, the quiz asks the players to identify the Mole and several pieces of information regarding the Mole, including the Mole's activity in challenges, biographical profile, their fashion and/or culinary choices during the show, etc. The player scoring lowest on the quiz (and taking the longest time to do so, {{in the event of}} tied scores) is eliminated from the game. The US version saw a format change from twenty questions to ten questions from Season 2 on, usually with all questions available to the public. Season 5 of the Australian series had contestants answer five questions about the Mole (not filmed), plus a further five <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> live eliminations. On two separate occasions, the live elimination computer quiz system malfunctioned and didn't record some contestants' responses. The rules stated that if this were to happen the elimination would be based on the five questions answered before the live show.|$|E

500|$|Allard Laban of Jellyvision Games {{noted that}} {{compared}} to 1995, where the pop culture was [...] "fragmented", {{the onset of}} the Internet and social media made it easier to develop <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game. At the same time, with more information and entertainment available, the writers had to be selective about what parts of culture would remain relevant; an example given by Heinrich was that while questions about Seinfeld were okay, questions about Mad About You were not. Jellyvision Games sought comedy writers, including from local comedy clubs such as Second City and I.O., narrowing down the pool of applicants from hundreds to six, including Second City comedian Tim Sniffen, who had worked on previous iterations of the You Don't Know Jack series. A weekly training process was employed to bring the new writers up to speed and review previously written dialog for possible improvements. Heinrich also assured that material was not repeated throughout the game's script. Heinrich estimates that each question in the game was a result of about two hours of work.|$|E

[...] When the new legislature convened in February 1910, Boyle tabled a list of eleven <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> government about the A [...] Rutherford, Minister of Railways as well as Premier, duly answered them in writing. [...] Boyle found these answers unsatisfactory, and on February 21 gave notice of a motion to expropriate the A's bond money; he held {{that the government had}} raised more money for the A than was needed for construction. [...] He also alleged that S. B. Woods, deputy to Attorney-General Charles Wilson Cross, had removed key components from the government's files on the A, in advance of their having been inspected by Boyle and Conservative leader R. B. Bennett.|$|E
500|$|... "Fire in My Heart" [...] is 2 {{minutes and}} 45 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of E major.

Rhys's vocals are joined by sparse drums, a synthesizer, organ and harmony backing vocals in the second verse which immediately follows the first at 31 seconds. The drums become louder during the third and final verse which leads into a bridge that begins after 1 minute and 31 seconds. During the bridge Rhys sings the lines [...] "Oh the monkey puzzle tree has some <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> watchdogs of the profane, and I ask, is it sad that I'm driving myself mad as this fire in my heart turns blue". A key change to F♯ major follows for the final verse, with Rhys repeating the line [...] "I've got a fire in my heart for you" [...] backed by multiple harmony vocals. The song ends with a coda during which Rhys elongates the word [...] "you" [...] over the chords A minor, A, G minor and F.|$|E

While the producers expected five thousand people to show up, twelve thousand appeared. Instructions were given to the crowd by director R. W. Goodwin using giant video screens attached to the scoreboard. During breaks between shooting concession stands, music and videos were made available to the attendees. Actors Duchovny and Anderson also answered <b>questions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> audience and over $20,000 worth of equipment was raffled off.
