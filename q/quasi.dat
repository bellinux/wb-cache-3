5|$|Lyon {{also has}} the {{distinction}} of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. On October 10, 1798, he was found guilty of violating the Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited malicious writing about the American government as a whole, or of the houses of Congress, or of the president. During the <b>Quasi</b> War with France, Lyon {{was the first person to}} be put to trial for violating the acts after he published editorials criticizing Federalist President John Adams.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{had also}} been {{augmented}} by the United States government, in both cargo and shipping, as repayment for French financial, moral and military support during the American Revolution. In supporting the French Revolution in this way, the American government, urged especially by Ambassador Gouverneur Morris, was fulfilling its ten-year-old debt to France. Friendly relations between the United States and France did not long survive the Jay Treaty which came into effect in 1796; by 1798 the two nations would be engaged in the <b>Quasi</b> War.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev {{was able}} to criticise Kosygin by {{contrasting}} him with Vladimir Lenin, whom Brezhnev {{claimed to have been}} more interested in improving the conditions of Soviet agriculture than improving the quality of light industrial goods. Kosygin's support for producing more consumer goods was also criticised by Brezhnev, and his supporters, most notably Konstantin Chernenko, for being a return to <b>quasi</b> First World policies. At the 23rd Party Congress Kosygin's position was weakened when Brezhnev's supporters were able to increase expenditure on defence and agriculture. However, Brezhnev did not have a majority in the Politburo, and could count on only four votes. In the Politburo Kosygin could count on Kiril Mazurov's vote, and when Kosygin and Podgorny were not bickering with each other, they actually had a majority in the Politburo over Brezhnev. Unfortunately for Kosygin this was not often the case, and Kosygin and Podgorny were constantly disagreeing on policy.|$|E
5|$|USS President was a wooden-hulled, three-masted heavy frigate of the United States Navy, {{nominally}} {{rated at}} 44 guns. George Washington named her {{to reflect a}} principle of the United States Constitution. She was launched in April 1800 from a shipyard in New York City. President {{was one of the}} original six frigates whose construction the Naval Act of 1794 had authorized, and she was the last to be completed. Joshua Humphreys designed these frigates to be the young Navy's capital ships, and so President and her sisters were larger and more heavily armed and built than standard frigates of the period. Forman Cheeseman, and later Christian Bergh were in charge of her construction. Her first duties with the newly formed United States Navy were to provide protection for American merchant shipping during the <b>Quasi</b> War with France and to engage in a punitive expedition against the Barbary pirates in the First Barbary War.|$|E
5|$|Dig Me Out is the {{follow-up}} to Sleater-Kinney's highly acclaimed second album Call the Doctor, released in 1996 by the queercore independent record label Chainsaw Records. Call the Doctor confirmed the band's {{reputation as one}} of the major musical acts from the Pacific Northwest, rebelling against gender roles, consumerism, and indie rock's male-dominated hierarchy. After the release of Call the Doctor, drummer Janet Weiss of <b>Quasi</b> joined the band. Previously, the band had had a number of temporary drummers, including Misty Farrell, Lora Macfarlane, and Toni Gogin. Weiss would eventually become Sleater-Kinney's longest serving and current drummer. For its third album, Sleater-Kinney worked again with producer John Goodmanson. The band left Chainsaw Records and decided to release the album through Kill Rock Stars, another independent record label which singer and guitarist Corin Tucker thought had better resources to ensure the band's distribution. Goodmanson also remarked that Kill Rock Stars afforded the band a generous amount of studio time for an independent label, stating that Call the Doctor only took four days to record while Dig Me Out was recorded over the period of eight days.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March 1799, a French {{squadron}} had sailed from Rochefort. Consisting of the frigates Concorde, under Commodore Jean-François Landolphe, Médée, under Captain Jean-Daniel Coudin, and Franchise, under Captain Pierre Jurien, it was {{a powerful}} force, capable of inflicting significant damage on lightly defended merchant shipping. Eluding the blockade force off Rochefort, the squadron sailed southwards until it reached the coast of West Africa. There Landolphe's ships began an extended commerce raiding operation, inflicting severe damage on the West African trade {{during the rest of}} the year. Eventually the strain of serving in tropical waters told on the ships and all three were forced to undergo an extensive refit in the nearest available allied shipyards, which were located in the Spanish-held River Plate in South America. Repairs continued for six months, until Landolphe considered the squadron once again ready to sail in the early summer of 1800. The squadron almost immediately captured an American schooner, which it fitted out as a tender. At the time, France and the United States had been engaged for two years in the <b>Quasi</b> War.|$|E

25|$|The {{wind and}} waves create surface {{currents}} (designated as « drift currents »). These currents can decompose in one <b>quasi</b> permanent current (which varies within the hourly scale) and one movement of Stokes drift under {{the effect of}} rapid waves movement (at the echelon {{of a couple of}} seconds).). The <b>quasi</b> permanent current is accelerated by the breaking of waves, and in a lesser governing effect, by the friction of the wind on the surface.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{presidency}} of John Adams an undeclared naval war broke out from 1798 until 1799 against France, often called the <b>Quasi</b> War, {{in part because of}} the soured relations between the two nations. In addition, the United States would come under the influence of British banking power and regulations, heightening tensions between Democratic-Republicans and Federalists.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the IWW, which from 1908 onwards constitutionally {{restricted}} {{itself from}} political alliances, the WIIU advocated political associations, and maintained a close {{association with the}} SLP, although (as of 1922) it declined to openly affirm this association. Robert Hoxie, author of Trade Unionism in the United States, referred to the Detroit IWW as socialistic, and the Chicago IWW as <b>quasi</b> anarchistic.|$|E
25|$|The {{authority}} of the vicar does not cease with the pope who appointed him. But should he die during a vacancy of the Holy See, the vicegerent assumed his functions as a <b>quasi</b> vicar capitular. Theoretically at least, the vicar may hold diocesan synods; he could also formerly grant a number of choir-benefices. Pope Leo XIII reserved this right in perpetuity to the pope.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{garbage man}} Joe Savage formed the Young Men's Progressive Club, {{which served as}} a <b>quasi</b> union for the {{sanitation}} workers of St. Petersburg. There were no union dues and strictly survived off donations. In an effort to avoid violence, they formed an anti-violence committee of an estimated 25 members responsible for preventing violence from breaking out during a strike.

25|$|Connaught Place, one of North India's largest {{commercial}} and financial centres, {{is located in}} the northern part of New Delhi. Adjoining areas such as Barakhamba Road, ITO are also major commercial centres. Government and <b>quasi</b> government sector was the primary employer in New Delhi. The city's service sector has expanded due in part to the large skilled English-speaking workforce that has attracted many multinational companies. Key service industries include information technology, telecommunications, hotels, banking, media and tourism.|$|E
25|$|He {{received}} his official naval commission as {{officer in the}} United States Navy on June 24, 1799, {{and was the first}} surgeon listed in the Naval Registry (and the only one listed as hired during the eighteenth century).

After living {{for a time}} in Florence, he settled in Paris in 1855, where he hosted many artistic and literary figures in his apartment at 2 Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin, among whom the forty years younger Belgian mattauphone virtuoso Edmond Michotte, considering him as his <b>quasi</b> figlio.|$|E
25|$|After {{its demise}} in the Mediterranean world, Gnosticism lived {{on in the}} {{periphery}} of the Byzantine Empire, and resurfaced in the western world. The Paulicians, an Adoptionist group which flourished between 650 and 872 in Armenia and the Eastern Themes of the Byzantine Empire, were accused by orthodox medieval sources of being Gnostic and <b>quasi</b> Manichaean Christian. The Bogomils, emerged in Bulgaria between 927 and 970 and spread throughout Europe. It was as synthesis of Armenian Paulicianism and the Bulgarian Orthodox Church reform movement.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 2009 JAXA {{plans to launch}} the first {{satellite}} of the <b>Quasi</b> Zenith Satellite System (QZSS), a subsystem of the global positioning system (GPS). Two others are expected to follow later. If successful, one satellite {{will be in a}} zenith position over Japan full-time. The QZSS mission is the last scheduled major independent mission for JAXA, as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now. The only exception is the IGS programme which will be continued beyond 2008. However it seems Japan is pressing forward now with the GCOM earth observation satellites as successors to the ADEOS missions. First launch is planned for 2010.|$|E
25|$|This army {{cut off the}} {{provision}} lines from Doullens and began to lay siege to the city. The Spanish were taken by surprise by {{the speed of the}} French reaction, many civilians were chased from the city and Amiens prepared for a long siege. The French camp grew in size which was well provisioned; two hospitals were established and the army were well financed {{at the expense of the}} Duke of Sully. The French dug trench parallels and <b>quasi</b> parallels one of the firsts in siege warfare that preceded Vauban. The Spanish launched many attempts against the siege works but these were mainly unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Pater {{is perhaps}} the most {{frequent}} epithet of Janus, found also in the composition Ianuspater. While numerous gods share this cultic epithet it seems the Romans felt it was typically pertinent to Janus. When invoked along with other gods, usually only he is called pater. For Janus the title is not just a term of respect; principally it marks his primordial role. He is the first of the gods and thus their father: the formula <b>quasi</b> deorum deum corresponds to diuum deus of the carmen Saliare. Similarly, in the expression duonus Cerus, Cerus means creator and is considered a masculine form related to Ceres.|$|E
25|$|Monroe {{thought that}} foreign and Federalist {{elements}} {{had created the}} <b>Quasi</b> War of 1798–1800 and were behind efforts to prevent the election of Thomas Jefferson as president in 1800. As governor he considered using the Virginia militia to force the outcome in favor of Jefferson. Federalists were likewise suspicious of Monroe, some viewing him at best as a French dupe and at worst a traitor. Jefferson won the 1800 election, and he appointed Madison as his Secretary of State. As a member of Jefferson's party {{and the leader of}} the largest state in the country, Monroe emerged as one of Jefferson's two most likely successors, alongside Madison.|$|E
25|$|Two {{charge states}} of this defect, neutral N-V0 and {{negative}} N-V−, are known from spectroscopic studies using optical absorption, photoluminescence (PL), {{electron paramagnetic resonance}} (EPR) and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which {{can be viewed as}} a hybrid of PL and EPR; most details of the structure originate from EPR. A nitrogen atom has five valence electrons. Three of them covalently bond to the carbon atoms and two remain non-bonded and are called a lone pair. The vacancy has three unpaired electrons. Two of them make a <b>quasi</b> covalent bond and one remains unpaired. The overall symmetry, however, is axial (trigonal C3V); one can visualize this by imagining the three unpaired vacancy electrons continuously exchanging their roles.|$|E
25|$|The Scheme {{community}} actively maintains {{over twenty}} implementations. Several significant new implementations (Chicken, Gambit, Gauche, Ikarus, Larceny, Ypsilon) {{have been developed}} {{in the last few}} years. The Revised5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme standard of Scheme was widely accepted in the Scheme community. The Scheme Requests for Implementation process has created a lot of <b>quasi</b> standard libraries and extensions for Scheme. User communities of individual Scheme implementations continue to grow. A new language standardization process was started in 2003 and led to the R6RS Scheme standard in 2007. Academic use of Scheme for teaching computer science seems to have declined somewhat. Some universities, such as MIT, are no longer using Scheme in their computer science introductory courses.|$|E
25|$|Until 1848 the Governor-General was {{directly}} {{appointed by the}} Dutch monarch, and in later years via the Crown and on advice of the Dutch metropolitan cabinet. During two periods (1815–1835 and 1854–1925) the Governor-General ruled jointly with an advisory board called the Raad van Indie (Indies Council). Colonial policy and strategy were {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Colonies based in The Hague. From 1815 to 1848 the Ministry was under direct authority of the Dutch King. In the 20th century the colony gradually developed as a state distinct from the Dutch metropole with treasury separated in 1903, public loans being contracted by the colony from 1913, and <b>quasi</b> diplomatic ties were established with Arabia to manage the Haji pilgrimage from the Dutch East Indies. In 1922 the colony came on equal footing with the Netherlands in the Dutch constitution, while remaining under the Ministry of Colonies.|$|E
25|$|This {{acceleration}} of the current {{takes place in the}} direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the <b>quasi</b> permanent current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the Thermocline.|$|E
25|$|The excerpt below, bars 7–12 of J. S. Bach's Fugue no. 2 in C minor, BWV 847, {{from the}} Well-Tempered Clavier, Book 1 {{illustrates}} {{the application of}} most of the characteristics described above. The fugue is for keyboard and in three voices, with regular countersubjects. This excerpt opens at last entry of the exposition: the subject is sounding in the bass, the first countersubject in the treble, while the middle-voice is stating a second version of the second countersubject, which concludes with the characteristic rhythm of the subject, and is always used together with the first version of the second countersubject. Following this an episode modulates from the tonic to the relative major by means of sequence, {{in the form of an}} accompanied canon at the fourth. Arrival in E-flat major is marked by a <b>quasi</b> perfect cadence across the barline, from the last quarter note beat of the first bar to the first beat of the second bar in the second system, and the first middle entry. Here Bach has altered countersubject 2 to accommodate the change of mode.|$|E
25|$|The CPPA-B {{was founded}} in 1954 by the British colonial {{administration}} when Southern Cameroons was granted <b>quasi</b> regional status and started operating in November 1955. The person responsible for the setting up of the archives (more precisely the Photo Section within the Southern Cameroons Information Service) was Emmanuel Moanga Mbwaye (1928-2016) who had trained as a photographer in the Colonial Film Unit while working with the Cameroon Development Cooperation (C.D.C.) which had been formed in 1947 {{with the objective of}} developing and running plantations of tropical crops in Cameroon. Mbwaye worked alone from the early years but was joined in 1961 by Scott Fominyam. The latter was an assistant-photographer to Mbwaye and, in 1974, was transferred to Bamenda to set up the North West regional office of the Photographic Section. Mbwaye was frequently sent out of office to cover events. Scheduling clashes meant he was unable to effectively do the work alone and this necessitated the contracting of studio photographers such as Batanwi Photos (South West in Victoria now Limbe) and CC Sports (North West in Bamenda). The mandate of the photographers of the Press Photo Agency was to follow any governmental or otherwise socially relevant events throughout its territory (today’s Northwest and Southwest Regions).|$|E
