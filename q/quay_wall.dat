Double-ended hulls remain {{the design of}} Sydney's current [...] "Freshwater class" [...] ferries. He {{designed the}} first concrete <b>quay</b> <b>wall</b> in Sydney Harbour, and wharves for deep-sea vessels. He also designed the first ice-making machines in New South Wales, introduced the first lifts, patented an improved system of baling wool which increased capacity fourfold, and oversaw hydraulic and electric light installations {{in the city and}} the carriages on its railway network. He planned mills, waterworks and pumping stations, including the high-level pumps at the reservoir on Crown Street. He made major electric light installations at the Anthony Hordern & Sons department store and the Hotel Australia, and provided a hot-water system for the hotel. He designed machinery for factories, dairies and railways, including, in 1878, the incline of what is now the Scenic Railway attraction at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains– which claims to be the world's steepest. Its original purpose was the transportation of coal from the Jamison Valley to the cliff-top.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Optimal {{design of}} <b>Quay</b> <b>Walls</b> against seismic forces {{has become a}} {{challenge}} for engineers. For countries that are placed on the earthquake belt, {{it is very important to}} investigate the strength and behavior of <b>quay</b> <b>walls</b> against earthquakes. In this study, the behavior of cantilever concrete <b>quay</b> <b>walls</b> placed on the saturated cohesive soil is studied using finite element method in ANSYS Software. Patterns of the interaction between soil and structure prove to be very complicated. On the other hand, with the consideration of the interactions between soil and structure under the seismic forces, the problem will be made much more complicated. In the present study, height of the <b>quay</b> <b>walls,</b> soil type, strength and duration of the earthquake on the Bending moment against the wall are considered and pressure distributions behind the wall have been investigated...|$|R

She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her duty. The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer.|$|E
60|$|The cavalcade {{passed out}} by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and {{proceeded}} past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on {{his way through the}} metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood <b>quay</b> <b>wall</b> under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.|$|E
40|$|Old <b>quay</b> <b>walls</b> {{are present}} in many cities in the Netherlands and characterise itself by a masonry top {{construction}} (sometimes with basalt on the water side to prevent erosion of the masonry) with a wooden relieving floor. Rows of wooden piles bear the top construction. Since these <b>quay</b> <b>walls</b> are generally more than 100 years old, extra inspections and deformation measurements are needed to prevent sudden failure of the walls. Some of the old <b>quay</b> <b>walls</b> do not meet current safety standards, but show little signs of poor condition. The replacement of all the walls at short notice would be costly. In this research {{it is assumed that}} hidden safeties {{play an important role in}} the better than expected condition of the old <b>quay</b> <b>walls.</b> The objective of the research is to investigate these hidden safeties in order to make a better prediction of the remaining lifespan of old <b>quay</b> <b>walls.</b> To unveil the hidden safeties, a case is linked to the research; the Nassaukade in Rotterdam (profiles 059 - 015 and 059 - 019). Four aspects which are investigated are; difference between the design surface load and the actual usage of the <b>quay</b> <b>walls,</b> undrained behaviour of the soils, the used soil parameters and the interaction between masonry and wood. Based on the casestudy it can be concluded that since old <b>quay</b> <b>walls</b> are generally more than 100 years old, historical investigation is needed to gain better insight in dimensions and materials of the old <b>quay</b> <b>walls.</b> New drawings do often not show the correct dimensions and materials. Old builder's specifications mostly contain this information. Besides this in Plaxis, when using undrained parameters instead of drained parameters the deformations are smaller and the safety factors are higher than with drained behaviour. With drained parameters the loads on the construction are very high and are in fact calculated as a permanent load. Also, using local test results instead of the national table (Table 1 of NEN 6740) with soil parameters to define the parameters for geotechnical calculations will lead to a more realistic soil model of that particular location. During the thesis, new parameter sets have been set up for 2 and 5 % strain, leading to higher cohesion and E 50 values of peat and clay (compared to the national table). During the thesis, different experimental set-ups are used to determine the shear friction coefficient between wood and masonry. Although there are exceptions due to a variance in quality of the wooden planks (and the ‘new’ age of the wood), the overall shear friction coefficient found in the tests performed in this research is 0. 75. This is higher than the 0. 4 and 0. 5 that are normally used in the hand calculations and in Plaxis. This thesis identifies four hidden safeties in old <b>quay</b> <b>walls.</b> Each one of these separately can be implemented in current calculation methods.
