5|$|The Sommerfeld {{model and}} spin models for {{ferromagnetism}} illustrated the successful application {{of quantum mechanics}} to condensed matter problems in the 1930s. However, there still were several unsolved problems, most notably the description of superconductivity and the Kondo effect. After World War II, several ideas from quantum field theory were applied to condensed matter problems. These included recognition of collective excitation modes of solids and the important notion of a <b>quasiparticle.</b> Russian physicist Lev Landau used {{the idea for the}} Fermi liquid theory wherein low energy properties of interacting fermion systems were given in terms of what are now termed Landau-quasiparticles. Landau also developed a mean field theory for continuous phase transitions, which described ordered phases as spontaneous breakdown of symmetry. The theory also introduced the notion of an order parameter to distinguish between ordered phases. Eventually in 1965, John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Schrieffer developed the so-called BCS theory of superconductivity, based on the discovery that arbitrarily small attraction between two electrons of opposite spin mediated by phonons in the lattice can give rise to a bound state called a Cooper pair.|$|E

40|$|Laughlin <b>quasiparticles</b> are the {{elementary}} excitations of a highly-correlated fractional quantum Hall electron fluid. They have fractional charge and obey fractional statistics. The <b>quasiparticles</b> can propagate quantum-coherently in chiral edge channels, and constructively or destructively interfere. Unlike electrons, the interference condition for Laughlin <b>quasiparticles</b> has a non-vanishing statistical contribution {{that can be}} observed experimentally. Two kinds of interferometer devices have been realized. In the primary-filling interferometer, the entire device has filling 1 / 3, and the e/ 3 edge channel <b>quasiparticles</b> encircle identical e/ 3 island <b>quasiparticles.</b> Here the flux period is h/e, same as for electrons, but the back-gate charge period is e/ 3. In the second kind of interferometer, a lower density edge channel at filling 1 / 3 forms around a higher density island at filling 2 / 5, so that e/ 3 edge <b>quasiparticles</b> encircle e/ 5 island <b>quasiparticles.</b> Here we observe superperiodic oscillations with 5 h/e flux and 2 e charge periods, both corresponding to excitation of ten island <b>quasiparticles.</b> These periods {{can be understood as}} imposed by the anyonic braiding statistics of Laughlin <b>quasiparticles.</b> Comment: in Proc. of EP 2 DS- 17 (Genoa, Italy, 2007...|$|R

The CDW can act as a charged lattice but the proportion of the total charge density assigned to the CDW and to <b>quasiparticles</b> depends on the external conditions. If the collisions between <b>quasiparticles</b> can be ignored, the effective charge of the CDW is different in the static and dynamic limits. In the static limit the <b>quasiparticles</b> relax to screen spatial variations and the form is analogous to that used for superfluids. In the dynamic limit the <b>quasiparticles</b> do not renormalize the effective charge.

25|$|From the {{perspective}} of solid state physics, Brillouin scattering is an interaction between an electromagnetic wave {{and one of the}} three above-mentioned crystalline lattice waves. The scattering is inelastic i.e. the photon may lose energy (Stokes process) and in the process create one of the three <b>quasiparticle</b> types (phonon, polaron, magnon) or it may gain energy (anti-Stokes process) by absorbing one of those <b>quasiparticle</b> types. Such a shift in photon energy, corresponding to a Brillouin shift in frequency, is equal to the energy of the released or absorbed <b>quasiparticle.</b> Thus, Brillouin scattering can be used to measure the energies, wavelengths and frequencies of various atomic chain oscillation types ('quasiparticles'). To measure a Brillouin shift a commonly employed device called the Brillouin spectrometer is used, the design of which is derived from a Fabry–Pérot interferometer.|$|E

40|$|The main {{features}} of fermion condensation {{quantum phase transition}} (FCQPT), which are distinctive in several aspects from that of conventional quantum phase transition (CQPT), are considered. We show that in contrast to CQPT, whose physics in quantum critical region is dominated by thermal and quantum fluctuations and characterized {{by the absence of}} <b>quasiparticles,</b> the physics of a Fermi system near FCQPT or undergone FCQPT is controlled by the system of <b>quasiparticles</b> resembling the Landau <b>quasiparticles.</b> Contrary to the Landau <b>quasiparticles,</b> the effective mass of these <b>quasiparticles</b> strongly depends on the temperature, magnetic fields, density, etc. This system of <b>quasiparticles</b> having general properties determines the universal behavior of the Fermi system in question. As a result, the universal behavior persists up to relatively high temperatures comparatively to the case when such a behavior is determined by CQPT. We analyze striking recent measurements of specific heat, charge and heat transport used to study the nature of magnetic field-induced QCP in heavy-fermion metal CeCoIn$_ 5 $ and show that the observed facts are in good agreement with our scenario based on FCQPT and certainly seem to rule out the critical fluctuations related with CQPT. Our general consideration suggests that FCQPT and the emergence of novel <b>quasiparticles</b> near and behind FCQPT and resembling the Landau <b>quasiparticles</b> are distinctive features intrinsic to strongly correlated substances.

50|$|<b>Quasi{{particles}}</b> are not particles as such, {{but rather}} an emergent entity in a complex material system that behaves like a particle. In 1982 Robert Laughlin explained the fractional quantum Hall effect by postulating the existence of fractionally-charged <b>quasiparticles.</b> This theory is now widely accepted, {{but this is not}} considered to be a violation of the principle of charge quantization, since <b>quasiparticles</b> are not elementary particles.|$|R
25|$|A polaron is a <b>quasiparticle</b> used in {{condensed}} matter physics {{to understand}} the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. The polaron concept was first proposed by Lev Landau in 1933 to describe an electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms move from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. This lowers the electron mobility and increases the electron's effective mass.|$|E
25|$|To {{calculate}} the bands including electron-electron interaction many-body effects, one can resort to so-called Green's function methods. Indeed, {{knowledge of the}} Green's function of a system provides both ground (the total energy) and also excited state observables of the system. The poles of the Green's function are the <b>quasiparticle</b> energies, the bands of a solid. The Green's function can be calculated by solving the Dyson equation once the self-energy {{of the system is}} known. For real systems like solids, the self-energy is a very complex quantity and usually approximations are needed to solve the problem. One such approximation is the GW approximation, so called from the mathematical form the self-energy takes as the product Σ = GW of the Green's function G and the dynamically screened interaction W. This approach is more pertinent when addressing the calculation of band plots (and also quantities beyond, such as the spectral function) and can also be formulated in a completely ab initio way. The GW approximation seems to provide band gaps of insulators and semiconductors in agreement with experiment, and hence to correct the systematic DFT underestimation.|$|E
500|$|The quantum Hall {{effect was}} {{discovered}} by Klaus von Klitzing in 1980 when he observed the Hall conductance to be integer multiples of a fundamental constant [...](see figure) The effect was observed to be independent of parameters such as system size and impurities. [...] In 1981, theorist Robert Laughlin proposed a theory explaining the unanticipated precision of the integral plateau. [...] It also implied that the Hall conductance can be characterized {{in terms of a}} topological invariable called Chern number. Shortly after, in 1982, Horst Störmer and Daniel Tsui observed the fractional quantum Hall effect where the conductance was now a rational multiple of a constant. Laughlin, in 1983, realized that this was a consequence of <b>quasiparticle</b> interaction in the Hall states and formulated a variational method solution, named the Laughlin wavefunction. The study of topological properties of the fractional Hall effect remains an active field of research.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>quasiparticles</b> in superconducting qubits emerges as an intrinsic constraint on their coherence. While {{it is difficult}} to prevent the generation of <b>quasiparticles,</b> keeping them away from active elements of the qubit provides a viable way of improving the device performance. Here we develop theoretically and validate experimentally a model for the effect of a single small trap on the dynamics of the excess <b>quasiparticles</b> injected in a transmon-type qubit. The model allows one to evaluate {{the time it takes to}} evacuate the injected <b>quasiparticles</b> from the transmon as a function of trap parameters. With the increase of the trap size, this time decreases monotonically, saturating at the level determined by the <b>quasiparticles</b> diffusion constant and the qubit geometry.

2500|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that DFT {{is a theory}} to predict ground state properties of a system only (e.g. the total energy, the atomic structure, etc.), and that excited state properties cannot be determined by DFT. This is a misconception. [...] In principle, DFT can determine any property (ground state or excited state) of a system given a functional that maps the ground state density to that property. [...] This {{is the essence of}} the Hohenberg–Kohn theorem. In practice, however, no known functional exists that maps the ground state density to excitation energies of electrons within a material. [...] Thus, what in the literature is quoted as a DFT band plot is a representation of the DFT Kohn–Sham energies, i.e., the energies of a fictive non-interacting system, the Kohn–Sham system, which has no physical interpretation at all. The Kohn–Sham electronic structure must not be confused with the real, <b>quasiparticle</b> electronic structure of a system, and there is no Koopman's theorem holding for Kohn–Sham energies, as there is for Hartree–Fock energies, which can be truly considered as an approximation for <b>quasiparticle</b> energies. Hence, in principle, Kohn–Sham based DFT is not a band theory, i.e., not a theory suitable for calculating bands and band-plots. In principle time-dependent DFT can be used to calculate the true band structure although in practice this is often difficult. A popular approach is the use of hybrid functionals, which incorporate a portion of Hartree–Fock exact exchange; this produces a substantial improvement in predicted bandgaps of semiconductors, but is less reliable for metals and wide-bandgap materials.|$|E
