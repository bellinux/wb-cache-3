5|$|Students' {{answers to}} the free-response section are {{reviewed}} in early June by readers that include {{high school and college}} statistics teachers gathered in a designated location. The readers use a pre-made rubric to assess the answers and normally grade only one <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given exam. Each question is graded on a scale from 0 to 4, with a 4 representing the most complete response. Communication and clarity in the answers receive a lot of emphasis in the grading.|$|E
5|$|Researchers in {{the field}} {{advocate}} a teaching style that incorporates group problem-solving activities and demands higher-level thought. According to this process, a teacher initially poses a single <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of ways. Next, students discuss {{the problem with the}} teacher and amongst themselves, asking questions. In forming these questions, students are actively brainstorming and recalling prior knowledge. At this point, the teacher provides specific conditions of the issue discussed, and students must adapt their prior knowledge, along with that of their peers, to generate a solution. Other curriculum designs tailored to young children such as “” incorporate practices which aim to improve students’ capacity to shift and prolong attention as well as think “outside the box” (i.e. generate creative solutions).|$|E

500|$|The third {{important}} {{theory of}} hippocampal function relates the hippocampus to space. The spatial theory was originally championed by O'Keefe and Nadel, who {{were influenced by}} E.C. Tolman's theories about [...] "cognitive maps" [...] in humans and animals. [...] O'Keefe and his student Dostrovsky in 1971 discovered neurons in the rat hippocampus that appeared to them to show activity related to the rat's location within its environment. [...] Despite skepticism from other investigators, O'Keefe and his co-workers, especially Lynn Nadel, continued to investigate this <b>question,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> line of work that eventually led to their very influential 1978 book The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. [...] There is now almost universal agreement that hippocampal function {{plays an important role}} in spatial coding, but the details are widely debated.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Harvey Pollack, who at {{the time}} was in charge of {{publicity}} and statistics for the Warriors, has given conflicting statements on the <b>question.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 1992 book, he was twice quoted as saying that the game ended with 46 seconds remaining. But in a 2002 interview quoted by Chamberlain biographer Robert Cherry, Pollack said that the last 46 seconds were played, and that Chamberlain just stood in the middle circle, waiting for the game to end and not wanting to touch the ball, as [...] "100 sounded better than 102". The game's official box score notes that Warrior Joe Ruklick missed two free throws after the break. Ruklick said he planned to miss the second free throw in hopes that Chamberlain might rebound it and get 102points.|$|E

500|$|Jason {{has been}} {{referenced}} or parodied in other films. In the film Scream, directed by Freddy Krueger creator Wes Craven, actress Drew Barrymore's character is being stalked by a killer who calls {{her on her}} home phone. In order to survive, she must answer the man's trivia questions. One question is [...] "name the killer in Friday the 13th." [...] She incorrectly guesses Jason, who did not become the killer for the film series until Part 2. Writer Kevin Williamson claimed his inspiration for this scene came when he asked this <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bar while a group was playing a movie trivia quiz game. He received a free drink, because nobody got the answer right. In another Wes Craven film, Cursed, a wax sculpture of Jason, from Jason Goes to Hell, {{can be seen in}} a wax museum. [...] In 2014, Jason made a cameo appearance in the RadioShack Super Bowl XLVIII commercial [...] "The '80s Called".|$|E
500|$|Over time, a split of {{authority}} grew among lower courts {{with regard to}} whether the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception allowed officers to always conduct warrantless blood tests on individuals suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol because evidence of alcohol was being destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes. States that recognized this per se exigency argued that [...] "nce police arrest a suspect for drunk driving, each passing minute eliminates probative evidence of the crime." [...] In 2012, the Court granted review in Missouri v. McNeely to resolve this <b>question.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 5–4 opinion, the Court rejected the theory that the natural dissipation of blood alcohol constituted a per se exigency. Instead, the court affirmed the basic principle from Schmerber that absent [...] "an emergency that justifie acting without a warrant," [...] police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects. Consequently, exigency in drunk driving cases [...] "must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspired by her {{encounter}} with the caped crusader, Kate begins fighting crime using military body armor and weaponry stolen from her father's military base. After being confronted by Jake, Kate accepts his offer for assistance and begins an intense two years of training across the globe with her father's military friends. Upon returning to Gotham, Kate discovers that her father has created a Batsuit for her, along with an arsenal of experimental weaponry based on Batman's known gadgetry and a bunker hidden in the Kane home. The first reference to the modern Batwoman is made by the Penguin in Detective Comics #824 who suggests Batman bring a date {{to the opening of}} his club, asking, [...] "Why don't you bring that new Batwoman? I hear she's kind of hot." [...] In 52 #7 (2006) the new Batwoman is introduced. Kane is revealed to have been intimately involved with former Gotham City police detective Renee Montoya and is heiress to one of the wealthiest families in Gotham, owning that which the Wayne family does not. In her third appearance in issue #11 of 52 entitled [...] "Batwoman Begins," [...] Kane assists Montoya and her partner the <b>Question</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mystery revolving around a warehouse owned by Kane's family. When Montoya and the Question are attacked sometime later by Whisper A'Daire's shapeshifting minions, Kane intervenes as Batwoman and rescues them.|$|E

500|$|A 2003 {{survey of}} {{residents}} living around Scotland's 10 existing wind farms found {{high levels of}} community acceptance and strong support for wind power, with much support from those who lived closest to the wind farms. The results of this survey support those of an earlier Scottish Executive survey 'Public attitudes to the Environment in Scotland 2002', which found that the Scottish public would prefer {{the majority of their}} electric power to come from renewables, and which rated wind power as the cleanest source of renewable energy. A survey conducted in 2005 showed that 74% of people in Scotland agree that wind farms are necessary to meet current and future energy needs. When people were asked the same <b>question</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Scottish renewables study conducted in 2010, 78% agreed. The increase is significant as there were twice as many wind farms in 2010 as there were in 2005. The 2010 survey also showed that 52% disagreed with the statement that wind farms are [...] "ugly and a blot on the landscape". 59% agreed that wind farms were necessary and that how they looked was unimportant. Regarding tourism, query responders consider power pylons, cell phone towers, quarries and plantations more negatively than wind farms. Scotland is planning to obtain 100% of electric power from renewable sources by 2020.|$|E
500|$|Both referendums were {{severely}} {{criticized by}} the political opposition inside Belarus {{as well as by}} international observers such as the OSCE. Observers state that both referendums were non-transparent and that the real results were not published. Observers were not allowed to see the process of counting ballots. Specifically, the democratic opposition to President Lukashenko decided to boycott the 1996 referendum on the Constitution. During the same election, international observers found problems with the voting process or found pro-government advertisements or notices at polling places. Opposition parties contend that the vote to dissolve the Supreme Soviet in 1996 removed Belarus' last democratically elected parliament and installed Lukashenko's hand picked parliament. Despite the claims of manipulation of the elections and the Constitution itself, there are a few parts of the current constitution approved by key leaders of the Belarusian democratic opposition. In a 2005 interview with Radio Free Europe, presidential candidate Alaksandar Milinkievič stated that Belarus' stance as a neutral country, stated in Article 18, should be preserved with regard to joining NATO and the European Union. Legal interpretation of the Constitution is also brought into <b>question.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> 1998 journal, the New York University School of Law noted that Belarusian legal scholars came up with a new theory to deal with jurisprudence. Laws are constitutional if they follow the will of President Lukashenko and the people; unconstitutional if the president and the people do not like it. The laws that fall in the latter category are considered [...] "ignored" [...] by the legal scholars. In June 1999, a Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers from the United Nations visited Belarus and noted inconsistency between national laws, decrees and the Constitution. The UN rapporteur, Dato Param Cumaraswamy, especially noted that temporary decrees issued by the national authorities are still in force, even if they had expired or contradict the Constitution.|$|E
