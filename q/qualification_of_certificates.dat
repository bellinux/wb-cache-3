However {{it is not clear}} what challenges they encounter as they study and teach simultaneously, often in remote and isolated communities. Although the programme has been running for some time, no such study has been conducted. Against this background, this is the first study to explore the challenges of DE to rural teachers. The study employed a qualitative methodology using the social constructivist model of seeking to build knowledge with the respondents. Thus, the major instruments employed were interviews and observations. The study found that being adult learners, the teachers had strong intrinsic motivation to succeed but also faced challenges arising from university administrative circumstantial support systems. The study concludes that such systemic support should be revisited if the DE programme is to truly serve the needs of its participants.

Then, a questionnaire survey was conducted to prioritize the identified collusive practices {{in terms of their}} probability and severity. The survey results indicate that the primary collusive practices in Chinese construction projects are misrepresentation <b>of</b> <b>qualification</b> <b>certificates,</b> loose site supervision, misusing prequalification requirements, fake tendering, approval of the unnecessary change orders, collective collusive tendering by helping one another, the nomination of a particular supplier, issuing certified works falsely, and inflating tender price.

40|$|Systems {{thinking}} is often invoked as a panacea {{for dealing with}} issues of sustainable development. Imperatives towards being more holistic - getting the bigger picture – are often coupled with a need for greater interdisciplinarity - joined-up-thinking – particularly amongst triple bottom line disciplines of economics, social studies and natural sciences. So why are systems thinking courses not more prevalent? And how might the teaching of systems thinking enhance the value of thinking differently about sustainable development?
