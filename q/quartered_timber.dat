50|$|To {{the south}} of the {{footbridge}} along Hamilton Street are the remaining quarters buildings. The first is the Single Men's <b>Quarters,</b> a <b>timber</b> building with a hipped corrugated iron roof, and a posted verandah to all four sides, onto which open several doorways. Connected to the rear is a timber addition housing amenities. Similar {{to other parts of the}} complex, it has a perimeter fence of timber posts and a piece of upturned railway track as the rail.|$|R
50|$|Next is the Inspectors <b>quarters,</b> a high-set <b>timber</b> {{house with}} front {{verandah}} {{returning to the}} southern side, which is apparently a standard elevated pyramidal gatekeepers cottage. At the corner is the Station Masters house, also of timber and corrugated iron, which has both open and enclosed verandahs. Between are more recent small fibrous cement cottages.|$|R
50|$|On {{the first}} floor balcony along the eastern elevation, new timber lattice board has been erected above the railing for added privacy for the private <b>quarters.</b> Another two <b>timber</b> {{partitions}} are located along the eastern elevation balcony to provide privacy between rooms. The verandah on eastern side has considerable damage, including missing balusters and water damage. Access to rooms is by original timber French doors.|$|R
40|$|The study {{describes}} moulding {{recovery and}} quality of seven Indonesian industrial wood species, i,e. meranti putih (shorea koordersii), sungkai (phenomena canescens jack). Cempaka (elmerillia ovalis dandy), dahu (dracontomelon dao), Perupuk (solenospermum sp.) meranti merah (shorea sp.). and kapur (dryobalanops sp.). It is found that volume recovery varies from 38. 7 to 80. 2 per cent. An optimal allowances for moulding raw material are 3. 0 mm in thickness and 9. 6 mm in yidthSungkai, dahu, Perupuk and kapur species produced the best moulding quality. Moulding quality of the other species {{is found to be}} of good quality. The processing of cempaka and meranti species, especially on their radial surface or <b>quarter</b> swan <b>timber,</b> should be undertaken carefully because of they have genetical interlocked grains...|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{elevation}} {{features an}} open portal, with a vaulted covering sheltered by a gabled awning, supported on coupled columns, featuring plaster cast capitals and bases. The portal opens onto an arcaded entrance porch, defined by similar columns, {{from which a}} closed <b>timber</b> <b>quarter</b> turn stair runs to the gallery. Panelled timber doors open off the entrance bay to the church. Above the portal are three round headed arched window openings, glazed with leadlight.|$|R
25|$|The defence {{installations}} at False Cape were concrete structures, comprising two gun emplacements, {{a battery}} observation post, and a main magazine which stored 400 rounds of 155mm ammunition {{for the two}} guns. Ready ammunition was housed in smaller shell and cartridge magazines constructed as part of each gun emplacement. Duty personnel <b>quarters,</b> probably of <b>timber</b> construction, were erected adjacent to the battery observation post. An anti-aircraft gun was mounted above the main magazine and No.2 gun emplacement. All of these installations were camouflaged with netting.|$|R
50|$|The Matron's {{flat and}} {{household}} workers' <b>quarters</b> is a <b>timber</b> framed building lined with tongue and grooved pine elevated on timber stumps. The verandahs {{are lined with}} fibrous cement sheeting to sill height with venetian blinds above. The Matron's flat, contained a verandah, office, bedroom, lounge, vestibule, front hall and bathroom. The Household workers' quarters contained a hallway, bedroom, sewing room, dining room, lounge, and back and side verandahs. All internal partition walls have been removed and the building {{was used as a}} kitchen until recently and is now unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} few years of the 1910s major {{redevelopment}} of the station was planned and the whole site was re-organised. The timber footbridge of 1900 was replaced with a steel framed structure with timber decking. The timber decking was replaced with steel mesh decking in 1932. Further extensions of the 1910s included the May 1912 replacement of a 40-foot turntable on the northern end of the site with a 58-foot model, to accommodate larger locomotives. Various alterations were made to the passenger station, these involved the addition of a refreshment room on the south end of the building joining the kitchen block to the station. Several residences were erected on the eastern boundary of the site, as well as various railway community buildings including the timber building used for crews' sleeping <b>quarters.</b> A <b>timber</b> extension of the Goods Shed used for offices, was extended again by July 1912. Plans were made for the erection of a semi-circular locomotive shed or part round-house in 1912. In 1921 a coal stage was added to the site.|$|R
50|$|The former Aboriginal <b>quarters</b> is a <b>timber</b> framed building, once {{sheltered}} by a {{gable roof}} with skillion roofs extending {{to the north}} and south, that stands in a paddock some 240 metres south of the main house. The roof framing and corrugated iron roof sheeting has blown off in a violent storm and lies stacked nearby. The north wall is constructed of vertical timber slabs set into a bedlog and notched to take a top rail; a concrete half wall stands to the west, and the south and east walls are clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The building has concrete floors, upstands and drains, and metal gates and fences remaining from its use as a piggery.|$|R
40|$|Holmen Skog AB is an {{important}} supplier of conifer pulpwood to the Iggesund Paperboard mill. After logging and transport to the landing by a forwarder, the wood is loaded on trucks for further transport, often by using separate loaders. During this handling process considerable amounts of stone material is sometimes mixed into the pulpwood and this causes problems for the industry. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify which part of the chain from forest to pulpmill, that contributes the most to this contamination. Sizes and total volumes of the contaminating stones were also investigated. Landings with stacks of wood were picked through by a forwarder to locate the individual stones. The same stacks were then run through the industry process and stones from the stone traps were registered. The result show that three quarters of the stone material could be related to the use of a separate loader at the landing while the forwarder contributed with the remaining one <b>quarter.</b> Each <b>timber</b> truck, with a load of 45 solid cubic meters under bark, brought on average 1. 4 stones, sized over 12 cm, to the industry which is far from an acceptable level...|$|R
40|$|Volume {{yield and}} quality of timber when using Star-sawing {{technique}} by Hans Holmberg and Dick Sandberg Abstract Volume yield and quality are investigated when starsawing logs of pine (Pinus silvestris L) and spruce (Picea abies Karst). Topdiameters of timber were for pine sorted in two classes 260 - 300 rnm and 300 - 340 mm. Spruce timber were sorted in one class with top diameters between 290 and 340 mm. The investigation shows a volume yield considerably higher for starsawing compared to conventional techniques. This investigation, carried out on a simple testplant, yields 68 %calculated from top volume of log. Volume yield calculated from a cone with top and root diameters is 56 %. With sideboards included these numbers will incerease with one percent. The triangular profiles is 47 % of the total volume and the rest 53 % are quarter sawn boards. The volume yield of spruce is about one percent higher than for pine. The difference is assumed to depend on more pronounced taper of the log in spruce, wich allows easier positioning of the log. Quality is determined with a method developed especially for <b>quarter</b> sawn <b>timber.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|As the fur trade {{declined}} in importance, the timber trade became Canada's most important commodity. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The {{first to be}} exploited was the Saint John River system. Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England. This area soon could {{not keep up with}} demand, and the trade moved to the St. Lawrence River where logs were shipped to Quebec City before being sent on to Europe. This area also became insufficient, and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the Ottawa River system, which by 1845 provided three <b>quarters</b> of the <b>timber</b> shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business. In one summer 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone.|$|R
5000|$|By 1916, the {{government}} intended {{to lay out}} the main settlement area, [...] "with regard to proper alignment and model village design" [...] and by 1918 a [...] "village square" [...] planted with shade trees had been established. Building and construction work was undertaken incrementally {{over the life of the}} reserve in this main settlement area. Many of these structures were rudimentary and inadequate with Annual Reports repeatedly drawing attention to the need for new and improved structures. Better quality timber buildings were constructed for administrative purposes and as staff <b>quarters,</b> with some <b>timber</b> sourced from Barambah's sawmill. The buildings reported to have been constructed between 1912 and 1923 included: a permanent Superintendent's residence (1912), quarters for the Assistant Superintendent and a Superintendent's office (1916-17); a lockup (by 1913) hospital (described as [...] "slab walled" [...] in 1919), nurses quarters (1917) two weatherboard cottages used as officers' quarters (1921); and in 1923, isolation quarters and combined office and store accommodation.|$|R
50|$|The Napoleonic Wars and the Continental {{blockade}} cut off, or {{at least}} reduced the Baltic trade so the British looked northwards to the colonies that had remained loyal and were still available.

Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of New Brunswick were cut and transported to Saint John where they were shipped to England.

50|$|The {{work was}} {{commenced}} {{the first week}} in January, and was prosecuted with the utmost energy, as their lives, apparently, depended on its completion. As fast as the block houses were built, the families moved into them. They were thirteen in number, arranged in two rows, with a wide street between, as shown in the engraving. The basement story was in general twenty feet square, and the upper about twenty-two feet, thus projecting over the lower one, and forming a defense from which to protect the doors and windows below, in an attack. They were built of round logs a foot in diameter, and the interstices nicely chinked and pointed with mortar. The doors and window shutters were made of thick oak planks, or puncheons, and secured with stout bars of wood on the inside. The larger timbers were hauled with ox-teams, of which they had several yokes, while the lighter for the roofs, gates, &c, were dragged along on hand sleds, with ropes, by the men. The drawing was much facilitated by a few inches of snow, which covered the ground. The pickets were made of <b>quartered</b> oak <b>timber,</b> growing on the plain back of the garrison, formed from trees about a foot in diameter, fourteen feet in length, and set four feet deep in the ground, leaving them ten feet high, over which no enemy could mount without a ladder. The smooth side was set outward, and the palisades strengthened and kept in their places by stout ribbons, or wall pieces, pinned to them with inch treenails on the inside. The spaces between the houses were filled up with pickets, and occupied three or four times the width of the houses, forming a continuous wall, or inclosure, about eighty rods in length and six rods wide. The palisades on the river side filled the whole space, and projected {{over the edge of the}} bank, leaning on rails and posts set to support them. They were sloped in this manner for the admission of air during the heat of summer.|$|R
