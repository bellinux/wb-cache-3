Most of the older officers had more experience under the Vietnamese National Army during the French colonial era, and some of the younger men saw them as too detached from the modern situation. The Young Turks had <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> influence over Khánh, as Thi and Kỳ had intervened militarily to save him from a coup attempt in September by Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức.|$|E

One scholar has counted 278 un-Homeric words in Works and Days, 151 in Theogony and 95 in Shield of Heracles. The {{disproportionate number of}} un-Homeric words in W & D is due to its un-Homeric subject matter. Hesiod's vocabulary also includes <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> formulaic phrases that are not found in Homer, which indicates {{that he may have}} been writing within a different tradition.|$|E
25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri.

We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time organizing.

25|$|There {{are quite}} a few guitar solos on this album. To be honest, I've never really classed myself as a lead player as such, {{but this is the first}} time I've sat down and seriously practiced lead work. I've been so {{involved}} in actually writing new material and coming up with song structures that I haven't had time to practice all the frilly things that go on top of it. Up 'till now, there hasn't really been much room for guitar solos as such. The riffs we write, they're not riffs that are meant to be soloed on top of. They're melodic within themselves. But I'm a great believer that less is definitely more. I love listening to all the shreddy, widdly stuff, but I have no interest in playing it. This new album is quite guitar-orientated. The last album was, but this is definitely more melodic. Dare I say it, there are <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> typical Maiden-esque harmonies in there.|$|E
25|$|Despite the tribulations {{created by}} the Second World War, Richmond was able to {{maintain}} a commendable level of consistency on the field. The club had <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> players in reserved occupations who remained at home, while the administration became adept at securing star players who were temporarily in Melbourne on war service. Dyer was a fearsome presence {{in his role as}} playing coach, but he was unable to improve Richmond's ability to win finals matches. A loss in the 1942 VFL Grand Final to Essendon (after starting as favourite) meant that over the previous 18 years, Richmond had won two flags but been runner-up eight times. Jack Titus set a still unbeaten record of playing in six losing Grand Final teams. In 1943, Richmond broke through to beat Essendon in a thrilling Grand Final by five points, a win that the club dedicated to ex-player Bill Cosgrove, an RAF pilot who had been killed in action {{a few weeks before the}} match. But another Grand Final loss followed in 1944, when Dyer's team failed against Fitzroy on a very hot day.|$|E
25|$|After {{the current}} splits into the Svalbard Branch and the Yermak Branch, the general sinking process {{described}} above still {{continues in the}} Svalbard Branch. However, in the Yermak Branch the WSC {{is not able to}} penetrate deep inside the Arctic Ocean because the zone it enters has very strong tidal mixing. This allows the Atlantic Water to mix with the Polar Waters, creating more of a homogeneous mixture of relatively warm and moderately saline water. This extends down to about 300 meters which is recognized as the bottom depth of the Return Atlantic Current. For the Svalbard Branch, the Atlantic Water core of the WSC continues to sink as it meets more and more freshwater on its eastern route. It sinks fairly quickly to a depth greater than 100 meters by the time it reaches the Barents Sea because in Northern Svalbard there is <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> freshwater run-off from fjords which adds to a deeper, less dense Arctic Surface Water and thus a deeper WSC. By the time this water recirculates to the Beaufort Gyre, the Atlantic core of the WSC is 400 to 500 meters deep. Unlike the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current, the Svalbard Branch is able to retain a strong Atlantic Water chemical signal whereas the Yermak Branch and the Return Atlantic Current carry a very weak Atlantic Water signal. The Atlantic Water core temperature is a direct reflection of the depth of the Svalbard Branch of the WSC.|$|E
