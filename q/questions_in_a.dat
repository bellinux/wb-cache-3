5|$|Born into a well-read {{and educated}} family, Hambro {{developed}} {{a penchant for}} French literature, marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of English literature in the Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel De frafalnes klubb, Hambro published trilogies and other novels {{for the next two}} decades. He had a keen interest in linguistics; in the 1969 book Ting, tanke, tale he problematized linguistic <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> popular scientific way. A translator of French literature, he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s.|$|E

According to the newspaper Hürriyet, he displayed a notably calm demeanor while he was questioned and answered <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cold-blooded manner.|$|E

25|$|In 1587 Hatton {{was made}} Lord Chancellor. Though {{he had no}} great {{knowledge}} of the law, {{he appears to have}} acted with sound sense and good judgement in his new position.

25|$|Question Period has a {{reputation}} for being quite chaotic due to the commonplace cat-calling and jeering from non-participating MPs, but notwithstanding the heckling, Question Period is actually tightly-regulated. Parties are only allowed to ask a predetermined number of questions based on the size of their caucus, and must ask their <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> specific order, predetermined by their party leadership for that day on a list given to the Speaker.|$|E
25|$|The CPSS scale assesses {{avoidance}} {{and change}} of activities, {{which may not}} accurately reflect pathology. This could possibly result in higher PTSD prevalence estimations. In a study, the CPSS scale correctly classified 72.2% of children. Nearly one-quarter of children were misclassified and 5.6% were misclassified (false negative). CPSS is a self-reporting assessment and is, therefore, subject to social desirability bias. Social desirability bias influences respondents to answer <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that presents them more favorably to others. This interferes {{with the purpose of}} the assessment and prevents clinicians from properly screening for PTSD.|$|E
25|$|One {{important}} aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly assume children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not {{given an opportunity to}} develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills and ask <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.|$|E

25|$|The {{examination}} is of 3 hours duration, {{and contains}} {{a total of}} 65 questions worth a maximum of 100 marks. From 2014 onward, the examination for all the papers is carried out in an online Computer Based Test (CBT) mode where the candidates are shown the <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> random sequence on a computer screen. The questions consist of both multiple choice questions (four answer options out of which the correct {{one has to be}} chosen) and numerical answer type questions (answer is a real number, to be entered via an on-screen keypad and computer mouse). Candidates are provided with scribble pads for rough work and these have to be returned after the examination. At the end of the 3-hour window, the computer automatically closes the screen from further actions.|$|E
25|$|Courts {{may receive}} Charter <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of ways. Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a {{criminal}} law that they argue is unconstitutional. Others may feel government services and policies {{are not being}} dispensed {{in accordance with the}} Charter, and apply to lower-level courts for injunctions against the government (as was the case in Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)). A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting reference questions to higher-level courts; for example, Prime Minister Paul Martin's government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case Re Same-Sex Marriage (2004). Provinces may also do this with their superior courts. The government of Prince Edward Island initiated the Provincial Judges Reference by asking its provincial Supreme Court a question on judicial independence under section 11.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} the accident, the Coast Guard had {{reported that the}} New York City Fire Department (FDNY) had rescued one survivor from the Hudson River; however, this report was shown to be incorrect. In addition to FDNY, six rescue boat crews from Coast Guard Station New York, a Coast Guard rescue helicopter crew from Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City, several Coast Guard Auxiliary assets, the New York City Police Department (NYPD), New Jersey State Police, and local emergency services all participated in the rescue effort. The Red Cross and the New York Harbor Police also assisted in the efforts. At about 3:00p.m., Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, addressed <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> press conference. Calling the crash [...] "an accident which {{we do not believe}} was survivable," [...] Bloomberg announced that the mission was no longer a rescue mission, but rather a recovery mission.|$|E

500|$|The {{subjective}} events {{allow students}} more creativity than the objective events. The speech event {{is divided into}} prepared and impromptu sections. A three-and-a-half to four-minute long prepared speech is delivered. The student is then given one minute to read three prompts and deliver a one-and-a-half to two-minute impromptu speech. Example prompts have included: [...] "It {{has been said about}} our modern times that, 'Invention is the mother of necessity.' Please discuss.", [...] "Math has been described as the universal language. Discuss." [...] and [...] "Why is light, light and dark, dark?" [...] In the interview, the students are asked a wide variety of <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> formal environment. Questions range from: [...] "Who is your role model?" [...] to [...] "How would you alert someone that their zipper is down?" [...] In both the speech and interview, the competitor is not allowed to reveal his or her school or hometown to ensure neutrality by the judges. In the essay event, students are given 50 minutes to write an essay responding to one of three prompts derived from the language and literature or the Super Quiz curriculum.|$|E
500|$|A dual-layer DVD release, {{with special}} {{features}} including trailers, making-of documentaries, and a recorded encoffining ceremony, {{was released in}} Japan on 18 March 2009. [...] A North American DVD edition of Departures, including {{an interview with the}} director, was released by Koch Vision on 12 January 2010; the film was not dubbed, but rather presented with Japanese audio and English subtitles. A Blu-ray edition followed in May. This home release received mixed reviews. Franck Tabouring of DVD Verdict was highly complimentary toward the film and the digital transfer, considering its visuals clean and sharp and the audio (particularly the music) [...] "a pleasure to listen to". Thomas Spurlin, writing for DVD Talk, rated the release as [...] "Highly Recommended", focusing on the [...] "unexpected powerhouse" [...] of the film's quality. Another writer for the website, Jeremy Mathews, advised readers to [...] "Skip It", finding the DVD an apt presentation of the source material—which he considered to [...] "reduce itself to clumsy, mug-filled attempts at broad comedy and awkward, repetitive tear-jerker scenes". [...] Both DVD Talk reviews agreed that the audio and visual quality were less than perfect, and that the DVD's extra contents were poor; Mathews described the interview as the director answering [...] "dull <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dull manner".|$|E
