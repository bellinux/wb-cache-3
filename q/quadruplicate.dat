60|$|What {{subject or}} group of {{subjects}} is to constitute (i)? There are at least three, and quite probably beyond the very limited range of my knowledge there are other, arrangements of studies that can be contrived to supply this essential substantial part of the College course. Each suffices completely, and I would hesitate to express any preference for one or the other. Each has its special direction towards certain sorts of adult function, {{and for that reason}} it may be suggested that the secondary education of an English-speaking country might very well afford all three (or more) types of secondary course. The small schools might specialize upon the type locally most desirable, the larger might group its triplicate (or <b>quadruplicate)</b> system of sustained and serious courses about a common Library and the common arrangements for Section ii. of the College scheme.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{six miles}} of macadamised road showed {{us that the}} team could move. A railway ran {{between us and the}} banks of the Willamette, and another above us through the mountains. All the land was dotted with small townships, and the roads were full of farmers in their town wagons, bunches of tow-haired, boggle-eyed urchins sitting in the hay behind. The men {{generally}} looked like loafers, but their women were all well dressed. Brown hussar-braiding on a tailor-made jacket does not, however, consort with hay-wagons. Then we struck into the woods along what California called a [...] "camina reale,"--a good road,--and Portland a [...] "fair track." [...] It wound in and out among fire-blackened stumps, under pine trees, along the corners of log-fences, through hollows which must be hopeless marsh in the winter, and up absurd gradients. But nowhere throughout its length did I see any evidence of road-making. There was a track,--you couldn't well get off it,--and it was all you could do to stay on it. The dust lay a foot thick in the blind ruts, and under the dust we found bits of planking and bundles of brushwood that sent the wagon bounding into the air. Sometimes we crashed through bracken; anon where the blackberries grew rankest we found a lonely little cemetery, the wooden rails all awry, and the pitiful stumpy headstones nodding drunkenly at the soft green mulleins. Then with oaths and the sound of rent underwood a yoke of mighty bulls would swing down a [...] "skid" [...] road, hauling a forty-foot log along a rudely made slide. A valley full of wheat and cherry trees succeeded, and halting at a house we bought ten pound weight of luscious black cherries for something less than a rupee and got a drink of icy-cold water for nothing, while the untended team browsed sagaciously by the roadside. Once we found a wayside camp of horse-dealers lounging by a pool, ready for a sale or a swap, and once two sun-tanned youngsters shot down a hill on Indian ponies, their full creels banging from the high-pommelled saddles. They had been fishing, and were our brethren therefore. We shouted aloud in chorus to scare a wild-cat; we squabbled over the reasons that had led a snake to cross a road; we heaved bits of bark at a venturesome chipmunk, who was really the little grey squirrel of India and had come to call on me; we lost our way and got the wagon so beautifully fixed on a steep road that we had to tie the two hind-wheels to get it down. Above all, California told tales of Nevada and Arizona, of lonely nights spent out prospecting, of the slaughter of deer and the chase of men; of woman, lovely woman, who is a firebrand in a Western city, and leads to the popping of pistols, and of the sudden changes and chances of Fortune, who delights in making the miner or the lumberman a <b>quadruplicate</b> millionnaire, and in [...] "busting" [...] the railroad king. That was a day to be remembered, and it had only begun when we drew rein at a tiny farmhouse {{on the banks of the}} Clackamas and sought horse-feed and lodging ere we hastened to the river that broke over a weir not a quarter of a mile away.|$|E

The line would run along the south bank of the Neckar through Esslingen with a station south of the Neckar in the Pliensauvorstadt district. In 1909, decided the Württemberg State Railways decided for cost reasons not to build the new line as far as Plochingen, but only up to the existing Eßlingen station, running over a 260-metre-long bridge over the Neckar. Since the proposed railway line was always in competition with proposals to <b>quadruplicate</b> the Fils Valley line, it was postponed and ultimately never built.|$|E

40|$|Soil-transmitted {{helminth}} {{infections are}} a major public health problem. An accurate diagnosis is important {{in order to identify}} individuals and communities in need of intervention, and for monitoring drug efficacy and potential emergence of resistance. We compared the accuracy of the Kato-Katz method and ether-concentration technique for the diagnosis of soil-transmitted helminth infections within a randomised controlled trial. <b>Quadruplicate</b> Kato-Katz thick smears (duplicate Kato-Katz from two stool samples each) were examined before (baseline) and 3  weeks after treatment (follow-up). Additionally, at baseline and follow-up, the first stool sample was subjected to an ether-concentration method. We determined the prevalence, sensitivity, negative predictive value, diagnostic agreement and cure rates for single and duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears from the first stool sample, <b>quadruplicate</b> Kato-Katz thick smears produced from two stool samples and single ether-concentration as compared to our 'gold' standard (i. e. <b>quadruplicate</b> Kato-Katz plus ether-concentration). <b>Quadruplicate</b> Kato-Katz revealed a higher sensitivity than single ether-concentration for Trichuris trichiura at baseline (94. 3  % vs. 88. 5  %, p[*]=[*] 0. 002) and follow-up (93. 8  % vs. 83. 5  %, p[*]>[*] 0. 001). In contrary, at follow-up, ether-concentration showed a higher sensitivity than <b>quadruplicate</b> Kato-Katz for Ascaris lumbricoides diagnosis (86. 7  % vs. 46. 7 %, p[*]=[*] 0. 012). The ether-concentration method showed similar or slightly higher sensitivity than the Kato-Katz technique based on a single stool sample for all soil-transmitted helminth infections. The estimated cure rates were heavily dependent on the diagnostic technique and sampling effort. In conclusion, data on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections and the efficacy of anthelminthics are greatly influenced by the diagnostic method and sampling effort. The ether-concentration technique is a valuable alternative to the Kato-Katz method for helminth diagnosis...|$|E
