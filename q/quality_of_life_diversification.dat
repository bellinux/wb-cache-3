40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to present rural funding within the European Cohesion Policy, which {{finances}} the EU Member states' programmes for socio-economic development. In the thesis, Structural and Cohesion Funds {{as well as the}} great impact of the territorial cohesion on strengthening cross-border and interregional connections are introduced. In 2004, Slovenia {{became a member of the}} EU and since 2007 it has been included in the new programme period of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, which positively influences rural development. In the period from 2007 to 2013, Slovenia has been introduced to the Operational Programme for Rural Development. This programme develops agricultural and economic competitiveness, improves environment and countryside as well as the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and the <b>diversification</b> <b>of</b> rural economy. On a local level, in municipalities, the main focus is on local development strategies. The central part of the thesis presents the Radlje ob Dravi municipality and the projects, which were set up through additional European funds. The excluded area within the region, poor economic development and limited life opportunities are critically discussed; however, some suggestions for the improvement of the countryside are added. The main tasks of mutual Slovenia–Austria Cross–border Cooperation Programme are introduced. An analysis on neighbouring Austrian municipalities is included, statistically compared with the Radlje ob Dravi municipality. In addition, dissimilar history of the countries' development is described. Rural development programmes are more successful, if rural inhabitants cooperate with each other, and are essential for reaching the desired goals and successfully finished projects. The thesis also deals with the development of the border area, cross-border cooperation and the significance for joining common projects...|$|R

40|$|Background: The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> {{elderly people}} has become {{relevant}} with the demographic shift {{that has resulted}} in greying of population. There are indications that concepts and concerns related to <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in older ages are different from the general population. Methods: A narrative review of selected literature. Results: <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is described often with both objective and subjective dimensions. The majority of the elderly people evaluate their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> positively on the basis of social contacts, dependency, health, material circumstances and social comparisons. Adaptation and resilience might play a part in maintaining good <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Although there are no cultural differences in the subjective dimension <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> in the objective dimension such differences exist. Two major factors to be considered with regard to <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in old age are dementia and depression. Discussion: With all other influences controlled, ageing does not influence <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> negatively; rather a long period <b>of</b> good <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is possible.

40|$|Objective: <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> {{patients}} with post-stroke aphasia {{is very important}} aspect of research and rehabilitation of these persons. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the impact of severity and type <b>of</b> aphasia on <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in patients after one year of onset of first-ever stroke. Subjects and Methods: It was investigated 51 post-stroke adult aphasic patients (23 males and 28 females) who were treated at the Department of Neurology, University Clinical Center Tuzla, Bosnia andHerzegovina. For determining the severity and type of aphasia Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination was used and the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> was assessed using The Stroke and Aphasia <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Scale- 39. Results: Patients with aphasia have reduced <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> at physical, communication, psychosocial and energy domain. Type of aphasic syndrome significantly affects <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> (r= 0. 677, p= 0. 00). Patients with mixed nonfluent and Broca’s aphasia have worst <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Using the multiple comparison (Tukey-test) it was found that persons with these two aphasic syndromes have significantly lower <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> compared to those with diagnosed anomic aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia and alexia with agraphia (p< 0. 05). Aphasia severity was significantly correlated with <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> (r = 0. 730, p = 0. 00). Conclusions: Persons with mild post-stroke aphasia have higher <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and persons with more severe post-stroke aphasia have lower <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> one year after onset of first-ever stroke. Type of aphasic syndrome is significantly associated with <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Subjects with mixed nonfluent and Broca’s aphasia have worst <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{scientific}} production about <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> during pregnancy in national and international journals, in the period from 2003 to 2008. Methodology: a qualitative bibliographic research carried out through the MEDLINE, LILACS SCIELO, and BEDENF databases, using the descriptors <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and pregnancy. Data was collected in June 2008. In {{order to meet the}} research objectives, similar data was grouped in four different topics: Connection between <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> pain, and physiologic changes during pregnancy; Connection between <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and risky maternal behavior; Connection between <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and nutritional situation during pregnancy; General issues regarding pregnant women’s <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Results: it was observed that the 21 selected articles were concerned with maternal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and with fetal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> during its intrauterine life and later during childhood and adult life. Studies about the practice of nursing related to pregnant women’s <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> were not found.

40|$|Re-defining {{the meaning}} <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> amongst urban {{society is a}} small {{contribution}} in social knowledge that is applicable to environmental management in Malaysia. Most working definitions <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> are confined to the totalling up of urban environment infrastructure facilities. It is assumed that if the facilities are good, then the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is also good although in reality it is a mere assumption. This article argues that <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is not static in its meaning, {{even if it is}} in the same environment. In reality <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is defined by experiences beside what is provided for by the environment. In such a case <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> provides a negotiated meaning. An empirical study was carried out in Seremban to determine the status <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> its population. The result of the study is deeply induced to determine the meaning <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> the urban population to be applied to the field of social knowledge and environmental management in Malaysia.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to clarify the impact of adverse events associated with the initial course of outpatient chemotherapy on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> breast cancer patients. We conducted a survey to assess the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in 48 breast cancer patients before and after receiving their first course of outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu Municipal Hospital. Patients completed the European <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> 5 Dimensions and <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anticancer Drugs before and after 1 course of outpatient chemotherapy. European <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> 5 Dimensions utility value and <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anticancer Drugs total score decreased significantly after chemotherapy (p< 0. 001 and p = 0. 018, respectively). The mean scores for the activity, physical condition, and psychological condition subscales <b>of</b> the <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anticancer Drugs decreased significantly after chemotherapy (p = 0. 003, p< 0. 001, and p = 0. 032, respectively), whereas the social relationships score increased significantly (p< 0. 001). Furthermore, in the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> according to individual adverse events, the decrease in <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> after chemotherapy in terms <b>of</b> the European <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> 5 Dimensions utility value and the <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Questionnaire for Cancer Patients Treated with Anticancer Drugs total score was greater in anorexic patients than in non-anorexic patients (p = 0. 009 and p< 0. 001, respectively).
