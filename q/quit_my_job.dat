2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1954 and from Fordham University in the Bronx with a bachelor's degree in Communication Arts in 1958, DeLillo {{took a job}} in {{advertising}} because he couldn't get one in publishing. He worked for five years as a copywriter at the agency of Ogilvy & Mather on Fifth Avenue at East 48th Street, writing image ads for Sears Roebuck among others, working on [...] "Print ads, very undistinguished accounts....I hadn’t made the leap to television. I was just getting good at it when I left, in 1964." [...] DeLillo published his first short story in 1960—"The River Jordan", in Epoch, the literary magazine of Cornell University—and began {{to work on his}} first novel in 1966. Discussing the beginning of his writing career, DeLillo said, [...] "I did some short stories at that time, but very infrequently. I <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> just to quit. I didn't <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> to write fiction. I just didn't want to work anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Comedy Central premiered Office Space on August 5, 2001 and 1.4 {{million viewers}} tuned in. By 2003, the channel had {{broadcast}} the film another 35 times.

He said, [...] "I {{get a lot of}} people who say, 'I <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> because of you.' That's kind of a heavy load to carry." [...] People approached Stephen Root asking him to sign their staplers. The red Swingline stapler featured prominently in the film was not available until April 2002 when the company released it in response to repeated requests by fans of the film. Its appearance in the film was achieved by taking a standard Swingline stapler and spray-painting it red.|$|E

40|$|Baby Monitor {{consists}} of twelve essays and nine journal entries about my new experience of motherhood {{and the first}} year and half of my first child, Benjamin's life. The essays and journal entries range from a mother's internal struggles of the stress of being a new mom to the encapsulation of the frozen moments that take my breath away as a mother. Hovering Between Two Worlds is about a mother's reflection on the prism that beams in her heart as light spills through a floor to ceiling Victorian window. The Her I Knew, the She I Know is a reflection on who I was before motherhood and who I am becoming as a mother. Mullets and Mohawks is about meeting a mother in line at Target and looking for confirmation from another mother that motherhood is difficult. Mom Insecruity Top Ten List is a list of ten insecurities I felt as a new mom. Heat Rising is about watching my son hold up our wedding itinerary against the curry yellow wall of our hallway. This reflection details some of the struggles my husband and I had after years of infertility. I'm Not Alone is an essay about the isolation, loneliness, and boredom of being a stay-at-home mom and adjusting to the transition of working full-time to staying home with <b>my</b> son after <b>quitting</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> as a school teacher. Tug Tug Tug is about the thick silk strings of a mother's heart as it feels the tug and connection to her husband and son. It is also about a writing spider that sets up a home in my backyard. Totin' is about stranger germ phobia, baby fingertip kisses, infertility, and the magic you can share with a stranger while waiting in line at CVS. Bored Baby - Bored Mama is an essay about a mother's guilt of not wanting to swoon over my baby every minute, as I try to find balance in the sliced pie of motherhood. Mum - Is He British? Too Much Dr. Who is an essay about the unexpected first word of my infant son, told to me by my husband. Curved in Cursive Sleeves is about the cocoon of time, intensity, and bond that is created between a mother and child while I nurse my son. This prism expands and parachutes in the arms and love I have for my son. The Glass Jar is the concluding essay about a moment of reflection about my son's transition from infant to toddler and the appreciation of having the time to spend with him as a stay-at-home mom. M.
