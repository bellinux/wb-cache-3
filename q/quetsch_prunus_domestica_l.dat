40|$|This paper {{provides}} the basics for more detailed {{research on the}} structures of bionic forms of different plant species and their application {{in the domain of}} landscape planning. The aim of this type of research is to expand knowledge of landscape planning with a deeper understanding of different geometric relations present in the existing natural forms. The correlation between structures in nature and structures that are present in contemporary landscape architecture could be established by the congruence with the geometric models from landscape. This paper is focused solely on the geometry of natural forms. The Voronoi diagram was used in order to examine the similarities and to perform a comparative analysis of the <b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.</b> leaf geometry and the geometry of cultural landscapes of Central Serbia. The resulting Voronoi diagram shows the similarity based on closed fields, Voronoi cells, which correspond to the nervation of <b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.</b> leaf by form.

40|$|Among popular crops, plum (<b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.)</b> has {{received}} special attention {{due to its}} health-promoting properties. The seasonality of this fruit makes it impossible to consume it throughout the year, so new products in a powder form may offer an alternative to fresh consumption and may be used as high-quality natural food ingredients. A 100 % plum (cultivar “Valor”) juice was mixed with three different concentrations of maltodextrin or subjected to sugars removal by amberlite-XAD column, and dried using the freeze, spray, and vacuum (40, 60, and 80 °C) drying techniques. The identification and quantification of phenolic acids, flavonols, and anthocyanins in plum powders was performed by LC-MS QTof and UPLC-PDA, respectively. l-ascorbic acid, hydroxymethylfurfural, and antioxidant capacity were measured by the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) ABTS and ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) methods in order to compare the influence of the drying methods on product quality. The results indicated that the profile of polyphenolic compounds in the plum juice powders significantly differed from the whole plum powders. The drying of a sugar free plum extract resulted in higher content of polyphenolic compounds, l-ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity, but lower content of hydroxymethylfurfural, regardless of drying method applied.

In the present study, a drip-irrigated plum production (<b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.</b> “Tophit plus”/Wavit) {{located in a}} semi-humid climate was studied. Analysis of the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of soil showed spatial patterns of sand lenses in the orchard. Water status of sample trees was measured instantaneously by means of leaf water potential, Ψleaf [MPa], and for all trees by thermal imaging of canopies and calculation of the crop water stress index (CWSI). Methods for determining CWSI were evaluated. A CWSI approach calculating canopy and reference temperatures from the histogram of pixels from each image itself was found to suit the experimental conditions. Soil ECa showed no correlation with specific leaf area ratio and cumulative water use efficiency (WUEc) derived from the crop load. The fruit quality, however, was influenced by physiological drought stress in trees with high crop load and, resulting (too) high WUEc, when fruit driven water demand was not met. As indicated by analysis of variance, neither ECa nor the instantaneous CWSI {{could be used as}} predictors of fruit quality, while the interaction of CWSI and WUEc did succeed in indicating significant differences. Consequently, both WUEc and CWSI should be integrated in irrigation scheduling for positive impact on fruit quality...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} two-year study (2009 - 2010) of initial and final fruit set in promising plum (<b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.)</b> hybrids developed at Fruit Research Institute - Čačak, under different pollination conditions. The following hybrids were studied: 38 / 62 / 70 (‘Hall’ x ‘California Blue’), 32 / 21 / 87 (‘Stanley’ x ‘Scoldus’), IV/ 63 / 81 (‘Large Sugar Prune’ x ‘Scoldus’), 22 / 17 / 87 (‘Čačanska Najbolja’ x ‘Zh'lta Butilcovidna’), 29 / 29 / 87 (‘Stanley’ x ‘Scoldus’) and 34 / 41 / 87 (‘Valjevka’ x ‘Čačanska Lepotica’). Each of the hybrids was studied both under self- pollination and open pollination. In vitro pollen germination was also performed {{as well as}} characteristics of flowering phenophase and flowering abundance. Generally, the results suggest lower flowering abundance {{in the second year}} of the study. Pollen germination ranged from averagely 25. 31 % (29 / 29 / 87) to 40. 01 % (38 / 62 / 70). With averagely 31. 59 % final fruit set under self-pollination and 29. 38 % under open pollination variants, respectively, hybrid 34 / 41 / 87 gave the best results. The lowest performance was observed in hybrid 32 / 21 / 87 with 1. 61 % and 7. 69 % final fruit set under self- and open pollination variants, respectively.

40|$|The {{damage to}} pear and plum buds was {{investigated}} in Mashhad, {{after a period of}} unusually warm weather for a few days in March 2013 followed by a sudden drop in temperature to - 12 °C. Frost damages of vegetative and reproductive buds and spur-part below the buds of pear and plum cultivars were investigated based on visual observations. The following pear (Pyrus communis L.) cultivars were investigated: William’s, Bell de june, Ida, Spadona, Koshia, Domkaj, Dare Gazi, Mohamad Ali, Boheme, Shekari, Ghodumi and one Asian pear (Pyrus serotina Rehd.). Japanese plum (P. salicina L.) included ’Shiro’, ’Shams’, ’Computi’ and European plum (<b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.)</b> included ’Stanley’, ‘Early Santa Rosa’, ’Late Santa Rosa’, ’Shablon’ and ’Black Diamond’. Electrical conductivity (EC) and proline content were measured in reproductive buds. It was discovered that visual damages were different between cultivars, as the vegetative pear bud of ‘Ghodumi’ suffered the most damage and all parts of ‘Late Santa Rosa’ were the most susceptible in plum cultivars. On the other hand, ‘Computi’ had the most resistant reproductive bud and no damage was observed in the other parts. The EC and proline content of ‘Dare Gazi’ were the highest despite the fact that high proline content did not show high resistance, which was related to the phenological stage of ‘Dare Gazi’...|$|R
40|$|Rainha Claudia Verde’ is a {{regional}} cultivar of <b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.</b> well adapted {{to a specific}} region {{in the south of}} Portugal. In order to understand the postharvest behavior of this cultivar produced in different orchards, cell wall poly-saccharides and cell wall calcium fruit content were studied during ripening in two consecutive years. During harvest period pectic fractions soluble in water, carbonate and KOH were prepared from alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR) of plums. Galacturonic and neutral sugars contents were measured during fruit ripening and fruit firmness was also evaluated. The calcium fruit level was determined in the AIR during harvest season as well as in dry matter. Fruit firmness was significantly higher in the second year and was probably related with calcium fruit content and pectic polysaccharides. There was a significant difference in calcium fruit content between orchards, and this might influence the overall fruit texture during the postharvest period. During fruit ripening water soluble pectic polysaccharides did not change significantly, which corresponded with the small decrease in tissue firmness. The occurrence in the supernatant of the cellulosic residue of highly branched polysaccharides might be the consequence of matrix material associated with microfibrilar phase. Depolymerization of the hemicellulosic fraction was not evident during plum ripening. The loss of fruit firmness is a consequence of many cellular events which are influenced by external factors. The knowledge of calcium content in the cell wall and the pectic poly¬saccharides could be of great importance to local farmers to predict fruit texture...|$|R
40|$|European plum (<b>Prunus</b> <b>domestica</b> <b>L.)</b> cv ‘Reine Claude Verte’ {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} for its excellent organoleptic qualities. Despite its increasing demand, this cultivar {{is in the}} process of being eradicated in many commercial orchards because of its generally erratic fruit setting. This situation led us to explore the behaviour of particular accessions with the aim of evaluating if some of them can crop more regularly. For this purpose, we initially evaluated the putative diversity of 24 European plum accessions of ‘Reine Claude Verte’ collected in different areas of Spain. For the molecular characterization, 16 Prunus SSRs were used. Eight of them were selected from previous works of SSRs transferability within the genus and the other eight were selected from a transferability screening of another 75 Prunus SSRs, in which 65 SSRs were conserved in the species. Morphological characterization was performed by evaluating 33 qualitative characters of leaves and fruits. Results allowed differentiating the accessions by their genotypic profile and their phenotype. The accessions were grouped in six genotypic profiles according to their genetic similarity and in seven clusters according to their fruit and leaf traits. High similarity was found between the ‘Reine Claude Verte’ commercial cultivars. Some of the prospected accessions sharing the same genotypic profile showed some morphological differences, whereas some accessions with different genotypic profiles presented fruit traits similar to ‘Reine Claude Verte’. The combined use of molecular and morphological characterization allowed identifying different clones of the cultivar that were selected for further agronomic evaluation...|$|R
