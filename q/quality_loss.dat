25|$|The aquatic {{ecological}} {{community in the}} natural drainage system of the lower Murray River catchment includes all native fish and aquatic invertebrates within all natural creeks, rivers and associated lagoons, billabongs and lakes of the regulated portions of the Murray River below the Hume Weir, the Murrumbidgee River below Burrinjuck Dam, and the Tumut River below Blowering Dam, {{as well as all}} their tributaries and branches. In Yanga National Park, permanent and intermittent river channels, intermittent swamps, and billabongs make up components of this {{ecological community}}. The modification of natural river flows as a result of river regulation (dams, weirs) has been identified as the main threat to this ecological community. The changed river flow regimes lead to reduced habitat <b>quality,</b> <b>loss</b> of spawning cues, and reduced opportunities for dispersal and migration. Grazing also contributes to the degradation; however, the exclusion of livestock after gazettal as a national park should ease this pressure.|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{the factors}} {{that could lead to}} the <b>loss</b> of <b>quality</b> is {{difficult}} for large, complex systems. Traditional design methods such as Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and Robust Design have been proven effective at the component level but are less effective for factors that involve interactions between components, software flaws and external noises. This thesis applies System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to two case studies at Cummins, Inc. The first case study was a technology change to a subsystem in a new product development project. The intent of this case was to determine if STPA, applied broadly to safety and hazard analysis, would be effective in identifying causes of <b>quality</b> <b>losses.</b> The second case was a historical quality improvement project. The intent of this case was to determine if STPA would be effective for developing solutions to causes of <b>quality</b> <b>losses.</b> The results of the case studies were compared to the traditional design methods. Use of STPA allowed the design teams to identify more causal factors for <b>quality</b> <b>losses</b> than FMEA or FTA, including component interactions, software flaws, and omissions and external noises. STPA was also found to be complementary to Robust Design Methods. Finally, use of STPA was effective for analyzing the complete hierarchical structure of the system for solutions to potential causes of <b>quality</b> <b>losses.</b> by Stephanie L. Goerges.

40|$|The {{study was}} aimed {{to examine the}} changes in seed oil content in {{different}} genotypes of maize, soybean and sunflower from 2002 to 2006, in two types of storage conditions which differ in air temperature and humidity: 25 Â°C/ 75 % and 12 Â°C/ 60 %, respectively.

Differences in oil content affected by storage longevity were significant among tested crops and genotypes within crops. Storage longevity was negatively associated with oil content.

40|$|Tomato {{production}} {{can serve}} as a source of income for most rural and periurban producers in most developing countries of the world. However, postharvest losses make its production unprofitable in these parts of the world. Postharvest losses in tomatoes can be as high as 42 % globally. Postharvest losses in tomatoes can be either quantitative or qualitative. Even though emphasis in crop research nowadays is increasing shifting from quantity to quality of produce, there is still little improvement in the quality of commercially produced tomato varieties, hence resulting in high <b>quality</b> <b>losses.</b> From the study it was discovered that the postharvest quality status of tomatoes partly depended on some preharvest practices carried out during production. Some of these factors are fertiliser application, pruning, maturity stage, cultivar selection, and irrigation. Using best postharvest handling practices or factors such as temperature, relative humidity, gases in storage, postharvest calcium chloride application, and physical handling procedures to maintain the quality after harvest was also critical. It was concluded by this study that understanding and managing both preharvest and postharvest factors properly will reduce the postharvest <b>quality</b> <b>losses</b> in tomatoes...|$|R
