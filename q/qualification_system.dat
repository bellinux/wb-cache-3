The <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> for the remaining eight places is region-based, with a total eight teams allocated for Europe, five for Oceania, three for the Americas, two for Africa, and one for Asia.

5|$|An {{exception}} to the usual European <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify {{at the expense of}} the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League. This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.|$|E

In 2010, the IFF adopted a FIFA-like continental <b>qualification</b> <b>system,</b> where teams must qualify to play at the world championships.

While the European <b>qualification</b> <b>system</b> was changed for 2009–10, the normal contingent of six Top 14 teams in the Heineken Cup did not change. The default number of French teams in the Champions Cup has remained at six, but the method for a seventh French team to qualify has changed from performance in the previous European season to a post-season playoff. For the inaugural Champions Cup in 2014–15, this playoff involved the seventh-place teams from both England and the Top 14; in future years, the same two sides will be joined by one Pro12 side.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} OECD {{activity}} The Role of National <b>Qualifications</b> <b>Systems</b> in Promoting Lifelong Learning is {{to investigate}} how <b>qualifications</b> <b>systems</b> influence the volume, distribution and quality of lifelong learning. This paper takes forward thinking {{about the ways in}} which <b>qualifications</b> <b>systems</b> can influence participation in lifelong learning (LLL) and the quality of learning experiences. A set of 11 components and some 60 subcomponents of <b>qualifications</b> <b>systems</b> is proposed and delineated and LLL is described by a set of 18 indicators. If there are relationships between <b>qualifications</b> <b>systems</b> and lifelong learning that are not just spurious correlations, then there will be mechanisms by which this happens. These mechanisms are the kernel of this activity and a set of 11 are proposed together with a description of their possible effects on individuals, providers and employers. Mechanisms might also be termed ‘drivers’ of LLL and each one may act on different stakeholders in different ways and operate differently in changing social, economic and cultural conditions. Thus the complexity of the field of enquiry is recognised. The paper attempts to refine the conceptualisation of mechanisms that work through the aspirations of individuals, the planning process of providers and the needs of employers. The paper also outlines some tentative ideas for empirical analysis of the interactions that are at the heart of the activity...|$|R
