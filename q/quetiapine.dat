5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and <b>quetiapine</b> are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious neurological disorder.|$|E
5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of <b>quetiapine</b> for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime sleepiness.|$|E
25|$|Only aripiprazole, olanzapine, and <b>quetiapine</b> have {{specifically}} {{been approved}} for MDD by the FDA in the United States. <b>Quetiapine</b> and lurasidone have been approved, as monotherapies, for bipolar depression, but as of present, lurasidone has not {{been approved for}} MDD.|$|E

25|$|Olanzapine is {{considered}} moderately toxic in overdose; more toxic than <b>quetiapine,</b> aripiprazole and the SSRIs and less toxic than the MAOIs and TCAs.|$|E
25|$|A 2014 meta {{analysis}} of 9 published trials having minimum duration 6 months and median duration 52 weeks concluded that olanzapine, <b>quetiapine,</b> and risperidone had better effects on cognitive function than amisulpride and haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review of add-on therapies for treatment-resistant depression concluded that <b>quetiapine</b> and aripiprazole have the strongest evidence-base supporting their efficacy, {{but they are}} associated with additional treatment-related side effects when used as an add-on therapy.|$|E
25|$|Atypical {{antipsychotic}} {{drugs like}} clozapine, olanzapine, <b>quetiapine,</b> risperidone and asenapine are relatively potent antagonists of 5-HT2A as {{are some of}} the lower potency old generation/typical antipsychotics. Other antagonists are MDL-100,907 (prototype of another new series of 5-HT2A antagonists) and cyproheptadine.|$|E
25|$|Risperidone is {{effective}} in treating the acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. A 2013 study compared 15 antipsychotic drugs in treating schizophrenia. Risperidone was ranked fourth, 11% more effective than paliperidone (5th), 20-23% more effective than haloperidol, <b>quetiapine,</b> and aripiprazole, and 36% less effective than clozapine (1st).|$|E
25|$|In a 2013 {{study in}} a {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in effectiveness in treating schizophrenic symptoms, clozapine was ranked first, demonstrating very high effectiveness. 25% more effective than amisulpride (2nd), 33% more effective than olanzapine (3rd), and twice as effective as haloperidol, <b>quetiapine,</b> and aripiprazole.|$|E
25|$|Patient A {{suffers from}} schizophrenia. Their {{treatment}} included {{a combination of}} ziprasidone, olanzapine, trazodone and benzotropine. The patient experienced dizziness and sedation, so they were tapered off ziprasidone and olanzapine, and transition to <b>quetiapine.</b> Trazodone was discontinued. The patient then experienced excessive sweating, tachycardia and neck pain, gained considerable weight and had hallucinations. Five months later, <b>quetiapine</b> was tapered and discontinued, with ziprasidone re-introduction into their treatment due to the excessive weight gain. Although the patient lost the excessive weight they gained, they then developed muscle stiffness, cogwheeling, tremor and night sweats. When benztropine was added they experienced blurry vision. After an additional five months, the patient was switched from ziprasidone to aripiprazole. Over the course of 8 months, patient A gradually experienced more weight gain, sedation, developed difficulty with their gait, stiffness, cogwheel and dyskinetic ocular movements. A pharmacogenomics test later proved the patient had a CYP2D6 *1/*41, with has a predicted phenotype of IM and CYP2C19 *1/*2 with predicted phenotype of IM as well.|$|E

Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{treatment}} of a manic episode of bipolar disorder involves the utilization of either a mood stabilizer (valproate, lithium, or carbamazepine) or an atypical antipsychotic (olanzapine, <b>quetiapine,</b> risperidone, or aripiprazole). Although hypomanic episodes may respond to a mood stabilizer alone, full-blown episodes are treated with an atypical antipsychotic (often {{in conjunction with a}} mood stabilizer, as these tend to produce the most rapid improvement).|$|E
25|$|Olanzapine is {{recommended}} by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence as a first line therapy {{for the treatment of}} acute mania in bipolar disorder. Other recommended first lines are haloperidol, <b>quetiapine</b> and risperidone. It {{is recommended}} in combination with fluoxetine as a first line therapy for acute bipolar depression; and as a second line treatment by itself for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of clozapine (Clozaril) represents {{a breakthrough in}} the treatment of psychotic symptoms of PD. Prior to its introduction, treatment of psychotic symptoms relied on reduction of dopamine therapy or treatment with first generation antipsychotics, all of which worsened motor function. Other atypical antipsychotics useful in treatment include <b>quetiapine</b> (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprazole (Abilify), and paliperidone (Invega). Clozapine is believed to have the highest efficacy and lowest risk of extrapyramidal side effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{case report}} has been {{published}} in which mirtazapine reduced visual hallucinations in a patient with Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP). This is in alignment with recent findings that inverse agonists at the 5-HT2A receptors are efficacious in attenuating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease psychosis. As {{is supported by the}} common practice of prescribing low-dose <b>quetiapine</b> and clozapine for PDP at doses too low to antagonize the D2 receptor, but sufficiently high doses to inversely agonize the 5-HT2A receptors.|$|E
25|$|A Lancet review {{found that}} it is in the middle range of 15 {{antipsychotics}} for effectiveness, approximately as effective as haloperidol and <b>quetiapine</b> and slightly more effective than ziprasidone and chlorpromazine, with better tolerability compared to the other antipsychotic drugs (4th best for weight gain, 5th best for extrapyramidal symptoms, best for prolactin elevation, 2nd best for QTc prolongation, and 5th best for sedation). The authors concluded that for acute psychotic episodes aripiprazole results in benefits in some aspects of the condition.|$|E
25|$|In bipolar disorder, SGAs {{are most}} {{commonly}} used to rapidly control acute mania and mixed episodes, often in conjunction with mood stabilizers (which {{tend to have a}} delayed onset of action in such cases) such as lithium and valproate. In milder cases of mania or mixed episodes, mood stabilizer monotherapy may be attempted first. SGAs are also used to treat other aspects of the disorder (such as acute bipolar depression or as a prophylactic treatment) as adjuncts or as a monotherapy, depending on the drug. Both <b>quetiapine</b> and olanzapine have demonstrated significant efficacy in all three treatment phases of bipolar disorder. Lurasidone (trade name Latuda) has demonstrated some efficacy in the acute depressive phase of bipolar disorder.|$|E
25|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} in parkinsonian syndromes {{for a variety of}} reasons. An overlap exists between PD and Lewy body dementia, so that where Lewy bodies are present in the visual cortex, {{hallucinations}} may result. Hallucinations can also be brought about by excessive dopaminergic stimulation. Most hallucinations are visual in nature, often formed as familiar people or animals, and are generally not threatening in nature. Some patients find them comforting; however, their caregivers often find this part of the disease most disturbing, and the occurrence of hallucinations is a major risk factor for hospitalisation. Treatment options consist of modifying the dosage of dopaminergic drugs taken each day, adding an antipsychotic drug such as <b>quetiapine,</b> or offering caregivers a psychosocial intervention to help them cope with the hallucinations.|$|E
25|$|Recently, {{metabolic}} {{concerns have}} been of grave concern to clinicians, patients and the FDA. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required all manufacturers of atypical antipsychotics to change their labeling to include a warning {{about the risks of}} hyperglycemia and diabetes with atypical antipsychotics. It must also be pointed out that although all atypicals must carry the warning on their labeling, some evidence shows that atypicals are not equal in their effects on weight and insulin sensitivity. The general consensus is that clozapine and olanzapine are associated with the greatest effects on weight gain and decreased insulin sensitivity, followed by risperidone and <b>quetiapine.</b> Ziprasidone and aripiprazole are thought to have the smallest effects on weight and insulin resistance, but clinical experience with these newer agents is not as developed as that with the older agents. The mechanism of these adverse effects is not completely understood but it is believed to result from a complex interaction between a number of pharmacologic actions of these drugs. Their effects on weight are believed to mostly derive from their actions on the H1 and 5-HT2C receptors, while their effects on insulin sensitivity are believed {{to be the result of}} a combination of their effects on body weight (as increased body mass is known to be a risk factor for insulin resistance) and their antagonistic effects on the M3receptor. Some of the newer agents, however, such as risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone, ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole, asenapine and iloperidone have clinically-insignificant effects on the M3 receptor and appear to carry a lower risk of insulin resistance. Whereas clozapine, olanzapine and <b>quetiapine</b> (indirectly via its active metabolite, norquetiapine) all antagonise the M3 receptor at therapeutic-relevant concentrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{tranquilizer}} or antipsychotic medication, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), a typical antipsychotic, {{was discovered in}} 1951 and introduced into clinical practice shortly thereafter. Clozapine (Clozaril), an atypical antipsychotic, fell out of favor due to concerns over drug-induced agranulocytosis. Following research indicating its effectiveness in treatment-resistant schizophrenia {{and the development of}} an adverse event monitoring system, clozapine re-emerged as a viable antipsychotic. According to Barker (2003), the three most-accepted atypical drugs are clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine. However, he goes on to explain that clozapine is usually the last resort when other drugs fail. Clozapine can cause agranulocytosis (a decreased number of white blood cells), requiring blood monitoring for the patient. Despite the effectiveness of clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, agents with a more favorable side-effect profile were sought-after for widespread use. During the 1990s, olanzapine, risperidone, and <b>quetiapine</b> were introduced, with ziprasidone and aripiprazole following in the early 2000s. The atypical anti-psychotic paliperidone was approved by the FDA in late 2006.|$|E
25|$|Aripiprazole's {{mechanism}} of action is {{different from those of}} the other FDA-approved atypical antipsychotics (e.g., clozapine, olanzapine, <b>quetiapine,</b> ziprasidone, and risperidone)., D3, and D4 Dopamine Receptors: Identification of the Clozapine Metabolite N-Desmethylclozapine as a D2/D3 Partial Agonist| journal = The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics | volume = 315 | issue = 3 | pages = 1278–87 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16135699 | doi = 10.1124/jpet.105.092155 }} Rather than acting as a pure antagonist of the dopamine D2 receptor, aripiprazole shows functional selectivity at the D2 receptor, acting as a silent antagonist of some subpopulations of D2 receptors but as a high-efficacy partial agonist (intrinsic activity = 75%) of other D2-receptor subpopulations. It appears to show predominantly antagonist activity on postsynaptic D2 receptors and partial agonist activity on presynaptic D2 receptors. Aripiprazole is also a partial agonist of the D3 receptor. In healthy human volunteers, D2 and D3 receptor occupancy levels are high, with average levels ranging between approximately 71% at 2mg/day to approximately 96% at 40mg/day. Most atypical antipsychotics bind preferentially to extrastriatal receptors, but aripiprazole appears to be less preferential in this regard, as binding rates are high throughout the brain.|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by the pharmaceutical companies) multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, <b>quetiapine,</b> and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E

2500|$|As {{hallucinations}} and delusions are {{not necessarily}} dangerous or troubling to the person with DLB, [...] caregivers not disabusing patients of them may be best. Often, the best approach is benign neglect—acknowledging, but not encouraging or agreeing. Trying to talk the DLB patient out of his delusion may be frustrating to caregivers and discouraging to patients, sometimes provoking anger or dejection. When misperceptions, hallucinations, and the behaviors stemming from these become troublesome, caregivers should try to identify and eliminate environmental triggers, and perhaps, offer cues or [...] "therapeutic white lies" [...] to steer patients out of trouble. Physicians may prescribe low doses of atypical antipsychotics, such as <b>quetiapine,</b> for psychosis and agitation in DLB. A small clinical trial found {{that about half of}} DLB patients treated with low doses of <b>quetiapine</b> experienced a significant reduction in these symptoms. Unfortunately, several participants in the study had to discontinue treatment because of side effects, such as excessive daytime sleepiness or orthostatic hypotension.|$|E
2500|$|The newer {{atypical}} antipsychotics are {{claimed to}} have an improved adverse effect profile than the typical antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are also sometimes used to treat distortions in thinking or false perceptions. Use of antipsychotics is generally short-term. One meta-analysis of two randomly controlled trials, four non-controlled open-label studies and eight case reports has suggested that several atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, clozapine, <b>quetiapine</b> and risperidone, may help BPD patients with psychotic-like, impulsive or suicidal symptoms. [...] However, there are numerous adverse effects of antipsychotics, notably Tardive dyskinesia (TD). Atypical antipsychotics are known for often causing considerable weight gain, with associated health complications.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 {{comparison}} of 15 antipsychotic drugs in schizophrenia, olanzapine was ranked third. It was 5% {{more effective than}} risperidone (4th), 24-27% more effective than haloperidol, <b>quetiapine,</b> and aripiprazole, and 33% less effective than clozapine (1st). A 2013 review of first episode schizophrenia concluded that olanzapine is superior to haloperidol in providing a lower discontinuation rate, and in short-term symptom reduction, response rate, negative symptoms, depression, cognitive function, discontinuation due to poor efficacy, and long-term relapse, but not in positive symptoms or on the Clinical Global Impressions score. In contrast, pooled second generation antipsychotics showed superiority to first generation antipsychotics only against the discontinuation, negative symptoms (with a much larger effect seen among industry- compared to government-sponsored studies), and cognition scores. [...] Olanzapine caused less extrapyramidal side effects, less akathisia, but caused significantly more weight gain, serum cholesterol increase, and triglyceride increase than haloperidol. A 2012 review concluded that among 10 atypical antipsychotics, only clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone were better than first generation antipsychotics. A 2011 review concluded that neither first- nor second generation antipsychotics produce clinically meaningful changes in Clinical Global Impression scores but found that olanzapine and amisulpride produce larger effects on the PANSS and BPRS batteries than five other second generation antipsychotics or pooled first generation antipsychotics. A 2010 Cochrane systematic review found that olanzapine may have a slight advantage in effectiveness when compared to aripiprazole, <b>quetiapine,</b> risperidone and ziprasidone. No differences in effectiveness was detected when comparing olanzapine to amisulpride and clozapine.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{prescribing}} {{medication for}} these conditions which often resolve spontaneously, recommendations {{have pointed to}} improved skin hygiene, good hydration via fluids, good nutrition, and installation of padded bed rails with use of proper mattresses. [...] Pharmacological treatments include the typical neuroleptic agents such as fluphenazine, pimozide, haloperidol and perphenazine which block dopamine receptors; these are {{the first line of}} treatment for hemiballismus. [...] <b>Quetiapine,</b> sulpiride and olanzapine, the atypical neuroleptic agents, are less likely to yield drug-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia. [...] Tetrabenazine works by depleting presynaptic dopamine and blocking postsynaptic dopamine receptors, while reserpine depletes the presynaptic catecholamine and serotonin stores; both of these drugs treat hemiballismus successfully but may cause depression, hypotension and parkinsonism. [...] Sodium valproate and clonazepam have been successful in a limited number of cases. Stereotactic ventral intermediate thalamotomy and use of a thalamic stimulator {{have been shown to be}} effective in treating these conditions.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{issued an}} {{advisory}} and subsequent black box warning regarding {{the risks of}} atypical anti psychotic use among elderly patients with dementia. The FDA advisory was associated with decreases {{in the use of}} atypical antipsychotics, especially among elderly patients with dementia. Subsequent research reports confirmed the mortality risks {{associated with the use of}} both conventional and atypical antipsychotics to treat patients with dementia. [...] Consequently, in 2008 the FDA issued although a black box warning for classical neuroleptics. Data on treatment efficacies are strongest for atypical antipsychotics. Adverse effects in patients with dementia include an increased risk of mortality and cerebrovascular events, as well as metabolic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, falls, cognitive worsening, cardiac arrhythmia, and pneumonia. Conventional antipsychotics may pose an even greater safety risk. Moreover, high potential conventional antipsychotics like haloperidol may be associated with the highest risk followed by low potential neuroleptics thereafter risperidone and olanzapine. <b>Quetiapine</b> seemed to have a lower risk. No clear efficacy evidence exists to support the use of alternative psychotropic classes (e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants).|$|E
