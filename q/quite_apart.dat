5|$|The next {{distinct}} {{period is}} Classical Mongolian, which is dated from the 17th to the 19th century. This is a written language {{with a high}} degree of standardization in orthography and syntax that sets it <b>quite</b> <b>apart</b> from the subsequent Modern Mongolian. The most notable documents in this language are the Mongolian Kangyur and Tengyur as well as several chronicles. In 1686, the Soyombo alphabet (Buddhist texts) was created, giving distinctive evidence on early classical Mongolian phonological peculiarities.|$|E
5|$|Bees {{have been}} kept in hives {{since at least the}} First Dynasty of Egypt, five {{thousand}} years ago, and man had been harvesting honey from the wild long before that. Fixed comb hives are used {{in many parts of the}} world and are made from any locally available material. In more advanced economies, where modern strains of domestic bee have been selected for docility and productiveness, various designs of hive are used which enable the combs to be removed for processing and extraction of honey. <b>Quite</b> <b>apart</b> from the honey and wax they produce, honey bees are important pollinators of crops and wild plants, and in many places hives are transported around the countryside to assist in pollination.|$|E

No special clothing is worn, and players wear normal street shoes.|$|R
50|$|The working {{hypothesis}} for the tariff negotiations was a linear tariff cut of 50% {{with the smallest}} number of exceptions.

An extraordinary general meeting was called on 3 May 1780, at which those present decided to make a call of 10% on all shareholders. This was a difficult time to ask for money, as the American War of Independence (1775–83) had ruined many of the Glasgow businesses, dependent on the American tobacco business. Moreover, asking for more money to keep a bankrupt business going was inopportune.|$|E

Challinger also references Pearse's army record which <b>quite</b> <b>apart</b> from his awards for valour includes entries for neglect of duty, absence from guard and disobedience to orders. He was promoted to lance corporal on 21 November 1917, and to corporal on 10 April 1918. He was wounded in action for a second time on 19 May 1918. He subsequently returned to England to recover, but did not return to his unit {{until the end of the}} war. After undergoing training at the Machine Gun Depot, he was posted the 1st Machine Gun Battalion on 1 December 1918.|$|E

500|$|However, {{at times}} Rosebery's {{behaviour}} could be eccentric. Gladstone remarked that Rosebery was, perhaps, rather too concerned with his health. Early {{in the marriage}} Rosebery decided to renovate the small ruined Barnbougle Castle (the original Rosebery family seat), close to, and within sight of, Dalmeny House. Once renovation was complete in 1882, Rosebery {{used it as a}} private retreat from his family, and began to spend his nights there alone. Always an insomniac, he claimed that the [...] "stillness of the waters [...] were conducive to sleep." [...] Books were his passion, and he assembled a huge library in the small castle. Thus Rosebery was able to lead a life at Dalmeny with his wife, but also <b>quite</b> <b>apart</b> from her.|$|E

He also criticized it for sharing too much of the American gangster and spy film clichés. The most critical review was done by Georg Metz of Dagbladet Information, who criticized its historicity and thought the characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting. Metz wrote, [...] "The nicest [...] one can say about this film, if it is nice, is that it celebrates the naïve view of history" [...] and described it as [...] " [...] neo-nationalistic panopticon of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Party congresses. <b>Quite</b> <b>apart</b> from that {{about a third of the}} dialogue is hard to understand, because the players do not articulate appropriately." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Nicholson, Agharta {{and other}} jazz-rock {{recordings}} such as Emergency! (1970) by the Tony Williams Lifetime suggested the genre was progressing toward [...] "a whole new musical language... a wholly independent genre <b>quite</b> <b>apart</b> {{from the sound}} and conventions of anything that had gone before". This development dwindled with the commercialism of jazz in the 1980s, he said, although Agharta remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s, especially on artists in the experimental rock genre. It {{became one of the}} favorite albums for English musician Richard Kirk, who recalled playing the record often while working at Chris Watson's loft during their early years in the band Cabaret Voltaire. [...] "I can see how this album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal", Kirk later told The Quietus. Along with On the Corner, it was also a major influence on the Beastie Boys' 1994 hip hop album Ill Communication. In 1998, composer and bandleader David Sanford completed his dissertation on Agharta as a doctoral student in composition at Princeton University. In it, he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences [...] "to evolve or modernize itself". In an interview several years later, Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the [...] "fringes of jazz" [...] and a place most other music has not explored since. In the All Music Guide to Jazz (2002), Thom Jurek considered the album to be inarguably the [...] "greatest electric funk-rock jazz record ever" [...] and declared [...] "there is simply nothing like Agharta in the canon of recorded music." ...|$|E

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in Venice, Frederick again caught cold; privately, Mackenzie was growing seriously concerned, having observed a continued tendency for Frederick's throat and larynx to swell. He forbade Frederick from speaking at any length, noting {{that if the}} Crown Prince insisted on speaking and contracted further colds, he could give him {{no more than three}} months to live. At the beginning of October, Victoria noted that [...] "Fritz's throat is giving no cause for fresh anxiety & he really does take a little more care and speaks a little less." [...] On 6 October, Frederick, his family and Mackenzie left for a villa at Baveno on the shore of Lake Maggiore, with Mackenzie leaving Baveno on 8 October, after predicting Frederick's recovery [...] "in 3 or 4 months," [...] wrote Victoria. Their elder son Wilhelm joined them at Baveno on 17 October for Frederick's 56th birthday the following day. At the end of October, Frederick's condition abruptly worsened, with Victoria writing to her mother on 2 November that Frederick's throat was again inflamed, but not due to any cold, and that he was [...] "very hoarse again" [...] and easily became depressed about his health. General Alfred von Waldersee observed that Frederick's health had grave implications, as if William died soon and his son succeeded, [...] "a new Kaiser who is not allowed to speak is a virtual impossibility, <b>quite</b> <b>apart</b> from the fact that we desperately need a highly energetic one." [...] His son Wilhelm reported to King Albert of Saxony that his father was frequently short-tempered and melancholic, though his voice appeared to have slightly improved, and that Frederick's throat was being treated by [...] "blowing in a powder twice a day to soothe the larynx." ...|$|E
