40|$|Integer-Forcing (IF) {{is a new}} framework, {{based on}} compute-and-forward, for {{decoding}} multiple integer linear combinations from the output of a Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output channel. This work applies the IF approach {{to arrive at a}} new low-complexity scheme, IF source coding, for distributed lossy compression of correlated Gaussian sources under a minimum mean squared error distortion measure. All encoders use the same nested lattice codebook. Each encoder quantizes its observation using the fine lattice as a quantizer and reduces the result modulo the coarse lattice, which plays the role of binning. Rather than directly recovering the individual <b>quantized</b> <b>signals,</b> the decoder first recovers a full-rank set of judiciously chosen integer linear combinations of the <b>quantized</b> <b>signals,</b> and then inverts it. In general, the linear combinations have smaller average powers than the original signals. This allows to increase the density of the coarse lattice, which in turn translates to smaller compression rates. We also propose and analyze a one-shot version of IF source coding, that is simple enough to potentially lead to a new design principle for analog-to-digital converters that can exploit spatial correlations between the sampled signals.

40|$|Integer-forcing {{source coding}} has been {{proposed}} as a low-complexity method for compression of distributed correlated Gaussian sources. In this scheme, each encoder quantizes its observation using the same fine lattice and reduces the result modulo a coarse lattice. Rather than directly recovering the individual <b>quantized</b> <b>signals,</b> the decoder first recovers a full-rank set of judiciously chosen integer linear combinations of the <b>quantized</b> <b>signals,</b> and then inverts it. It has been observed that the method works very well for "most" but not all source covariance matrices. The present work quantifies the measure of bad covariance matrices by studying the probability that integer-forcing source coding fails {{as a function of}} the allocated rate, %in excess of the %Berger-Tung benchmark, where the probability is with respect to a random orthonormal transformation that is applied to the sources prior to quantization. For the important case where the signals to be compressed correspond to the antenna inputs of relays in an i. i. d. Rayleigh fading environment, this orthonormal transformation can be viewed as being performed by nature. Hence, the results provide performance guarantees for distributed source coding via integer forcing in this scenario...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new compress-and-forward {{implementation}} for the relay channel based on joint source-channel coding techniques. The relay performs scalar quantization of its observation {{in combination with}} a redundant index mapping. Our system utilizes {{the correlation between the}} <b>quantized</b> <b>signal</b> and the direct-link observation of the transmitted symbols as redundancy for error protection on the relay-to-destination link. In order to fully exploit this correlation the destination requires iterative decoding to recover the quantized observation sent by the relay. Once regenerated, this <b>quantized</b> <b>signal</b> is optimally combined with the direct-link observation to decode the message conveyed by the source. By quantizing the observed signal itself rather than a measure on the reliability of the information bits (e. g. a posteriori probabilities from a decoder), and by using digital communication methods on the relay-to-destination link our system yields superior performance to that of amplify-and-forward, decode-and-forward and previous implementations of compress-and-forward based on soft decoding. © 2010 IEEE.

40|$|For many {{commercial}} applications it is {{of interest}} to identify and localize objects. The most traditional way of identifying objects is to use labels with a printed barcode, an alternative can be UHF RFID tags. This thesis describes possible solutions to the localization problem. By measuring the phase difference between the transmitted continuous wave and the received backscatter at different frequencies, {{it is possible to}} estimate the distance. By measuring the distance to three readers it is possible to determine the location of a tag with the help of trilateration. To overcome the influence of the environment on the distance estimate, this thesis suggests the use of reference tags and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to derive a location. The results in terms of average localization error are similar to a RSSI based method, about 0. 4 m. Another approach is to use an array of multiple antennas, a so-called phased array. When a signal is received by two different antennas there will be a time delay between the signals dependent on the Direction of Arrival (DOA) of the signal. For an array with more antennas the MUSIC or EPSRIT algorithm can be used. The observation that a tag is within the near field of a phased array leads {{to the fact that there}} is an extra phase difference depending on the distance of the tag to the array. An average angle error of 3 to 4 degrees and a range error in the order of 0. 3 m is measured. Differences with measurements in an anechoic room show that the performance of the system heavily depends on the environment. To decrease the energy consumption of a multi-array system, this thesis explores the use of heavily <b>quantized</b> <b>signals</b> instead of the high resolution signals used in the near field experiments. The DOA estimation algorithms are based on correlations between the different array channels. By using single bit <b>quantized</b> <b>signals,</b> errors are introduced in these correlations, which can be corrected. Experiments in a realistic environment show that by using single-bit <b>quantized</b> <b>signals,</b> the DOA estimation degrades from 4 to 6 degrees...|$|R
