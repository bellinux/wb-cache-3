50|$|The garden had {{a variety}} of trees divided namely into fruit and citrus trees. Including {{mulberry}} trees (ċawsli), plum trees (għajnbaqar), apricot tree (berquqa), almond tree (lewża), pear trees (lanġas), vines (dwieli), fig trees (tin), prickly pears (bajtar tax-xewk), pomegranate trees (rummien), apple trees (tuffieħ ta’ Belludja), peach <b>trees</b> (ħawħ), and <b>quince</b> <b>trees</b> (sfarġel). The citrus family was represented by orange trees (larinġ), lemon trees (lumi), tangerine trees (mandolin), and sweet lime trees (lumiċell). The abundance of trees and fruit in this garden showed how fertile and productive it must have been.|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{wall was}} rebuilt in 1981, {{at which point}} the {{northern}} wall was reduced by seven layers of brick. An area of topiary with seven specimens was planted in 1983 with box, behind the coach house. Lilacs, weeping cherries and hibiscus were planted in 1984 along the garden wall near the coach house. A pergola covered with laburnum and wisteria was introduced in 1986 leading to the entrance into the walled garden. Between 1986 and 1988, two iron gates and a sundial were added. In the 1990s, the orchard near the walled garden was supplemented by black mulberry, walnut and <b>quince</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Europe, quinces are {{commonly}} grown {{in central and}} southern areas where the summers are sufficiently hot for the fruit to fully ripen. They are not grown in large amounts; typically one or two <b>quince</b> <b>trees</b> are grown in a mixed orchard with several apples and other fruit trees: so were they grown in the 18th-century New England colonies, where {{there was always a}} quince at the lower corner of the vegetable garden, Ann Leighton notes in records of Portsmouth, New Hampshire and Newburyport, Massachusetts. Charlemagne directed that quinces be planted in well-stocked orchards. Quinces in England are first recorded in about 1275, when Edward I had some planted at the Tower of London.|$|R

50|$|Within {{the first}} year a chapel, granary, tack room, and three other rooms had been constructed, using native labor. In 1788 two more rooms were added. In 1789 a second granary was built, {{quarters}} for the mayordomo, and quarters for the missionaries were built. Also, a covered passageway which temporarily served as a kitchen. Crops of wheat and beans were planted in quantities {{to provide for the}} needs of the parent mission. At its peak the asistencia consisted of a three-wing main structure surrounding a central plaza. Corn, peas, barley, asparagus, and rosemary would, in time also be cultivated, along with grape vineyards and groves of peach and <b>quince</b> <b>trees.</b> Due to a significant decline in the native population, the facility was used mainly as an outpost to graze cattle after 1790.|$|R
60|$|Among our old or ancient trees {{the peach}} was the {{favourite}} {{of the whole}} house {{on account of the}} fruit it gave us in February and March, also later, in April and May, when what we called our winter peach ripened. Peach, quince, and cherry were the three favourite fruit- trees in the colonial times, and all three were found in some of the quintas or orchards of the old estancia houses. We had a score of <b>quince</b> <b>trees,</b> with thick gnarled trunks and old twisted branches like rams' horns, but the peach trees numbered about four to five hundred and grew well apart from one another, and were certainly the largest I have ever seen. Their size was equal to that of the oldest and largest cherry trees one sees in certain favoured spots in Southern England, where they grow not in close formation but wide apart with ample room for the branches to spread on all sides.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the more}} arid regions (the west faces) grow giant or medium cactus and various shrubs (chilca, tola, etc.) As more {{rainfall}} is available, the vegetation is dense with trees such as conifers, alder, deciduous trees including walnut, jacaranda, pisonia, Schinus molle, quebracho, acacia, and flowering {{plants such as}} orchids, jasmine and bromeliads. The Córdoba and San Luis areas have abundant vegetation on the eastern slopes, including carob, [...] "coconuts" [...] (local name of palm trees), garabato blanco (acacia) and willow. In the Córdoba hills are stands of olives, peach, pear, apricot, fig <b>trees,</b> <b>quince,</b> lemon <b>trees,</b> cypress, cedar, ponderosa pine, eucalyptus, poplar, oak and willow Especially in the Córdoba and San Luis areas are found shrubs and medicinal herbs peperina, pennyroyal, dandelion, plantain, canchalagua, wild grapes, chamomile, malva, lime and passion fruit.|$|R
