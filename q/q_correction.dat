40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the quantum {{mechanical}} description of magnetic phenomena {{has been well}} developed. However, the first principle calculations of the physical properties of magnetic systems is still a challenge. One {{solution to the problem}} is to construct model magnetic Hamiltonians such that these Hamiltonians can well describe accurate energies of the low-lying magnetic states, starting from an ab initio Hamiltonian in a finite atomic orbital basis set. In {{the first part of this}} work, the multireference equation of motion coupled cluster (MREOM-CC) approach including spin-orbit coupling is applied to model magnetic systems FArO, FArOF and FArFOH. All low-lying magnetic states are obtained subsequently from a compact diagonalization of the transformed Hamiltonian in the MREOM-CC scheme. The accuracy of MREOM is shown to be comparable to the well-established multireference Configuration Interaction with singles and doubles and the Davidson <b>Q</b> <b>correction</b> (MRCISD+Q), but the MREOM approach is significantly more efficient for systems with a large number of electronic states. In the second part, we discuss the details of the effective Hamiltonian approach, proposed in this work. The purpose of this approach is to obtain low-lying states for a Hamiltonian that consists of pairwise interactions between magnetic sites only. The approach includes two steps: the definition of an effective Hamiltonian that acts in a compact space of low-lying single-site states obtained from a mean-field calculation, and the diagonalization of the effective Hamiltonian. The last step still limits the size of systems that can be tackled. Some variants of the effective Hamiltonian approach are tested in benchmark applications to model magnetic systems. The results indicate that this approach is promising, and finally we briefly discuss how this approach can be improved in the near future...|$|E

In particular, we get ¯ Λ < 0. 7 GeV. Our constraints further imply mc ≥ 1. 43 GeV and mb ≥ 4. 66 GeV. We discuss future prospects of improving these bounds and their phenomenological implications. 1 The Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) provides a systematic way of calculating 1 /mQ corrections to the model independent results of heavy quark symmetry [1]. For inclusive semileptonic B and D decay rates, Chay et al. [2] showed that the heavy quark limit (mQ → ∞) coincides with the free quark decay model {{and that there are}} no corrections to this result at order 1 /mQ. The 1 /m 2 <b>Q</b> <b>corrections</b> can be computed in terms of only two additional nonperturbative parameters [3]. HQET provides much more precise predictions for inclusive semileptonic decays than the spectator quark model [4]. One ingredient in the improvement is the incorporation o...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{associated}} with hyperfine mass splitting between pseudoscalar and vector mesons may induce surprisingly large 1 /m 2 <b>Q</b> <b>corrections</b> {{in the heavy}} quark expansion. We demonstrate this in a relativistic quark model by calculating to all orders in 1 /mQ, with and without hyperfine effects, and comparing to the first order results. Total corrections of 30 % or more are quite possible in the decay rates for B → Dlν and B → D∗lν near zero recoil. The subject of semileptonic weak decays of mesons containing a heavy quark has recently attracted much attention. In the limit in which the heavy quark mass mQ becomes infinite the theoretical treatment of these decays is greatly simplified,[1] potentially reducing the uncertainty in the extraction of the Kobayashi-Maskawa elements. But more insight into {{the magnitude of the}} corrections to this limit is required. We present here a relativistic quark model which provides a representation of the decay amplitudes to all orders in 1 /mQ. In [2] we show that the model correctly incorporates all heavy quark symmetry relations at zeroth and first order in the 1 /mQ expansion. We will use the model to study a source of corrections to the heavy quark limit which has not yet been seriously considered. This is the spin symmetry breaking effects due to gluon exchange between the heavy and light quarks. These hyperfine effects split the vector and pseudoscalar masses, but they will also cause a distortion of the light quark wave function in a way which depends on the spin of the heavy quark...|$|R

40|$|Analysis of archival Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) data on {{neutron star}} low-mass X-ray {{binaries}} {{has shown that}} for several sources the quality factor Q of the lower kilohertz Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPO) drops sharply beyond a certain frequency.

The static many‐body (screening) effect is shown to cause the crossover of the growth exponent for the average nucleus radius from 1 / 2 to 1 / 6. Hence the electric current grows as t 1 / 2 at short times and falls with t- 1 / 2 at long times, according to the Cottrell equation.

Evidence {{from human}} myopia genetic mapping studies (MYP 3 locus), {{modulated}} animal models, and observations of glycemic control in humans suggests that insulin-like growth factor (IGF) - 1 {{plays a role}} in the control of eye growth. This study was conducted to determine whether IGF- 1 polymorphisms are associated with myopia in a large, international dataset of Caucasian high-grade myopia pedigrees. Methods. Two hundred sixty-five multiplex families with 1391 subjects participated in the study. IGF- 1 genotyping was performed with 13 selected tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using allelic discrimination assays. A family-based pedigree disequilibrium test (PDT) was performed to test for association. Myopia status was defined using sphere (SPH) or spherical equivalent (SE), and analyses assessed the association of (1) high-grade myopia (≤ − 5. 00 D), and (2) any myopia (≤ − 0. 50 D) with IGF- 1 markers. Results were declared significant at P ≤ 0. 0038 after Bonferroni <b>correction.</b> <b>Q</b> values that take into account multiple testing were also obtained. Results. In all, three SNPs—rs 10860860, rs 2946834, and rs 6214 —were present at P < 0. 05.

The {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to the experimental researches which are aimed at increasing the efficiency of horizontal tube condensers by strictly accurate evaluation of heat transfer and regime parameters in condensing various refrigerants in horizontal tubes of such devices. The unique measurements of heat fluxes and heat transfer coefficients local by circumference have been carried out during condensation of Freon R- 22 and steam which varies over a wide range of the main regime parameters (G, ?, q, Rel). The improved model of film condensation inside horizontal tubes for prediction of heat transfer with application of the results of numerical solutions of Bae et al. is proposed. In this model more precise definition of friction coefficient on interphase as the main parameter crucial for condensation is given. This more precise definition contains experimental substantiation of ?q ? prediction for calculation of pressure losses by friction and <b>correction</b> ?<b>q</b> that takes into account surface suction at the interphase. Heat exchange predicted by the proposed method was compared with the experimental data of various authors for 13 substances (steam, Freon?s R- 22, R- 123, R- 134 a, R- 245 fa, carbon dioxide, propylene, propane, ether, isobutene, refrigerants FC- 72, Novec? 649, HFE- 7000) in annular and intermediate modes. Good agreement of the experiments with calculations (divergence within 25 %) proves correctness of the proposed method both for laminar flow of condensate film and turbulent flow (models by Bae and others). ?????? ????????? ????????????????? ?????????????, ??????? ?????????? ?? ????????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????????-??????? ????????????? ????? ????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ? ???????? ?????????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ?????? ????? ?????????. ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????????? ????????????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ??? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ?????????????? ??????? ???? ??? ????? ?????, ??? ? ? ?????????????????? ???????, ??????????? ? ????????????? ? ?????????? ????????????. ????????, ??? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ????????????? ? ???????? ??????? ????????? 30 ? 70 % ? ????. ????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ?? ????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ??????????? ??????

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an operator}} {{depending on the}} "transverse velocity'' r that describes the effect of hadron masses on the leading 1 /Q power correction to event-shape observables. Here, Q is {{the scale of the}} hard collision. This work builds on earlier studies of mass effects by Salam and Wicke [J. High Energy Phys. 05 (2001) 061] and of operators by Lee and Sterman [Phys. Rev. D 75, 014022 (2007) ]. Despite the fact that different event shapes have different hadron mass dependence, we provide a simple method to identify universality classes of event shapes whose power corrections depend on a common nonperturbative parameter. We also develop an operator basis to show that at a fixed value of <b>Q,</b> the power <b>corrections</b> for many classic observables can be determined by two independent nonperturbative matrix elements at the 10 % level. We compute the anomalous dimension of the transverse velocity operator, which is multiplicative in r and causes the power correction to exhibit nontrivial dependence on Q. The existence of universality classes and the relevance of anomalous dimensions are reproduced by the hadronization models in Pythia 8 and Herwig++, though the two programs differ in the values of their low-energy matrix elements.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study the event shapes {{variable}} thrust. Event shape variables are observables {{that characterize the}} shape of the distribution of the final state particles of a reaction. We take advantage of the formalism of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), an effective theory of the strong interactions appropriate for describing energetic jets. We give a factorization theorem for the process e+e- to hadrons, valid in the whole range of thrust values. This factorization theorem resums large logarithms at the N 3 LL accuracy and contains the full O(a) result for the fixed order cross section. In {{order to be able to}} describe the whole range of thrust values, we define the profile functions, which are thrust-dependent factorization scales which smoothly interpolate between regions where resummation of large logarithms is important and where it is not. To determine non perturbative effects, we fit renormalon-free nonperturbative matrix elements of operators defined in field theory, Q 1. We perform a global analysis to all available thrust data in the tail region, where a two parameter fit to a,(mz) and the first power <b>correction</b> <b>Q</b> 1 suffices. We find cr(mz) = 0. 1135 i (0. 0002) expt ± (0. 0005) hadr ± (0. 0009) pert, with X 2 /dof(= 485) = 0. 91, where the displayed 1 -sigma errors are the total experimental error, the hadronization uncertainty, and the perturbative theory uncertainty, respectively. Furthermore, we perform a global analysis to all available data on the first moment of the thrust distribution. This analysis is a partially independent check of the tail fit, in fact it probes different regions of the thrust distribution and the analysis of experimental systematic uncertainties was conducted independently with respect to the data for the distribution. We find a,(mz) = 0. 1141 i (0. 0004) exp ± (0. 0014) hadr ± (0. 0007) pert with X 2 /dof(= 45) = 1. 33. We also consider pp collisions, in particular the Drell-Yan process. Here we calculate analytically the beam thrust logarithms of the relevant beam functions and of the coefficient function at O(a 2). This is a necessary ingredient for the calculation of the nonsingular terms in resummed predictions. by Riccardo Abbate. Thesis (Ph. D.)
