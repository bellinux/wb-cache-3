2500|$|Mansilla {{prepared}} a strong defense in <b>Quebracho,</b> against the returning convoy. He did not prepare chains {{to close the}} river this time, as the ships would be moving downstream, rather than upstream. This new attack was very successful. The Argentine cannons attacked the enemy ships at will, and the merchant ships attempted in vain to pass behind the warships. [...] Two merchant ships were sunk, and others had to throw their cargo in the river to reduce their weight. The steam boats were {{the focus of the}} attack, the Harpy was disabled and the Gorgon suffered great damages. After three hours of fire, the ships escaped as they could, and four damaged merchant ships were set on fire to avoid Argentine capture.|$|E
2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, <b>quebracho,</b> gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E
5000|$|Schinopsis lorentzii is a {{hardwood}} tree known as red <b>quebracho,</b> {{native of the}} Paraguayan subtropical area, which forms forests in Gran Chaco region of Argentina, in Paraguay, and Bolivia. Some of its common names are coronillo, <b>quebracho</b> Cornillo (Brazil), <b>quebracho</b> chaqueño, <b>quebracho</b> colorado santiagueño, <b>quebracho</b> macho, and <b>quebracho</b> bolí. The qualification colorado ("red") differentiates it from other species of common <b>quebracho</b> tree, the Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco (<b>quebracho</b> blanco, [...] "white quebracho", family Apocynaceae).

50|$|A fourth species, Jodina rhombifolia (syn. Iodinia rhombifolia, the <b>Quebracho</b> flojo (the loose <b>quebracho)</b> or quebrachillo) of {{the family}} Santalaceae, is also {{sometimes}} mentioned.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quebracho</b> {{produces}} tannins {{that can}} be extracted in <b>quebracho</b> sawmills from the heartwood of both red (Schinopsis lorentzii) and white <b>quebracho</b> (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco). Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the <b>quebracho</b> extract by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble <b>quebracho</b> (also known as insoluble <b>Quebracho)</b> is the natural extract obtained directly from the <b>quebracho</b> wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble <b>quebracho</b> extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). <b>Quebracho</b> tannins give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and tear resistant with a pleasant touch. The sulphited <b>quebracho</b> extract may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that <b>quebracho</b> tannins present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|E

50|$|Schinopsis balansae is a {{hardwood}} tree known as willow-leaf red <b>quebracho</b> which forms {{forests in the}} subtropical Gran Chaco ecoregion of north-eastern Argentina, and Paraguay. It {{is also found in}} the wild Pantanal vegetation in Brazil. Some of its vernacular names are <b>quebracho</b> colorado chaqueño and <b>quebracho</b> santafesino. Other species, like Schinopsis lorentzii, bear the general name <b>quebracho</b> and have similar properties and uses. S. balansae shares its habitat with a species of the same genus, S. heterophylla, and the two are often confused.|$|E
50|$|According to King and White (1957), the hydrolysable tannins and {{gallic acid}} {{found in the}} sapwood {{constitute}} the raw material for the biosynthesis of the condensed tannins found in the heartwood. Fustin (predominantly (-)-Fustin 66%), (-)-7:3':4'-trihydroxyflavan-3:4-diol ((-)-leuco-fisetinidin), (+)-catechin, gallic acid, fisetin and 2-benzyl-2-hydroxycoumaran-3-ones have been isolated from the heartwoods of Schinopsis balansae, Schinopsis quebrachocolorado and from commercial <b>quebracho</b> extract. <b>Quebracho</b> tannin is rich in profisetinidins and prorobinetidins. The expected masses found in mass spectrometry in negative mode in <b>quebracho</b> tannin are 289, 561, 833, 951, 1105, 1377, 1393, 1651 and 1667.

5000|$|Their {{common name}} is <b>quebracho,</b> from Spanish quiebra-hacha ("axe-breaker") in {{recognition}} of the hardness of their wood, or more precisely <b>quebracho</b> colorado ("red quebracho"), to distinguish them from the [...] "white quebracho" [...] trees of the quite unrelated genus Aspidosperma.|$|E
50|$|The tanning {{properties}} of <b>quebracho</b> extracts {{were discovered in}} 1867 by a French tanner, Emilio Poisier, who lived in Argentina. By 1895, the <b>quebracho</b> extracts were exported to Europe and became the principal vegetal tannin source in the world. Amongst other activities Ernesto Tornquist (1842-1908) organised the exploitation of <b>quebracho</b> in Santiago del Estero, in the Chaco region. Originally a dry forest area, the abundance of <b>quebracho</b> attracted timber industries of British capital during the 19th century, leading to extensive deforestation. This devastated the ecosystem {{in a relatively short}} time. The private owners of the Chaco then turned to cotton production, employing the local Toba people as a cheap seasonal workforce; the conditions did not change substantially for decades.|$|E
5000|$|On August 30, <b>Quebracho</b> {{participated in}} a {{demonstration}} supporting Hezbollah and against the State of Israel {{in the context of}} the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict in front of the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires. After meeting with the Argentinian Interior Minister, DAIA and AMIA leaders filed a lawsuit against <b>Quebracho</b> on September 1 at the Federal Court, accusing it of incitement and disturbing public order. Kirszenbaum and Luis Grynwald, AMIA’s president, told the court that <b>Quebracho</b> [...] "gives us enormous preoccupation and sadness as Argentines," [...] not just as Jewish leaders. AMIA board member Edgardo Gorenberg described <b>Quebracho</b> as [...] "a threat to democracy," [...] saying it [...] "recalls the darkest" [...] parts of Argentine history.|$|E
