40|$|In this paper, {{a general}} {{strategy}} for synthesis of carbon-based core/ZnO-shell-type composite and hollow materials is reported. These materials include colloidal carbon spheres@ZnO nanospheres, ZnO-carbon composite "dandelions", ZnO-carbon branched "dandelions", Au-ZnO-carbon composite "dandelions", and size-tunable hollow ZnO spheres. As-synthesized composite "dandelions" exhibited a color change, which originated {{from the surface}} plasmon resonance of gold nanoparticles, showing their optical application. <b>All</b> <b>products</b> obtained show well photocatalytic activities and ZnO-carbon composite "dandelions" have the highest photocatalytic efficiency in <b>all</b> <b>products.</b> In this paper, a general strategy for synthesis of carbon-based core/ZnO-shell-type composite and hollow materials is reported.

50|$|As {{with other}} government-owned {{monopolies}} within free trade areas, {{there are several}} aspects that govern the operation. <b>All</b> <b>product</b> selections and displays {{must be based on}} customer preferences, and every producer and distributor must be handled the same way. All marketing activities must be for the company itself and its own services, never for an individual product. This is also the reason why <b>all</b> <b>products</b> are taxed on alcohol content, not on price, and that <b>all</b> <b>products</b> are sold with the same profit margin. This explains why a cheap vodka can be seen as very expensive at 300 SEK (in 2011 prices) whilst Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is of a similar price.|$|R
