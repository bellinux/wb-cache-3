5|$|The Penrhyn <b>Quarry</b> {{is still}} {{producing}} slate, though {{at a much}} reduced capacity from its heyday {{at the end of}} the 19th century. In 1995, it accounted for almost 50% of UK production. It is currently owned and operated by Welsh Slate Ltd (a subsidiary of Lagan Building Solutions), which also owns and carries out some operations at the Oakeley <b>quarry</b> at Blaenau Ffestiniog, the Pen yr Orsedd <b>quarry</b> in the Nantlle Vale, and the Cwt-y-Bugail <b>quarry.</b> In March 2010 the company announced its decision to mothball the Oakeley <b>quarry</b> because of subsidence at the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the building is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate {{to give the impression}} of rock; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn <b>Quarry,</b> the blue from Cwt y Bugail <b>Quarry,</b> the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd <b>quarry,</b> and the black from the Corris <b>Quarry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additional {{excavations}} since 1998 {{have revealed}} additional skeletal elements belonging to Eolambia. It {{is now the}} most completely-known iguanodont from between the Cenomanian and Santonian stages. Nearly every single skeletal element belonging to the taxon is represented by multiple fossils across existing collections. At least twelve individuals, including at least eight juveniles, were discovered in a <b>quarry</b> south {{of the town of}} Emery, including parts from both the skull {{and the rest of the}} body. The <b>quarry</b> is known as the Cifelli #2 Eolambia caroljonesa <b>Quarry,</b> or more formally CEUM locality 42em432v. Another <b>quarry</b> south of the town of Emery – the Willow Springs 8 <b>quarry,</b> or CEUM locality 42Em576v – preserves at least four juveniles. Material from these quarries was described in 2012 by Kirkland along with Andrew McDonald, John Bird, and Peter Dodson, who also provided an updated diagnosis for Eolambia based on this material.|$|E

5000|$|The two disused <b>quarries</b> in the reserve, Forder and Lowhill, were <b>quarried</b> in the 19th {{century for}} roadstone. Lowhill closed in 1915. Horneblende {{dolerite}} was <b>quarried</b> {{for use in}} road construction. Both <b>quarries</b> are now County Geological Sites.|$|R
50|$|Amalgamated Roadstone Corporation Ltd. {{was formed}} on 23 April 1935 {{to acquire a}} number of <b>quarries</b> in Britain.

5|$|Crucial to {{road and}} {{airfield}} development was {{the output of}} the Nine Mile <b>Quarry.</b> Initially it was run by the 1st Army Troops Company, which installed suspended electric lighting, allowing the <b>quarry</b> to be worked around the clock from 30 April 1942. Companies A and C of the 96th Engineer Battalion took over the running of the <b>quarry</b> in June. In turn, they were relieved by C Company of the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion in November. Work went on in three eight hour shifts per day, seven days a week. The face of the <b>quarry</b> was drilled from the top and dropped to the floor by blasting. Knapping hammers were used to break the stone into small pieces that could be lifted onto trucks by hand. There were two rock crushers on hand; an old model and a modern mobile diesel crusher supplied by the US Army.|$|E
5|$|Fields {{adjacent}} to the temple belong {{to the city of}} San Francisco which has authorized the digging of a gravel <b>quarry</b> on the site. Local residents concerned about the temple's future brought a lawsuit to attempt block the <b>quarry</b> project, but eventually ran out of funds and dropped the suit.|$|E
5000|$|Burlington Slate <b>Quarries</b> {{are located}} near Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, England. The <b>quarries</b> have {{produced}} a characteristic blue-grey slate for hundreds of years, with large-scale production starting in the early 19th century, when the Cavendish family organised small-scale <b>quarrying</b> activities by local farmers into a larger group of <b>quarries,</b> which then attracted others into the area {{to live and work}} in the <b>quarries</b> from the 1820s onwards.|$|R

5|$|Part of the Dinorwig Slate <b>Quarry</b> is now {{within the}} Padarn Country Park, {{and the other}} part houses the Dinorwig power station in caverns under the old <b>quarry</b> workings. The National Slate Museum is located {{in some of the}} <b>quarry</b> workshops. The museum has {{displays}} including Victorian slate-workers' cottages that once stood at Tanygrisiau near Blaenau Ffestiniog. As well as many exhibits, it has the multi-media display To Steal a Mountain, showing the lives and work of the men who quarried slate here. The museum has the largest working water wheel in the United Kingdom, which is available for viewing via several walkways, and a restored incline formerly used to carry slate waggons uphill and downhill.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quarry</b> House was {{constructed}} {{on the site}} of the former <b>Quarry</b> Hill Flats (see 1920s and 1930s) at <b>Quarry</b> Hill. The building houses the Department of Health and the Department for Work and Pensions and is their main regional offices. The building is controversial. Its imposing design has often been regarded as being domineering and self-important and has led the building to be nicknamed The Kremlin and The Ministry of Truth.|$|E
5|$|Quarrying ceased in {{the early}} 1960s (1962–1965), when the stones {{extracted}} were no longer of sufficient quality. Between 1971 and 1978, the <b>quarry</b> was gradually filled with marl from the Bellignies <b>quarry.</b> Since then, the site has been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession, forming tree, shrub and herb layers.|$|E
50|$|Industrial {{limestone}} <b>quarrying</b> for {{the manufacture}} of soda ash started in the Buxton area as early as 1874. In 1926 this operation became part of ICI. Large-scale limestone and gritstone <b>quarries</b> flourished as lead mining declined, and remain an important if contentious industry in the Peak. Twelve large limestone <b>quarries</b> operate in the Peak; Tunstead near Buxton {{is one of the}} largest <b>quarries</b> in Europe. Total limestone output was substantial: at the 1990 peak, 8.5 million tonnes was <b>quarried.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the 1700s {{there were}} <b>quarries</b> within the village. The <b>quarries</b> {{produced}} high quality freestone {{right up until}} the 1900s. In 1809-1812 stone from the <b>quarries</b> built the nearby Black and White Cart bridges.|$|R
50|$|Silurian gritstone is <b>quarried</b> {{along the}} North Craven Fault above Ingleton and in Ribblesdale. Lower Carboniferous Great Scar Limestone is <b>quarried</b> {{in those areas}} and also near Grassington. Carboniferous reef {{limestone}} is <b>quarried</b> around Skipton.|$|R
5|$|The Chelmscombe <b>Quarry</b> {{finished}} {{its work}} as a limestone <b>quarry</b> in the 1950s and was then used by the Central Electricity Generating Board as a tower testing station. During the 1970s and 1980s it was also {{used to test the}} ability of containers of radioactive material to withstand impacts and other accidents.|$|E
5|$|The Langenberg <b>Quarry,</b> where K. langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant Massifs. During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this does not imply that K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg <b>Quarry</b> were probably transported allochthonously (albeit only by a short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the <b>quarry,</b> which implies that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of the <b>quarry</b> are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, a shrine to the Roman goddess Minerva was carved in the <b>quarry</b> for protection, perhaps by the <b>quarry</b> workers. Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quarrying</b> {{expanded}} {{rapidly in}} the first half of the 19th century. Significant <b>quarries</b> opened at Llechwedd, Maenofferen and Votty & Bowydd, while Turner and Casson's Diphwys Casson flourished. Further afield, Cwmorthin and Wrysgan <b>quarries</b> were established to the south of the town, while at the head of Cwm Penmachno to the north east a series of <b>quarries</b> started at Rhiwbach, Cwt y Bugail and Blaen y Cwm. To the south east another cluster of <b>quarries</b> worked the slopes of Manod Mawr.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quarrying</b> {{has taken}} place in the area for many centuries {{but it was not until}} the 17th century that large <b>quarries</b> were built and {{production}} substantially increased. Wagonways were built to transport limestone from the <b>quarries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Tank <b>Quarry</b> on North Hill and West of England <b>Quarry</b> on the Worcestershire Beacon {{were used}} as {{locations}} in the Doctor Who serial The Krotons, starring Patrick Troughton. The serial was broadcast in four weekly parts from 28 December 1968 to 18 January 1969.|$|E
5|$|The genus name Knoetschkesuchus {{combines}} {{the family name}} of Nils Knötschke, {{a researcher at the}} DFMMh who was responsible for the collection, curation, and preparation of Langenberg <b>Quarry</b> specimens, with the common crocodilian suffix suchus, from the Greek souchos ("crocodile"). Meanwhile, the species name langenbergensis is in reference to the provenance of this species from the Langenberg <b>Quarry.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{of the type}} species of Knoetschkesuchus, K. langenbergensis, comes from a marly limestone bed (numbered as Bed 83, not Bed 93 as reported by some publications) containing recrystallized micritic intraclasts, located within the Langenberg <b>Quarry</b> in the Harz Mountains near Goslar, Lower Saxony, Germany. These deposits have been dated to the Upper Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic - specifically, to the regional equivalent of the Upper Kimmeridgian known as the Mittleres Kimmeridge, and belong to the Süntel Formation. Although well-preserved, fossils from this <b>quarry</b> were recovered generally by regular blasting operations in the <b>quarry.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century {{and again in}} the 1940s two <b>quarries</b> in the Meshomasic State Forest were <b>quarried</b> for {{feldspar}} and mica. The <b>quarries</b> are still open to the public and rock collectors to explore.|$|R

50|$|Large scale slate <b>quarrying</b> {{also took}} place {{around the town}} of Monson, Maine where an {{extensive}} series of <b>quarries</b> flourished from the 1860s onwards. A small scale <b>quarrying</b> and dressing operation continues in Monson into the 21st century.|$|R
5|$|The {{only known}} {{specimen}} of ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus is a mandible (lower jaw) {{found in the}} spring of 1935 by David Dunkle in Edson <b>Quarry,</b> Sherman County, Kansas. It is in the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University as specimen MCZ 6202. Edson <b>Quarry</b> is in the Ogallala Formation and the Hemphillian North American Land Mammal Age. Claude W. Hibbard described the mandible as ? Oryzomys pliocaenicus in a 1939 paper. Hibbard wrote that the fauna was middle Pliocene, but it is now considered Miocene. The Edson <b>Quarry</b> fauna contains a diversity of other fossils, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As the <b>quarry</b> {{had long since}} been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. The <b>quarry</b> itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on the <b>quarry</b> floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E
5|$|While Scully {{consoles}} Patti, {{whose husband}} just died in Scully's arms, Doggett {{reports that he}} cannot find the Shadow Man's body. Scully, fearful {{that he is a}} Super Soldier pursuing Mulder, chases after the train with Doggett and Reyes. An employee who works for the train gets a call on his radio, saying that someone jumped off a train and into a rock <b>quarry.</b> Doggett and Reyes chase after someone they believe to be Mulder, while Scully goes deeper into the <b>quarry.</b> There, she is attacked by the Shadow Man. Suddenly, the Shadow Man is destroyed by the magnetite being mined from the <b>quarry.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Quarrying</b> {{has taken}} place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and sand in the river valleys. Flint, also {{extracted}} from <b>quarries,</b> was often used to build older local buildings. Several former <b>quarries,</b> now flooded, have become nature reserves.|$|R
50|$|Hensall lies on rich sand deposits, {{which have}} in the past been <b>quarried.</b> As a result of the <b>quarrying</b> a number of former <b>quarries</b> {{puncture}} the otherwise flat landscape. In recent years these have become important habitats for wildlife.|$|R
50|$|In {{the area}} where the Helena River emerges from its valley to the sandplain, there are still four <b>quarries</b> evident, despite being unused as <b>quarries</b> for fifty years or more. Mountain and Stathams <b>quarries</b> are now managed as rock {{climbing}} locations.|$|R
