5|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} twenty-eight Treehouse of Horror episodes, with one airing every year. They {{are known for}} being more violent than an average Simpsons episode and contain several {{different}} trademarks, including the alien characters Kang and Kodos who have appeared in every episode. <b>Quite</b> <b>often</b> the segments will parody well-known movies, books, radio shows, and television shows. The Twilight Zone has been parodied <b>quite</b> <b>often,</b> and {{has served as the}} inspiration for numerous segments.|$|E
5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both for himself and the publisher. As a result, the finished product <b>quite</b> <b>often</b> was different from the original text. Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E
5|$|Periyar was {{a radical}} {{advocate}} of anti-Brahmanism. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is <b>quite</b> <b>often</b> confused as being anti-Brahmin. Brahmanism is accepting social inequality based on birth. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste {{was seen as}} a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.|$|E

5|$|Sharks {{tend to be}} seen <b>quite</b> <b>often</b> in {{cartoons}} {{whenever a}} scene involves the ocean. Such examples include the Tom and Jerry cartoons, Jabberjaw, and other shows produced by Hanna-Barbera. They also are used commonly as a clichéd means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them, or the character may be standing on a plank above shark infested waters.|$|E
5|$|During his 16-year stay at CRGS, student numbers {{increased}} from 29 to 180 boys under his guidance, particularly through {{the introduction of}} day pupils. Shaw Jeffrey is also credited {{with the introduction of}} many changes at the school, including the introduction of purple blazers, the setting up of the Old Colcestrian Society for former boys (and <b>quite</b> <b>often</b> honoured former masters), a preparatory school, a cadet corps, an orchestra, a bugle band and a series of school entertainments and theatrical performances, and the acquisition of several buildings on behalf of the school. He was a national pioneer of the teaching of modern European languages through phonetics, employed language teachers from Germany and France, and set up arrangements for foreign study during holidays.|$|E
5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans <b>quite</b> <b>often</b> are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album 4½ stars stating [...] "This free bop session (which is <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> free but <b>often</b> {{has a strong}} pulse) is one of altoist Oliver Lake's more {{rewarding}} sessions".|$|R

5|$|The busway follows {{roughly the}} Torrens River valley, but with {{smoother}} curves. This {{means that it}} crosses the river <b>quite</b> <b>often,</b> with either a park or a few houses on a point surrounded by the river and busway. This occurs a total of eight times before the busway reaches Klemzig Interchange {{on the north side}} of the river. The busway crosses the river again soon after Klemzig and passes Lochiel Park and part of the suburbs of Campbelltown and Paradise to its north between the busway and the river before reaching Paradise Interchange.|$|E
5|$|A life of Augustine {{was written}} by Goscelin around 1090, but this life portrays Augustine in a {{different}} light than Bede's account. Goscelin's account has little new historical content, mainly being filled with miracles and imagined speeches. Building on this account, later medieval writers continued to add new miracles and stories to Augustine's life, often quite fanciful. These authors included William of Malmesbury, who claimed that Augustine founded Cerne Abbey, the author (generally believed to be John Brompton) of a late medieval chronicle containing invented letters from Augustine, and a number of medieval writers who included Augustine in their romances. Another problem with investigating Augustine's saintly cult is the confusion resulting because most medieval liturgical documents mentioning Augustine do not distinguish between Augustine of Canterbury and Augustine of Hippo, a fourth-century saint. Medieval Scandinavian liturgies feature Augustine of Canterbury <b>quite</b> <b>often,</b> however. During the English Reformation, Augustine's shrine was destroyed and his relics were lost.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quite</b> <b>often</b> {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding {{the breaking of the}} record. Sports collectible dealers and buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia associated with such milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive {{to the way in which}} their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria that special balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E
50|$|Pouilly-Fuissé is a {{dry white}} wine made from Chardonnay grapes. It is pale and refreshing, <b>often</b> <b>quite</b> delicate, and <b>often</b> shows a clear oak influence. On average these wines sell for {{much less than the}} white wines of Côte de Beaune to the north.|$|R

5|$|Similarly, in the second-singular, {{inherited}} *-ta -ti {{competed with}} lengthened *-tā -tī for {{masculine and feminine}} forms. The expected result would be -t or -tā for masculine, -t or -tī for feminine, and in fact both variants of both forms {{are found in the}} Bible (with -h marking the long -ā and -y marking the long -ī). The situation appears to have been quite fluid for several centuries, with -t and -tā/tī forms found in competition both in writing and in speech (cf. the Secunda (Hexapla) of Origen, which records both pronunciations, although <b>quite</b> <b>often</b> in disagreement with the written form as passed down to us). Ultimately, writing stabilized on the shorter -t for both genders, while speech choose feminine -t but masculine tā. This is the reason for the unexpected qamatz vowel written under the final letter of such words.|$|E

Apparent dyskaryosis below the age of twenty-five is not regarded as significant, and in many countries where cervical screening programmes exist, the age of entry into the programme is around that of twenty-five years old. The programme often terminates around the age of sixty-five, assuming no abnormal smears were found previously over a ten year period.|$|R
