40|$|Calculations are {{performed}} numerically and analytically of synchrotron spectra for thermal and power-law electron distributions using the single-particle synchrotron power spectrum derived from quantum electrodynamics. It is {{found that the}} photon energy at which <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> appear is proportional to temperature and independent of field strength for thermal spectra; <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> introduce an exponential roll-off away from the classical spectra. For power law spectra, the photon energy at which <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> appear is inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength; <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> produce a steeper power law than is found classically. The results are compared with spectra derived from the classical power spectrum with an energy cutoff ensuring conservation of energy. It is found that an energy cutoff is generally an inadequate approximation of <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> for low photon energies and for thermal spectra, but gives reasonable results for high-energy emission from power-law electron distributions...|$|R

Robert Andrews Millikan studied the photoelectric effect experimentally, and Albert Einstein developed a theory for it. At the same time, Ernest Rutherford experimentally discovered the nuclear model of the atom, for which Niels Bohr developed his theory of the atomic structure, which was later confirmed by the experiments of Henry Moseley. In 1913, Peter Debye extended Niels Bohr's theory of atomic structure, introducing elliptical orbits, a concept also introduced by Arnold Sommerfeld. This phase is known as old quantum theory.|$|E

This review highlights the recent significant developments in the experiment, theory, and simulation of nuclear <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> in water. Novel experimental techniques, such as deep inelastic neutron scattering, now provide a detailed view {{of the role of}} nuclear <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> in water 2 ̆ 7 s properties.

We discuss how this principle has recently been used to explain the apparent dichotomy in water 2 ̆ 7 s isotope effects, which can range from very large to almost nonexistent depending on the property and conditions.

25|$|The task of distributing {{a secret}} key could be {{achieved}} even when the particle (on which the secret information, e.g. polarization, has been encoded) does not traverse through the quantum channel using a protocol developed by Tae-Gon Noh. Here Alice generates a photon which randomly takes either path (a) or path (b). Path (a) stays inside Alice's secure device and path (b) goes to Bob. By rejecting the photons that Bob receives and only accepting the ones he doesn't receive, Bob & Alice can set up a secure channel, i.e. Eve's attempts to read the counterfactual photons would still be detected. This protocol uses the quantum phenomenon whereby {{the possibility that a}} photon can be sent has an effect even when it isn't sent. So-called interaction-free measurement also uses this <b>quantum</b> <b>effect,</b> as for example in the bomb testing problem, whereby you can determine which bombs are not duds without setting them off, except in a counterfactual sense.|$|E
25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} {{arises from}} a mixture between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos. That is, the three neutrino states that {{interact with the}} charged leptons in weak interactions are each a different superposition of the three neutrino states of definite mass. Neutrinos are created in weak processes in their flavor eigenstates. As a neutrino propagates through space, the quantum mechanical phases of the three mass states advance at slightly different rates due to the slight differences in the neutrino masses. This results in a changing mixture of mass states as the neutrino travels, but a different mixture of mass states corresponds to a different mixture of flavor states. So a neutrino born as, say, an electron neutrino will be some mixture of electron, mu, and tau neutrino after traveling some distance. Since the quantum mechanical phase advances in a periodic fashion, after some distance the state will nearly return to the original mixture, and the neutrino will be again mostly electron neutrino. The electron flavor content of the neutrino will then continue to oscillate {{as long as the}} quantum mechanical state maintains coherence. Since mass differences between neutrino flavors are small in comparison with long coherence length for neutrino oscillations this microscopic <b>quantum</b> <b>effect</b> becomes observable over macroscopic distances.|$|E

The {{formulation of the}} DG model {{is described as a}} quantum correction ot the classical drift-diffusion model. <b>Quantum</b> confinement <b>effects</b> are shown to be significant in sub- 100 nm MOSFETs. In thin-oxide MOS capacitors, <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> may reduce gate capacitance by 25 % or more. As a result, the inclusion of <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> may reduce gate capacitance by 25 % or more. As a result, the inclusion of <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> in simulations dramatically improves the match between C-V simulations and measurements for oxide thickness down to 2 nm. Significant quantum corrections also occur in the I-V characteristics of short-channel (30 to 100 nm) n-MOSFETs, with current drive reduced by up to 70 %. This effect is shown to result from reduced inversion charge due to quantum confinement of electrons in the channel. Also, subthreshold slope is degraded by 15 to 20 mV/decade with the inclusion of <b>quantum</b> <b>effects</b> via the density-gradient model, and short channel effects (in particular, drain-induced barrier lowering) are noticeably increased...|$|R
