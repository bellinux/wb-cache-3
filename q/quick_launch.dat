25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old <b>Quick</b> <b>Launch</b> toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for {{a quick look at the}} desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|E
500|$|With a late start {{into the}} {{handheld}} gaming market, Sega rushed {{to get the}} Game Gear into stores quickly, having lagged behind Nintendo in sales without a handheld on the market. [...] As one method of doing so, Sega based the hardware of the Game Gear on the Master System, albeit with a much larger color palette than its predecessor: the Game Gear supported 4096 colors, compared to the 64 colors supported by the Master System. [...] Part of the intention of this move was to make Master System games easy to port to the Game Gear. [...] Though the Game Gear {{was designed to be}} technologically superior to the Game Boy, its design came at a cost of battery life: whereas the Game Boy could run for more than 30 hours on four AA batteries, the Game Gear required six AA batteries and could only run for three to five hours. [...] With its <b>quick</b> <b>launch</b> in Japan, the handheld sold 40,000 units in its first two days, 90,000 within a month, and the number of back orders for the system was over 600,000. [...] According to Sega of America marketing director Robert Botch, [...] "there is clearly a need for a quality portable system that provides features other systems have failed to deliver. [...] This means easy-to-view, full-colour graphics and exciting quality games that appeal to all ages." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{company was}} founded in 2006 by {{small group of people}} from Telenor and NetCom (Norway). Together with Siemens - during a few months in 2006/2007 - they built a new mobile {{operator}} from scratch and had a commercial launch of the GSM-900 network in 2007. This {{is probably one of the}} <b>quickest</b> <b>launches</b> of a mobile operator in history. Their network covered the greater Oslo area, as well as the cities of Stavanger and Trondheim. Outside these cities, customers could roam on the network of the Norwegian operator Netcom Norway.|$|R
50|$|The Kodiak {{spaceport}} has two launch pads with {{a mission}} control center that includes 64 workstations with high-speed communications and data links. There is a clean room for preparing satellites for launch, a fully enclosed 17-story-tall rocket assembly building and two independent range and telemetry systems. The complex sits on 3700 acre of state-owned land. Launch pad 1 is designed for orbital launches, while launch pad 2 is intended for sub-orbital flights. A third launch pad is planned which would allow the facility to support <b>quick</b> <b>launches</b> of satellites: under 24 hours to launch from 'go ahead'.|$|R
50|$|The default {{settings}} for the taskbar in Microsoft Windows place {{it at the}} bottom of the screen and includes from left to right the Start menu button, <b>Quick</b> <b>Launch</b> bar, taskbar buttons, and notification area. The <b>Quick</b> <b>Launch</b> toolbar was added with the Windows Desktop Update and is not enabled by default in Windows XP. Windows 7 removed the <b>Quick</b> <b>Launch</b> feature in favor of pinning applications to the taskbar itself. On Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, a hotspot located in the bottom-left corner of the screen replaced the Start button, although this change was reverted in Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2.|$|E

In {{order to}} verify a <b>quick</b> <b>launching</b> system for rockets with small and medium sizes, an {{engineering}} vehicle localization and navigation sub-system {{is presented in}} this article. The structure of the launcher includes the front board and two cylindrical landmarks on both sides. When the vehicle gets close to the launcher, two 2 D laser scanners on the vehicle detect the launcher reliably. And an extend Kalman filter is used to estimate the vehicleâ€™s pose relative to the launcher. The localization and navigation {{results show that the}} lateral positioning error is smaller than 1 cm so that the vehicle could align with the launcher accurately...|$|R

Hence the vexation of the captain of Number Nine. He descended to the beach, with a low word here and there picked a crew of the strongest surfers, and {{returned}} to the lanai with a pair of binoculars. Quite casually, the crew, six of them, carried Number Nine to the water's edge, saw paddles and everything in order for a <b>quick</b> <b>launching,</b> and lolled about carelessly on the sand. They were guilty of not advertising that anything untoward was afoot, although they did steal glances up to their captain straining through the binoculars.|$|R

This new version of the Sejil-2 is faster during the powered flight portion of its trajectory and also during the re-entry phase.It is also harder to detect for anti-missile systems, as it is covered with anti-radar material.The new highly maneuverable missile is also more efficient as it requires less time for prelaunch preparations.|$|R

40|$|As {{the mobile}} {{applications}} become increasing popular, people are installing {{more and more}} Apps on their smart phones. In this paper, we answer the question whether it is feasible to predict which App the user will open. The ability for such prediction can help pre-loading the right Apps to the memory for faster execution or help floating the desired Apps to the home screen for <b>quicker</b> <b>launch.</b> We explored a variety of contextual information, such as last used App, time, location, and the user profile, to predict the userâ€™s App usage using the MDC dataset. We present three findings from our studies. First, the contextual information {{can be used to}} learn the pattern of userâ€™s App usage and to predict App usage effectively. Second, for the MDC dataset, the correlation between sequentially used Apps has a strong contribution to the prediction accuracy. Lastly, the linear model is more effective than the Bayesian model to combine all contextual information and for such predictions...|$|R

50|$|Orbcomm <b>Quick</b> <b>Launch</b> (QL) {{satellites}} are satellites {{which were}} intended to replenish the constellation. The first five such satellites were launched in 2008, with one more planned, but never launched. The satellites {{are based on the}} CDS-3 satellite, which was launched on the same rocket as the first five QL spacecraft. The sixth will be launched as a secondary payload to a Russian Government satellite, also on a Kosmos-3M. Orbcomm holds options for two further satellites.The satellites experienced a power system anomaly, and Orbcomm filed an insurance claim on the satellites for $50 million. Orbcomm reported in 2011 that the last remaining <b>Quick</b> <b>Launch</b> satellite had failed.|$|E
50|$|The {{company has}} entered a {{partnership}} with the German company OHB-System, providing the Kosmos-3M launch vehicle as well as designing and producing satellite platforms for OHB-System's ORBCOMM project. Six such satellites were launched on 19 June 2008 with the Kosmos-3M rocket: one ORBCOMM CDS weighing 80 kg, and five ORBCOMM <b>Quick</b> <b>Launches</b> weighing 115 kg each. On November 9, 2009 ORBCOMM filed a report to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission stating that since launch, communications capability for three of the quick-launch satellites and the CDS has been lost. The failed satellites experienced attitude control system anomalies as well as anomalies with its power systems, which resulted in the satellites losing their proper orientation toward the sun and in reduced power generation. The company has filed a $50 million claim with its insurers covering the loss of all six satellites and received $44.5 million in compensation. In 2009, ORBCOMM turned to another satellite manufacturer to build 18 satellites for its second-generation constellation.|$|R
