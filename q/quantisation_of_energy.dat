But they also provided evidence supporting {{the model of}} the atom that had been proposed the previous year by Niels Bohr. Its key feature was that an electron inside an atom occupies one of the atom's [...] "quantum energy levels". Before a collision, an electron inside the mercury atom occupies its lowest available energy level. After the collision, the electron inside occupies a higher energy level with 4.9electron volts (eV) more energy. This means that the electron is more loosely bound to the mercury atom. There were no intermediate levels or possibilities.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} how the {{essentials}} of quantum theory, i. e., the Schroedinger equation and the Heisenberg uncertainty relations, {{can be derived from}} classical physics. Next to the empirically grounded <b>quantisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> and momentum, the only input is given by the assumption of fluctuations in energy and momentum {{to be added to the}} classical motion. Extending into the relativistic regime for spinless particles, this procedure leads also to a derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation. Comparing classical Hamiltonian flow with quantum theory, then, the essential difference is given by a vanishing divergence of the velocity of the probability current in the former, whereas the latter results from a much less stringent requirement, i. e., that only the average over fluctuations and positions of the average divergence be identical to zero.

This double well is obtained by gluing together, at the origin, two shifted harmonic oscillator potentials. The Schrödinger equation is exactly solvable.

40|$|The de Haas-van Alphen effect (dHvAe) {{describes}} the periodic oscillation of the magnetisation in a material {{as a function}} of inverse applied magnetic field. It forms the basis of a well established procedure for measuring Fermi surface properties and its observation is typically taken as a direct signature of a system being metallic. However, certain insulators can show similar oscillations of the magnetisation from <b>quantisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> electron states in filled bands. Recently the theory of such an anomalous dHvAe (AdHvAe) has been worked out but so far there is no clear experimental observation. Here, we show that the inverted narrow gap regime of InAs/GaSb quantum wells is an ideal platform for the observation of the AdHvAe. From our microscopic calculations we make quantitative predictions for the relevant magnetic field and temperature regimes, and describe unambiguous experimental signatures.

40|$|Time-space noncommutativity {{leads to}} <b>quantisation</b> <b>of</b> time and <b>energy</b> nonconservation when time is {{conjugate}} to a compact spatial direction like a circle. In this context energy is conserved only modulo some fixed unit. Such a possibility arises {{for example in}} theories with a compact extra dimension with which time does not commute. The above results suggest striking phenomenological consequences in extra dimensional theories and elsewhere. In this paper we develop scattering theory for discrete time translations. It enables the calculation of transition probabilities for energy nonconserving processes and has a central role both in formal theory and phenomenology. We can also consider space-space noncommutativity {{where one of the}} spatial directions is a circle. That leads to the <b>quantisation</b> <b>of</b> the remaining spatial direction and conservation of momentum in that direction only modulo some fixed unit, as a simple adaptation of the results in this paper shows.

40|$|Abstract. Thermionic {{emission}} {{from hot}} fullerene anions, C−N, has been measured in an electrostatic storage ring for even N values from 36 to 96. The decay is quenched by radiative cooling {{and hence the}} observations give information on the intensity of thermal radiation from fullerenes. The experiments are analysed by comparison with a simulation which includes the <b>quantisation</b> <b>of</b> photon <b>energy</b> and the statistics of emission. Experiments with heating of the molecules with a laser beam conrm {{the interpretation of the}} observations in terms of radiative cooling and give an independent estimate of the cooling rate for C− 60. The measured cooling rates agree in general within a factor of two with the prediction from a classical dielectric model of a thermal radiation intensity of 300 eV/s for C 60 at 1 400 K, scaling approximately with the 6 th power of the temperature and with the number of atoms in the molecule.

We show that, {{in addition to}} the well known <b>quantisation</b> <b>of</b> CB states within the dopant plane, the confinement of VB-derived states between the sub-surface P dopant layer and the Si surface gives rise to a simultaneous <b>quantisation</b> <b>of</b> VB states in this narrow region. We also show that the VB quantisation can be explained using a simple particle-in-a-box model, and that the number and <b>energy</b> separation <b>of</b> the quantised VB states depend on the depth of the P dopant layer beneath the Si surface. Since the quantised CB states do not show a strong dependence on the dopant depth (but rather on the dopant density), it is straightforward to exhibit control over the properties of the quantised CB and VB states independently of each other by choosing the dopant density and depth accordingly, thus offering new possibilities for engineering quantum matter.
