25|$|A {{number of}} Welsh clubs {{play in the}} English league system. Prior to 1996, these clubs, {{as members of the}} Football Association of Wales, were {{entitled}} to enter the Welsh Cup, and thus eligible to take the European place that came with winning the competition. However, from 1996 onwards, these clubs were prevented from taking part, which meant that they would {{no longer be able to}} claim a European place representing Wales. However, these clubs remained as members of the FAW, meaning that it was unclear whether they would be eligible to claim one of England's European places in the event that they met the <b>qualifying</b> <b>criteria.</b> This was not a major issue as for many years the Welsh clubs were in the lower divisions of the Football League and tended not to make the latter stages of either the FA or League Cups. However, in 2008, Cardiff City reached the final of the FA Cup, which led to UEFA and the Football Association needing to reach a consensus on the club being one of England's representatives in the event of them winning the competition (this became moot as they lost the 2008 FA Cup Final). However, the question of participation in European competition was only definitively resolved in 2012, when Cardiff reached another major final (this time the League Cup Final, which they again lost). UEFA stated that there would be no bar to Cardiff City or Swansea City being eligible for one of England's places; at the same time however they prevented the FAW from offering the European place for winning the Welsh Cup to teams playing in the English league system (the FAW had invited the six clubs playing in England to participate in the 2011–12 Welsh Cup, and had hoped to persuade UEFA to allow them to give these clubs the right to claim the European place). In 2013, Swansea became the first Welsh club to gain a place representing England by winning the League Cup and qualifying for the 2013–14 Europa League.|$|E

500|$|The <b>qualifying</b> <b>criteria</b> {{have been}} criticised as elitist and pro-establishment in nature. The {{argument}} against allowing the electorate to elect as President a candidate {{of their choice}} {{without the need for}} candidates to meet detailed qualification criteria has been said to be [...] "unconvincing" [...] and predicated on [...] "the government's paternalistic distrust of the electorate".|$|E
500|$|Imposing more {{stringent}} {{criteria for the}} President than for the Prime Minister appears unreasonable, considering how the Prime Minister's governing powers are far more substantial {{than that of the}} President. Among other things, candidates have to be above 45 years of age and must either presently hold or in the past have held high public office or directorships in private sector companies with paid-up capitals of at least S$100 million. It has been estimated that [...] "only just over 400 people have the necessary financial or administrative experience to qualify as spelt out in the constitution". These onerous <b>qualifying</b> <b>criteria</b> have greatly reduced the pool of candidates, and have been criticized as [...] "technocratic rather than democratic".|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the chief}} villain, Hugo Drax, {{was to be}} played by British actor James Mason, but once the {{decision}} was made that the film would be an Anglo-French co-production under the 1965–79 film treaty, French actor Michael Lonsdale was cast as Drax and Corinne Cléry was chosen for the part of Corinne Dufour, to comply with <b>qualifying</b> <b>criteria</b> of the agreement. Stewart Granger [...] and Louis Jourdan was considered also for the role of Drax. [...] Jourdan later portrayed prince Kamal Khan, chief villain of Octopussy. American actress Lois Chiles had originally been offered the role of Anya Amasova in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), but had turned down the part when she decided to take temporary retirement. Chiles was cast as Holly Goodhead by chance, when she was given the seat next to Lewis Gilbert on a flight and he believed she would be ideal for the role as the CIA scientist.|$|E

For example, an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra {{may or may not}} have a corresponding Lie group. That is, there may be a group corresponding to the Lie algebra, but it might not be nice enough to be called a Lie group, or the connection between the group and the Lie algebra might not be nice enough (for example, failure of the exponential map to be onto a neighborhood of the identity).

2500|$|Other {{than the}} cities of London and Westminster, no local {{authorities}} in the Greater London area have been granted city status. The Home Office had a policy of resisting any attempt by metropolitan boroughs to become cities even when their populations, and other proposed claims as <b>qualifying</b> <b>criteria,</b> might otherwise have made them eligible. It was felt that such a grant would undermine {{the status of the}} two existing cities in the capital. The Metropolitan Borough of Southwark made a number of applications, but in 1955 the borough's town clerk was told not to pursue the matter any further. Outside the boundaries of the county, the County Borough of Croydon made three applications, all of which were dismissed as it was not seen as being sufficiently separate from London. When the successor London Borough of Croydon applied in 1965 the Assistant Under Secretary of State summarised the case against Croydon: [...] "...whatever its past history, it is now just part of the London conurbation and almost indistinguishable from many of the other Greater London boroughs".|$|E
