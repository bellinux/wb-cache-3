40|$|AbstractAccording to the {{statistical}} analysis, it is {{shown that the}} differences {{of the content of}} α-helix and β-strand between α/β and α+β proteins are of statistical significance. Based on the secondary structure content and the percentage of parallel or anti-parallel strands, any mixed αβ protein can be represented by a point in a three-dimensional prism. The distribution of the mapping points for 79 mixed αβ proteins (domains), of which 26 are class α/β and 53 are class α+β, shows that the two kinds of points are situated at distinct regions roughly. A new <b>quantitative</b> <b>criterion</b> based on the Fisher discriminant algorithm is proposed to distinguish between the α/β and α+β proteins (domains). Of the 79 proteins 77 are correctly classified (97. 5 %). As a stringent cross-validation test, the jackknife test shows that of the 79 proteins 77 are correctly classified. The jackknife test accuracy is still 97. 5 %. These figures indicate the self-consistence and the extrapolating effectiveness of the new <b>quantitative</b> <b>criterion.</b> Applying the new criterion to reclassify the α/β and α+β proteins (domains) in SCOP is also discussed. It is hoped that the new <b>quantitative</b> <b>criterion</b> will be useful for the development of protein classification databases...|$|R

40|$|In game theory, {{there are}} two social interpretations of rewards (payoffs) for {{decision-making}} strategies: (1) the interpretation based on the utility criterion derived from expected utility theory and (2) the interpretation based on the <b>quantitative</b> <b>criterion</b> (amount of gain) derived from validity in the empirical context. A dynamic decision theory has recently been developed in which dynamic utility is a conditional (state) variable that {{is a function of}} the current wealth of a decision maker. We applied dynamic utility to the equal division in dove-dove contests in the hawk-dove game. Our results indicate that under the utility criterion, the half-share of utility becomes proportional to a player’s current wealth. Our results are consistent with studies of the sense of fairness in animals, which indicate that the <b>quantitative</b> <b>criterion</b> has greater validity than the utility criterion.

Previous ones were published in 1956, 1959, 1974 and 1989, and they, following Dokuchaiev's ideas, were relied mostly on the natural's criteria (quality) like soil forming processes and soil morphological features (4th edition was transient because diagnostic soil horizons appeared there). 5th edition of classification, where it was possible, was built on <b>quantitative</b> <b>criteria,</b> like quantitative described diagnostic horizons, diagnostic materials and diagnostic properties. Soil forming processes are {{not a part of}} classification but the relationship between the processes and their morphological effects was taken into account during creating differentiating criteria of diagnostic horizons, materials and properties.

5000|$|There {{are several}} critiques about {{evaluating}} autoethnographical works grounded in interpretive paradigm. First, {{some researchers have}} criticized that within qualitative research there are those that dismiss anything but positivist notions of validity and reliability. (see Doloriert and Sambrook, 2011, pp. 593-595) For example, Schwandt (1996, p. 60) argues that some social researchers have “come to equate being rational in social science with being procedural and criteriological.” Building on quantitative foundations, Lincoln and Guba (1985) translate quantitative indicators into qualitative quality indicators, namely: credibility (parallels internal validity), transferability (parallels external validity), dependability (parallels reliability), and confirmability (parallels objectivity and seeks to critically examine whether the researcher has acted in good faith {{during the course of}} the research). Smith (1984) and Smith and Heshusius (1986) critique these qualitative translations and warn that the claim of compatibility (between qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>criteria)</b> cannot be sustained and by making such claims researches are in effect closing down the conversation.
