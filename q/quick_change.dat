40|$|A Bayesian {{formulation}} of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection in multiple onoff processes is obtained within a decision-theoretic framework. For geometrically distributed busy and idle times, {{we show that}} the optimal joint design of channel switching and change detection has a simple threshold structure under a mild condition. Extensions to arbitrarily distributed busy and idle times, in particular, heavy tail distributions, are discussed. We show that this problem presents a fresh twist to the classic problem of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection that considers only one stochastic process. We demonstrate {{that the key to}} <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection in multiple processes is to abandon the current process when its state is unlikely to change in the near future (as indicated by the measurements obtained so far) and seek opportunities in a new process to avoid realizations of long busy periods. This problem arises in spectrum opportunity detection in cognitive radio networks where a secondary user searches for idle channels in the spectrum.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{classical}} problem of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection, a decision maker observes {{a sequence of}} random variables. At some point in time, {{the distribution of the}} random variables changes abruptly. The objective is to detect this change in distribution with minimum possible delay, subject to a constraint on the false alarm rate. In many applications of <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection, e. g., where the changes are infrequent, it is of interest to control the cost of observations or the cost of data acquired before the change point. To this end, in this survey paper, data-efficient versions of {{the classical}} <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection problems are studied, and a summary of existing results on these problems is provided. Some extensions to distributed sensor networks are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Quickly {{detecting}} {{changes in}} the statistical behaviour of measurements is important in many applications of control engineering involving fault detection and process monitoring. In this paper, we pose and solve minimax robust Lorden and Bayesian <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection problems for situations where the cost of detection delays compounds exponentially. We show that the detection rules that solve our robust <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection problems are also the rules that solve the standard (non-robust) problems specified by least favourable distributions from uncertainty classes of possible distributions that satisfy a stochastic boundedness condition. In contrast to previous robust <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection results with nonlinear detection delay penalties, our results with exponential delay penalties are exact (i. e., they hold for any false alarm constraint and {{not only in the}} asymptotic regime of few false alarms). We illustrate our results through simulations...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> {{detection}} with a wireless sensor node is studied in this paper. The sensor that is deployed {{to monitor the}} environment has limited energy constraint to the classical <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection problem. We consider the "censoring" strategy at the sensor side, i. e., the sensor selectively sends its observations to the decision maker. The <b>quickest</b> <b>change</b> detection problem is formulated in a minimax way. In particular, {{our goal is to}} find the optimal censoring strategy and stopping time such that the detection delay is minimized subject to constraints on both average run length (ARL) and average energy cost before the change. We show that the censoring strategy that has the maximal post-censoring Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence coupled with Cumulative Sum (CuSum) and Shiryaev-Roberts-Pollak (SRP) detection procedure is asymptotically optimal for the Lorden's and Pollak's problem as the ARL goes to infinity, respectively. We also show that the asymptotically optimal censoring strategy should use up the available energy and has a very special structure, i. e., the likelihood ratio of the no send region is a single interval, which can be utilized to significantly reduce the computational complexity. Numerical examples are shown to illustrate our results...|$|R
