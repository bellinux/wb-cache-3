40|$|Plant {{managers}} {{generally have}} no direct marketing responsibilities {{but they have}} control over product <b>quality</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> This paper hypothesises that many firms evaluate these managers on profit because sales, a component of profit, convey information on a plant manager's performance on product <b>quality</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> Several predictions are developed from the hypothesis and tested in this study. The chance that a plant manager is evaluated on cost vs profit is predicted to decrease with the sensitivity and precision of sales {{as an indicator of}} product <b>quality</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> In addition, the chance that a plant manager is evaluated on cost vs profit may be associated with {{the extent to which the}} manager is also evaluated on specific measures of product <b>quality</b> and <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> Empirical results are generally consistent with these predictions. compensation; cost centres; performance evaluation; plant managers; profit centres; product quality; <b>customer</b> <b>service.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Excellent <b>quality</b> of <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> is so {{important}} for government agencies {{even though they are}} not-for-profit. Better service enhances productivity, and treating customer right the first time saves time and money. Creating satisfied customers reduces the likelihood irate citizens take their complaints to higher sources, or to a public forum where negative word-of-mouth can be damaging. A common criticism of the public in Malaysia has been the poor <b>quality</b> of <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> rendered by employees in government agencies. As the largest organization in Malaysia, the quality of service they provide has a tremendous influence on public perceptions of the quality of public service. A study was, therefore, performed to measure the <b>quality</b> of <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> provided by public agencies in Malaysia. Focus was given to the Road Transport Department as this study could not cater to all departments throughout the government agencies. One hundred respondents who experienced interactions with this department were chosen to participate in this study. They were required to answer online questionnaires and expressed their feedback regarding the <b>quality</b> of <b>customer</b> <b>service</b> this department provided. The result demonstrated that most of the respondents were unsatisfied with the <b>quality</b> of <b>Customer</b> <b>Service</b> Representatives, facilities, procedure/policies, and the atmosphere of the department itself. Recommendations that were discussed in the study are: sending employee for training, supervisor as a role model, to eliminate bureaucracy, improve facilities (counters, seats, telephone systems, and waiting area), and improve hiring processes...|$|R
