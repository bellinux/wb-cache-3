In addition, because the sensitivity of basket <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swap</b> rates to market risk increases with the number of reference entities, the valuation error can be more sub-stantial in pricing basket <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> than <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> with a single reference entity when market risk is ignored...|$|R

40|$|Many {{observers}} {{have argued that}} <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> {{contributed significantly to the}} credit crisis. Of particular concern to these observers are that <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> trade in the largely unregulated over-the-counter market as bilateral contracts involving counterparty risk and that they facilitate speculation involving negative views of a firm’s financial strength. Some {{observers have}} suggested that <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> would not have made the crisis worse had they been traded on exchanges. I conclude that <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> did not cause the dramatic events of the credit crisis, that the over-the-counter <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> market worked well during much of {{the first year of the}} credit crisis, and that exchange trading has both advantages and costs compared to over-the-counter trading. Though I argue that eliminating over-the-counter trading of <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> could reduce social welfare, I also recognize that much research is needed to understand better and quantify the social gains and costs of derivatives in general and <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> in particular. ...|$|R

On the other side, in trying to understand the credit crisis, many observers have identifi ed <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> to be a prominent villain.

This means that it can be cheaper to hedge a portfolio of <b>credit</b> <b>default</b> <b>swaps</b> or bonds with a CDS index than it would be to buy many single name CDS to achieve a similar effect.
