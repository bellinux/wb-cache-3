HFT industry people argue that the phenomenon could be a software error. HFT insiders refer to <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> as “flickering”, which is caused by feedback loops. It is suggested that investors who engage in <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> [...] "puts his own capital at risk" [...] and increases [...] "liquidity" [...] for buy side investors.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{potential}} {{effect on the}} 2010 Flash Crash, <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> has been debated by financial researchers, industry advocates and media outlets, including in Fox Business, Wall Street Journal, CBS Money Watch, RISK, and The New York Times. Some have noted that {{the release of the}} Michael Lewis book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt has helped to initiate the debate on high-frequency trading, including the tactics of spoofing, layering and <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing.</b> The book details the rise of high-frequency trading in the US market, which has caused financial regulators to clamp down on issues related to <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> is {{a tactic}} {{employed}} by malicious traders that involves quickly entering and withdrawing {{large quantities of}} orders {{in an attempt to}} flood the market, thereby gaining an advantage over slower market participants. The rapidily placed and canceled orders cause market data feeds that ordinary investors rely on to delay price quotes while the stuffing is occurring. HFT firms benefit from proprietary, higher-capacity feeds and the most capable, lowest latency infrastructure. Researchers showed high-frequency traders are able to profit by the artificially induced latencies and arbitrage opportunities that result from <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing.</b>|$|E

Today {{was a rather}} “blue day” for me cause I guess I didn’t have enough planned things to do. Of course, being without you can make me blue anytime, but Bubsie, I wish I knew more younger people around Cleve., altho’ I still can’t figure out where I’d get the {{time to spend with}} them. I mean I’d like to take [sic] with someone in the “same boat” as I’m in. Know what I mean? So far, outside of Amy I haven’t met a sould [sic] who really is in a similar perdicament [sic] to mine, 2 ̆ 6 then, Amy was in the WACS before marriage 2 ̆ 6 didn’t have the adjustment to make that I did. But—don’t worry, dear. I’ll survive until you come home [...] 2 ̆ 6 for the present, I’m as happy as can be expected. Spoke to your Mom 2 ̆ 6 Sanf today. Sanf 2 ̆ 6 I talked for about 30 minutes about a million different things. I still think he lacks certain social graces and he definitely cannot adjust to different classes 2 ̆ 6 ages of people the way you can. You are definitely very adaptable to people if you want to be. Honey, I really feel you could be a great statesman, if that would be your desire. I finished reading “Your Car Was Made to Last. ” I got nothing out of the technical chapter, but the chapter on “Etiquette in a Garage 2 ̆ 6 Service Station” was Cleve besides being information. If I got [sic] ambitious during the week, I’ll <b>quote</b> some <b>stuff</b> to you. However, one thing I remember very vividly is “if a put a boat in, but have it valcanized. ” Guess we should have read the book a long time ago. It has definitely straightened me out on some points about the car, itself 2 ̆ 6 how to drive it. UK 2 ̆ 6 I had dinner at Chin’s—I thought it was my party 2 ̆ 6 was I surprised when UK beat me to the bill! Sadie 2 ̆ 6 Max have been literally begging me to see “Wilson” with them, so UK 2 ̆ 6 I met them at the Keiths. I thought the picture excellent as a whole. However, it had a few minor flaws— 2 nd wife looked too young—picture forgot that as death drew near, he was paralyzed on left side, etc. ! However, it gave a clear picture of a sincere, idealistic, rather stubborn man who was born “ 30 years too soon. ” I thought I’d send you another cablegram, but I think I’ll wait 2 ̆ 6 find out how soon you rec’d the first one. Darling—you are ever in my thoughts 2 ̆ 6 in my heart. I love you, Vic dear, Edith [Transcription ends...|$|R

50|$|Diaz and Theodoulidis {{presented}} analysis {{contrary to}} the claim that HFT firms use the tactic to provide liquidity. It was rather shown that the potentially abusive and manipulative behavior known as <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> is able {{to increase the gap}} of best bid and ask prices, thereby increasing costs for ordinary investors. The researchers concluded that “it is possible for a high-speed trader to profit by artificially creating latencies in trading data feeds that would make arbitrage possible by taking advantage of the HFT induced price differences between markets.” Researchers also found that more than 74% of U.S. listed equity securities received at least one <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> event during the 2010 Flash Crash.|$|E
50|$|By <b>quote</b> <b>{{stuffing}},</b> trading systems delay price quotes {{while the}} stuffing is occurring, simply by placing and canceling orders {{at a rate}} that substantially surpasses the bandwidth of market data feed lines. The orders pile up in buffers, and the delay (increased latency) lasts until the buffer drains. Trading systems slow down a direct exchange feed whenever they want, and the phantom orders {{do not need to be}} in a particular stock; they can be in any of the securities that cohabit the particular price (market data) feed. For example, phantom orders at the rate of over about 10,000 messages/second, even for fractions of a second, delay the NYSE's CQS feeds.Exchanges profit by selling higher-capacity feeds to HFT traders, which disincents self-regulation that could prevent the <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing.</b> <b>Quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> happens frequently - when 6,000 replacement orders for one stock are crammed into a second, each order is valid for less time than it takes for the news of the order (traveling at close to the speed of light) to reach anyone not at the exchange; no normal person can execute a trade against the phantom order.|$|E
50|$|In September 2010, Business Insider {{reported}} that Trillium Capital {{had received a}} $1 million fine by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for trading strategies that were considered <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> and market manipulation.

50|$|<b>Quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> is made {{possible}} by high-frequency trading programs that can execute market actions with incredible speed.

50|$|In finance, <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> {{refers to}} a form of market {{manipulation}} employed by high-frequency traders (HFT) that involves quickly entering and withdrawing a large number of orders in an attempt to flood the market. This can create confusion in the market and trading opportunities for high-speed algorithmic traders. The term is relatively new to the financial market lexicon and was coined by Nanex in studies on HFT behavior during the 2010 Flash Crash.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) {{began looking}} at the {{practice}} of <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> {{in relation to the}} Flash Crash. The agency started assessing whether the practice violated [...] "existing rules against fraudulent or other improper behavior" [...] or caused a disadvantage through distorted stock prices. SEC chairman Mary Schapiro said the agency would assess whether traders must hold orders open for minimum periods of time and other changes to financial trading. [...] No such regulations have been enacted (except in Italy).|$|E

40|$|The article {{discusses}} selected {{market abuse}} activities that manifested in several financial markets {{during the recent}} global financial crisis. In relation to this, market abuse activities such as front running and <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing,</b> dark pools and flash orders, hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud, high frequency trading, credit default swaps and short selling will be briefly analysed. This is done to investigate whether the current South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework is robust enough to effectively combat these activities. This is further aimed at exposing certain challenges embedded in the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework {{in relation to the}} prevention and combating of the aforementioned practices in the financial markets in South Africa. To this end, the article seeks to explore these challenges by, first, examining the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the combating of front running and <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing.</b> Secondly, the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the curbing of dark pools and flash orders will be discussed. Thirdly, the adequacy of the aforesaid enforcement framework will be examined in relation to the combating of hedge funds insider trading and high yield securities investment fraud. Fourthly, a similar examination will be done in respect of high frequency trading. Fifthly, the adequacy of the South African anti-market abuse enforcement framework with regard to the curbing of credit default swaps will be discussed. Lastly, a similar discussion regarding short selling will be undertaken...|$|E
30|$|Consequently, one natural {{research}} direction should involve {{risk management}} and mitigation {{in the financial}} markets. There are different types of risk related {{to the use of}} HFT approaches. First, there is operational risk coming from the reliability of trading algorithms used by HFT firms. This kind of risk always naturally exists for any kind of new technology: it can only be reduced but never eliminated. The minimization of operational risk relies on high-frequency traders’ constant checking and testing of their algorithms, the use of appropriate risk management tools, and adoption of effective risk management strategies. In addition, the improper behavior of high-frequency traders will result in human-centric risk. The misconduct of traders, involving ping orders, <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> and layering, for example, disturbs the effective daily operations of financial markets and impairs the ability of all of the market participants to benefit from trading. These kinds of behavior and their prevention are of interest to psychology and behavioral science researchers, as well as policy-makers.|$|E
30|$|With the {{continuous}} and fast development of HFT, {{larger and larger}} shares of equity trades were created in the U.S. financial markets, as we noted earlier. Also, there was mounting evidence of disturbed market stability and caused significant financial losses due to HFT-related errors. This led the regulators to increase their attention and effort to provide the exchanges and traders with guidance on HFT practices They also expressed concerns about high-frequency traders extracting profit at the costs of traditional investors and even manipulating the market. Some forms of misconduct by these traders have been reported (Biais & Woolley 2011). For instance, high-frequency traders can generate {{a large amount of}} orders within microseconds to exacerbate a trend. Other types of misconduct include: ping orders, which is using some orders to detect other hidden orders; and <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing,</b> which is issuing a large number of orders to create uncertainty in the market. HFT creates room for these kinds of market abuses, and its blazing speed and huge trade volumes make their detection difficult for regulators (Nelson & Cox 2013).|$|E
40|$|This paper poses a few {{fundamental}} {{questions regarding the}} attributes of the volume profile of a Limit Order Books stochastic structure by taking into consideration aspects of intraday and interday statistical features, the impact of different exchange features {{and the impact of}} market participants in different asset sectors. This paper aims to address the following questions: 1. Is there statistical evidence that heavy-tailed sub-exponential volume profiles occur at different levels of the Limit Order Book on the bid and ask and if so does this happen on an intra or interday time scale? 2. In futures exchanges, are heavy tail features exchange (CBOT, CME, EUREX, SGX and COMEX) or asset class (government bonds, equities and precious metals) dependent and do they happen on ultrahigh (< 1 sec) or mid-range (1 sec- 10 min) high frequency data? 3. Does the presence of stochastic heavy-tailed volume profile features evolve in a manner that would inform or be indicative of market participant behaviors, such as high frequency algorithmic trading, <b>quote</b> <b>stuffing</b> and price discovery intra-daily? 4. Is there statistical evidence for a need to consider dynamic behavior of the parameters of models for Limit Order Book volume profiles on an intra-daily time scale? Progress on aspects of each question is obtained via statistically rigorous results to verify the empirical findings for an unprecedentedly large set of futures market LOB data. The data comprises several exchanges, several futures asset classes and all trading days of 2010, using market depth (Type II) order book data to 5 levels on the bid and ask. Keywords...|$|E
