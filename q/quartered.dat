2500|$|To {{explain the}} process, {{consider}} {{one third of}} one <b>quarter.</b> Using {{the example of a}} cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a <b>quarter,</b> and four <b>quarters</b> make up a whole, twelve of these small, equal slices make up a whole. Therefore, a third of a <b>quarter</b> is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a <b>quarter</b> is one twelfth, two thirds of a <b>quarter</b> is two twelfth. [...] The second fraction, three <b>quarters,</b> is three times as large as one <b>quarter,</b> so two thirds of three <b>quarters</b> is three times as large as two thirds of one <b>quarter.</b> Thus two thirds times three <b>quarters</b> is six twelfths.|$|R

5|$|As Warden, and {{afterwards}} Master, of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20 {{percent of the}} coins taken in during the Great Recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate lipid composition of teat canal keratin when different conditions of bacterial colonization and <b>quarter</b> inflammation were present. In Experiment 1, 11 multiparous cows with subclinical mastitis (bacteria present but no visible inflammation) {{in at least one}} <b>quarter</b> were selected for study. <b>Quarters</b> that were sampled and found negative for bacterial growth were classified as control. In Experiment 2, 10 multiparous cows with clinical mastitis in one or more <b>quarters</b> were selected. Milk samples from inflamed <b>quarters</b> were cultured to identify mastitis pathogens; these <b>quarters</b> were classified as clinical; all other <b>quarters</b> were classified as control. Teat canal keratin was collected from all <b>quarters</b> just before an a. m. milking, samples were weighed and lipid determinations were conducted by TLC. Keratin from subclinical <b>quarters</b> compared with keratin from control <b>quarters</b> did not differ in either neutral lipid or fatty acid composition. Total lipid was significantly higher in keratin from teats of clinical <b>quarters</b> than in keratin from control <b>quarters</b> (27. 8 vs. 21. 5 -mu-g/mg). Neutral lipid composition of keratin was similar between teats from clinical <b>quarters</b> and teats from control <b>quarters.</b> In Experiment 2, <b>quarter</b> foremilk samples were also obtained to determine lipid composition. The FFA in milk from clinical <b>quarters</b> contained fewer short-chain fatty acids, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids were significantly higher in milk from clinical <b>quarters...</b>|$|R
