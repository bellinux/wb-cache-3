5|$|After the Dutch {{settlement}} of South Africa began, the <b>quagga</b> was heavily hunted as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. While some individuals {{were taken to}} zoos in Europe, breeding programs were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State, and the <b>quagga</b> was extinct in the wild by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one <b>quagga</b> was ever photographed alive and only 23 skins are preserved today. In 1984, the <b>quagga</b> was the first extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and the <b>Quagga</b> Project is trying to recreate the phenotype of hair coat pattern and related characteristics by selectively breeding Burchell's zebras.|$|E
5|$|The <b>quagga</b> was {{the first}} extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study {{launched}} the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the <b>quagga</b> was {{more closely related to}} zebras than to horses, with the <b>quagga</b> and mountain zebra (Equus zebra) sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An immunological study published the following year found the <b>quagga</b> to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the <b>quagga</b> diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.|$|E
5|$|As it {{was easy}} to find and kill, the <b>quagga</b> was hunted by early Dutch {{settlers}} and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The <b>quagga</b> was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The <b>quagga</b> had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild individual died in 1878.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus <b>quagga</b> by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. <b>Quagga</b> subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant <b>quagga</b> specimens. Some authors have described the <b>quagga</b> as a kind of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Later {{morphological}} studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 {{analysis of}} cranial measurements {{found that the}} <b>quagga</b> was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the <b>quagga</b> was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the <b>quagga</b> as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The only <b>quagga</b> to {{have been}} photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five {{photographs}} of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the <b>quagga</b> were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the <b>Quagga</b> Project, claimed {{that this is an}} optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. Embryological evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{practical}} function of striping {{has not been}} determined for zebras in general, it is unclear why the <b>quagga</b> lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the <b>quagga</b> lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with {{this is that the}} mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the <b>quagga</b> appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity compared to other zebras.|$|E
5|$|The <b>quagga</b> {{catshark}} is harmless {{and is not}} {{utilized by}} humans. It is caught incidentally by demersal fisheries in bottom trawls and potentially other gear; such fishing activity is very intense in Indian and Somalian waters, though specific data on this species is lacking. Therefore, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|Exotic {{species of}} fauna {{such as the}} zebra and <b>quagga</b> mussels and the New Zealand mud snail are {{invasive}} species that can greatly impact fish species. Though the mussel species are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail {{has been found in}} the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a preventative program to try to keep these species from entering forest waterways.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD {{to tap into the}} lake. Water from the Colorado River Aqueduct is not being used due to the threat of the <b>Quagga</b> mussel, an invasive species that has already contaminated other Southern California lakes served by the aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Only nine <b>quagga</b> {{catshark}} specimens {{have been}} recorded. In addition to Alcock's type specimen, four males were trawled from off the eastern Somalian coast {{by the research}} ship RV Anton Bruun in 1964. Four more individuals, two male and two female, were found amongst the contents of commercial fishing trawls conducted off Quilon, India in 2010. A male specimen reported from the Gulf of Aden in 1939 was later re-identified as a speckled catshark (H. boesemani).|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have had}} {{a great impact on}} the populations of wild equines. Threats to wild equines include habitat {{destruction}} and conflicts with local people and livestock. Since the 20th century, wild equines have been decimated over many of their former ranges and their populations scattered. In recent centuries, two subspecies, the <b>quagga</b> and the tarpan, became extinct. Only the plains zebra remains numerous and widespread. The IUCN lists the African wild ass as critically endangered, the Grévy's zebra, mountain zebra and Przewalski's horse as endangered, the Onager as vulnerable, the kiang as lower risk and the plains zebra as least concern. The Przewalski's horse was considered to be extinct in the wild from the 1960s to 1996. However, following successful captive breeding, it has been reintroduced in Mongolia.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the <b>quagga.</b> This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|Slender and firm-bodied, the <b>quagga</b> {{catshark}} has a {{short and}} flattened {{head with a}} pointed snout. The slightly protruding {{tip of the snout}} is not upturned like in some other Halaelurus species. The anterior rims of the nostrils bear triangular flaps of skin. The small, horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have rudimentary nictitating membranes; below the eyes are thick ridges, and behind them are tiny spiracles. The rather large mouth is curved, with the upper teeth exposed when closed. There are short furrows at the corners of the mouth. The jaws contain 26–28 upper and 27 lower tooth rows on each side; in addition, there are three tooth rows at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and one row at the lower. The teeth have three cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are placed higher than the level of the mouth; the fifth pair are smaller than the rest.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} <b>quagga</b> {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E
25|$|On {{the lower}} slopes of Devil's Peak, above Groote Schuur Hospital, an animal camp bequeathed to the City of Cape Town by Cecil John Rhodes {{has been used}} in recent years as part of the <b>Quagga</b> Project. The quaggas used to roam the Cape Peninsula, the Karoo and the Free State in large numbers, but were hunted to {{extinction}} during the early 1800s. The last <b>quagga</b> died in an Amsterdam zoo in 1883. In 1987 a project was launched by Reinhold Rau to back-breed the <b>quagga,</b> after it had been established, using mitochondrial DNA obtained from museum specimens, that the <b>quagga</b> was closely related to the plains zebra, and on 20 January 2005 a foal considered to be the first quagga-like individual because of a visible reduced striping was born. These quagga-like zebras are officially known as Rau quaggas, as no one can be certain that they are anything more than <b>quagga</b> look-alikes. The animal camp above Groote Schuur Hospital has several good looking Rau quaggas, but they are unfortunately not easily seen except from within the game camp, which is quite large and undulating, and the animals are few. The animal camp is not open to the public.|$|E
25|$|Zebra and <b>quagga</b> mussels first {{appeared}} in the United States in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Chlorine dioxide also is {{used for}} control of zebra and <b>quagga</b> mussels in water intakes.|$|E
25|$|Zebra and <b>quagga</b> mussels can be {{destructive}} to an ecosystem due to competition for resources with native species. The filtration of zooplankton by the mussels can negatively impact the feeding for some species of fish. Zebra and <b>quagga</b> mussels can attach to hard surfaces and build layers on underwater structures. The mussels {{are known to}} clog pipes including those in hydroelectric power systems, thus becoming a costly and time-consuming problem for water managers in the West.|$|E
25|$|Several vendors (Cisco, Allied Telesis, Juniper, Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, <b>Quagga),</b> {{implement}} the two extensions below for stub and not-so-stubby areas. Although {{not covered by}} RFC standards, they are {{considered by many to}} be standard features in OSPF implementations.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, C. P. Groves and C. H. Bell {{investigated}} the taxonomy of the zebra genus, Equus, subgenus Hippotigris. They published their {{research in the}} journal Mammalian Biology. They revised the subspecies of the plains zebra Equus <b>quagga.</b> Six subspecies are now recognisable.|$|E
25|$|Despite these measures, <b>quagga</b> mussel DNA was {{detected}} in 2012 and live mussels {{were found at}} a number of sites in Spring and Summer 2013. As of June 2013 the NPS was attempting a diver based eradication program to find and remove mussels before the lake becomes infested.|$|E
25|$|Embryological {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} the zebra's background colour is dark and the white is an addition. The first subspecies to be described, the now-extinct <b>quagga,</b> had plain brown hindquarters. There have been various mutations of the zebra's pelage, from mostly white to mostly black. Rare albino zebras have been recorded in the forests of Mount Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Subspecies {{include the}} extinct <b>quagga</b> and six {{recognised}} extant subspecies, {{though there is}} great variation in coat patterns between individuals. The striping pattern is unique among ungulates in the region, and its functions are disputed. Suggested functions include crypsis, forms of motion camouflage, social signaling and recognition, and discouraging biting flies. As of 2016, the plains zebra is classified as Near Threatened by IUCN.|$|E
25|$|Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy: {{a diverse}} Natural History {{collection}} covering {{the whole of}} the animal kingdom. Includes rare dodo and <b>quagga</b> skeletons. A teaching and research collection, it is named after Robert Edmund Grant, UCL's first professor of comparative anatomy and zoology from 1828, now mainly noted for having tutored the undergraduate Charles Robert Darwin at the University of Edinburgh in the 1826–1827 session. Open at limited fixed times and by appointment.|$|E
25|$|Introductions {{into the}} Great Lakes include the zebra mussel, which was first {{discovered}} in 1988, and <b>quagga</b> mussel in 1989. The mollusks are efficient filter feeders, competing with native mussels and reducing available food and spawning grounds for fish. In addition, the mussels {{may be a}} nuisance to industries by clogging pipes. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that {{the economic impact of}} the zebra mussel could be about $5billion over the next decade.|$|E
25|$|The {{first study}} {{of what would}} {{come to be called}} aDNA was {{conducted}} in 1984, when Russ Higuchi and colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley reported that traces of DNA from a museum specimen of the <b>Quagga</b> not only remained in the specimen over 150 years after the death of the individual, but could be extracted and sequenced. Over the next two years, through investigations into natural and artificially mummified specimens, Svante Pääbo confirmed that this phenomenon was not limited to relatively recent museum specimens but could apparently be replicated in a range of mummified human samples that dated as far back as several thousand years (Pääbo 1985a; Pääbo 1985b; Pääbo 1986).|$|E
25|$|Species {{have also}} been {{introduced}} via attachment to sporting boats which are trailered between regions. This is the probable source {{of a number of}} low salinity plants like Egeria densa and water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes). These plants have created profound changes in the Delta by disrupting water flow, shading phytoplankton, and providing habitat for piscivorous fish like the striped bass, Morone saxatilis, itself intentionally introduced in the late 1800s from the Chesapeake Bay. The freshwater <b>quagga</b> mussel, originally from Europe, is expected to be introduced by boaters within the next two to ten years, in spite of precautionary measures. Furthermore, the young age and isolated environment of the San Francisco estuary has resulted in the success of invasive invertebrates {{due to the lack of}} biodiversity.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{has been}} cited as a {{possible}} reason for a decrease in population of various whitefish, important because of their culinary desirability and, hence, economic consequence. Moreover, between 1879 and 1899, reported whitefish harvests declined from some 24.3 million pounds (11 millionkg) to just over 9 million pounds (4 millionkg). By 1900, commercial fishermen on Lake Michigan were hauling in an average of 41 million pounds of fish annually. By 1938, Wisconsin's commercial fishing operations were motorized and mechanized, generating jobs for more than 2,000 workers, and hauling 14 million pounds per year. The population of giant freshwater mussels was eliminated as the mussels were harvested for use as buttons by early Great Lakes entrepreneurs. Since 2000, the invasive <b>quagga</b> mussel has smothered the bottom of Lake Michigan almost from shore to shore, and their numbers are estimated at 900 trillion.|$|E
25|$|Some local {{population}}s, though, {{have faced}} great declines and even extinctions. Though facing decline in numbers the plains zebra population is thriving at about 750,000. One subspecies, the <b>quagga,</b> is now extinct. In Tanzania, the zebra population has decreased by 20% {{from the late}} 1990s to the mid-2000s. Zebras are threatened by hunting for their hide and meat, and habitat change from farming. They also compete with livestock for food, and are sometimes culled. Poaching is largely a threat to northern populations, while southern populations are threatened mostly by habitat loss. Recent civil wars in Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Uganda have caused dramatic declines in all wildlife populations, including those of plains zebra. It is now extinct in Burundi. Civil war in Angola {{during much of the}} past 25 years has devastated its wildlife populations, including its once-abundant plains zebra, and destroyed the national parks administration and infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 25,000 large animals, mostly ungulates, {{live in the}} crater. Large {{animals in}} the crater include the black {{rhinoceros}} (Diceros bicornis), the local population of which declined from about 108 in 1964-66 to between 11-14 in 1995, the African buffalo or Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer), and the hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius). There also are many other ungulates: the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) (7,000 estimated in 1994), Grant's zebra (Equus <b>quagga</b> boehmi) (4,000), the common eland (Taurotragus oryx), and Grant's (Nanger granti) and Thomson's gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii) (3,000). Waterbucks (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) occur mainly near Lerai Forest. There are no topis (Damaliscus lunatus), oribis (Ourebia oribi), or crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus). Impala (Aepyceros melampus) are absent because the open woodland they prefer does not exist. Giraffe also are absent, possibly {{because of a lack}} of browse species. Tanzanian cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus raineyi), East African wild dog (Lycaon pictus lupinus), and African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus) are rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} exotic water fleas have accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Great Lakes, such as the spiny waterflea, Bythotrephes longimanus, and the fishhook waterflea, Cercopagis pengoi, potentially having {{an effect on the}} zooplankton population. Several species of crayfish have also been introduced that may contend with native crayfish populations. More recently an electric fence has been set up across the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in order to keep several species of invasive Asian carp out of the area. These fast-growing planktivorous fish have heavily colonized the Mississippi and Illinois river systems. The sea lamprey, which has been particularly damaging to the native lake trout population, is another example of a marine invasive species in the Great Lakes. Invasive species, particularly zebra and <b>quagga</b> mussels, may be at least partially responsible for the collapse of the deepwater demersal fish community in Lake Huron, as well as drastic unprecedented changes in the zooplankton community of the lake.|$|E
25|$|Lake Michigan {{is home to}} a {{wide variety}} of fish species and other organisms. It was {{originally}} home to lake whitefish, lake trout, yellow perch, panfish, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass and bowfin, as well as some species of catfish. As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919, an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting, there has been a decline in native lake trout populations, ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species, the alewife. As a result, salmonids, including various strains of brown trout, steelhead (rainbow trout), coho and chinook salmon, were introduced as predators in order to decrease the alewife population. This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded, resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species. Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead, brown trout, and coho and chinook salmon, which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries. However, several introduced invasive species, such as lampreys, round goby, zebra mussels and <b>quagga</b> mussels, continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility, resulting in knock-on changes to Lake Michigan's ecosystem, threatening the vitality of native fish populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{species was}} accidentally {{introduced}} into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast water transfer in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact; the consequences are quite complex as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them while consuming other invasive species. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many important to the angling industry. The goby's robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species. Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby's ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and <b>quagga),</b> may result in greater bioaccumulation of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because {{even though they do}} not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large scale spread of the zebra mussel, which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} much debate over {{the status of the}} <b>quagga</b> in {{relation}} to the plains zebra. It is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected {{at a time when the}} name [...] "quagga" [...] referred to all zebras. Fossil skulls of Equus mauritanicus from Algeria have been claimed to show affinities with the <b>quagga</b> and the plains zebra, but they may be too badly damaged to allow definite conclusions to be drawn from them. Quaggas have also been identified in cave art attributed to the San. Reginald Innes Pocock was perhaps the first to suggest that the <b>quagga</b> was a subspecies of plains zebra in 1902. As the <b>quagga</b> was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the trinomial name for the <b>quagga</b> becomes E. <b>quagga</b> <b>quagga</b> under this scheme, and the other subspecies of plains zebra are placed under E. <b>quagga</b> as well.|$|E
500|$|The <b>quagga</b> {{catshark}} (Halaelurus <b>quagga)</b> is {{a species}} of catshark, belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae. A small, slim-bodied shark reaching [...] in length, it has a distinctive color pattern of narrow, dark brown vertical bars, which resemble those of the <b>quagga.</b> Its head is short and flattened, with a pointed snout tip that is not upturned.|$|E
