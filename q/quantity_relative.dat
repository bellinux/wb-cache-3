The arithmetic (without Arabic numerals, be it remembered) and the geometry of the mediaeval quadrivium were astonishingly clumsy and ineffectual instruments in comparison with the apparatus of modern mathematical method. And while the mathematical subjects of the quadrivium were taught as science and for their own sakes, the new mathematics is a sort of supplement to language, affording a means of thought about form and quantity and a means of expression, more exact, compact, and ready than ordinary language. The great body of physical science, {{a great deal of the}} essential fact of financial science, and endless social and political problems are only accessible and only thinkable to those who have had a sound training in mathematical analysis, and the time may not be very remote when it will be understood that for complete initiation as an efficient citizen of one of the new great complex world-wide states that are now developing, it is as necessary to be able to compute, to think in averages and maxima and minima, as it is now to be able to read and write. This development of mathematical teaching is only another aspect of the necessity that is bringing the teaching of drawing into schools, the necessity that is so widely, if not always very intelligently perceived, of clearheadedness about <b>quantity,</b> <b>relative</b> quantity, and form, that our highly mechanical, widely extended, and still rapidly extending environments involve.|$|E

This particular single choice is usually called the measured value, which may be optimal in some well-defined sense (e.g., a mean, median, or mode). Thus, the relative measurement uncertainty is the measurement uncertainty divided by the absolute value of the measured value, when the measured value is not zero.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn recent years, {{heterogeneous}} photocatalysis {{has emerged}} as a new effective, powerful, clean, and safe decontamination technology for the treatment of organic pollutants and the transformation of hazardous chemicals into different forms. This review focuses on the recent development of various conventional technologies of reactors designated for the photodegradation of hazardous organic pollutants with their limitations. This phenomenon is strongly influenced by reaction conditions such as temperature of reaction, pH, light intensity and wavelength, pollutant concentration, photocatalyst <b>quantity,</b> <b>relative</b> humidity (RH), and other parameters. The catalyst photoactivity depends on the structural characteristics of the semiconductor, its morphology, and its particles size. This paper presents the progression of photocatalytic reactors for synthetic dyes degradation with special consideration to the use of supported photocatalyst and nanostructured titanium supported over volcanic ashes, owing to the major advantage of an easy separation of the catalyst when compared to homogenous system, namely suspended catalyst.

In the first one we revisit the well known Faber–Krahn inequality for the principal eigenvalue of the p-Laplace operator with zero homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Motivated by Chatelain, Choulli, and Henrot, 1996, we show in case the equality holds in the Faber–Krahn inequality, the domain of interest must be a ball. In the second problem we consider a generalization of the well known torsion problem and accordingly define a quantity that we name the p-torsional rigidity of the domain of interest. We maximize this <b>quantity</b> <b>relative</b> {{to a set of}} domains having the same volume, and prove that the optimal domain is a ball. The last problem is very similar in spirit to the second one. We consider a Hamilton–Jacobi boundary value problem, and define a quantity to be maximized relative to a set of domains having fixed volume. Again, we prove that the optimal domain is a ball. The main tools in our analysis are the method of domain derivatives, an appropriate generalized version of the Pohozaev identity, and the classical symmetrization techniques...|$|E
40|$|Parametric {{response}} mapping (PRM) of paired CT lung images {{has been}} shown to improve the phenotyping of COPD by allowing for the visualization and quantification of non-emphysematous air trapping component, referred to as functional small airways disease (fSAD). Although promising, large variability in the standard method for analyzing PRM(fSAD) has been observed. We postulate that representing the 3 D PRM(fSAD) data as a single scalar <b>quantity</b> (<b>relative</b> volume of PRM(fSAD)) oversimplifies the original 3 D data, limiting its potential to detect the subtle progression of COPD as well as varying subtypes. In this study, we propose a new approach to analyze PRM. Based on topological techniques, we generate 3 D maps of local topological features from 3 D PRM(fSAD) classification maps. We found that the surface area of fSAD (S(fSAD)) was the most robust and significant independent indicator of clinically meaningful measures of COPD. We also confirmed by micro-CT of human lung specimens that structural differences are associated with unique S(fSAD) patterns, and demonstrated longitudinal feature alterations occurred with worsening pulmonary function independent of an increase in disease extent. These findings suggest that our technique captures additional COPD characteristics, which may provide important opportunities for improved diagnosis of COPD patients. status: publishe...|$|E
