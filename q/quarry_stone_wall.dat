50|$|The village {{church of}} St Peter in Chains was begun in 1154, during the English {{period in the}} region, Aquitaine. The 12th century {{freestone}} nave and bell tower survive. At that time, the church {{was part of the}} Benedictine priory of the nuns of Ligueux. In the 14th century, during the hundred years war between England and France, the defensive rectangular tower was added, using <b>quarry</b> <b>stone.</b> At the same time, the walls and bell tower were increased in height, again with <b>quarry</b> <b>stone.</b> The <b>walls</b> at the west entrance can be seen to be 3 metres thick. A bell was provided in 1851; it was replaced in 1979. The nave originally had a wooden vault; it {{has been replaced by a}} stone vault.|$|R

50|$|Blount and Sarah Ferrell {{married in}} 1835 and {{eventually}} settled on land {{given to them}} by her father. In 1841, Mrs. Ferrell initiated {{the development of a}} formal boxwood parterre garden along the facing slope of the property, which had been used for cotton cultivation. Mrs. Ferrell incorporated various religious symbols and motifs into the gardens' design as a confirmation and testimony of her belief that Ferrell gardens should be a reflection of faith and religious piety. She grew a wide variety of plants and incorporated locally <b>quarried</b> <b>stone</b> to create <b>walls,</b> steps and terraces.|$|R
5|$|Renovations {{included}} {{adding a}} new roof, creating a new entrance, adding an elevator, among other changes. Creating a new entrance involved removing hand <b>quarried</b> <b>stone</b> from the <b>walls</b> to enlarge a window opening. The remodeling also brought the building up to modern seismic codes and {{to comply with the}} Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). City officials hoped to maintain the character of the original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing for the center came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces.|$|R
5000|$|The {{perimeter}} {{foundation and}} exterior walls {{are made of}} rough-cut Bowlby stone, a type of volcanic tuff. The gray-brown <b>stone</b> was locally <b>quarried.</b> The <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> are true load-bearing <b>walls.</b> There are <b>stone</b> arches above the windows and main entry doors. The arch keystones and window sills are light gray granite. The courthouse windows are double-hung, one-over-one style in wooden frames. They are arranged in pairs and symmetrically placed {{on all sides of}} the building. Some of the original wooden sashes have been replaced by modern vinyl sashes; however, the frames are still intact. In the 1970s, aluminum storm windows were mounted over all the windows. Five first floor windows at the southeast corner of the building have steel bars and are covered with woven wire mesh. This is the exterior of the men's jail. Originally, there were five barred windows on the northeast corner of the building, where the women's jail was located. However, the bars were removed in 1997 when women's cells were removed.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} methods of {{constructing}} dry <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> {{depending on the}} quantity and type of stones available. Most older walls are constructed from stones and boulders cleared from the fields during preparation for agriculture [...] (field stones) but many also from <b>stone</b> <b>quarried</b> nearby. For modern <b>walls,</b> <b>quarried</b> <b>stone</b> is almost always used. The type of wall built {{will depend on the}} nature of the stones available.|$|R

50|$|Built between 1897 and 1899 out of {{the stones}} found in the {{immediate}} locality, and constructed directly onto outcrops of exposed Charnwood bedrock, Stoneywell creates the impression it is an organic part of the landscape. Set away from the road, it is close to Stoneywell Wood and its surrounding gardens are by design and necessity more wild than cultivated. The house is built on a slope and approached from above so that a visitor is required to walk round the house {{to get to the}} front door, which faces south-west over the rugged landscape. At one end the roof almost reaches the ground, and the massive chimney stack buttresses the south wall. The roof, like many of Gimson's houses, was originally thatch, but following a fire in 1938 was re-roofed in second-hand Swithland slates. The rooms, windows and roofline step downwards, along the open z-shape of the groundplan, to follow the contours of the hill, such that the ground floor is on three levels, and both groundfloor and dormer windows are all at different heights. The fireplace and doorway have huge Swithland slate lintels, that were found nearby at abandoned slate <b>quarries.</b> The <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> were built from undressed stones, their surfaces being kept even by the careful selection of each stone by the masons, to fit needs of the wall. Many of the stones were re-used from dry <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> already on the site, or recovered from the boulder clay and outcrops around about. Externally the stone has been left in a natural state, whereas internally both the walls and the exposed timbers are white. These constructional timbers, matching the intricate irregularities of the ground plan, had been cut and prepared by Richard Harrison at Sapperton, Gloucestershire to Ernest Gimson's design, and transported the 150 miles for assembly on site, showing how much pre-planning and design had gone into Gimson's plan. In 1966 it was listed as a Grade II* listed building.|$|R
50|$|During the {{intervening}} years, {{only half of}} the cathedral was complete, including 4 of the naves, and all the pillars were in place. Unfortunately, due to the continuing conflict, the original drafts were lost; all that remained were a drawing of the original facade and a general plan of construction. Also, much of the original <b>quarry</b> <b>stone</b> disappeared, and the cathedral was damaged when the army decided to use one of the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> as a place of execution; many died by firing squad for their faith. The evidence still exists in the form of hundreds of bullet holes etched in the wall; a silent memorial to those who died there.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s the <b>stone</b> <b>quarry</b> was closed. The high <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> in {{the lower}} part of the quarry (now a bird reserve) is still visible.

25|$|The Mohonk Preserve also secured {{designation}} for the Trapps mountain hamlet as {{a historic}} district on the New York State and National Registers for Historic Places. In addition, Preserve staff has identified about 65 cultural and historic sites within the district, including cellar holes (stone foundations) of former buildings, water-powered sawmills, bridge abutments, <b>stone</b> <b>walls,</b> <b>stone</b> <b>quarries,</b> charcoal pits, and burying grounds (cemeteries).|$|R
50|$|Windsor Hills Historic District is a {{national}} historic district in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. It is a cohesive residential suburb defined by rolling topography, winding, picturesque streets, <b>stone</b> garden <b>walls,</b> walks and private alley ways, early-20th century garden apartments, duplexes, and freestanding residences. Structures are predominantly of frame construction with locally <b>quarried</b> <b>stone</b> foundations. Windsor Hills developed over a period from about 1895 through 1929. The dominant styles include Shingle cottages, Dutch Colonial Revival houses, Foursquares, and Craftsman Bungalows.|$|R
50|$|The William Ogburn House is a {{historic}} ruin located north of East Peru, Iowa, United States. This 1½-story limestone structure is an early example of a vernacular farm house, and the only known saltbox residence known to exist in Madison County. It is attributed to David Harris who used innovative design variations that were not used by other local masons. The stone of the main facade is composed of finished cut <b>quarry</b> faced <b>stone</b> laid two against one with broken bond within courses. The other elevations are composed of rubble limestone. It also features quoins and jambs of finished cut <b>quarry</b> faced <b>stone.</b> The house suffered a fire so only the <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> remain. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.|$|R

40|$|Have {{you ever}} {{looked at a}} <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> and {{wondered}} where all the different rocks came from and what story each might tell? Some <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> are made of angular rocks, probably mined from a quarry. Others are made of rounded stones. Observing the differences in shape, size, color, mineralogy, and other characteristics of the <b>stones</b> in a <b>wall</b> can tell us {{a lot about the}} history of the stones and of the <b>wall.</b> <b>Stone</b> <b>wall</b> builders usually take advantage of the most readily available and, of course, best looking materials. Walls can be used to support a building or to hold back a hillside or as decorative landscaping (Fig. 1). Here in western Washington, many of the walls, such as those facing the buildings on the Capitol Campus, are built of angular <b>stones</b> <b>quarried</b> from the Wilkeson Sandstone near Tenino. In eastern Washington, many walls are made of basalt because of the abundance of that rock type there. A wide variety of metamorphic rocks can be found in the walls of north-central Washington...|$|R
