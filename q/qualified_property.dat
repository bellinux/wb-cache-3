60|$|If, therefore, {{the choice}} {{were to be}} made between Communism with all its chances and {{the present state of}} society with all its sufferings and injustices, all the difficulties, great or small, of Communism, would be but as dust in the balance. But, to make the {{comparison}} applicable, we must compare Communism at its best with the régime of individual property, not as it is, but as it might be made. The laws of property have never yet conformed to the principles on which the justification of private property rests. They have made property of things which never ought to be property, and absolute property where only a <b>qualified</b> <b>property</b> ought to exist. Private property, in every defense made of it, is supposed to mean the guarantee to individuals of the fruits of their own labor and abstinence. The guarantee to them of the fruits of the labor and abstinence of others, transmitted to them without any merit or exertion of their own, is not of the essence of the institution, but a mere incidental consequence, which, when it reaches a certain height, does not promote, but conflicts with the ends which render private property legitimate. To judge of the final destination of the institution of property, we must suppose everything rectified which causes the institution to work in a manner opposed to that equitable principle, of proportion between remuneration and exertion, on which, in every vindication of it that will bear the light, it is assumed to be grounded. We must also suppose two conditions realized, without which neither Communism nor any other laws or institutions could make the condition of the mass of mankind other than degraded and miserable. One of these conditions is, universal education; the other, a due limitation of the numbers of the community. With these, there could be no poverty, even under the present social institutions: and, these being supposed, the question of socialism is not, as generally stated by Socialists, a question of flying to the sole refuge against the evils which now bear down humanity, but a mere question of comparative advantages, which futurity must determine. We are too ignorant either of what individual agency in its best form, or socialism in its best form, can accomplish, to be qualified to decide which of the two will be the ultimate form of human society.|$|E

However, the IL methods are facing challenges to separate the hydrolyzed sugar products as well as the renewable ILs from the complex hydrolysis mixtures. In this study, an alumina column chromatography (ACC) method was developed for the separation of hydrophilic IL   N -methyl- N -methylimidazolium dimethyl phosphate ([Mmim][DMP]) and glucose, which was the main ingredient of the monosaccharide hydrolyzate. The processing parameters involved in ACC separation were investigated in detail.

40|$|Digital {{technology}} has radically disrupted the established ways of organising the film industry. However, digital initiatives such as {{marketing and distribution}} strategies involving social media and online distribution have also provided means through which filmmakers manage this environment. I investigate {{the role of the}} digital data involved, which I term Digital Engagement Metrics (DEMs), in market reconfiguration. Through exploratory, longitudinal case study of market construction for independent films, the thesis articulates the interdependent combination of attributes that co-constitute DEMs’ highly mobile, and multifaceted valuation capacities, and develops a conceptualisation of their role as a market device. I engage with the literature of translation, calculation, and the performativity and materiality of markets. I then develop an approach for tracing market activity to understand the interaction of networked agencies that shape the arrangement of economic transactions. My analysis is delivered in three empirical chapters, which provide rare data on the emergent digital practice of a film production company. I chart the progressive establishment of DEMs’ role in the hybridisation of established market attachment frameworks, and the instantiation of new modes of coordinating market actors. I conclude that the dynamic assembly, content and distributed architecture of market arrangements involving DEMs simultaneously shape the product and enable its calculation. In addition to extending the reach of market studies into a new empirical field, I make a number of contributions to the theoretical literature. My findings bring two coordinating kinds of performativity into focus. These are the creation of felicitous conditions required to mobilise DEMs as an organisational concept, and the digital materialisation of the audience both as the market, and as a <b>qualified</b> <b>property</b> of the market object. Reading DEMs through the market devices lens renders previously hidden modes of calculation visible, and this has implications for developing assemblage-oriented research in the creative industries...|$|E
