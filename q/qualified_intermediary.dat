The article provides the system of argumentation of the thesis that the use of mediation technologies helps to achieve the combination of the parties' autonomy and to guarantee a mutually beneficial result on a common ground. For this purpose the conflicting parties endow a third party with certain powers - the mediator, who is involved in order to look at the conflict from the side and help conflicting actors to get rid of excessive emotion and bias in a dispute. Thus, political mediation is a form of alternative expert and political dispute resolution and settlement, voluntarily elected by conflicting communities on the basis of their desire to reach agreement and political objectivity.

40|$|Addressing {{tax evasion}} and {{avoidance}} {{through use of}} tax havens {{has been the subject}} of a number of proposals in Congress and by the President. Actions by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G- 20 industrialized nations also have addressed this issue. In the 111 th Congress, the HIRE Act (P. L. 111 - 147) included several anti-evasion provisions, and P. L. 111 - 226 included foreign tax credit provisions directed at perceived abuses by U. S. multinationals. Numerous legislative proposals to address both individual tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance have been advanced. Multinational firms can artificially shift profits from high-tax to low-tax jurisdictions using a variety of techniques, such as shifting debt to high-tax jurisdictions. Because tax on the income of foreign subsidiaries (except for certain passive income) is deferred until income is repatriated (paid to the U. S. parent as a dividend), this income can avoid current U. S. taxes, perhaps indefinitely. The taxation of passive income (called Subpart F income) has been reduced, perhaps significantly, through the use of hybrid entities that are treated differently in different jurisdictions. The use of hybrid entities was greatly expanded by a new regulation (termed check-the-box) introduced in the late 1990 s that had unintended consequences for foreign firms. In addition, earnings from income that is taxed often can be shielded by foreign tax credits on other income. On average, very little tax is paid on the foreign source income of U. S. firms. Ample evidence of a significant amount of profit shifting exists, but the revenue cost estimates vary substantially. Evidence also indicates a significant increase in corporate profit shifting over the past several years. Recent estimates suggest losses that may approach, or even exceed, $ 100 billion per year. Individuals can evade taxes on passive income, such as interest, dividends, and capital gains, by not reporting income earned abroad. In addition, because interest paid to foreign recipients is not taxed, individuals can evade taxes on U. S. source income by setting up shell corporations and trusts in foreign haven countries to channel funds into foreign jurisdictions. There is no general third-party reporting of income as is the case for ordinary passive income earned domestically; the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relies on <b>qualified</b> <b>intermediaries</b> (QIs). In the past, these institutions certified nationality without revealing the beneficial owners. Estimates of the cost of individual evasion have ranged from $ 40 billion to $ 70 billion. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA; included in the HIRE Act, P. L. 111 - 147) introduced required information reporting by foreign financial intermediaries and withholding of tax if information is not provided. These provisions became effective only recently, and their consequences are not yet known. Most provisions to address profit shifting by multinational firms would involve changing the tax law: repealing or limiting deferral, limiting the ability of the foreign tax credit to offset income, addressing check-the-box, or even formula apportionment. President Obama’s proposals include a proposal to disallow overall deductions and foreign tax credits for deferred income, along with a number of other restrictions. Changes in the law or anti-abuse provisions have also been introduced in broader tax reform proposals. Provisions to address individual evasion include increased information reporting and provisions to increase enforcement, such as shifting the burden of proof to the taxpayer, increased penalties, and increased resources. Individual tax evasion is the main target of the HIRE Act, the proposed Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, and some other proposals...|$|R

40|$|Italian {{universities}} {{are going through}} a phase of strong competition to attract growing numbers of new undergraduates, which allows them to access related shares of public funds from the Ministry of University and Scientific Research. This urges the universities to pay attention not only to training quality, which is - together with research and scientific output - {{the core of the}} offer, but also to the design of innovative solutions in the field of peripheral services. Among them, the job placement service and connection with the world of work is the subject of increasing attention at several Italian universities. While companies and the labour market require direct contacts with the universities - delegated to act as <b>qualified</b> <b>intermediaries</b> of human resources - on the other hand, the same students expect not only education from university but also actions to guide them through the difficulties of access to employment and occupations. With placement service, universities have the opportunity to increase value provided to stakeholders, both in terms of broadening the number of services - adding peripheral activities to traditional ones – and in terms of support to the student beyond the obtainment of a degree. Value is a complex concept. In the field of service management it is defined as the gap between benefits and sacrifices perceived, related to the long term relationship between suppliers and clients and, more generally, between service companies and their stakeholders. Although the University holds the lead in organizing and designing the placement service, value is generated by all stakeholders - who benefit from positive network externalities proportional to the other stakeholders’ commitment. The placement service may be interpreted as an interface, a kind of relational infrastructure capable of maintaining and enhancing the stability of relationships, trust and collaboration between stakeholders. The University of Urbino Carlo Bo, students, businesses and local authorities create and receive value by belonging to the placement related network, each differently but interdependently. Value and quality are therefore strongly linked concepts: quality exists when internal and external customer expectations are met. The value derives from long-term comparison between benefits (functional, symbolic, temporal, economic, relational, psychological) and sacrifices connected to them. Quality, like value, depends not on only the offer, but also on demand behaviour. The offer plays a crucial role in understanding the stakeholders’ often unexpressed expectations and for designing, proposing, and delivering value through offer policies in line with demand expectations. This paper has a twofold objective: on the one hand to point out the concepts of quality and value, on the other hand to explain how university placement services can increase the value created for the various stakeholders of the University. For this purpose, we analyse the experience of the placement service of the University of Urbino "Carlo Bo" and the main initiatives set to bring together University students and companies looking for young people to hire. This study reveals that placement service at the University of Urbino is innovative in terms of organization and management. The involvement of all actors in design and implementation of the initiatives is a strategic factor, crucial for meeting the expectations of stakeholders, raising levels of quality and satisfaction and, ultimately, the value created. Although limited to only one case of placement – the University of Urbino, the research presents original features regarding the application of service management principles to an institution like the University, which is increasingly directed towards value creation for our stakeholders. This application appears necessary given that increased competition among universities is based not only on traditional core activities - research and training - but also on the ability to contribute to student employability after the obtainment of a degree...|$|R

40|$|Background Much of {{the debate}} around the science and {{technology}} of genetically modified (GM) crops has focussed on the policies and practices of national governments and international organisations or on the acceptability of GM products with consumers. Little work had been done with the primary users of such technologies – farmers. Further, the management of knowledge has become a significant issue for all {{sectors of the economy}} and yet little attention had again been given to farmers as a particular societal group of small to medium sized enterprises subject to ‘knowledge-based’ influences from many other societal groups. Aims and objectives This project investigated the attitudes, intentions and practices of farmers regarding the new technology of GM crops (both those with experience of them and those without) in relation to their social setting. The relationship building research approach we developed had three phases that used three different, and progressively more interactive, discussion and mapping techniques to engage with (often the same) participants. Telephone and face-to-face interviews with farmers, and a workshop with farmers and others involved in agriculture, helped: 1. Explore how farmers construct their understandings of GM crops through their interactions with others, in particular family members, neighbouring farmers, seed companies, farming advisors and the local community. 2. Ascertain the acceptability to farmers of recommended management practices for GM crops used in the Government sponsored Farm Scale Evaluations (FSEs). 3. Develop models of social learning systems appropriate to support individual farmers within informal social settings who decide to adopt contentious new technologies such as GM crops. Key findings Farmers’ understandings of GM crops as a new technology: Farmers view GM crops as a technology derived from new practices in plant breeding that build upon previous technologies and contribute to the running of the whole farm business. They are responding to them much as they would to any new technology, as a technology that provides improvements that are assessed for their value in practice by experimentation in the individual farm context. Farmers who had been involved in the FSEs, and those who had not, believed that GM crops offer clear economic and environmental benefits to themselves and the wider public. New technologies, such as GM crops are attractive to farmers as a way of reconciling conflicting demands to deliver high quality products at low cost and also to farm in an environmentally responsible way. Farmers’ acceptance of recommended management practices: The farmers involved in the FSEs had no problems following the recommended management practices and several could see ways in which to modify them to create benefits to themselves and to others if GM crops were licensed in the UK, in particular by using lower rates of herbicide. Farmers’ social learning systems and links to their communities: Farmers’ learning is dominated by informal learning, beyond any initial formal training, and this occurs through experimenting and the use of tacit knowledge arising from using new technologies in practice on their own farm. They also actively engage with other farmers (their network of practice) and many organisations that impact on their work (their community of influencers). That is, they draw on and exchange knowledge and experience from the range of people in their social environment. Farmers’ network of practice is widely distributed rather than being local while their community of influencers is complex, but relatively stable and consistent over time, and largely not local, although the degree of influence of individual members of the community may change. Some influence over practice is one-way (e. g. regulations that impose restrictions on what can be done) while some influences result from two-way negotiation (e. g. with agricultural advisers on agronomic matters). Key individuals within organisations in their community of influencers are often important, rather than simply the organisations themselves. Most farmers have to act individually at the boundary between their network of practice and community of influencers in order to find and exchange information and knowledge. For example, with the decline in public funding for the former Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) {{there is a lack of}} official people working at the boundary between farmers’ network of practice and other key communities of practice within a farmer’s community of influencers. Similarly, there is a less effective connection between both the scientific research occurring in the agricultural science community of practice and agricultural policy development occurring in government departments and agencies, with the day-to-day agricultural practices and long term plans of farmers. The value of our research approach: Farmers appreciated the use of a more participatory approach that sought the inclusion of their views, as users, into the broader conversations about new technologies. They also valued the interactive, relationship-building nature of the research approach. Dissemination of findings An integral part of the project has been the sharing of the outcomes of each phase of the study with the participants and with key stakeholders in the agricultural sector. A project website, project reports, conference papers, journal articles and an executive summary document are being used to disseminate the findings to different audiences. Implications for policy and practice Based on our findings there is a need for: • An enabling environment that is responsive to farmers’ needs, with clear, consistent and long-term policy signals about the future of agriculture, to allow them time to adapt to changing demands. • Improved connections between farmers and consumers. • Greater awareness amongst policy makers, regulators, scientists and the supermarkets, of what farmers can and cannot do. • Independent, trustworthy, sources of research and advice for farmers. • The valuing of farmers’ informal learning from experience, for example in the shaping of agricultural research. The following features are among those that would most improve the systems of support available to farmers in their decisions about new technologies: • horizon-scanning on behalf of farmers, to synthesise information, look at the potential of new technologies, and develop clear long-term directions for agriculture • government-sponsored <b>intermediaries</b> <b>qualified</b> in and knowledgeable about agriculture, to improve the links between government policies, scientific research and the grassroots...|$|R
