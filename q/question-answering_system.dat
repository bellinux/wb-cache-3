The first Prolog program, also written in 1972 and implemented in Marseille, was a French <b>question-answering</b> <b>system.</b> The use of Prolog as a practical programming language was given great momentum by the development of a compiler by David Warren in Edinburgh in 1977. [...] Experiments demonstrated that Edinburgh Prolog could compete with the processing speed of other symbolic programming languages such as Lisp. [...] Edinburgh Prolog became the de facto standard and strongly influenced the definition of ISO standard Prolog.|$|E

A language general enough to describe any reasonable question-answering subjects and express desired questions and answers. 2. The ability to search efficiently the stored information and recognize items {{that are relevant to}} a particular query. 3. The ability to derive an answer that is not stored explicitly, but that is derivable by the use of moderate effort from the stored facts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cortex is an {{automatic}} generic document summarization system. To select {{the most relevant}} sentences of a document, it uses an optimal decision algorithm that combines several metrics. The metrics processes, weighting and extract pertinence sentences by statistical and informational algorithms. This technique might improve a <b>Question-Answering</b> <b>system,</b> whose function is to provide an exact {{answer to a question}} in natural language. In this paper, we present the results obtained by coupling the Cortex summarizer with a <b>Question-Answering</b> <b>system</b> (QAAS). Two con gurations have been evaluated. In the rst one, a low compression level is selected and the summarization system is only used as a noise lter. In the second con guration, the system actually functions as a summarizer, with a very high level of compression. Our results on French corpus demonstrate that the coupling of Automatic Summarization system with a <b>Question-Answering</b> <b>system</b> is promising.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of saving various computational resources {{is an argument}} often advanced in favor of permitting <b>question-answering</b> <b>systems</b> to make occasional errors. In this paper we establish absolute bounds {{on the amount of}} memory savings that is achievable with a specified error level for certain types of <b>question-answering</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Question-answering</b> <b>systems</b> are treated as communication channels carrying information concerning the acceptable answers to an admissible set of queries. Shannon's rate-distortion theory is used to calculate bounds on the memory required for several question-answering tasks. For data retrieval, pattern-classification, and position-matching systems it was found that only small memory gains could be materialized from error-tolerance. In pair-ordering tasks on the other hand, more significant memory savings could be accomplished if small errorrates are tolerated. Similar limitations govern the tradeoffs between error and computation time. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a procedure for quantitative evaluation of interactive <b>question-answering</b> <b>systems</b> and illustrate it with {{application to the}} High-Quality Interactive <b>Question-Answering</b> (HITIQA) <b>system.</b> Our objectives were (a) to design a method to realistically and reliably assess interactive <b>question-answering</b> <b>systems</b> by comparing the quality of reports produced using different systems, (b) to conduct a pilot test of this method, and (c) to perform a formative evaluation of the HITIQA system. Far {{more important than the}} specific information gathered from this pilot evaluation is the development of (a) a protocol for evaluating an emerging technology, (b) reusable assessment instruments, and (c) the knowledge gained in conducting the evaluation. We conclude that this method, which uses a surprisingly small number of subjects and does not rely on predetermined relevance judgments, measures the impact of system change on work produced by users. Therefore this method can be used to compare the product of interactive systems that use different underlying technologies...|$|R

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to build the sets of clauses in {{definite}} clause grammar, which can express the phrasal and sentential semantics. We build these sets based on the semantic models of computational and inferential methods for analyzing the phrasal and sentential semantics in Vietnamese <b>Question-Answering</b> <b>System</b> Model (VietQASM), and implementation techniques for computing the semantics in Pham and Nguyen (Int J Simul Syst Sci Technol 17, 2016; A computational and inferential method for analyzing the semantics of phrase and sentence in Vietnamese <b>Question-Answering</b> <b>System</b> Model (VietQASM), 2015). We also present the technical novel, which expresses the process of creating the semantic expressions according to these models. Those semantic expressions will be used to make an event of data-knowledge base in the Vietnamese <b>Question-Answering</b> <b>System</b> (VietQAS). We built three sets of clauses: (1) the first set is used to define the semantic forms of lexicons, (2) the second set is used to compute and infer the semantics for phrases, (3) the third set is used to compute and infer the semantics for sentences. We only use all these sets for building a reading-comprehension mechanism for all statement sentences in the VietQAS.|$|E
