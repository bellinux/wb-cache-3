30|$|If {{the number}} of lifting <b>quay</b> <b>cranes</b> is reduced by 50 %, the peak-related costs are reduced by {{approximately}} 40 % (saving up to € 195, 000 per year).

40|$|Operational Research and Optimization are {{fundamental}} disciplines which, for decades, provided the real-world with tools for solving practical problems. Many such problems arise in container ports. Container terminals are important assets in modern economies. They constitute an important means of distributing goods made overseas to domestic markets in most countries. They are expensive {{to build and}} difficult to operate. We describe here {{some of the main}} operations which are faced daily by decision makers at those facilities. Decision makers often use Operational Research and Optimization tools to run these operations effectively. In this thesis, we focus on seaside operations which can be divided into three main problems: 1 - the Berth Allocation Problem (BAP), 2 - the <b>Quay</b> <b>Crane</b> Assignment Problem (QCAP), 3 - the <b>Quay</b> <b>Crane</b> Scheduling Problem (QCSP). Each one of the above is a complex optimization problem in its own right. However, solving them individually without the consideration of the others may lead to overall suboptimal solutions. For this reason we will investigate the pairwise combinations of these problems and their total integration In addition, several important factors that affected on the final solution. The main contributions of this study are modelling and solving of the: 1 - Robust berth allocation problem (RBAP) : a new efficient mathematical model is formulated and a hybrid algorithm based on Branch-and-Cut and the Genetic Algorithm is used to find optimal or near optimal solutions for large scale instances in reasonable time. 2 - <b>Quay</b> <b>crane</b> assignment and <b>quay</b> <b>crane</b> scheduling problem (QCASP) : a new mathematical model is built to simultaneously solve QCASP and a heuristic based on the Genetic Algorithm is developed to find solutions to realistic instances in reasonable time. 3 - Berth allocation, <b>quay</b> <b>crane</b> assignment and <b>quay</b> <b>crane</b> scheduling problem (BACASP) : an aggregate model for all three seaside operations is proposed and to solve realistic instances of the problem, an adapted variant of the Genetic Algorithm is implemented.
