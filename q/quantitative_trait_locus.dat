40|$|Phenotypic {{variation}} for <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> {{results from}} the simultaneous segregation of alleles at multiple <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci.</b> Understanding the genetic architecture of <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> begins with mapping <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> to broad genomic regions and ends with the molecular definition of <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> alleles.

50|$|A <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>locus</b> (QTL) is {{a section}} of DNA (the locus) which {{correlates}} with variation in a phenotype (the quantitative trait). Usually the QTL is linked to, or contains, the genes which control that phenotype. QTLs are mapped by identifying which molecular markers (such as SNPs or AFLPs) correlate with an observed trait. This is often an early step in identifying and sequencing the actual genes that cause the trait variation.|$|E

50|$|A <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>locus</b> (QTL) is {{a region}} of DNA which is {{associated}} with a particular phenotypic trait, which varies in degree and which can be attributed to polygenic effects, i.e., the product of two or more genes, and their environment. These QTLs are often found on different chromosomes. The number of QTLs which explain variation in the phenotypic trait indicates the genetic architecture of a trait. It may indicate that plant height is controlled by many genes of small effect, or by a few genes of large effect.|$|E
50|$|For example, using MAS {{to select}} {{individuals}} with disease resistance involves identifying a marker allele that is linked with disease resistance {{rather than the}} level of disease resistance. The assumption is that the marker associates at high frequency with the gene or <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>locus</b> (QTL) of interest, due to genetic linkage (close proximity, on the chromosome, of the marker locus and the disease resistance-determining locus). MAS can be useful to select for traits that are difficult or expensive to measure, exhibit low heritability and/or are expressed late in development.

40|$|A granddaughter {{design was}} used to locate <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> {{determining}} conformation and functional traits in dairy cattle. In this granddaughter design, consisting of 20 Holstein Friesian grandsires and 833 sons, genotypes were determined for 277 microsatellite markers covering the whole genome. Breeding values for 27 traits, regarding conformation (18), fertility (2), birth (4), workability (2), and udder health (1), were evaluated in an across-family analysis using multimarker regression. Significance thresholds were determined using a permutation test. The across-family analysis suggested the presence of 61 <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> when 27 (i. e., one for each trait) were expected by chance. The test statistic exceeded the genomewise significance threshold for the following traits and chromosomes: chest width on chromosome 2; gestation length on chromosome 4; stature, body capacity, and size on chromosome 5; dairy character on chromosome 6; angularity on chromosome 12; fore udder attachment on chromosome 13; and fore udder attachment and front teat placement on chromosome 19.

40|$|Given {{that the}} {{evidence}} of a substantial genetic contribution to cognitive ability is now convincing, the next challenge is to locate and identify the genes involved. It is likely that there are several genes, each of only small effect. Detection of such so-called <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> contributing to polygenic traits in plants and animals is facilitated by the ability to carry out experimental crosses. However, in humans detection of <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> depends on studies of siblings or other relative pairs or on allelic association studies aimed at detecting linkage disequilibrium in populations.

50|$|A <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>locus</b> (QTL) {{refers to}} a suite of genes that {{controls}} a quantitative trait. A quantitative trait {{is one that is}} influenced by several different genes as opposed to just one or two. QTLs are analyzed using Qst. Qst looks at the relatedness of the traits in focus. In the case of QTLs, clines are analyzed by Qst. A cline (biology) is a change in allele frequency across a geographical distance. This change in allele frequency causes a series of intermediate varying phenotypes that when associated with certain environmental conditions can indicate selection. This selection causes local adaptation, but high gene flow is still expected to be present along the cline.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{the first}} step is to map the gene or <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>locus</b> (QTL) of {{interest}} first by using different techniques and then using this information for marker assisted selection. Generally, the markers to be used should be close to gene of interest (<5 recombination unit or cM) in order to ensure that only minor fraction of the selected individuals will be recombinants. Generally, not only a single marker but rather two markers are used in order to reduce the chances of an error due to homologous recombination. For example, if two flanking markers are used at same time with an interval between them of approximately 20cM, there is higher probability (99%) for recovery of the target gene.|$|E
50|$|Suitable {{candidate}} {{genes are}} generally {{selected based on}} known biological, physiological, or functional relevance to the disease in question. This approach is limited by its reliance on existing knowledge about known or theoretical biology of disease. However, more recently developed molecular tools are allowing insight into disease mechanisms and pinpointing potential regions {{of interest in the}} genome. Genome-wide association studies and <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>locus</b> (QTL) mapping examine common variation across the entire genome, and as such can detect a new region of interest that is in or near a potential candidate gene. Microarray data allow researchers to examine differential gene expression between cases and controls, and can help pinpoint new potential genes of interest.|$|E

40|$|<b>Quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> {{affecting}} milk yield, health, {{and type}} traits were studied for seven large U. S. Holstein grandsire families using the granddaughter design.

Effects of marker alleles were analyzed for 30 traits (21 type traits, 5 milk traits, 2 calving ease traits, and somatic cell score and productive life) and 16 canonical traits derived from type and production traits. Previously we reported results from 36 of these markers but have re-evaluated those results using a more robust analysis method. We report results from all 70 markers using permutation tests to calculate experiment-wise significance values, replacing the less stringent comparison-wise values previously reported. With this new methodology we detected 9 putative <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> <b>loci</b> within specific families. Four markers were associated with effects on type traits on chromosomes 4, 5, 14, and 23. Two markers were associated with effects on protein percentage on chromosomes 6 and 14, and 3 markers were associated with effects on productive life on chromosomes 2, 21, and 23.
