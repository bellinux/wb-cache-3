5|$|Treatment in {{the first}} stage aims for an optimal trade off between symptom control and {{treatment}} side-effects. The start of levodopa treatment may be postponed by initially using other medications such as MAO-B inhibitors and dopamine agonists instead, in the hope of delaying the onset of complications due to levodopa use. However, levodopa is still the most effective treatment for the motor symptoms of PD and should not be delayed in patients whose <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> impaired by those symptoms. Levodopa-related dyskinesias correlate more strongly with duration and severity of the disease than duration of levodopa treatment, so delaying this therapy may not really provide much longer dyskinesia-free time than early use.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the actor and partner effects of stigma that was perceived by people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) and caregivers on <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> at the dyadic level. A survey was conducted among 148 dyads consisting of one PLWHA and one caregiver (296 participants) in Nanning, China. The interdependent relationship between a pair of dyadic members that influences the associations between stigma and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> analyzed, using an innovative dyadic analysis technique: the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM). We found in this dyadic analysis that (1) PLWHAs compared to their caregivers exhibited a higher level of perceived HIV stigma and lower level <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> measured in four domains; (2) both PLWHAs' and caregivers' perceived HIV stigma influenced their own <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life; (3) The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>was</b> not substantially influenced by their partners' perceived stigma; and (4) Both actor and partner effects <b>of</b> stigma on <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>were</b> similar among PLWHAs and their caregivers.

25|$|In {{diagnosing}} suspected dysplasia, {{the x-ray}} {{to evaluate the}} internal state of the joints is usually combined with {{a study of the}} animal and how it moves, to confirm whether its <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> being affected.

25|$|If {{the impact}} of {{symptoms}} of osteoarthritis on <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> significant and more conservative management is ineffective, joint replacement surgery or resurfacing may be recommended. Evidence supports joint replacement for both knees and hips as it is both clinically effective, and cost-effective.

25|$|The {{standard}} {{surgical treatment}} for severe GERD is the Nissen fundoplication.

25|$|Whether or not aging {{directly}} affects women's sexual functioning during menopause {{is another}} area of controversy. However, many studies, including Hayes and Dennerstein's critical review, have demonstrated that aging has a powerful impact on sexual function and dysfunction in women, specifically {{in the areas of}} desire, sexual interest, and frequency of orgasm. In addition, Dennerstien and colleagues found that the primary predictor of sexual response throughout menopause is prior sexual functioning. This means {{that it is important to}} understand how the physiological changes in men and women can affect their sexual desire. Despite the seemingly negative impact that menopause can have on sexuality and sexual functioning, sexual confidence and well-being can improve with age and menopausal status. Furthermore, the impact that a relationship status can have on <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> often underestimated.|$|E

Results: In non-fractured women with PMO, QUALEFFO total scores and subscales were higher than those with osteopenia and normal BMD. In women with PMO, a positive correlation was found between QUALEFFO total scores, and age, Body Mass İndex (BMI), parity and duration of menopause, and a negative correlation between QUALEFFO total scores, and level of education, economical status and femur neck BMD scores.
