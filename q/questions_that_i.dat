60|$|The <b>Questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{circulated}} were as follows; {{there was}} an earlier and uncomplete form, which I need not reproduce here.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not go away, friend," [...] I {{said to the}} jailer, who {{was trying}} to depart while my back was turned. [...] "I have <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would ask you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why ask <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't answer? See here, Mary Louise: it isn't wise, or even safe, {{for me to}} {{tell you}} {{anything}} just yet. What I know frightens me--even me! Can't you wait and--trust me?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "This Is The Sort Of <b>Question</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Am Usually Afraid to Ask" [...] - 4:22 ...|$|R
60|$|The first <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> put, as {{we drove}} from the station to the house, related {{naturally}} to her father.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is out of}} the <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should let}} you walk all the way here from Allington and all the way back without taking something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And any <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may ask you, I ask {{altogether}} on {{his behalf}}--on his behalf {{and on that}} of his wife, Lady Fitzgerald. I tell you, {{that you may have}} no scruples as to answering me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Edward's eyes sparkled, and {{his color}} rose. [...] "You must change this tone, fellow, and that speedily," [...] he observed. [...] "I order you {{to lower your}} hand, and answer the <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall put to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I--I don't {{just like}} to," [...] replied Peter. [...] "I've asked him so many <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am afraid he'll think me a nuisance. I tell you what, Jimmy, you ask him!" [...] Peter's eyes brightened {{as he said}} this.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} girl slowly. [...] "But can you not {{see that it is}} out of the <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should entrust you with this commission?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "None at all," [...] Wrayson declared. [...] "But, Colonel! {{there is}} one more <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must ask you. Did Louise speak to you about her brother?" ...|$|R
60|$|The wonder in her glance {{increased}} and asked a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could not answer. I stretched forward, and caught {{one of the}} hands lying idle in her lap.|$|R
60|$|Brought {{into the}} {{presence}} of the Jumjum, who graciously saluted me, I was seated on a beautiful rug and told in broken English by an interpreter who had escaped from Kansas that I was at liberty to ask any <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> chose.|$|E
60|$|My {{mother was}} overjoyed at seeing me so soon again, even though I aroused her from sleep {{to open the}} door, and asked so many <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could do no less than tell her all which had {{happened}} since I last saw her.|$|E
60|$|The {{truth is}} that we do this thing so {{differently}} over in America that I was for the time being completely thrown off my bearings. The <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had every right to expect after many years of American and Canadian interviews failed to appear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pray remember," [...] he said coldly, [...] "that it {{was through}} such an {{apparently}} trivial <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> found out Why Paul Ferroll Killed His Wife, and What Happened to Jones!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's a {{beautiful}} name," [...] Longueville rejoined; [...] "but I may say, {{in answer to}} your <b>question,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am not struck {{with the fact that}} her face corresponds to it." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{there were}} no further {{witnesses}} for the prosecution I cross-examined these two at full length, but absolutely without results, since every vital <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> asked was met with a direct negative.|$|R
6000|$|... "You forget we are {{now trying}} these Stewarts," [...] he replied, with great significance. [...] "If we should ever come to be trying you, {{it will be very}} different; and I shall press these very <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am now willing to glide upon. But to resume: I have it here in Mr. Mungo Campbell's {{precognition}} that you ran immediately up the brae. How came that?" ...|$|E
60|$|VERNON. You see, dear, {{it might}} hurt them, coming from me. It would seem like ingratitude. Mrs. Bennet--Why, it wasn't till I {{began to ask}} <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> grasped {{the fact that she}} WASN'T my real mother. As for old Bennet, ever since my father died--well, I hardly know how I could have got on without him. It was Charles Bennet that taught me to ride; I learned my letters sitting on Jane's lap.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not ask me, Macumazahn," [...] he gasped. [...] "You {{white men}} are very clever, but you don't quite know everything. There are {{men in the}} world who can make people believe they see things which they do not see. Let us be going while we may, for when those Umtetwas have got over their fright, they will come back to loot the waggons, and then perhaps they will begin asking <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't answer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will {{attribute}} nothing evil to you, Mr. Longstaff. Only it {{is quite}} out of the <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should--respond as I suppose you wish me to; and therefore, pray, do not say anything further." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Baron de Grost," [...] he said, [...] "you {{have been}} very kind to me since I have had the {{pleasure}} of your acquaintance. I hope you will not ask me any <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot answer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By heavens, no! You {{have not}} {{answered}} me the one <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have asked you. You {{have not given}} me the only reason which I would take,--even for a while. Can you love me, Marion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would say}} that I had come from Syria, and sailed from Acre in a trader, which is {{perfectly}} true, and also that I {{was taken off the}} ship I was on by a galley--which would not be altogether false, as I crossed one as I landed. I think there would be very little questioning, for I should pretend to be in a state of sullen despair, and give such short answers to <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should soon be left alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Married. Married! ... Well, {{that being}} so," [...] he added, quite calmly, tearing the licence slowly into halves {{and putting them}} in his pocket; [...] "that being prevented, I should like to do some good {{to you and your}} husband, whoever he may be. There are many <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am tempted to ask, but I will not do so, of course, in {{opposition}} to your wishes. Though, if I could know your husband, I might more easily benefit him and you. Is he on this farm?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{have had}} a trying month, unusually damp close weather, and {{influenza}} has been prevalent. Many boys had it, one little fellow died. He was very delirious at last, and as he lay day and night on my bed we had often to hold him. But one night he was calm and sensible, and with Henry Tagalana's help I obtained from him such a simple answer or two to our <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt justified in baptizing him. He was about ten years old, I suppose one of our youngest.|$|E
6000|$|... "Everything {{depends upon}} your being honest with me," [...] she continued. [...] "You will see from my <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> know. Was there not {{something}} said about supper at your rooms {{before or after}} the dance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is of {{very little}} {{consequence}} {{to you to}} know that," [...] said Forester, [...] "but I {{want to ask you}} a little more about the affair. Are you willing to answer any <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> may ask?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Holmes. [...] "I may say {{in answer}} to your {{original}} <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have not cleared my mind entirely {{on the subject of}} this case, but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have every hope of reaching some conclusion. It would be premature to say more." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{regards the}} first question, I have no {{hesitation}} in answering it {{in a manner}} favourable to Communism. It {{is clear that the}} present inequalities of wealth are unjust. In part, they may be defended as affording an incentive to useful industry, but I do not think this defence will carry us very far. However, I have argued this question before in my book on Roads to Freedom, and I will not spend time upon it now. On this matter, I concede the Bolshevik case. It is the other two <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish to discuss.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mind telling you," [...] {{said the}} King, [...] "of my own free will, {{and not in}} answer to any <b>questions,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{do not know where}} I am going. I am a King, as you may have noticed, and I have been banished from my kingdom for a year. I am now going to look into the {{government}} of other countries in order that I may find out what it is that is wrong in my own kingdom. Every thing goes badly, and there is something very faulty at the bottom of it all. What this is I want to discover." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found the}} little {{lady in a}} small room opening from the parlor, and also, to my great surprise, I found her {{extremely}} talkative and chatty. She asked me so many <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had little chance to answer them, and she told me a great deal more about Walford and its people and citizens than I had learned during my nine months' residence in the village. I was very glad to give her an opportunity of talking, which was a pleasure, I imagined, she did not often enjoy; but as I saw no signs of her stopping, I was obliged to rise and take leave of her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should in}} her place. It {{is out of}} the <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should be here, and not go to her. It would be monstrous. I will wait till they have done lunch, and then I will go up." ...|$|R
6000|$|Being quite {{unprepared}} for the reply, I received it with a sufficiently awkward 'Indeed! Dear me!' Presently I added, 'Do you--' I {{was going to say}} 'live there,' but it seemed so absurd a <b>question,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> substituted 'live near here?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} {{out of the}} <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should worry Captain Esmond now," [...] he said. [...] "Unless you are {{prepared}} to make an unconditional surrender, which I should strongly recommend, there is nothing I can do for you." ...|$|R
