" Such an information flow mainly relies on a database, which stores all the information about ISO 9000 certification requested by a desired company.

We treat first the case of architecture design activity because it's the basis of the software development process. Our framework enables on the one hand to describe best practices {{and on the other hand}} to check their application by designers. We present an implementation of our framework in the Eclipse platform and for an ADL dedicated to Web applications.

During the ASPIRE trial (the first multi-centered, randomized trial with large enrollment), the survival to hospital discharge rates decreased from 9.9% with manual CPR to approximately 5%. Because of these findings, the ethics review board terminated the study. However, some researchers question {{the validity of the}} ASPIRE protocol. The CIRC study results additionally indicate that the AutoPulse increases the time before first defibrillation and decrease the average compressions per minute in comparison with manual CPR. Overall, the study shows no improvement over high <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> CPR.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{no longer}} specifies {{that the organization}} shall issue and maintain documented procedures, however ISO 9001:2015 requires the organization to document any other procedures required for its effective operation. The standard also requires the organization to issue and communicate a documented quality policy, a <b>Quality</b> <b>Manual</b> (which {{may or may not}} include documented procedures) and numerous records, as specified throughout the standard. New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction (section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard’s requirements are being met, while the external auditor’s role is to determine the quality management system's effectiveness. More detailed interpretation and implementation examples are often sought by organizations seeking more information in what can be a very technical area.|$|E
40|$|During a {{software}} process improvement program, {{the current state}} of software development processes is being assessed and improvement actions are being determined. However, these improvement actions are based on process models obtained during interviews and document studies, e. g. <b>quality</b> <b>manuals.</b> Such improvements are scarcely based on the practical way of working in an organization; they do not take into account shortcuts made due to e. g. time pressure. Becoming conscious about the presence of such deviations and understanding their causes and impacts, consequences for particular software process improvement activities in a particular organization could be proposed.

40|$|It is {{essential}} that medical equipment manufacturers provide high quality service documentation for their products. Without it, the maintenance and repair of equipment becomes difficult and inefficient for biomedical engineering departments. Due to the key role documentation plays in their daily work, biomeds expect high <b>quality</b> <b>manuals</b> covering issues such as equipment installation, maintenance, troubleshooting and repair. A survey of 40 biomeds in the US and UK confirms that service manuals {{play a key role}} in troubleshooting equipment failures. It also showed that 65 % of respondents rate service manuals on average as good rather than very good and indicated a number of areas which manufacturers can improve in their documentation, including diagrams and troubleshooting flowcharts. These results have strong implications for medical manufacturers—there are a number of issues that need to be improved in order to make documentation more effecti...|$|R

50|$|In 2007, FSI matched a $248,000 {{grant from}} the New York City Department of Small Business with $300,000 of its own {{investment}} to provide specialized training to its employees. In 2008, a quality professional was briefly employed to train employees in quality and introduce ISO quality and prepare a <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> for the company. Sadly enough, the company {{was not prepared to}} accept the role of quality and profit was the only concern. The training course described herein was completed after the release of this professional. Seventy-five members of the FSI team completed a year-long course in subjects such as quality control, customer service, packaging, lean manufacturing, assembly, safety and warehousing. In light of its success for both FSI and New York, the program was renewed in 2009, with an expanded curriculum that added instruction in ESL and mathematics. They are recognized as a Made In NYC company, as they fully manufacture several of their product lines (including electric cooktops and blanket warmers) in their Bronx facilities. In 2014, they were recognized as one of NYC's leading employers in proactively hiring veterans.|$|E

A brief description of the areas which are important for the establishment and the maintenance of a certified or of an uncertified quality management system will follow. In the second part, the quality management system of an electrical engineering company is presented first, followed by the presentation of a chosen construction company.

40|$|This report {{describe}} {{about the}} development of MS ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> and system procedure for FKM laboratory, University Malaysia Pahang (UMP). This report consists of five chapters which are Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Results and Conclusion. The objectives of this project are study and identify the clauses of MS ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 and develop the <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> and system procedure according to the standard requirement for FKM laboratory. Studies and understanding the clauses is important before developing the <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> and system procedure. This standard is divided to two main requirements which are management requirement and technical requirement. The management requirement of this standard is similar with the requirement of ISO 9001. The requirement of ISO 9001 was being studies. A workshop of MS ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005 was being attended to understand more clear on the clauses and some important information to develop the <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> and system procedure. After that, one of the accredited MS ISO/IEC 17025 laboratories has been chosen to visit. It was also to understand more deep in developing the <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> and system procedure; and ensures that the <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> and system procedure is developing in the right path. The <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> is developing as the policy and objective of the laboratory. The system procedure will been develop as a procedure to achieve the objective of the <b>quality</b> <b>manual.</b> The forms are creating as an evidence to support the requirements of the standard. The <b>quality</b> <b>manual</b> had been developed from clause 4. 9 to clause 4. 15 which is clauses of management requirement of the standard. The system procedure also had been developed for each of the clauses except the clause 4. 10 improvement. This clause not required any system procedure because this clause had related with the entire clause to ensure that the quality management system is continual improve. Some of the form had been created such as Non-Conforming Investigation Form, Corrective and Preventive Action Form. The schedule for the internal audit and management review had been developed. The audit checklist had been created for the auditor use during the audit process. All the documents will be proposed to FKM laboratory for the accreditation of MS ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005. In conclusion, the objective of the project had been achieved where the entire related document had been developed...|$|E

In order to obtain a diagnosis of the current situation and estimate the fulfillment of the established norms, an Internal Audit is executed. In addition, a Process Map is prepared once local procedures are evaluated, allowing to determine the existence of correlations inside the unit.
