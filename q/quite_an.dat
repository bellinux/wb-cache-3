5|$|Evaluative {{conditioning}} {{suggests that}} if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of classical conditioning in which we come to like or dislike something through an association. Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the cocktail party effect, {{it could be that}} the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning. Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese kanji) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.|$|E

25|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that this region went through <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> intricate prehistory, {{so much so that}} it is difficult to move about amongst the muddle of peoples that have followed each other.
