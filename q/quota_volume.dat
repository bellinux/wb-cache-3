50|$|A TRQ {{combines}} two {{policy instruments}} that nations historically {{have used to}} restrict imports: quotas and tariffs. In a TRQ, the quota component works together with a specified tariff level to provide the desired degree of import protection. Essentially, a TRQ is a two-tiered tariff. The first Q imports entering within the quota portion of a TRQ are usually subject to a lower, tariff rate called the Inside tariff quota rate or ITQR. Imports above the quota's quantitative threshold (Q) face a much higher (usually prohibitive) Outside tariff quota rate or OTQR. The Q units are called the <b>quota</b> <b>volume,</b> and this volume serves as the cut off between the ITQR and the OTQR.|$|E
40|$|The {{negotiation}} of improved market access in agriculture {{is crucial to}} the success of the Doha Round. The depth of tariff cuts will be the main indication of the level of ambition of the agricultural talks and hence the Round as a whole. Agricultural tariffs remain five times higher than tariffs in industrial goods, and account for the bulk of the distortions in agricultural trade. Recent analysis indicates that 92 percent of the global gains from trade liberalization in agriculture result from removing market access barriers. The July Framework reaffirmed the objective of substantial improvements in market access. This is to be accomplished by a single approach, a tiered (or banded) formula for tariff cuts, with the higher tariff rates being subject to the highest cuts. Negotiations have centered on how many bands to select, where to place the thresholds, and how progressive to make the band-specific reductions. The issue of whether to impose a tariff cap was left undecided in the Framework Agreement. Tariff caps have the advantage of reducing tariffs that are so high that they are little different from an import ban. If the cap is set at a low enough level, real trade improvements may follow. The Framework Agreement specifies that each Member may identify in the schedule a number of products as "Sensitive Products. " However, analysis has shown that even exempting as little as two percent of tariff lines from formula based cuts would substantially reduce the expected gains from market access improvements. This points up the need for significant increases in TRQs for Sensitive Products to achieve significant improvements in market access. All tariff lines subject to TRQs, whether or not they are classified as Sensitive Products, should be subject to <b>quota</b> <b>volume</b> expansion. Improving the administration of TRQs and reducing in-quota tariffs are both important objectives for the Doha Round. There is considerable scope to improve the efficiency and transparency of quota regimes. The continued availability of the Special Safeguard for Agriculture by WTO members "remains under negotiation. " But abuse of such a safeguard in order to protect domestic producers thwarts the objective of improved market access. Some limitations will need to be introduced if the safeguard is to be continued under the new agreement. The Framework Agreement emphasizes that Special and Differential Treatment is to be an integral part of the market access outcome. This can be ensured by several provisions. Developing countries can specify a number of products as Special Products, based on criteria of food security, livelihood security and rural development needs. The difficulty is in devising concrete criteria for selecting these products. The Framework Agreement also endorses the creation of a Special Safeguard Mechanism for developing countries. Tariff cuts in the Doha Round can erode the value of preferences and can have important consequences for some countries. Preference-granting countries could offset the declining value of those preferences either through financial transfers or additional market access for all products from the current preferred exporters. Least Developed Countries (LDCs) should not be required to undertake any reduction commitments, though they might wish to do so for their own economic advantage. Developed countries should provide duty- and quota-free access to LDCs to encourage full integration into the trade system. International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the options for}} liberalizing tariff-rate quotas when a marketing board controls domestic production and international prices are stochastic. Lowering over-quota tariff and increasing import <b>quota</b> <b>volumes</b> are not equivalent. The trade-offs between {{the two types of}} trade reforms are examined through numerical simulations for the Canadian chicken industry. Introducing world price variability results in a distribution of welfare impacts for the different groups in the industry. Consumers and processors gain more with tariff liberalization than with increased import quotas. The difference in producer surplus between liberalization regimes is truncated so that producers only see down-side risk under the tariff liberalization regime.

5000|$|The Special Agricultural Safeguard (SSG) is {{provision}} in the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. The SSG allows Member countries to impose additional tariffs on agricultural products if their import volume exceeds defined trigger levels, or if prices fall below specified trigger levels. Its purpose is to prevent disruption of domestic markets due to import surges or abnormally low import prices. The SSG applies only to products that are (1) subject to tarrification and (2) {{in cases where the}} country has designated a productas eligible for the SSG in its Schedule of Commitments. It can apply only to imports that exceed tariff-rate <b>quota</b> <b>volumes.</b> The SSG is an alternative to the general safeguard provision of the GATT and is easier to invoke because it does not require a test of injury or threat of injury. In the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations, the United States, the Cairns Group, and many developing countries have proposed elimination of the SSG.|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} study is to analyze welfare effects of Japan’s rice import quota focusing on the simultaneous buy and sell (SBS) of the rice importation minimum access (MA) policy. Based on the utility function specified in this study, the constructed model is adopted to measure consumption patterns through estimating elasticity of substitution between imported rice and Japan’s domestic rice, and consumers’ preference parameters for different kinds of rice. The results showed that Japanese households prefer domestic rice to the imported rice. Besides, three scenarios of adjusting rice <b>quota</b> <b>volumes</b> were carried out to examine the changes in consumer prices of imported rice and Japanese consumers’ welfares. The results revealed that tariff equivalents of the SBS import quota almost doubled the scale of the mark-up, and the intervention by the Ministry of Agriculture of Japan did cause non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs). Finally, if the SBS rice quota quantity was fixed at or larger than 180 thousand tons every fiscal year, the consumer prices of imported rice in Japan’s market would decrease to be less than the prices of Japan’s domestic rice, and therefore the imported rice would have more price advantages in this scenario...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} two issues: (i) {{the extent}} of the restrictiveness/effectiveness of the Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) with respect to the developing country suppliers of textile products during the 1980 s, and (ii) {{the extent to which these}} restrictions yield trade gains for the less established developing suppliers. After analyzing data, the author's made the following conclusions. Rather than ease up, the MFA became more restrictive. Proportionately more shipments were subject to <b>quotas</b> and <b>volume</b> generally grew less where quotas were binding. The unit value of shipments subject to binding quotas also increased substantially more than the unit value of unconstrained items. Developing countries that were new exporters of textile products also hoped to capture a larger share of the textile market as a result of quotas for other developing countries. However, the needy countries have benefited little from the MFA, and countries whose exports grow soon find themselves on the restricted list. Finally, domestic producers in the United States have benefited most from the MFA.

40|$|The {{development}} of the Estonian fisheries and fishing rights during the post-Soviet period is discussed. In {{order to deal with}} excessive fishing capacity, a part of the fishing rights, both <b>volume</b> <b>quotas</b> and gear-use rights, in all Estonian fisheries will be allocated each year through auctions while the remainder will be allocated {{on the basis of the}} history of the use of recent fishing rights. This was done for the first time in 2001. All fishing rights depreciate from year to year in a geometric fashion, by 10 % yearly.

40|$|International audienceThe {{regulation}} of water use and water management has evolved considerably in recent years. The evolution of water regulatory systems includes {{the design of}} new management policies, which could benefit from ex-ante comparative impact assessments with regard to those of current or past practices. To this aim, the MAELIA project develops an integrated modelling and simulation platform {{for the assessment of}} alternative water management policies, especially during low-water crisis in the Adour-Garonne basin (South-West region of France). The development of such an integrated assessment and modelling platform requires the consideration and integration of many entities and processes involved in the system under consideration - water resources and flows, agricultural structures and activities, state and evolution of land cover and land use, etc. This article focuses on the formal representation of two alternative options regarding the choice of water withdrawal policy, which are likely to have considerable impacts on the whole socio-hydro-system s: management by rate of flow (currently applied); and management by <b>volume</b> <b>quotas</b> (alternative to be assessed). Furthermore, the article presents a conceptual framework for the integrated modelling of such social-ecological systems together with graphical notations for models' representation...|$|R
40|$|From the mid- 60 s to the mid- 80 s {{there has}} been a gradual but {{fundamental}} change in the nature of trade protection. International trade has become increasingly restricted by quotas and other nontariff barriers, as the level of tariffs have fallen and governments have devised other forms of protection for sectors facing increased foreign competition. The paper shows such non-tariff barriers have very different effects and implications from tariff for the welfare outcome of a regional integration agreement. Indeed, binding quotas, differently from tariffs, succeed to preserve the trade volumes {{with the rest of the}} world, and lead to welfare improving customs unions and free trade areas since trade between the partners is not expanded at the expense of trade with the outside world. By relating the existence of welfare enhancing regional integration to the systematic change in the type of trade policy conducted by most countries, this paper emphasizes that the desirability of piecemeal reforms has increased through time and justifies a renewed and grown policy interest in preferential trade in the 90 s, when NTBs had a greater weight in trade policies. This can contribute to explain the spurt of regionalism observed in the data. Regional Integration Agreements, Tariffs, <b>Volume</b> <b>quotas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Integration of Polish {{agriculture}} {{is recognized as}} a success. Nevertheless some remarkable difficulties have emerged. Some of them are related to low production quotas in dairy, sugar and starch sectors. Authors of this Poster argue {{that the level of}} starch quota inscribed for Poland is incompatible with the principle of fair competition on the inner EU market. The quota ceiling of mere 145 thousand tons is a heavy constraint to the processing plants – their total processing capacities are estimated for some 220 - 260 thousand tons. Therefore, they are utilized in c. 56 - 66 %, leading to the increase of unit costs of starch production of about 9, 2 % and decrease of the competitiveness. Another point is the ratio of the <b>quota</b> to the <b>volume</b> of harvests: 0, 1121 for Denmark, 0, 057 for Germany and (only) 0, 0131 for Poland. Furthermore, the domestic consumption of starch products in Poland is two-fold bigger than the quota with resultant increase of importation. Paradoxically, such practices are pronounced in spite of unutilized natural resources of Polish agriculture – high proportion of light soils. The temporary solution is to increase the quota – the long-run one is to rethink the concept of quota system – under the new CAP reform.

40|$|Some {{species of}} marine {{phytoplankton}} {{are believed to}} be more tolerant of high concentrations of trace metals than others, but no conclusive test of this hypothesis has been conducted. Eleven species of phytoplankton representing 5 classes were grown in Aquil medium containing Cd$ sp{ 2 +}$ concentrations between 10 $ sp{- 9. 85 }$ and 10 $ sp{- 6. 84 }$ M. Growth rates and intracellular concentrations of Cd, C, N and S were measured. Cadmium <b>quotas</b> (mol Cd/litre-cell <b>volume)</b> were lower in members of Bacillariophyceae than in Chlorophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Dinophyceae and Cyanophyceae (ANOVA, p $<$ 0. 001). Cellular C:S molar ratios decreased in phytoplankton grown at high (pCd 7. 37 - 6. 84) compared to low Cd (no added Cd), as S/litre-cell volume increased. Similar results were observed for C:N molar ratios. In two species that were examined, C:S ratios decreased as a linear function of increasing Cd concentration. Mean Cd$ sp{ 2 +}$ concentration that reduced growth rate to 50 % of maximum (pCd$ sp{ 50 }) $ was not significantly different among phytoplankton classes (ANOVA, p $<$ 0. 05). When these experimental data were combined with pCd$ sp{ 50 }$s calculated from published sources, Chlorophyceae were found to be the most resistant class (ANOVA, p $<$ 0. 01). Cadmium and Cu resistance (pCd$ sp{ 50 }$ and pCu$ sp{ 50 }) $ were correlated (r = 0. 52, p $<$ 0. 05), suggesting co-tolerance of phytoplankton to toxic levels of these metals. Chlorophyceae were most tolerant and Cyanophyceae the least tolerant of Cu (ANOVA, p $<$ 0. 01). No significant differences were observed among Bacillariophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, and Dinophyceae, which were of intermediate sensitivity to both metals. The results confirm the existence of a phylogenetic dependence of resistance to trace metal toxicity in phytoplankton...|$|R
