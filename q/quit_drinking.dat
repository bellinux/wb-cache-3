5|$|Peter von Bagh regards Vainio as {{the pioneer}} of Finnish 1960s humorous songs since he began their {{composition}} before Irwin Goodman. Producer Jaakko Salo commented that Vainio's career {{found a new}} start once Vainio <b>quit</b> <b>drinking.</b> According to him, it is evident from Vainio's texts that his songs are based on his own experiences.|$|E
5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he <b>quit</b> <b>drinking,</b> but it did become more emotional.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani <b>quit</b> <b>drinking</b> in 1972, and {{at first}} Vainio found their {{decision}} odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to <b>quit</b> <b>drinking</b> for good.|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} British {{football}} {{stars of the}} late 20th century, Baxter drank to excess, {{and at one point}} was said to be consuming three bottles of Bacardi a day. Scotland teammate Dave Mackay unsuccessfully advised him to train harder and live more sensibly. Baxter often got falling-down drunk the night before a match, but this did not seem to hamper his play, and team managers took little notice of his drinking. After retiring from football Baxter became a pub licensee, an unsuitable career for a problem drinker. At the age of 55 he needed two liver transplants in four days, and promised to <b>quit</b> <b>drinking.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vainio began {{composing}} {{actively in}} the late 1970s, although he had already published his own compositions {{at the beginning of}} the decade. His earliest compositions include Matkarakastaja and Viisari värähtää. Among his most popular songs from the late 1970s is Käyn ahon laitaa ("I Walk by the Side of a Glade") from the 1979 album of the same name. Even though Vainio had already <b>quit</b> <b>drinking,</b> he still occasionally sang about alcohol. Vainio started writing more sensitive songs, a trend which became evident in his next albums. 1981's Albatrossi ja sorsa ("The Albatross and the Duck") contains one of Vainio's most well-known songs, Albatrossi. The topic of the song was lost youth. Another sensitive song on the album is Apteekin ovikello ("The Pharmacy Doorbell"), the idea for which Vainio got from Tapio Rautavaara. Other well-known songs were Panaman konsuli ("The Consul of Panama") and Kun mä rupesin ryyppäämään ("When I Started Drinking").|$|E

25|$|Maradona had a {{tendency}} to put on weight, and suffered increasingly from obesity (at one point weighing 280lb (127kg)) from the end of his playing career until undergoing gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 6 March 2005. His surgeon said that Maradona would follow a liquid diet for three months in order to return his normal weight. When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter, he displayed a notably thinner figure. On 29 March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires. He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse and was released on 11 April, but readmitted two days later. In the following days, there were constant rumors about his health, including three false claims of his death within a month. After transfer to a psychiatric clinic specialising in alcohol-related problems, he was discharged on 7 May. On 8 May 2007, Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had <b>quit</b> <b>drinking</b> and had not used drugs in two-and-a-half years.|$|E
25|$|During {{times when}} Uncle Tupelo was not touring, Tweedy and Farrar played as Coffee Creek, a {{short-lived}} cover band with The Bottle Rockets' Brian Henneman and Mark Ortmann. Around this time, Tweedy began developing problems with alcohol abuse, leading to tensions between Tweedy and Farrar. While he never refused {{to play a}} gig, Tweedy was forced to sit out in place of Henneman at some performances. Tweedy <b>quit</b> <b>drinking</b> entirely after meeting future wife Sue Miller, although he replaced this habit with smoking marijuana. However, after developing a dependence on marijuana, he quickly quit using it, as well. After releasing Still Feel Gone, the band formed a friendship with Peter Buck of R.E.M., who produced their third album March 16–20, 1992 for free. Uncle Tupelo left the Rockville label in favor of Sire Records (Warner) later in 1992 because Rockville refused to pay the band any royalties for their albums. After the signing, Max Johnston and John Stirratt joined the band as Mike Heidorn was replaced by Bill Belzer who was later replaced by Ken Coomer. The five-piece band recorded Anodyne, which sold over 150,000 copies and debuted at number 18 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, but was the last album Uncle Tupelo released.|$|E
500|$|Vainio was {{supported}} by his friends who had <b>quit</b> <b>drinking</b> a few years earlier, such as Osmo [...] "Osku" [...] Kanerva. Eino Grön, a friend of Vainio's, decided to follow his example and managed to quit {{a year and a}} half after Vainio. Vainio never wanted to be called a teetotaler and considered himself a recovered alcoholic. After he <b>quit</b> <b>drinking,</b> Vainio's songs became more serious and more sensitive, although he still wrote humorous lyrics as well.|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} explore the gap of {{prevalence}} of healthy lifestyle behaviors including smoking cessation, <b>quitting</b> <b>drinking,</b> physical activity and healthy eating between Chinese adults with and without cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study is a cross-sectional component of Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) -China study, which recruited ~ 46, 000 participants from 70 rural and 45 urban communities between 2005 and 2009. Participants were divided into disease (with CVDs) and control (without any diseases) groups. The adjusted rates were estimated for different strata by the generalized, linear mixed-effects model, including community as a random effect with additional adjustment for age, sex, education and income. Among 40, 490 participants, < 10 % had all four healthy lifestyle behaviors (disease group versus control group: urban areas: 7. 8 % versus 8. 1 %; rural areas: 3. 4 % versus 3. 2 %). The rates of smoking cessation and <b>quitting</b> <b>drinking</b> were significantly higher in disease group for both urban and rural residents (P< 0. 001). In urban areas, higher rates were observed in all other three healthy lifestyle behaviors except physical activity in low-income regions (P< 0. 05). Similarly, the higher trends were observed for stopping smoking and drinking while opposite trends for healthy eating among rural residents from low-income regions (P< 0. 05). Our study showed that the prevalence of adopting all four behaviors was low among Chinese adults. Individuals with CVDs {{were more likely to}} follow healthy lifestyle behaviors, but it still indicated a large gap between the actual and ideal adoption of healthy lifestyle behaviors, which called for the promotion of population-wide strategies to modify lifestyle behaviors in addition to individual health-care intervention strategies...|$|R
