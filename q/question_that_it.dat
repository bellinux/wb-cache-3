500|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner, {{who listened to}} {{progressive}} rock in his youth, wrote things that he initially withheld from the band, because he felt that his bandmates would not understand him - he described his work as being [...] "way too proggy". Despite his initial doubt, they loved his work when he showed it to them. Thereafter, Heppner began describing the forthcoming record in progressive rock terms during interviews. He told the Whistler <b>Question</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> [...] "is a little more musically complex; deeper into the sort of metal side where we started out from", but that [...] "It still sounds like us". He also told Jam! that the new songs were [...] "leaning toward progressive (rock) territory".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had to be exact otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots. This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E

2500|$|According to some defence analysts, India should {{increase}} its {{military presence in}} Afghanistan not only to protect Indian projects and nationals there, but also to aid the coalition forces to improve the overall security situation in the war-torn country. Gurmeet Kanwal, head of the Center for Land Warfare Studies, said, [...] "I would say {{the time has come}} to live up to our responsibility. If it involves military intervention, so be it." [...] C. Raja Mohan, an Indian foreign policy analyst, urged India's government to increase military presence in Afghanistan and also added [...] "Afghanistan needs to be stabilised. Pakistan needs to be stabilised. This requires more drastic remedies." [...] In April 2008 Afghanistan's Defense Minister formally requested India's help in counter-insurgency operations during his visit to New Delhi. India has already provided large-scale military equipment to the Afghan National Army and has also given crucial intelligence inputs to the United States-led coalition forces. Several members of the Afghan army have undergone anti-terrorist training in India and in April 2007, the Indian Army also sent a delegation to set up an army training school in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. In September 2007, India held a joint military exercise with the United Kingdom to train British forces in counter-insurgency operations, particularly those in Afghanistan. India also has an operational air force command at the Farkhor Air Base in neighbouring Tajikistan. Indian Express said in an editorial, [...] "after the Kabul bombing, India must come to terms with an important <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has avoided debating so far. New Delhi cannot continue to expand its economic and diplomatic activity in Afghanistan, while avoiding a commensurate increase in its military presence there. For too long, New Delhi has deferred to Pakistani and American sensitivities about raising India's strategic profile in Afghanistan." [...] However, some analysts have feared that if India joins the United States-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, it would harm the soft power it has gradually built in the region as a result of the widespread popularity of Bollywood films and Indian television soaps among Afghans.|$|E
