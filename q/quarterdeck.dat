5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{were moved}} {{on a system}} of wheeled trolleys running on Décauville rails that extended throughout each half-hangar to the <b>quarterdeck</b> {{at the rear of}} the ship. The torpedo bombers would be moved to the <b>quarterdeck</b> where their wings would be extended and then they would be lowered into the water by the large crane at the very stern of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and <b>quarterdeck</b> and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard gun from the <b>quarterdeck</b> were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port gun from the <b>quarterdeck</b> were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the <b>quarterdeck.</b> A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the <b>quarterdeck</b> guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Captain W. C. Pakenham, the Royal Navy's {{official}} military observer {{under the}} Anglo-Japanese Alliance, took {{notes of the}} battle's progress from a deck chair on Asahis exposed <b>quarterdeck.</b> His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West.|$|E

5|$|Defence {{received}} a QF 12-pounder (3-inch) 12 cwt anti-aircraft (AA) gun and a QF 3-pounder (47mm) AA gun in 1915–16. The 12-pounder gun was {{mounted on the}} aft superstructure and the 3-pounder on the <b>quarterdeck</b> at the extreme rear.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the confusion and loss of leadership aboard the American vessel, the British boarding party was being effectively organised. A number of small-arms men rushed aboard Chesapeake, led by Broke, including the purser, Mr G. Aldham, and the clerk, Mr John Dunn. Aldham and Dunn were killed as they crossed the gangway, {{but the rest of}} the party made it onto Chesapeake. Captain Broke, at the head of not more than twenty men, stepped from the rail of the waist-hammock netting onto the muzzle of the after-carronade of Chesapeake, and from there he jumped down to her <b>quarterdeck.</b> As the British boarded there were no American officers left on the <b>quarterdeck</b> to organise resistance.|$|E
5|$|Musashi {{was fitted}} with two catapults on her <b>quarterdeck</b> and could stow {{up to seven}} floatplanes in her below-decks hangar. The ship {{operated}} Mitsubishi F1M biplanes and Aichi E13A1 monoplanes and used a , stern-mounted crane for recovery.|$|E
5000|$|Calypso {{was built}} to the same {{technical}} drawings as the five other Echo-class ships: , , , , and [...] The class {{was designed to be}} 16-gun ship sloops with <b>quarterdecks</b> and forecastles.|$|R
5000|$|... 386MAX (originally 386 to the Max, later Qualitas MAX) was a {{computer}} memory manager for DOS-based personal computers. It competed with <b>Quarterdeck's</b> QEMM memory manager. It was manufactured by Qualitas.|$|R
50|$|Intel {{processors}} {{from the}} 386 onward allowed a virtual 8086 mode, which simplified the hardware required to implement expanded memory for DOS applications. Expanded memory managers such as <b>Quarterdeck's</b> QEMM product and Microsoft's EMM386 supported the {{expanded memory standard}} without requirement for special memory boards.|$|R
5|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with aircraft facilities to handle two to four KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern. Two hangars were built into the after end of the forecastle deck to house {{two of them and}} cranes were provided at the forward end of the <b>quarterdeck</b> to hoist them out of the water.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' turrets in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1932 the platforms {{were removed from the}} turrets and a trainable catapult was installed on her <b>quarterdeck,</b> along with a crane to recover a seaplane. The catapult and crane were removed by March 1937.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, Courageous was {{assigned}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet. She became flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron near the end of 1916 when that unit was re-formed after most of its ships had been sunk at the Battle of Jutland in May. The ship was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917 by the addition of mine rails on her <b>quarterdeck</b> that could hold over 200 mines, but never laid any mines. In mid-1917, she received half a dozen torpedo mounts, each with two tubes: one mount {{on each side of the}} mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the <b>quarterdeck.</b> On 30 July 1917, Rear-Admiral Trevylyan Napier assumed command of the 1st Cruiser Squadron and was appointed Acting Vice-Admiral Commanding the Light Cruiser Force until he was relieved on 26 October 1918.|$|E
50|$|The {{founding}} of the company was fueled by an interest in web conferencing. Min Zhu, a Stanford-trained System Engineer had been struggling to develop a web-conferencing tool. Coincidentally, during this time, he befriended Subrah Iyar who was running <b>Quarterdeck's</b> research lab and the two formed a partnership.|$|R
50|$|Flames quickly {{spread between}} Theseus decks, {{and a second}} {{detonation}} of ammunition stores destroyed the poop and <b>quarterdecks</b> and toppled the main mast over the starboard bow. A further ten men were killed before the fire was brought under control, leaving the ship unserviceable for the Acre campaign.|$|R
50|$|The first {{software}} {{expanded memory}} management (emulation) program was CEMM, available in September 1986 as a utility for the Compaq Deskpro 386. A popular and well-featured commercial solution was <b>Quarterdeck's</b> QEMM. A contender was Qualitas' 386MAX. Functionality was later incorporated into MS-DOS 4.01 in 1989 and into DR-DOS 5.0 in 1990, as EMM386.|$|R
5|$|In May 1920, Australia {{participated in}} {{celebrations}} and naval activities {{associated with the}} visit of the Prince of Wales. From July to November 1920, an Avro 504 floatplane of the Australian Air Corps was embarked aboard Australia {{as part of a}} series of trials intended to cumulate {{in the creation of a}} naval aviation branch. The aircraft was stored on the <b>quarterdeck</b> next to 'Q' turret, and was deployed and recovered by derrick. Inter-service rivalry and the ship's reduction to non-seagoing status in September prevented further operations.|$|E
5|$|Littorio and Vittorio Veneto had a {{standard}} crew of 80officers and 1,750enlisted men; {{while serving as}} a flagship, the crew was increased by a command staff of between 11 and 31 additional officers. The standard crew for Roma and Impero was increased by 100enlisted men. Aircraft facilities were located on the <b>quarterdeck,</b> where it was initially planned to base six La Cierva autogyros. Instead, a single catapult was fitted. The ships were equipped with three Ro.43 reconnaissance seaplanes or navalized Re.2000 fighters. The Re.2000 fighter was a wheeled aircraft and had to land on an airfield.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1768, Endeavour {{sailed to}} Galleon's Reach {{to take on}} armaments to protect her against {{potentially}} hostile Pacific island natives. Ten 4-pounder cannons were brought aboard, six of which were mounted on the upper deck and the remainder stowed in the hold. Twelve swivel guns were also supplied, and fixed to posts along the <b>quarterdeck,</b> sides and bow. The ship departed for Plymouth on 30 July, for provisioning and to board her crew of 85, including 12Royal Marines. Cook also ordered that twelve tons of pig iron be brought on board as sailing ballast.|$|E
50|$|DESQview was {{critically}} acclaimed and won many fans, {{but it never}} met with mass appeal, despite <b>Quarterdeck's</b> sustained efforts to win people over. Reportedly it intrigued many people at Microsoft, including Bill Gates, who by some accounts based his first version of Windows on DESQview and two other early GUIs, Visi On and GEM.|$|R
5000|$|The second pair - [...] and [...] - were {{launched}} {{on the same}} date in 1816. They were modified at Plymouth Dockyard in 1820 and 1821 respectively, before their first commission, {{by the addition of}} <b>quarterdecks</b> and forecastle to what had originally been flush-deck vessels, and they were at that time re-classed as 26-gun sixth rate post ships.|$|R
50|$|The first ship of the class, , was a 90-gun ship. When {{the second}} batch of three ships was ordered several years later, they were {{specified}} as being 98-gun ships. This was achievable without significant {{modifications to the}} design thanks to the earlier practice of not arming the <b>quarterdecks</b> of second rates, thus allowing for the addition of 4 guns per side.|$|R
5|$|The Magdeburg class {{introduced}} several {{significant improvements}} over earlier designs, including {{a more effective}} bow shape that improved seakeeping and a cut-down <b>quarterdeck</b> that allowed for more efficient handling of the ships' mines. Perhaps most importantly, a waterline armored belt was added to improve the defensive capabilities of the new ships. They also had much more powerful turbines, and as a result, a higher top speed. All following light cruisers adopted these innovations.|$|E
5|$|The Wittelsbach class {{represented}} an incremental {{improvement over the}} preceding Kaiser Friedrich III class. They were equipped with the same armament of four 24cm guns, but were given an additional torpedo tube. They had improved defensive capabilities, as they were protected by a more extensive armored belt. They also differed from the preceding ships in their main deck, {{the entire length of}} which was flush. The Kaiser Friedrich III had a cut-down <b>quarterdeck.</b> The ships of the class, which included Wittelsbach, Wettin, Zähringen, Schwaben, and Mecklenburg, were the first battleships built under the first Naval Law of 1898.|$|E
5|$|The {{connection}} between M and {{the inspiration for}} his character, Rear Admiral John Godfrey, was made apparent with Bond visiting <b>Quarterdeck,</b> M's home. He rings the ship's-bell for HMS Repulse, M's last command: it was Godfrey's ship too. Godfrey was Fleming's superior officer in Naval Intelligence Division {{during the war and}} was known for his bellicose and irascible temperament. During their Christmas lunch, M tells Bond of an old naval acquaintance, a Chief Gunnery Officer named McLachlan. This was actually an old colleague of both Godfrey and Fleming's in the NID, Donald McLachlan.|$|E
50|$|An {{expanded}} memory board, being a hardware peripheral, needed a software device driver, which exported its services. Such a device driver was called {{expanded memory}} manager. Its name was variable; the previously mentioned boards used REMM.SYS (AST), PS2EMM.SYS (IBM), AEMM.SYS (AT&T) and EMM.SYS (Intel) respectively. Later, the expression became associated with software-only solutions requiring the Intel 80386 processor, for example <b>Quarterdeck's</b> QEMM, Qualitas' 386MAX or the default EMM386 in MS-DOS, PC DOS and DR-DOS.|$|R
50|$|Typically {{displacing}} around 2000 {{tons and}} carrying a crew of 750, the second rates by {{the second half of}} the 18th century carried 32-pounder guns on the gun deck, with 18-pounders instead of 24-pounders on the middle deck, and 12-pounders on the upper deck (rather than 18- or 24-pounders on first rates), although there were exceptions to this. Both first and second rates carried lighter guns (and, after 1780, carronades) on their forecastles and <b>quarterdecks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|A week of {{buffeting}} a tempestuous {{and relentless}} sea; {{a week of}} seasickness and deserted cabins; of lonely <b>quarterdecks</b> drenched with spray--spray so ambitious that it even coated the smokestacks thick with a white crust of salt to their very tops; a week of shivering in {{the shelter of the}} lifeboats and deckhouses by day and blowing suffocating [...] "clouds" [...] and boisterously performing at dominoes in the smoking room at night.|$|R
5|$|When she was {{converted}} into an escort destroyer in late 1943, 'B' gun {{was replaced by}} a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar and stowage was increased for a total of 70 depth charges which meant that 'Y' gun and the 12-pounder AA gun had to be removed to compensate for the weight. A Type 271 target-indication radar replaced the director. It is likely that the Vickers guns were replaced by the Oerlikons from the <b>quarterdeck</b> at this time.|$|E
5|$|After {{consultation}} with Admiralty, Adams {{took advantage of}} this freedom to make four substantive changes to the Tartar design. The ship's wheel was moved from behind the mizzen mast to before it to improve the helmsman's line of sight. The tiller was also relocated, from an exposed position on the <b>quarterdeck</b> to a safer location belowdecks and near the stern. The vessel's hawseholes were relocated from the lower to the upper deck to allow additional storage space inside the hull. Finally, {{in recognition of the}} vessel's likely role in chasing small enemy craft, the leading pair of gunports were moved from the sides of the vessel to the bow in order to form a battery of chase guns.|$|E
5|$|Hood was {{initially}} fitted with flying-off platforms mounted {{on top of}} 'B' and 'X' turrets, from which Fairey Flycatchers could launch. During her 1929–31 refit, the platform was removed from 'X' turret and a trainable, folding catapult was installed on her <b>quarterdeck,</b> along with a crane to recover a seaplane. She embarked a Fairey IIIF from No. 444 Flight of the Royal Air Force. During the 1932 West Indies cruise, the catapult proved {{to be difficult to}} operate in anything but a calm sea, as it was frequently awash in bad weather. The catapult and crane were removed in 1932, along with the flying-off platform on 'B' turret.|$|E
50|$|HMS Conqueror was a 74-gun third-rate ship of {{the line}} of the Royal Navy, {{launched}} on 23 November 1801 at Harwich. She was designed by Sir John Henslow as part of the Middling class of 74s, and was the only ship built to her draught. Whereas the common class carried 28 18-pounder guns on their upper gun decks, the middling class carried 30, and only ten 9-pounder guns on their <b>quarterdecks</b> instead of the 12 of the common class.|$|R
50|$|The Tone {{class had}} no {{aircraft}} hangar, {{but there was}} a comprehensive arrangement of transport rails and turntables on the aircraft catapult and <b>quarterdecks.</b> Two gunpowder-propelled catapults were located on the beam abaft the mainmast. A maximum of four Kawanishi E7K2 'Alf' three-seat floatplanes and four Nakajima E8N1 'Dave' floatplanes could be carried, the normal complement being six, of which four were to be E8Nls. In practice, no more than five were ever embarked. As the war progressed these types were superseded by the Aichi E13A1 'Jake' and Mitsubishi F1M2 'Pete'.|$|R
50|$|The San Carlo Borromeo class ships had a deck {{length of}} 167 ft, a keel length of 143 ft, and were 43 ft wide. They were built to hold 66 guns, which {{although}} by modern standards {{would make them}} third rate ships of the line, were considered Primo Rango, or first rank. Of these 66 guns, 26 were 40-pound cannons, 28 were 30-pound cannons, and 12 were 14-pound cannons, located on the lower, upper, and <b>quarterdecks,</b> respectively. This gave a broadside weight of 1024 Venetian pounds, or in modern units, 308 kg.|$|R
