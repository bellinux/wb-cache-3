5|$|At {{the height}} of his career as a {{director}} Whale directed The Road Back (1937), a sequel to All <b>Quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front. Studio interference, possibly spurred by political pressure from Nazi Germany, led to the film's being altered from Whale's vision and it was a critical and commercial failure. A run of similar box-office disappointments followed and, while he would make one final short film in 1950, by 1941 his film directing career was over. He continued to direct for the stage and also rediscovered his love for painting and travel. His investments made him wealthy and he lived a comfortable retirement until suffering strokes in 1956 that robbed him of his vigor and left him in pain. He committed suicide on 29 May 1957 by drowning himself in his swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Unlike during Cyclone Nargis in 2008, the Government of Myanmar {{took steps}} {{to ensure the safety}} of {{residents}} in the path of Cyclone Giri. An estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm. Throughout central Myanmar, at least 157 people are known to have been killed by Giri. Thousands of structures near where the storm made landfall were destroyed, leaving more than 70,000 people homeless. An international relief effort began shortly after the storm passed to assist survivors of the storm. Initially, local and foreign media initially criticized the Myanmar government for not giving residents enough warning of the storm and later for keeping <b>quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> situation. However, the focus later shifted to the loss of life and relief efforts.|$|E
5|$|Audience tastes {{were fairly}} eclectic during the 20th century, but several trends did emerge. During the silent era, films with war themes were popular with audiences, with The Birth of a Nation (American Civil War), The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, The Big Parade and Wings (all World War I) {{becoming}} {{the most successful}} films in their respective years of release, with the trend {{coming to an end}} with All <b>Quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front in 1930. With the advent of sound in 1927, the musical—the genre best placed to showcase the new technology—took over as the most popular type of film with audiences, with 1928 and 1929 both being topped by musical films. The genre continued to perform strongly in the 1930s, but the outbreak of World War II saw war themed films dominate again during this period, starting with Gone with the Wind (American Civil War) in 1939, and finishing with The Best Years of Our Lives (World War II) in 1946. Samson and Delilah (1949) saw the beginning of a trend of increasingly expensive historical dramas set during Ancient Rome/biblical times throughout the 1950s as cinema competed with television for audiences, with Quo Vadis, The Robe, The Ten Commandments, Ben-Hur and Spartacus all becoming the highest-grossing film of the year during initial release, before the genre started to wane after several high-profile failures. The success of White Christmas and South Pacific in the 1950s foreshadowed the comeback of the musical in the 1960s with West Side Story, Mary Poppins, My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music and Funny Girl all among the top films of the decade. The 1970s saw a shift in audience tastes to high concept films, with six such films made by either George Lucas or Steven Spielberg topping the chart during the 1980s. The 21st century has seen an increasing dependence on franchises and adaptations, with the box office dominance of films based on pre-existing intellectual property at record levels.|$|E

25|$|Foul weather plagued 25 June; only 11 sorties of {{tactical}} air struck {{in support of}} the Royalists.

25|$|Parts of the 1961 British film Whistle Down the Wind, {{and the two}} BBC {{television}} series All <b>Quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Preston Front and Juliet Bravo, were filmed in the town.

25|$|Controversy {{occurred}} when Barry suddenly departed {{the group with}} no public explanation on the program. Rumours in magazines and newspapers suggested she had been caught stealing items from other members. Six years later in 2006, Barry appeared on the program Where Are They Now?, {{to speak for the}} first time over the incident. She stated that she accidentally kept Monk's weekly money allowance with the intention of giving it back to her, but forgot to do this and was therefore removed from the group. In a 2017 Woman's Day interview, Barry stated that she was paid $1000 to leave and keep <b>quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> matter, and blamed her actions on her youth and naivety.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} decades {{were relatively}} quiet {{after such a}} dominant era during the 1920s. Stade Toulousain would not make it to any grand finals during the 1930s, {{and it would not}} be until the late 1940s when they would return. However they did contest the Challenge Yves du Manoir with RC Toulon in 1934, though it ended in a nil-all tie and both teams were winners. The club made it to the final of the 1947 championship, and claimed the premiership, beating SU Agen, 10 to 3. However, no such championships followed, the club was again relatively <b>quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> championship. It was 22 years in the waiting; Toulouse made it to the final, but were defeated by the CA Bègles club.|$|E
25|$|In 1964 Keeping {{illustrated}} {{his first}} book for the Folio Society, an edition of Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights. He disliked the book, finding the characters unconvincing, and so illustrated them in two-colour lithographs in an expressionist style, paying {{little attention to the}} faces. He had been contracted for twelve illustrations, but delivered twenty-two, and asked the publisher to choose the twelve best. He followed this with Erich Maria Remarque's All <b>Quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front (1966) in a similar style. For the same publisher he illustrated Ghost Stories of M. R. James (1973), Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto (1976) and Victor Hugo's Les Misérables (2 volumes, 1976) in two-colour lithographs, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Idiot (1971) in line drawings.|$|E

25|$|Cromwell served {{during the}} last two years of World War II with the United States Coast Guard, along with fellow actor and enlistee Cesar Romero. Actor Gig Young was also a member of this branch of the service during the war. During this period, Cole Porter rented Cromwell's home in the Hollywood Hills, where Porter worked at length on Panama Hattie. Director James Whale was a {{personal}} friend, for whom Cromwell had starred in The Road Back (1937), the ill-fated sequel to All <b>Quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front. With the war's end, and upon returning to California from the Pacific after nearly three years of service with the Coast Guard, Cromwell acted in local theater productions. He also signed on for live performances in summer stock in the East during this period.|$|E
25|$|Another notable false {{lead was}} that of Sidney Sherman, a {{recently}} discharged Marine who had served in World War II. Police had found blonde hairs {{in the back of}} the Degnan apartment building, and nearby was a wire that authorities suspected could have been used as a garrote to strangle Suzanne Degnan. Near that was a handkerchief the police suspected might have been used as a gag to keep Suzanne <b>quiet.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> handkerchief was a laundry mark name: S. Sherman. The police hoped that perhaps the killer had erred in leaving it behind. They searched military records and discovered that a Sidney Sherman lived at the Hyde Park YMCA. The police went to question Sherman but discovered that he had vacated the residence without checking out and quit his job without picking up his last paycheck.|$|E
25|$|Pitts enjoyed her {{greatest}} fame {{in the early}} 1930s, often starring in B movies and comedy short films, teamed with Thelma Todd. She played secondary parts in many films. Her stock persona (a fretful, flustered, worried spinster) made her instantly recognizable and was often imitated in cartoons and other films. She starred {{in a number of}} Hal Roach short films and features, and co-starred in a series of feature-length comedies with Slim Summerville. Switching between comedy short films and features, by the advent of sound, she was relegated to comedy roles. A bitter disappointment was when she was replaced in the classic war drama All <b>Quiet</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Western Front (1930) by Beryl Mercer after her initial appearance in previews drew unintentional laughs, despite her intense performance. She had viewers rolling in the aisles in Finn and Hattie (1931), The Guardsman (1931), Blondie of the Follies (1932), Sing and Like It (1934) and Ruggles of Red Gap (1935). In 1936 and 1937 she portrayed Hildegarde Withers in two movies, succeeding Edna May Oliver as the spinster sleuth, but they were not well received.|$|E
