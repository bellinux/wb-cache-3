Numerous appressed pubescent hairs are on the petiolar scale; this is the opposite in S. richteri, as these hairs are sparse. Workers appear red and somewhat yellowish with a brown or completely black gaster. Gastric spots are sometimes seen in larger workers, where they are not as brightly coloured as those in S. richteri. The gastric spot usually covers a small portion of the first gastric tergite. The thorax is concolorous, ranging from light reddish-brown to dark-brown. The legs and coxae are usually lightly shaded. The head has a consistent colour pattern in large workers, with the occiput and vertex appearing brown. Other parts of the head, including the front, genae, and the central region of the clypeus, are either yellowish or yellowish brown. The anterior borders of the genae and mandibles are dark-brown; they also both appear to share the same coloured shade with the occiput. The scapes and funiculi range from being the same colour as the head or shares the same shade with the occiput. Light-coloured areas of the head in small to medium-sized workers is restricted to only the frontal region, with a dark mark resembling an arrow or rocket being present. On occasion, nests may have a series of different colours. For example, workers may be much darker, and the gastric spot may be completely absent or appear dark-brown.|$|R

In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to simultaneously search for the conformal module and the optimal quasi-conformal parameterization. The key idea is to minimize the Beltrami energy subject to the boundary constraints. The optimal solution is our desired quasi-conformal parameterization onto a punctured disk. The parameterization of the multiply-connected domain simplifies numerical computations and has important applications in various fields, such as in computer graphics and vision. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on synthetic data together with real multiply-connected Riemann surfaces. Results show that our proposed method can efficiently compute quasi-conformal parameterizations of multiply-connected domains and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. Applications of the proposed parameterization technique have also been explored.

40|$|Background and Aims: Episure™ AutoDetect™ syringe (EAS), a {{spring-loaded}} syringe, {{is a new}} loss-of-resistance syringe used {{to identify}} epidural space. It has an advantage of subjective and objective confirmation in identifying epidural space over glass syringe (GS) for beginners. We compared the performance of EAS with that of GS for identifying epidural space in lower thoracic epidurals. Methods: A total of 120 American Society of Anesthesiolgists I-II patients aged 18 - 60 years requiring lower thoracic epidural analgesia for surgery were randomised into Group I (EAS) : Epidural identified using EAS and Group II (GS) epidural identified with GS. Patient demographic data, depth to epidural space (cm), number of attempts, time to locate epidural space (<b>s),</b> inadvertent dural <b>puncture</b> and failed epidural analgesia were the parameters noted. Results: There were no differences in patient demographics or depth to the epidural space between the two groups. There were five failed blocks in the GS group and none in the EAS group (P = 0. 0287). Similarly, there were five inadvertent dural punctures in the GS group and none in the EAS group (P = 0. 0287). When epidural was identified in fewer attempts, {{the time needed to}} identify epidural space was quicker with EAS (P = 0. 0012). Conclusion: Using EAS allowed reliable and quick identification of the epidural space in lower thoracic epidural technique as compared to use of glass syringe. There was no incidence of inadvertent dural puncture or failed blocks with the EAS...|$|R
40|$|In this article, {{we present}} an {{effective}} encoding of dendrograms by embedding {{them into the}} Bruhat-Tits trees associated to p-adic number fields. As an application, we show how strings over a finite alphabet can be encoded in cyclotomic extensions of Q_p and discuss p-adic DNA encoding. The application leads to fast p-adic agglomerative hierarchic algorithms {{similar to the ones}} recently used e. g. by A. Khrennikov and others. From the viewpoint of p-adic geometry, to encode a dendrogram X in a p-adic field K means to fix a set <b>S</b> of K-rational <b>punctures</b> on the p-adic projective line P^ 1. To P^ 1 ∖ S is associated in a natural way a subtree inside the Bruhat-Tits tree which recovers X, a method first used by F. Kato in 1999 in the classification of discrete subgroups of PGL_ 2 (K). Next, we show how the p-adic moduli space M_ 0,n of P^ 1 with n punctures {{can be applied to the}} study of time series of dendrograms and those symmetries arising from hyperbolic actions on P^ 1. In this way, we can associate to certain classes of dynamical systems a Mumford curve, i. e. a p-adic algebraic curve with totally degenerate reduction modulo p. Finally, we indicate some of our results in the study of general discrete actions on P^ 1, and their relation to p-adic Hurwitz spaces. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Background: Percutaneous central venous {{cannulation}} (CVC) {{in infants}} and children is a challenging procedure, and it is usually achieved with a blinded, external landmark-guided technique. Recent guidelines from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend the use of ultrasound guidance for central venous catheterization in children. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate this method in a pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit, assessing the number of attempts, access time (skin to vein), incidence of complication, and the ease of use for central venous access in the neonatal age group. Methods: After approval by the local departmental ethical committee, we evaluated an ultrasound-guided method over a period of 6 months in 20 critically ill patients requiring central venous access in a pediatric intensive care unit and a neonatal intensive care unit (median age 9 (0 - 204) months and weight 9. 3 (1. 9 - 60) kg). Cannulation was performed after locating the puncture site with the aid of an ultrasound device (8 MHz transducer, Vividi General Electrics® Burroughs, USA) covered by a sterile sheath. Outcome measures included successful insertion rate, number of attempts, access time, and incidence of complications. Results: Cannulation of the central vein was 100 % successful in all patients. The right femoral vein was preferred in 60 % of the cases. The vein was entered on the first attempt in 75 % of all patients, and the median number of attempts was 1. The median access time (skin to vein) for all patients was 64. 5 <b>s.</b> No arterial <b>punctures</b> or hematomas occurred using the ultrasound technique. Conclusions: In a sample of critically ill patients from a pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit, ultrasound-guided CVC compared with published reports on traditional technique required fewer attempts and less time. It improved the overall success rate, minimized the occurrence of complications during vein cannulation and was easy to apply in neonatal and pediatric patients...|$|R
40|$|Near {{real time}} MR-guided {{interventions}} are achievable using new techniques. The lack {{of exposure to}} ionizing radiation, multiplanar slice orientation and high soft tissue contrast {{as well as the}} acquisition of functional data predestine MRI for minimally invasive interventions. However, there is currently no standard for minimum frame rates. This has to be investigated to ensure maximum safety and efficiency. MRI sequences can be accelerated by using conventional keyhole imaging. Therefore, the influence of reduced k-space filling on the presentation of a needle artefact and the difference between image and physical needle position was investigated. The technique will be evaluated for their applicability to interventional MRI. The 1. 0 T Panorama HFO MRI (Philips, Best, The Netherlands) was used in the studies. Two groups of experimentees (A: experienced investigators (N = 7), B: inexperienced subjects (N = 13)) punctured a static gel phantom for the puncture study. We analyzed the image parameters SNR and CNR and the puncture parameters time to locate the plane (tl), puncture time (tp), done corrections (cn) and the distance to the intended target structure (dist) after completion of the puncture procedures in respect to the acquisition time (ta) and affiliation to the groups. An interactive sequence has been optimized for an acquisition time of ta= 1 s. This sequence was delayed to ensure consistent image quality at different acquisition times ta= 1 s- 6 <b>s.</b> A MR-compatible <b>puncture</b> machine provided iterative movements in the k-space study, which could be reconstructed on the basis of equations. The k-space filling of a gradient echo sequence of 100 % (1. 4 s) was reduced in 10 % increments down to 20 % and in addition a minimum filling of 15 % (0. 56 s) was assumed. Image quality was measured and compared using the parameters contrast (C), CNR, SNR, as well as the modulation transfer factors (MTF). Furthermore, the contribution of movements along (vl) and perpendicular to the needle (vp) was evaluated in regard to the representation of the needle in the images. The puncture study showed a significant correlation of the time to locate the plane to both, the acquisition time (p< 0. 001) and the affiliation to the groups (p= 0. 01; A: ta= 1 s 25 ± 12 s; ta= 6 s 55 ± 21 s; B: ta= 1 s 22 ± 13 s; ta= 6 s 37 ± 12 s). There is also a correlation (p< 0. 001) between the acquisition time and the puncture time (A: ta= 1 s 59 ± 36 s; ta= 6 s 122 ± 21 s, B: ta= 1 s 47 ± 23 s; ta= 6 s 83 ± 12 s). Moreover, the corrections (cn) correlates with the acquisition time (p= 0. 04) and the affiliation to the groups (p= 0. 01; A: ta= 1 s 3 ± 2; ta= 6 s 5 ± 4; B: ta= 1 s 1. 5 ± 1. 5 s; ta= 6 s 2 ± 2). Furthermore, the average accuracy was measured with 5. 6 ± 3 mm, keeping the parameters SNR and CNR constant. The k-space study could not dedect a significant relationship between the width of the needle and the k-space filling. Nevertheless, there were no new artefacts. The deviations of the calculated needle tip positions to the position of the artefact were 3 mm along and 0. 8 mm vertically to the needle axes. Furthermore, a weak correlation (r=- 0. 14) was found between the reduced k-space acquisition and the CNR. It could be shown that acquisition times up to 4 s for interventions to static organs are acceptable. However, it is possible to increase temporal resolution to fractions of a second for punctures on structures larger than 1 mm without significant loss in quality using conventional keyhole imaging with filiings greater than 15 %, so that the entire intervention process can be better documented...|$|R
