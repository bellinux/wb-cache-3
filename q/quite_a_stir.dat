25|$|The 1964 Games held in Tokyo are {{notable for}} heralding {{the modern age}} of telecommunications. These games {{were the first to}} be {{broadcast}} worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites. The 1964 Games were thus {{a turning point in the}} global visibility and popularity of the Olympics. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka Anton Geesink created <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.|$|E

Many people decided that this prodigious {{situation}} meant that eating the fish would grant them immortality, and so all present wanted to buy the fish.

25|$|In March, {{a driver}} dropped dead at Bulwell Depot {{just before he}} was due to take a car out. Consequently, all drivers were {{required}} to be medically examined periodically. A further noteworthy incident at Bulwell at this time occurred when an officer stationed at Bulwell Hall commandeered a tramcar standing at Bulwell Market Place to take 17 men to Victoria Station. This created <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir,</b> for if such occasions occurred frequently the service would be thrown into disorder. From this time soldiers were carried at half fare, a later concession being the issue of prepaid ½d. and 1d. passes to wounded soldiers.|$|E
25|$|During this time, {{while still}} in Sacramento, the {{gigantic}} engine {{was used as an}} advertising tool by the railroad, to spectacular effect. According to author Guy L. Dunscomb, the engine was kept under steam near the Central Pacific's passenger depot, where it would await the arrival of passenger trains coming in from the east. As the train arrived, El Gobernador would steam past the depot dragging a long line of empty freight cars behind it and causing <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the process. The engine would then be uncoupled and placed on adjacent trackage, where the passengers could {{get a good look at}} the monster up close.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} found match documentation {{was from}} 9 January 1864, when Bells Life in Victoria printed the complete scores of a match between Andersons Creek and Caledonia (now St Andrews), and many noted early residents took part including James Masterton, who got five wickets in each innings. Masterton owned a rich mining claim almost opposite the Old Catholic Church in Brackenbury Street. In 1856 he caused <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the Melbourne Argus {{when he found}} 12oz. of gold in a tub of quartz. Others who took part were the Squires brothers who ran the Grocers Shop in the Main Street for 40 years, which {{it is now the}} Foodlands Store, Stiggants the pioneer orchardist on Pound Road, while Ewen Hugh Cameron who later represented the district in Parliament for 40 years took two wickets for Caledonia.

Dicker broke the Troopergate scandal in July 2007 and engaged in a heated argument with Republican gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino in October 2010, in which Paladino accused Dicker of authorizing a photographer to take pictures of his daughter.|$|R
60|$|We {{took our}} seats round the same clean, white table, and {{received}} our favorite beverage {{in the same}} bright tankards. They were set before us by the sober Margery, no one else being visible. As frequently happen'd, {{we were the only}} company. Walking and breathing the keen, fine air had made us dry, and we soon drain'd the foaming vessels, and call'd for more. I remember well an animated chat we had about some poems that had just made their appearance from a great British author, and were creating <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> public <b>stir.</b> There was one, a tale of passion and despair, which Wheaton had read, and of which he gave us a transcript. Wild, startling, and dreamy, perhaps it threw over our minds its peculiar cast. An hour moved off, and we began to think it strange that neither Ninon or the widow came into the room. One of us gave a hint to that effect to Margery; but she made no answer, and went on in her usual way as before.|$|R
25|$|As league {{entered a}} new century, the Neftchi Baku found {{themselves}} facing new challengers. They were challenged by emerging Khazar Lankaran, Inter Baku and Baku in both competitions. The country's football received major blow in 2002, when UEFA imposed a two-year ban {{in response to a}} long-standing conflict between the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan and majority of the country's top flight clubs. The domestic championship was abandoned {{as a result of the}} conflict and the top clubs prevented their players from playing for the national team, with tax officials also probing allegations of fraud at the Azerbaijan federation. Under the management of Agaselim Mirjavadov, Khazar Lankaran finished as Azerbaijan Cup winners in 2006 and 2007, while becoming league champions in 2006–07 despite losing the title to Neftchi in 2004–05 during Championship play-off. Qarabağ was the first ever team from Azerbaijan to reach UEFA Europa League play off-round during the seasons 2009–10 and 2010–11. Few gave chances for qualification to the next round, although the Aghdam side caused <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> against favorites Rosenborg, Honka, Twente and Wisła Kraków.|$|E
500|$|The {{weeks with}} two major armies sitting within miles {{of each other}} were not without conflict, and a petite guerre ensued in the no man's land between White Marsh and Northern Liberties. Minor skirmishes between light troops {{increased}} in intensity throughout November, with almost daily losses being incurred by both the British and the Americans. In retaliation, on November 22, Howe ordered his troops to set fire to several large country houses in the Germantown area, including Fair Hill, a mansion and country estate that had previously belonged to John Dickinson. [...] Eleven houses in all were burned to the ground, and residents of Philadelphia climbed onto rooftops and church steeples to watch the spectacle. [...] Just one day earlier, crowds had gathered to watch the burning of Commodore John Hazelwood's Pennsylvania Navy in the Delaware. [...] On the same morning the mansions were burned, an earthquake struck Philadelphia, and was felt {{as far away as}} Lancaster. [...] On November 27, an aurora borealis lit up the night skies. [...] The two events caused <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> among both the residents of Philadelphia and the troops, British and American alike, who took them as an ominous sign of things to come.|$|E
500|$|After winning {{his second}} world title, he {{embarked}} on a European tour which took him all over the Continent. Robinson traveled with his flamingo-pink Cadillac, which caused <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in Paris, and an entourage of 13 people, some included [...] "just for laughs". He was a hero in France due to his recent defeat of LaMotta—the French hated LaMotta for defeating Marcel Cerdan in 1949 and taking his championship belt (Cerdan {{died in a plane}} crash en route to a rematch with LaMotta). Robinson met President of France Vincent Auriol at a ceremony attended by France's social upper crust. During his fight in Berlin against Gerhard Hecht, Robinson was disqualified when he knocked his opponent with a punch to the kidney: a punch legal in the US, but not Europe. The fight was later declared a no-contest. In London, Robinson lost the world middleweight title to British boxer Randolph Turpin in a sensational bout. Three months later in a rematch in front of 60,000 fans at the Polo Grounds, he knocked Turpin out in ten rounds to recover the title. In that bout Robinson was leading on the cards but was cut by Turpin. With the fight in jeopardy, Robinson let loose on Turpin, knocking him down, then getting him to the ropes and unleashing a series of punches that caused the referee to stop the bout. Following Robinson's victory, residents of Harlem danced in the streets. In 1951, Robinson was named Ring Magazine's [...] "Fighter of the Year" [...] for the second time.|$|E

[...] The sighting caused <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>stir</b> in the London papers, and Sir Richard Owen, the famous English biologist, proclaimed the beast an elephant seal.
