5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt {{to answer the question}} or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the question was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E
5|$|While on a {{visit to}} the Peloponnese in 1862 a new coup was {{launched}} and this time a Provisional Government was set up and summoned a National Convention. Ambassadors of the Great Powers urged King Otto not to resist, and the king and queen took refuge on a British warship and returned to Bavaria aboard (the same way they had come to Greece) taking with them the Greek royal regalia which they had brought from Bavaria in 1832. It has been suggested that had Otto and Amalia borne an heir, then the King would not have been overthrown, as succession was also a major unresolved <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. It is also true, however, that the Constitution of 1843 made provision for his succession by his two younger brothers and their descendants.|$|E
5|$|As the {{independent}} state of Belgium consolidated after the Revolution, {{the issue of}} a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important political <b>question.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> start of the period, French was the dominant language, and was the only language that was approved for use in legal and government business anywhere in the country. It was also the language of the economic and social elite, even in Flanders. By the 1860s, with Flemish dialects in decline, increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual, paralleling a similar decline in northern France. However, partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture, the Flamingant political movement began to develop, with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. By 1898, Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters. During {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement (although not a united one), fully emerging during the First World War.|$|E

Arundel applied in 1897 to the British Colonial Office for a licence to work the island on the presumption that the USA had abandoned their claim. The United Kingdom then considered Baker Island as a British territory, while never formally annexing it. The United States raised the <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the 1920s and after some diplomatic exchanges, they launched in 1935 the American Equatorial Islands Colonization Project and issued on May 1936 Executive Order 7358 to clarify their sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|Between 1603 and 1613 Sir Walter Raleigh was a {{prisoner}} in the Tower of London awaiting execution; in this period he wrote {{a history of the}} world in five volumes where he described his American experiences and adventures, in it he wondered whether all the new species discovered in the new continent could have found their place on Noah's Ark. A very serious <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, he postulates that only animals from the old continent found place on the Ark; eventually, after the Flood, some of these animals would migrate to the new continent and, under environmental pressure, change their appearances to create new species. Fifty years later, Matthew Hale went even further, and said that only the prototypes of all animal species were welcomed on the Ark; these would eventually differentiate after their release. Many clergymen were happy with Raleigh and Hale ideas since they appeared {{to solve the problem of}} the Ark's tonnage.|$|E

25|$|Ant {{was poised}} to join the 1980s-focused Here & Now tour in January 2002, {{but was unable to}} do so after he was charged with {{throwing}} a car alternator through a pub window and then threatening patrons with an imitation firearm. The previous evening, Adam has since claimed, he had received telephone threats to himself and his young daughter from the jealous husband of a female Camden Market stallholder who had agreed to make some clothing for him. The following morning, advised by people around Camden that he would find the man in <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Prince of Wales pub in Camden, Ant arrived there to confront his persecutor. Some of the pub patrons made fun of his appearance and told him in mocking terms that the man he was looking for was not present. Staff then asked him to leave as the premises were a private members' club. Before storming off, Ant angrily told them all that he would return. Some hours later, finding a discarded car alternator in the street, Ant threw it through the pub window. The broken glass injured a local musician. Chased through the backstreets of Camden by pub security and others, he drove them away by pulling out an old World War II-era starting pistol, once the property of his father. Returning afterwards to the main street, he was spotted by a police patrol, gun still in hand, and arrested as he tried to leave the scene {{in the back of a}} minicab.|$|E
25|$|FOA's Torsten Magnusson {{met with}} the American envoy Howard A. Robinson in November 1954, and Malte Jacobsson from the Atom Committee talked to Counter Admiral Lewis Strauss from Atomic Energy Commission in April 1955. Sweden {{indicated}} {{that it would be}} interested in purchasing approximately 25 nuclear devices. In 1957, Ambassador Erik Boheman raised the <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> US State Department, while the Swedish Ministry of Defense inquired about sending Swedish officers to train on the use of nuclear weapons. Boheman also mentioned that Denmark and Norway had already purchased weapons systems that could carry nuclear warheads, although neither country had devices to deploy on such systems. The American response was dismissive because Sweden, as a non-NATO state, did not have any mutual defense agreement with the US, which was a requirement in American law to even consider nuclear weapons cooperation. The message was clear - if Sweden reconsidered its nonalignment policy, the US would consider a new request from Sweden, otherwise discussions would be fruitless. Analysis from the US State Department in 1959, showed that Sweden {{did not have to be}} a NATO-member for the proposed nuclear weapons sales, but it had to, at the very minimum, have an agreement with the US regarding use of nuclear weapons, which would imply Sweden renouncing nonalignment. On April 6, 1960, the United States National Security Council decided that the Americans should not support the Swedish ownership of nuclear weapons, nor did it approve of the idea of a Swedish nuclear weapons program. The US Government believed that Western interests would be best served against the Soviet Union if Sweden invested its limited resources in conventional weapons, rather than an expensive nuclear weapons program.|$|E
500|$|A vexing <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{time was}} how a {{production}} reactor should be cooled. Taking a conservative view that every possible neutron must be preserved, {{the majority opinion}} initially favored cooling with helium, which would absorb very few neutrons. Szilard argued that {{if this was a}} concern, then liquid bismuth would be a better choice. He supervised experiments with it, but the practical difficulties turned out to be too great. In the end, Wigner's plan to use ordinary water as a coolant won out. When the coolant issue became too heated, Compton {{and the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., moved to dismiss Szilard, who was still a German citizen, but the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, refused to do so. [...] Szilard was therefore present on December 2, 1942, when the first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was achieved in the first nuclear reactor under viewing stands of Stagg Field, and shook Fermi's hand.|$|E

500|$|The {{book has}} a lexicon with certain {{different}} names for foreign objects. A Children's Literature review noted the words [...] "kittypet" [...] and [...] "twoleg" [...] which mean housecat and humans respectively. In the book, instead, of using [...] "said", Cary {{uses the word}} [...] "mewed". This was criticized with the reviewer writing [...] "that 'he mewed', 'she purred', and 'the warrior mewed', which pass for cat talk, grows old fast". In response to a <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Q section of the forum Holmes explained that the names come [...] "in two parts, either or both of which can reflect something about the cat's appearance, personality, or habits". However, they must also {{be part of the}} world they know; Holmes originally gave Tigerclaw the name Hammerclaw until one of the editors pointed out the cats wouldn't know what a hammer is. For the names, Kate Cary says that she takes in inspiration for the names from [...] "sight, sounds and scents the cats would experience". At the same time, more names become available as the cat's world becomes more diverse.|$|E
500|$|From 2008 to 2010, {{time limits}} {{were used for}} each question.

Unused time was banked, and if the contestant reached question fifteen, {{he or she was}} given 45 seconds plus the amount of time previously banked. If the clock reached zero before a contestant could provide a final answer, the contestant was forced to walk away with the winnings they had at that point. During the clock format era, a [...] "Millionaire Menu" [...] was introduced, in which categories are revealed for each <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the game, and are made visible to the contestant for their future reference. Some prize levels also changed at the start of season eight.

Keith Kerr introduced himself as a homosexual and asked [...] "...why you [...] think that American {{men and women in uniform}} are not professional enough to serve with gays and lesbians?" [...] Hunter thanked the general for his service and then argued that the sole issue was [...] "unit cohesion," [...] mirroring a statement from former Secretary of State Colin Powell. After the debate, Kerr was found to be a member of Hillary Clinton's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transsexual Americans For Hillary Steering Committee. Because of this, CNN removed footage of the question from future telecasts. The next day, Hunter sent a letter to Hillary Clinton that read: [...] "Dear Hillary Clinton, Regarding the [...] "plant", retired Brig. Gen. Keith H.

500|$|The {{identity}} of Mysterion is never revealed in [...] "The Coon". After the episode aired, the question [...] "Who is Mysterion?" [...] became a frequently asked <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> FAQ for the official South Park website, South Park Studios. The answer posted at that site was that [...] "there is no answer", {{and that only}} Trey Parker and Matt Stone actually know. Parker said {{it was one of}} the most common questions he was asked about the show, along with the {{identity of}} Cartman's father, which was resolved in the fourteenth season episode [...] "201". Parker and Stone originally said there was no actual answer to Mysterion's identity, as they never chose a specific character to be him. In the original ending of the episode, after Mysterion is arrested, Kyle is shown to be in prison and it is believed he is the superhero. However, the real Mysterion visits him, and Kyle explains he pretended to be Mysterion so the real superhero could remain free and continue fighting crime. As a thank you, Mysterion revealed his identity by showing his face, but like in the actual episode, the viewer cannot determine who he is because all the children look alike without hats. The ending was ultimately cut because Parker and Stone decided it took too much time for a simple throwaway gag and to show that Kyle was not Mysterion. The clip is available as a deleted scene in the thirteenth season DVD and Blu-ray sets. The superhero characters from [...] "The Coon" [...] returned in the fourteenth season episodes [...] "", [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] and [...] "Coon vs. Coon and Friends", in which Mysterion is revealed.|$|E
500|$|Actions by the Massachusetts Bay Colony rulers {{came into}} <b>question</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Privy Council in 1633. [...] Several {{opponents of the}} Puritans {{levelled}} charges that the colony's administrators sought independence from the crown and laws of England; Cradock and other company representatives were called before the council to answer these charges. [...] They successfully defended {{the actions of the}} colonists, but the Puritans' opponents succeeded in having ships full of colonists detained from sailing in February 1633/4 until the colonial charter was presented to the council for inspection. [...] Cradock was called upon to provide it; he informed the council that the charter was in the colony, and secured the release of the ships with a promise to have the charter delivered. [...] The colonial council in Boston, not wanting to send the document for fear the charter would be revoked, temporized, claiming in their July 1634 meeting that the document could only be released by a vote of the colony's General Court. [...] It was not scheduled to meet until September, at which time the matter would be taken up. [...] The General Court refused to consider the issue, and began fortifying Boston Harbour, expecting a military confrontation over the issue. [...] The 1634 launch of a ship intended to carry a force to the colony was unsuccessful, ending the military threat to the colony. [...] The political threats continued, and the charter of the Plymouth Council of New England, issuer of the colony's land grant, was revoked. [...] Furthermore, criminal charges, some of them clearly trumped up, were laid against Cradock and others associated with the Massachusetts Bay Company in 1635. [...] Cradock was acquitted of most of these charges, but was convicted of usurpation of authority and deprived of his ability to act on behalf of the company.|$|E
