It is composed {{of the distribution of}} quality aims over each phase in product development and the deployment of quality operations and resources to accomplish these aims. This paper proposes a <b>quality</b> <b>planning</b> methodology based on risk assessment and the planning tasks of product development are translated into evaluation of risk priorities. Firstly, a comprehensive model for <b>quality</b> <b>planning</b> is developed to address the deficiencies of traditional quality function deployment (QFD) based <b>quality</b> <b>planning.</b> Secondly, a novel failure knowledge base (FKB) based method is discussed. Then a mathematical method and algorithm of risk assessment is presented for target decomposition, measure selection, and sequence optimization. Finally, the proposed methodology has been implemented in a web based prototype software system, QQ-Planning, {{to solve the problem of}} <b>quality</b> <b>planning</b> regarding the distribution of quality targets and the deployment of quality resources, in such a way that the product requirements are satisfied and the enterprise resources are highly utilized. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010...|$|R

Data was collected using a structured questionnaire developed using a 5 -points Likert Scale. The study used interviews and a questionnaire aimed at comparing data on current <b>quality</b> <b>planning</b> strategy at this insurer to best practice in the industry, in order to establish the extent to which <b>quality</b> <b>planning</b> is used in the effort to continuously improve customer satisfaction. Findings show that {{there is a lack of}} <b>quality</b> <b>planning</b> best practice at the insurer hindering its positioning amongst the top 10 performing short-term insurers in South Africa. Quality is vital in establishing a company as a leader in its industry that satisfy its customer needs beyond their expectations. Quality cannot be stagnant, as customer needs are dynamic. Therefore, quality needs to continuously improve in order to satisfy the ever changing customers’ needs.

40|$|Background: Behaviour support <b>plan</b> (BSP) <b>quality</b> {{is known}} to be an {{important}} aspect of the support provided to people with disability who show challenging behaviours and has been found to lead to reductions in challenging behaviour. Preliminary evidence suggests that <b>quality</b> of <b>plans</b> is associated with reductions in the use of restraint and seclusion. Method and materials: Quality of a sample of behaviour support plans was assessed using the Behaviour Support <b>Plan</b> – <b>Quality</b> Evaluation II (BSP-QE II) Guide (Browning Wright, Saren & Mayer, 2003). Episodes of restraint and seclusion before and during implementation of plans were examined by comparing restraint and seclusion use between individuals with high quality versus low <b>quality</b> <b>plans.</b> Results: Compared to individuals with low <b>quality</b> <b>plans,</b> individuals with high <b>quality</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be subjected to less restraint and seclusion over time, while those with low <b>quality</b> <b>plans</b> were subjected to increases. With the exception of one quality component, all components in high <b>quality</b> <b>plans</b> were found to be associated with decreases in restraint and seclusion use. Conclusions: The results support earlier preliminary findings that quality of behaviour support plans are associated with reductions in restrictive intervention use. The findings are important because they suggest that increasing quality of behaviour support plans may lead to decreases in restraint and seclusion over time...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pollution}} from vehicles highly affects human health in Berlin and surrounding areas, {{as well as}} a very high contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and the effect that has {{on the rest of the}} planet. It was brought to the forefront in 2002 that Berlin was not falling within the emission limits of these toxins that were set out by The World Health Organization for Europe and Copenhagen. [...] Part of the Berlin Governments’ additional measures to mitigate this issue, was the Environmental Zone. The Environmental Zone is part of Berlin’s Air <b>Quality</b> <b>Plan</b> to reduce the emissions from vehicles focusing specifically on particulate matter (PM 10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Sixteen monitoring stations where set up in the city to record pollution concentrations in an effort to eventually narrow it down to a specific area of the city that required the most focus. [...] The area decided upon comprises eighty-eight square kilometres that contains an estimated one million residence. [...] It is regulated based on vehicles compliance or non-compliance of standard pollution levels, which will allow them to gain access to the Environmental Zone if they fall within the restrictions.|$|E

40|$|The TSP <b>quality</b> <b>plan</b> is {{composed}} during meeting 5 of the launch 1 by determining the defect injection rates and yields for each {{phase of the}} product development process. Using the team’s historical averages for these rates and estimated hours per phase, the team can predict how many defects will likely be injected and removed as products move through this process. Unfortunately, these averages do {{not take into account}} normal variability in the process. However, by applying a Monte Carlo simulation to the standard TSP quality planning process, a team can determine the historical distribution of process variability and produce a plan with ranges for expected defects injected and removed, as well as a measure of goodness for the product and process. The TSP <b>Quality</b> <b>Plan</b> One of the hallmarks of projects using the TSP is the attention to quality or, more accurately, the ability to manage product defects. In fact, TSP creator Watts S. Humphrey says: [...] . defect management must be a top priority, because the defect content of the product will largely determine your ability to develop that product on a predictable schedule and for its planned costs. [1] A chief component of this focus is the <b>quality</b> <b>plan</b> developed during meeting 5 of the TSP launch (for a project). This plan {{is composed}} by estimating defects injected and removed during the various phases of the software process. The team uses historical averages of defects injected per hour to determine defects injected and similar averages for yield (the percent of existing defects found and fixed during a phase) to determine those removed (see Table 1 for a sample <b>quality</b> <b>plan).</b> According to Humphrey, the true purpose of the <b>quality</b> <b>plan</b> “is to establish team yield goals for each process step ” [2].
