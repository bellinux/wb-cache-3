5|$|The First of the Few (also {{known as}} Spitfire in the US and Canada) (1942) was a British film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Leslie Howard, with Howard in the starring role of R.J. Mitchell, and David Niven playing a composite character based on the Schneider Trophy pilots of 1927, 1929 and 1931, and the Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill. Some of the footage includes film shot in 1941 of operational Spitfires and pilots of 501 Squadron (code letters SD). Howard {{spent a long time}} researching the history of the Spitfire's development for the film; Mrs. Mitchell and her son Gordon were on the set during much of the production. The aerobatic flying sequences featured in the last 15 minutes of the film were made by Jeffrey <b>Quill</b> <b>in</b> early November 1941, flying a Spitfire Mk II mocked up to represent the prototype.|$|E

[...] At the bottom, from left to right, are six female royal saints: Saint Margaret of Scotland, Helena of Constantinople, Elisabeth of Hungary, Elizabeth of Aragon, Empress Cunegunda and Edith of Wilton. In the middle of the altar are six canonized kings, four of whom are: Hermenegild a Visigoth martyr, Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor, Edward the Confessor and Casimir of Poland. [...] Above these four are Saints Louis of France and Ferdinand III of Castile. [...] In between these kings an oil {{painting}} of the Adoration of the Magi by Juan Rodriguez Juarez shows Jesus as the King of kings. The top portion features a painting of the Assumption of Mary as celestial queen flanked by oval bas reliefs, one of Saint Joseph carrying the infant Jesus and the other of Saint Teresa of Ávila with a <b>quill</b> <b>in</b> her hand and the Holy Spirit above her, inspiring her to write. Above this are figures of Jesus and Mary among sculptures of angels crowned with an image of God, the Father.|$|E
500|$|The island's {{population}} numbered a {{few dozen}} families throughout the 18th century, corresponding to a population {{of no more than}} a couple of hundred people; it was recorded as numbering 30 families in 1710, 47 in 1724, 40 in 1735 and 30 in 1760. They rented their land from two branches of the Sinclair family, the Sinclairs of Mey who owned Uppertown and the Sinclairs of Freswick who owned Nethertown. The latter acquired Nethertown in 1721 and eventually took possession of Uppertown as well by obtaining the wadset from the Kennedys, reportedly through skullduggery. According to the deathbed confession of one of the witnesses to the transaction, the laird, Sinclair of Freswick, obtained the [...] "assent" [...] of the deceased Kennedy holder of the wadset by placing a <b>quill</b> <b>in</b> the dead man's hand and moving it to make the corpse write its name on the document. The other witness committed suicide, perhaps out of guilt. The island was reasonably profitable for the Sinclairs; in 1724 the islanders paid an annual rent of 1,300 marks (equivalent to about £125 at 2011 prices), part of which was paid in surplus grain ferried by Stroma's boats to the Sinclair granaries at Staxigoe near Wick. They were self-sufficient in dairy produce and were known for the quality of their cheese-making; Daniel Defoe thought Stroma cheese was excellent.|$|E
2500|$|Kerryn Tolhurst, lead guitarist, mandolin-player, and singer-songwriter founded Adderley Smith Blues Band in 1964 in Melbourne, {{which was}} one of Australia's first {{authentic}} blues bands. Lead vocalist and harmonica-player Broderick Smith joined in 1966, both Smith and Tolhurst were conscripted into the Army as part of National Service during the Vietnam War for two years from 1968 to 1970. Smith was unable to continue with the band but Tolhurst was able to keep a line-up performing, including Joe Camilleri on saxophone in 1970. After National Service, Tolhurst formed Sundown, with singer-songwriter Keith Glass, as a country rock group, Smith briefly joined Sundown before going on to blues boogie band, Carson in 1971. After Sundown, Tolhurst joined singer-songwriter Greg <b>Quill</b> <b>in</b> his country rock group Country Radio during 19721973. Quill and Tolhurst co-wrote their hit singles [...] "Gypsy Queen" [...] and [...] "Wintersong".|$|E

2500|$|Currently, {{the best}} {{algorithms}} for such tasks {{are based on}} convolutional neural networks. [...] An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and hundreds of object classes. [...] Performance of convolutional neural networks, on the ImageNet tests, is now close to that of humans. The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on a stem of a flower or a person holding a <b>quill</b> <b>in</b> their hand. They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras). By contrast, those kinds of images rarely trouble humans. [...] Humans, however, tend to have trouble with other issues. For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, reprising {{their roles}} {{from the first}} film are Laura Haddock as Meredith Quill, Gregg Henry as her father, Seth Green {{as the voice of}} Howard the Duck, and canine actor Fred as Cosmo. Members of Yondu's Ravager crew {{appearing}} in the film include Evan Jones as Retch, Jimmy Urine as Half-Nut, Stephen Blackehart as Brahl, Steve Agee as Gef, Mike Escamilla as Scrote, Joe Fria as Oblo, Terence Rosemore as Narblik, and Tommy Flanagan as Tullk, as well as Charred Walls of the Damned drummer and Howard Stern Show personality Richard Christy in a cameo appearance. Many of these actors are close friends with Gunn. The other members of Stakar and Yondu's old team, based on the comic's original incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy, include Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, Ving Rhames as Charlie-27, and Michelle Yeoh as Stakar's female counterpart Aleta Ogord. Also included in the team are the CG characters Krugarr and Mainframe, with the latter voiced, in an uncredited cameo, by Miley Cyrus. Rosenbaum had previously auditioned to play Peter <b>Quill</b> <b>in</b> Vol. 1. Gunn cast Yeoh because of his love of 1990s Hong Kong films, and Cyrus after admiring [...] "the tone of her voice" [...] while watching her as a judge on The Voice. He added that the team would return in future MCU films alongside Stallone's Stakar.|$|E
2500|$|Animal Logic and Method Studios {{also worked}} on the various parts of Ego's planet, with Animal Logic {{focusing}} on Ego's cathedral, and Method on the arrival sequence and Baby Groot's [...] "not that button" [...] sequence in the Planet Hollow. Animal Logic's work for Ego's cathedral was also based on fractal art. The team at Animal Logic were initially brought on to the film {{to work on the}} story vignettes that were used to explain the backstory, which started as oil paintings before evolving to falling sand, and eventually the final plastic sculptures that were used. Method also created the film's final sequence for Yondu's funeral. To make Rocket shedding a tear convincing, Method used in-house footage of Animation Supervisor Keith Roberts [...] "performing the scene for reference, studying the macro facial movements like minor eye darts or blinks, in addition to what was filmed on set and in the sound booth by" [...] Cooper. Additional work included the scenes on the planet Berhart. Lola VFX worked on de-aging Russell, having previously done similar work in other MCU films; they also added to various characters, including Nebula. To achieve the younger Ego, Lola referenced Russell's performance in Used Cars, as [...] "he had a lot of the [...] action" [...] the visual effects artists were looking for. They also used a younger stand in, Aaron Schwartz, since he had [...] "big broad jaw, chin, and most importantly the way the laugh lines move and crease as he talk", similar to Russell's. Laura Haddock, reprising her role from the first film of Meredith <b>Quill</b> <b>in</b> the sequence, was also slightly de-aged to play the younger version of that character.

2500|$|The {{figures on}} the next two tiers turn {{slightly}} towards Christ's large icon in the central axis of the iconostasis. The third tier, above the Feasts is called the Apostles' tier. As this row has 12 paintings like the Feasts tier, it would be logical to suppose each icon displayed one of Jesus' disciples. But {{that is not the}} case here, in fact only eight of the twelve apostles appear on this tier. From the left, the first icon depicts apostle Thomas. The [...] "doubting" [...] disciple was originally a carpenter. He holds a spear in his right hand, symbolizing his martyrdom in India. Bartholomew is the next in the row. Originally he was a peasant, and according to the Christian legend, he died in Armenia, flayed alive and crucified, head downward. Bartholomew holds his own flayed skin in his hand as a symbol of his death. The next apostle is Andrew, Peter's brother. Legend says that he was crucified in Patras, Greece on a Crux decussata (X-shaped cross), now commonly known as a Saint Andrew's Cross. He is portrayed with this cross. Andrew is followed by Mark the Evangelist. He was painted with a <b>quill</b> <b>in</b> his right hand, and his own gospel in his left. Close to him is the icon of Matthew the Evangelist, who was painted in a rather similar way to Mark. Red and white shades dominate his garment too, and he also holds a quill and his gospel. The last icon on the left side of the Apostles tier, the closest to Jesus' central image, portrays Peter. He was the leader of the apostles, and though he died as a martyr in Rome, he is not associated with his martyrdom on the icon. He holds the Keys of Heaven in his hands.|$|E
2500|$|History is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a female figure draped in Hellenistic robes, holding a feathered <b>quill</b> <b>in</b> her proper right hand and an open book cradled {{in the crook of}} her proper left arm. She wears a floor-length tunic with a wide, slightly pleated neckline underneath a loosely draped mantle which is approximately a foot shorter than the tunic itself. The mantle is draped over her proper left shoulder, encircles her body about the proper right hip, and is gathered at her proper left waist. Her proper right sleeve is rolled halfway up her arm above the elbow, and her proper right arm is crossed in front of her body, horizontal to her waist. She holds a feathered quill delicately in her proper right hand, and little finger of which is curled and raised slightly. The little finger of her proper left hand, which holds the open book, is also curled slightly, adding a sense of delicacy to her pose. Some of the pages of the book have been delineated from one another, in order to give it a more realistic appearance. Her hair is pulled back into a braid, and wound around itself several times, creating a thick bun. Her features have an idealized cast to them, and her eyes are lowered, gazing at the pages of the book in her proper left hand. The sculpture's proper right foot is raised slightly at the heel, and she stands with the majority of her weight on her proper left foot. This sculpture, like the other seven, is carved from Italian Carrara marble, and sits upon a cement pedestal. Approximately three feet below the base of the statue is a black plaque, upon which is the word [...] "HISTORY" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E

40|$|A {{retrospective}} evaluation of 5 cases of orbital or intraocular porcupine <b>quills</b> <b>in</b> {{the dog and}} a literature review from MEDLINE (1983 - 1995) is presented. This paper reviews the diagnosis, therapy, and visual prognosis of ocular and orbital <b>quills</b> <b>in</b> the dog. Distinguishing penetration and perforation of the eye and intraocular structures is paramount in establishing a visual prognosis and appropriate therapy. Perforation of the cornea or sclera, lens, or the uvea and retina necessitates prompt specialized surgical therapy to save vision. The diagnosis of orbital quills can be readily confirmed with ultrasonography. The characteristic sonographic appearance of a double-banded, linear, hyperechoic object allows accurate localization of the quill, which aids surgical removal...|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} work a new method of electrospinning was {{introduced}} by floating a <b>quilled</b> drum <b>in</b> PAN solution. The production rate of the presented method was drastically greater than those of single and multiple-nozzle methods. The <b>quills</b> were arranged <b>in</b> a way that in each rotation only one row of the quills were responsible for generating jets. Thus, there was no perturbation between the electric field of each row. Moreover, the interactions between the jets were reduced by imposing a sufficient distance between them. Having the potential of forming 28 jets on {{the apex of the}} <b>quills</b> <b>in</b> each rotation, the jets were free to be deposited from the randomly determined positions to the collector drum and the production rate was increased. The arrangement of the <b>quills</b> was <b>in</b> a way that each one could deposit polymer solution to the collector drum in even distances which led to a more uniform web formation as appose to multi-nozzle method.|$|R
