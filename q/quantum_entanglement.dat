5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglement</b> of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} {{progress}} in the last 20 – 30 years, during which we discovered {{that there are many}} new phases of matter that are beyond the traditional Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss new “topological” phenomena, such as topological degeneracy that reveals the existence of those new phases—topologically ordered phases. Just like zero viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new “topological” phenomena define the topological order at macroscopic level. More recently, we found that at the microscopical level, topological order is due to long-range <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglements.</b> Long-range <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglements</b> lead to many amazing emergent phenomena, such as fractional charges and fractional statistics.

5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling into this category include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglement</b> in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E
5|$|Olivia {{suggests}} {{the possibility that}} the effect is due to <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglement</b> between Alice in the prime universe and Derek in the parallel one. Alice previously told Olivia that Derek died recently from trying to replace a faulty fuse after they flipped a coin to decide who would replace it, and Walter surmises that the parallel universe Alice died in a similar fashion due to a different outcome of the coin flip. Alice's connection to the parallel universe Derek is causing the crack. As the building starts to exhibit the initial signs of a singularity and Broyles (Lance Reddick) prepares to release the amber, Olivia and Peter attempt to persuade Alice that the man she sees is not really her husband. Alice does not believe them until Derek starts to refer to their children. Alice, who is childless, realizes Peter and Olivia are telling the truth; the connection is broken and the effects on the building ebb away.|$|E

40|$|In primary school, we {{were told}} that there are four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. In college, we learned that there are much more than four states of matter. For example, there are {{ferromagnetic}} states as revealed by the phenomenon of magnetization and superfluid states as defined by the phenomenon of zero-viscosity. The various phases in our colorful world are so rich that it is amazing that they can be understood systematically by the symmetry breaking theory of Landau. In this paper, we will review the progress in last 20 [...] 30 years, during which we discovered that there are even more interesting phases that are beyond Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss new "topological" phenomena, such as topological degeneracy, that reveal the existence of those new phases - topologically ordered phases. Just like zero-viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new "topological" phenomena define the topological order at macroscopic level. As a new type of order, topological order requires a new mathematical frame work, such as fusion category and group cohomology, to describe it. More recently, we find that, at microscopical level, topological order is due to long-range <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglements,</b> just like fermion superfluid is due to fermion-pair condensation. Long-range <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglements</b> lead to many amazing emergent phenomena, such as fractional quantum numbers, fractional/non-Abelian statistics, and perfect conducting boundary channels. Long-range <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglements</b> can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons (or more generally, gauge interactions and Fermi statistics) : light waves (gauge fields) are fluctuations of long-range entanglements, and electrons (fermions) are defects of long-range entanglements.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} <b>quantum</b> discord and <b>entanglement</b> for two central spin qubits coupled to an isotropic Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick bath. It is found that both <b>quantum</b> discord and <b>entanglement</b> have quite distinct behaviors {{with respect to the}} two different phases of the bath. In the case of the symmetry broken phase bath, <b>quantum</b> discord and <b>entanglement</b> can remain as constant. In the case of the symmetric phase bath, <b>quantum</b> discord and <b>entanglement</b> always periodically oscillate with time. The critical point of quantum phase transition of the bath can be revealed clearly by the distinct behaviors of quantum correlations. Furthermore, it is observed that quantum discord is significantly enhanced during the evolution while entanglement periodically vanishes...|$|R

40|$|What are {{the metaphysical}} {{foundations}} of Buddhism and modern science? Nagarjuna {{is not looking}} for a material or immaterial object which can be declared as a fundamental reality of this world. His fundamental reality is not an object. It is a relation between objects. This is a relational view of reality. This is the heart of Nagarjuna’s ideas. In the 19 th century a more or less unknown Italian philosopher, Vincenzo Goberti, spoke about relations as the mean and as bonds between things. Later, in quantum physics and in the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead we are talking about interactions and entanglements. These ideas of relatedness or connections or entanglements in Eastern and Western modes of thought are the main idea of this essay. Not all entanglements are known. Just two examples: the nature of <b>quantum</b> <b>entanglements</b> is not known. <b>Quantum</b> <b>entanglements</b> should be faster than light. That's why Albert Einstein had some doubts.
