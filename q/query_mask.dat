40|$|Characterization and {{standardization}} of large animal model in biomedical research {{is still a}} challenge as {{only a minority of}} scientists and clinicians is working at this topic. While housing conditions and feeding are adapted to recommendations given by specified committees basic aspects in experimental protocols such breed, sex, age, anaesthesia, instrumentation, volume management, habituation and training of the animals still show large differences. However, these parts of the protocol are the most important ones for ‘baseline’ values of any organ function and thus influence mainly final results as well as interpretation and discussion of the results. Consequently, since it is necessary that experimental research provide standardization, the comparability of the data becomes often impossible between the different research groups. One reason for thigh variation in basic methods – that are quite often used without any specific characterization of the method’s impact on experimental results – is a dramatic lack of information. While in molecular biology and in ‘in-vitro’ technology databases are focused on protocols providing detailed description and characterization, research in experimental medicine working with large animal models still has to manage all types of theoretical preparation and information using databases exclusively focused on the topics of scientific questions such as Medline®/PubMed which is organized by the American National Library of Medicine. Thus, it appears to be important to provide search programs that are focused on reference and data search dealing with every important detail of the basic methods. In this doctoral thesis a literature search was performed by using NLM-Medline®/PubMed, BIOSIS Previews® and Science Citation Index ExpandedTM of the Institute of Scientific Information® in consideration of focusing next to pigs which are most often used for animal models in all types of rescue and critical care medicine or anaesthesia. Terms of queries of literature search were predetermined and allowed large number of hits. Based on a catalogue of questions heamodynamic data were selected and references were reorganized in consideration of their corresponding basic methods in anaesthesia, instrumentation, monitoring, positioning, age/weight, sex, breed, source and statistical analysis. The <b>query</b> <b>mask</b> that was developed for scientists using the new database-application provides a simple user-surface and is absolutely self-explaining. The mention of sources used, which were identified by the database-application for query combinations of basic methods, are shown at a report, which can be printed out. The database-application is based on Microsoft®-ACCESS, which is a component of Microsoft®-‘Office’. Thus, immediate availability of the application is given for the most of potential users. The database presented here may contribute to a more efficient preparation and discussion of experimental studies in porcine models. In consequence, {{standardization of}} and progress due to experimental work based on the use of porcine models may be improved. And, improved scientific work is always part of transferring the spirit of “Refine, Reduce, Replace” (3 R’s) into realized consideration of animal welfare-aspects...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a strategy for}} quickly identifying and positionally mapping human homologs of yeast genes to cross-reference the biological and genetic information known about yeast genes to mammalian chromosomal maps. Optimized computer search methods {{have been developed to}} scan the rapidly expanding expressed sequence tag (EST) data base to find human open reading frames related to yeast protein sequence queries. These methods take advantage of the newly developed BLOSUM scoring matrices and the <b>query</b> <b>masking</b> function SEG. The corresponding human cDNA is then used to obtain a high-resolution map position on human and mouse chromosomes, providing the links between yeast genetic analysis and mapped mammalian loci. By using these methods, a human homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae CDC 27 has been identified and mapped to human chromosome 17 and mouse chromosome 11 between the Pkca and Erbb- 2 genes. Human CDC 27 encodes an 823 -aa protein with global similarity to its fungal homologs CDC 27, nuc 2 +, and BimA.

40|$|Methylation of {{cytosine}} in the 5 {{position of}} the pyrimidine ring is a major modification of the DNA in most organisms. In eukaryotes, the distribution and number of 5 -methylcytosines (5 mC) along the DNA is heritable but can also change with the developmental state of the cell and {{as a response to}} modifications of the environment. While DNA methylation probably has a number of functions, scientific interest has recently focused on the gene silencing effect methylation can have in eukaryotic cells. In particular, the discovery of changes in the methylation level during cancer development has increased the interest in this field. In the past, a vast amount of data has been generated with different levels of resolution ranging from 5 mC content of total DNA to the methylation status of single nucleotides. We present here a database for DNA methylation data that attempts to unify these results in a common resource. The database is accessible via WWW ([URL] It stores information about the origin of the investigated sample and the experimental procedure, and contains the DNA methylation data. <b>Query</b> <b>masks</b> allow for searching for 5 mC content, species, tissue, gene, sex, phenotype, sequence ID and DNA type. The output lists all available information including the relative gene expression level. DNA methylation patterns and methylation profiles are shown both as a graphical representation and as G/A/T/C/ 5 mC-sequences or tables with sequence positions and methylation levels, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Despite its {{benefits}} and wide-spread acceptance, SQL [5]is {{not a perfect}} query language. Although graphical tools for <b>query</b> construction <b>mask</b> some of the complexity, complex database schema challenge even experienced database users during query formulation because a user is responsible for mapping the semantics of their query {{to the structure of}} the database. In this work, we propose a semantic query language for graphically querying relational database systems that allows a user to query the database by semantics instead of structure. Database semantics are described using a global dictionary and semantic specifications that are combined to form an integrated, context view. Users query the semantic view by concept name, and the query processor translates semantic queries to SQL. This translation involves automatically determining attribute and relation mappings and join conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{my beloved}} {{father and mother}} 4 Distributed open {{information}} retrieval involves posing queries that may span across multiple data resources and involve users with multiple levels of understanding, presenting a challenging problem domain with multiple levels of data heterogeneity. To ease data interoperability and to tolerate the data heterogeneities, a semantic mediation approach is used to capture the key domain concepts and the relations between them. Semantic mediation processes naturally support <b>query</b> transparency, <b>masking</b> the underlying data model complexity, enabling users to specify what to query {{at a higher level}} of data abstraction, rather than having to specify where or how to query at a low-level. Within the context of the EU Environment Data Exchange Network for Inland Water, EDEN-IW, research project, a distributed semantic model represented in the DAML+OIL Ontology Language, has been created to enable queries to be mediated across multiple heterogeneous databas...|$|R
40|$|Online social {{networks}} (OSN) contain data about persons or objects including pri-vate information and user generated labels. We study two problems on managing OSN data. Data is often shared with trusted parties. Still, data {{has to be}} adapted {{so that it does}} not trivially reveal identities of the users and their interactions. We formulate this problem of “masking ” data by deliberately introducing uncertainty and trading it off with the utility of data for useful analyses. We present methods for masking static and dynamic OSN data and show high accuracy in experiments for answering a variety of <b>queries</b> over the <b>masked</b> data. User-generated labels have many uncertainties due to missing values, synonyms, and so on. The problem of Label Set Enhancing captures the task of reducing these uncertainties, by inferring missing values, replacing labels for larger concept labels and so on. We present first known, efficient, iterative solutions to this problem where the labels form a hierarchy. Our evaluations show significant benefits in using a hierarchy for reducing uncertainty in label sets in OSN data...|$|R

Beforehand, <b>query</b> sequences were <b>masked</b> for low-complexity and fibrillar regions using Coils (Lupas et al., 1991) and SEG (Wootton and Federhen, 1996). The collected NuMA proteins were aligned using Muscle (Edgar, 2004), and conserved regions within the alignment were detected using Gblocks (Castresana, 2000) and Plotcon (Rice et al., 2000). Highest conservation was observed in a C-terminal appr. 60 amino-acids (aa) long region, preceded by a more moderately conserved 100 aa segment with a serine compositional bias as defined with SEG and SAPS (Brendel et al., 1992). The well-conserved N-terminal 200 - 300 aa including a CH domain (Novatchkova and Eisenhaber, 2002) together with the C-terminal 60 aa segment are best suited for the use in distant homology searches. Profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs, Eddy, 1998) were derived for the two best conserved N- and C-terminal segments.

RepbaseSubmitter is a java-based interface for formatting and annotating Repbase entries. It eliminates many common formatting errors, and automates actions such as calculation of sequence lengths and composition, thus facilitating curation of Repbase sequences. In addition, it has several features for predicting protein coding regions in sequences; searching and including Pubmed references in Repbase entries; and searching the NCBI taxonomy database for correct inclusion of species information and taxonomic position. Censor is a tool to rapidly identify repetitive elements by comparison to known repeats.
