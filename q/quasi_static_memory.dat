40|$|International audienceThe {{majority}} of applications, {{ranging from the}} low complexity to very multifaceted entities requiring dedicated hardware accelerators, are very well suited for Multiprocessor Systems-on-Chips (MPSoCs). It is critical to understand the general characteristics of a given embedded application: its behavior and its requirements in terms of MPSoC resources. This paper presents a complete method to study the important aspect of memory characteristic of an application. This method spans the theoretical, architecture-independent memory characterization to the <b>quasi</b> optimal <b>static</b> <b>memory</b> allocation of an application on a real shared-memory MPSoC. The application is modeled as an Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) graph {{which is used to}} derive a Memory Exclusion Graph (MEG) essential for the analysis and allocation techniques. Practical considerations, such as cache coherence and memory broad-casting, are extensively treated. Memory footprint optimization is demonstrated using the example of a stereo matching algorithm from the computer vision domain. Experimental results show a reduction of the memory footprint by up to 43 % compared to a state-of-the-art minimization technique, a throughput improvement of 33 % over dynamic allocation, and the introduction of a tradeoff between multi-core scheduling flexibility and memory footprint...|$|R

We also show that this issue is caused by the assumption of a <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> electrical field and therefore can be avoided by modeling a dynamical electrical field. ...|$|R

These issues are significant in longer and heavier trains increasing risk of wagon roll over, wheel climb, wagon body pitch, bogie pitch and wagon lift off. Modelling of coupler angles {{has been added}} to normal longitudinal train simulation toallow comprehensive study of lateral components of coupler forces. Lateral coupler forces are then combined with centripetal inertia calculations to allow <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> lateral forces, <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> vertical forces and <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> bogie L/V to be calculated allowing study of stringlining, buckling or wagon rollover risks. The approach taken allows for the different rollingstock lengths, overhang and coupling lengths and allows angles occurring in transitions to also be studied.

40|$|We explore {{remanent}} magnetization (μ) as {{a function}} of time and temperature, in a variety of rhombohedral antiferromagnets (AFM) which are also weak ferromagnets (WFM) and piezomagnets (PzM). These measurements, across samples with length scales ranging from nano to bulk, firmly establish the presence of a remanence that is <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> in nature and exhibits a counter-intuitive magnetic field dependence. These observations unravel an ultra-slow magnetization relaxation phenomenon related to this <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> remanence. This feature is also observed in a defect free single crystal of α-Fe_ 2 O_ 3, which is a canonical WFM and PzM. Notably, α-Fe_ 2 O_ 3 is not a typical geometrically frustrated AFM and in single crystal form, it is also devoid of any size or interface effects, which are the usual suspects for a slow magnetization relaxation phenomenon. The underlying pinning mechanism appears exclusive to those AFM which are either symmetry allowed WFM, driven by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) or can generate this trait by tuning of size and interface. The qualitative features of the <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> remanence indicate that such WFM are potential piezomagnets, in which magnetization can be tuned by stress alone...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanical}} behaviour of bones up to failure is necesary for diagnosis {{and prevention of}} accident and trauma. As far as we know, no authors have yet studied the tensile behaviour of compact bone including failure under dynamic loadings (1 m/s). The originality of this study comes from not only the analysis of compact bone failure under dynamic loadings, the results of which are compared to those obtained under <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> loadings but also {{the development of a}} statistical model. We developed a protocol using three different devices. Firstly, an X-ray scanner to analyse bone density, secondly, a common tensile device to perform <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> experiments and thirdly, a special device based upon a hydraulic cylinder to perform dynamic tests. For all the tests, we used the same sample shape which took into account the brittleness of the compact bone. We first performed relaxation and hysteresis tests followed by tensile tests up to failure. Viscous and plastic effects were not relevant to the compact bone behaviour so its behaviour was considered elastic and brittle. The bovine compact bone was three to four times more brittle under a dynamic load than under a <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> one. Numerically, a statistical model, based upon the Weibull theory is used to predict the failure stress in compact bone...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the basic {{question}} of what factors determine the strain field in a <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> granular flow. It is shown that using stress - strain rate relations is not the proper way to understand <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> rheology. An alternative approach is discussed where the local deformation is regarded as the cause of deformation in the vicinity. We suggest a continuum model where the local shear strain is proportional to its Laplacian and the proportionality factor is determined by the local stress. The predicted behavior is tested in a three dimensional shear cell by means of computer simulations. The simplicity of our setup makes it ideal to demonstrate and examine the fundamental open questions of collective granular flows. The observed shear profile is interpreted in the framework of the suggested model. Comment: 9 pages, 11 figures, submitted to PR...|$|R

40|$|When a train {{runs through}} a turnout or a sharp curve, high lateral forces occur between the wheels and rails.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation into}} the constant stress amplitude compression compression fatigue behavior of closed cell aluminum foam, both with and without lateral constraint, was conducted. Results show that while {{the early stages of}} strain accumulation due to fatigue loading are independent of constraint, the rapid strain accumulation stage behaviors are sensitive to the constraint. This was ascribed to the noticeable hardening with plastic deformation observed under constraint during <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> loading, which in turn reduces the effective maximum stress experienced by the foam specimen during fatigue loading. This was demonstrated through a simple empirical model that connects fatigue strain accumulation without constraint to that under constraint. Complementary X ray tomography experiments suggest that the fatigue behavior of the foams is relatively less sensitive to morphological defects such as missing walls than the <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> mechanical properties such as plastic strength. Evaluation of the energy absorption behavior suggests that the damage that accumulates during fatigue does not affect the energy absorbing ability of the foam adversel...|$|R

Several identical functional modules placed in sequence usually form rockfall protection system. These modules comprise an interception structure (panel), a support structure, the connection components and the foundations. Experimental tests are fundamental for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of a protection barrier and usually, the response of the structures to block impact is investigated. Moreover, it is also of prime importance to examine how the single components behave upon impact. In particular, attention is focused on the strength under <b>static</b> or <b>quasi</b> <b>static</b> conditions. Energy dissipating devices are one of the numerous connection components and it is the one of interest in this study. The paper deals with two series of experimental tests carried out on energy dissipators, in order to compare the energy that can be dissipated in quasi-static conditions to the one that can be dissipated in the same kind of device subjected to impulsive forces. Indeed, when a block impacts on the defense structure the stresses induced on the interception structure and transferred to the other components of the barrier are dynamic by nature.
