5|$|As {{soon as the}} Persian {{survivors}} had put to sea, the Athenians marched as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to Athens. They {{arrived in}} time to prevent Artaphernes from securing a landing in Athens. Seeing his opportunity lost, Artaphernes ended the year's campaign and returned to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Following the attack, the U.S. issued new {{security}} guidance to its bases in Afghanistan, according to U.S. military officials. One U.S. military {{official said the}} guidance would adjust procedures as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> on a large scale.|$|E
5|$|Parizeau's {{immediate}} plans {{after the}} referendum relied upon {{what he felt}} would be general pressure from economic markets and the business community in English Canada to stabilize the situation as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> which he believed would mitigate any catastrophic initial events (such as blockades) and prepare for negotiations.|$|E

5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts {{to complete a}} map as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators have called the work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, X Corps, with the 7th Infantry Division and 1st Marine Division, {{attacked}} Incheon, striking the North Korean army from the rear. The attack routed the surprised North Koreans, and by 19 September, the Eighth Army {{pushed out of}} the Pusan Perimeter and advanced north. The 24th Infantry Division advanced to Songju, then to Seoul. The Army advanced north along {{the west coast of}} Korea through October. By mid-October, the North Korean Army had been almost completely destroyed, and US President Harry S. Truman ordered General MacArthur to advance all units into North Korea as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to end the war. The 24th Infantry Division, with the South Korean 1st Infantry Division, moved to the left flank of the advancing Eighth Army, and moved north along Korea's west coast. The 24th Division then moved north to Chongju. On 1 November, the division's 21st Infantry captured Chonggodo, 18 miles from the Yalu River and Korea's border with China. Units of the Eighth Army and X Corps spread out as they attempted to reach the Yalu and complete the conquest of North Korea as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{the late}} 1960s, fires were {{generally}} {{believed to be}} detrimental for parks and forests, and management policies were aimed at suppressing fires as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> However, as the beneficial ecological role of fire became better understood in the decades before 1988, a policy was adopted of allowing natural fires to burn under controlled conditions, which proved highly successful in reducing the area lost annually to wildfires.|$|E

5|$|Cornwallis was {{sensitive}} {{to the fact that}} Tipu was likely to deny the invading army access to local forage and provisions, so he made arrangements for a large supply of provisions and arranged for the use of elephants to assist in the movement of the army's siege equipment. He also encouraged the Marathas and the Nizam to step up their advances to join his army as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> so that he could take advantage of their cavalry.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} regain the upper hand, he planned to launch a {{surprise}} assault on the Austrian army stationed in the Cisalpine Republic. Based on the assumption the Austrians would never expect Napoleon's large force {{to be able to}} traverse the Alps, he chose that as his route. He selected the shortest route through the Alps, the Great St Bernard Pass, which would enable him to reach his destination as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. As has been discussed above, some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> back to Athens.|$|E

5|$|As {{the points}} of any smooth simple closed curve move in this way, the curve remains simple and smooth. It loses area at a {{constant}} rate, and its perimeter decreases as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> for any continuous curve evolution. If the curve is non-convex, its total absolute curvature decreases monotonically, until it becomes convex. Once convex, the isoperimetric ratio of the curve decreases as the curve converges to a circular shape, before collapsing to a single point of singularity. If two disjoint simple smooth closed curves evolve, they remain disjoint until one of them collapses to a point.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E
50|$|The thick {{atmosphere}} is sufficiently acidic that downed pilots' craft were being slowly disintegrated. An exposed pilot's survival time outside his craft {{is less than}} a minute, due to his flight suit and helmet literally dissolving. This makes it imperative that the player rescue pilots <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> and efficiently <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, a {{nationwide}} movement pressed {{to return to}} pre-war society as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> in the U.S. When combined with the increasing national paranoia about communism and psychoanalytic theory that had become pervasive in medical knowledge, homosexuality became an undesired characteristic of employees working for the U.S. government in 1950. Homosexuals {{were thought to be}} vulnerable targets to blackmail, and the government purged its employment ranks of open homosexuals, beginning a widespread effort to gather intelligence about employees' private lives. State and local governments followed suit, arresting people for congregating in bars and parks, and enacting laws against cross-dressing for men and women.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay {{consists}} of racing in futuristic hovercrafts and using their speed-boosting abilities to navigate through the courses as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> in settings like the recurring Mute City, Big Blue and Port Town. The first game was labeled by critics as an influential video game {{that created the}} futuristic racing subgenre as well as inspired the creation of numerous racing games such as Daytona USA and the Wipeout series. The series casually centers around the F-Zero racer Captain Falcon and his talented racing and bounty hunting abilities {{as well as his}} encounters with the other F-Zero characters.|$|E
30|$|In the speeded naming task, {{participants}} {{were instructed to}} read the word shown to them {{on a computer screen}} aloud <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> and accurately <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Reaction times were measured from the stimulus onset to the onset of the participant’s verbal response. Verbal responses were recorded for offline scoring of accuracy. In the lexical decision task, {{participants were}} instructed to decide, <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> and accurately <b>as</b> <b>possible,</b> whether the presented item was a real English word or a nonword (i.e., a made up word like ‘POIL’ that does not exist in English). If the item was a word, participants pressed the button on the response box labeled ‘WORD’ with their right index finger. If the item was a nonword, participants pressed the button labeled ‘NONWORD’ with their left index finger. Reaction times were measured from stimulus onset of the participant’s button press.|$|R

5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who did not respond well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible.</b> Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E
5|$|Hooper {{produced}} the film {{for less than}} $300,000 (about $ adjusted for inflation) and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, {{so that he could}} finish as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a PG rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it R. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it would interfere with the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>possible</b> to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E
