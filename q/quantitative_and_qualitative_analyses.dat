40|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{conducted}} on "dominance" as reflected in spoken interactional features, most of which deal with English. Many of these studies adopt a quantitative approach, examining the amount and distribution of interactional features such as amount of talk, interruptions and overlaps, turn-taking, questions, and topic initiations, and they have drawn conclusions on "dominance" accordingly. The present study explores gender dominance in conversation by analyzing conversational data from eight Japanese dyads by integrating <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>analyses.</b> The quantitative analysis of two dimensions of conversational dominance, sequential dominance and participatory dominance, does not show any obvious gender dominance; however, the qualitative analysis of three of the dyads finds a clear pattern of male speakers' self-oriented conversational style, which is manifested in their storytelling and claiming expertise, and this is supported by female speakers' other-oriented conversational style. Gender dominance therefore is seen as a mutual construction. The conclusion discusses the importance of integrating findings from both <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> <b>analyses</b> in situated contexts to deepen understanding of the complexity of gender dominance.
