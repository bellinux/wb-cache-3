40|$|A semi-empirical maximum overall sound {{pressure}} level (OASPL) airframe noise model was derived. The noise radiated from aircraft wings and flaps was modeled by using the trailing-edge diffracted <b>quadrupole</b> <b>sound</b> theory derived by Ffowcs Williams and Hall. The noise radiated from the landing gear was modeled by using the acoustic dipole sound theory derived by Curle. The model was successfully correlated with maximum OASPL flyover noise measurements obtained at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center for three jet aircraft - the Lockheed JetStar, the Convair 990, and the Boeing 747 aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to investigate the fundamental aerodynamic sound generation mechanisms involved in human voice production. A full scale dynamic model of the larynx was used. The experimental facility allowed jet flows through orifices of different laryngeal-like geometries to be investigated, for various acoustic loads and working gas mixtures. The broadband sound generation by stationary jets was first investigated. Empirical non-dimensional relations for the amplitude and the spectral character of the sound radiated from confined jet flows were developed, utilizing an original spectral decomposition procedure. The results confirmed previous findings relative to the basic mechanisms involved, and provided improved models {{that could be used}} to predict the spectrum of the broadband noise generated at the glottis during phonation. Broadband noise generation in pulsating flows was also investigated. It was found that the quasi-steady approximation did not always yield accurate predictions for the broadband component of the radiated sound during the opening and closing stages of one glottal cycle. Otherwise, the periodic component of the radiated sound in pulsating flows, with and without a strong acoustic loading, was predicted well using the quasi-steady approximation within the accuracy limitations of the experimental facility. A species of jet tone was observed in the case of a stationary jet flow through an orifice with divergent walls. This was postulated to be caused by a dynamic stall phenomenon. The geometry, wall motion, and mechanical properties of the model did not replicate those of a human subject with great fidelity. However, many basic features were reproduced which allowed the verification of the quasi-steady approximation often used in voice production models to be verified over a range of flow conditions. The experimental results help clarify the role of monopole, dipole, and <b>quadrupole</b> <b>sound</b> sources involved in translaryngeal flows, and provide useful insight on basic flow-sound interactions within the human larynx. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} {{computational}} aeroacoustics (CAA), in which sound generation by unsteady flows is calculated from first principles, has recently {{emerged as a}} viable discipline. This paper describes one CAA technique which has been validated for low Mach number, low Reynolds number, two-dimensional flows. Results of its application to geometries producing both dipole and <b>quadrupole</b> type <b>sound</b> sources are presented along with theoretical and experimental comparisons. In addition, the future promise of this and other CAA techniques in removing the present limitations is evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} ultra-cold atomic physics allows probing of two-component quantum liquids with a {{hydrodynamic}} normal fluid accompanied by superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates (BECâ€™s), where the experimental {{results can be}} compared to theoretical predictions of the behavior of a weakly interacting two fluid system. Hydrodynamicity in quantum systems like BEC's can have influence on multiple aspects of the collective behavior of the system, such as on the oscillation frequency of <b>quadrupole</b> modes, multiple <b>sound</b> modes in the condensate, but also on high-order excitations which resemble standing sound waves. The hydrodynamicity and excitations of the ultra-cold atomic cloud are the main motivation for the experiments presented in this thesis. In the Utrecht experiment large BEC's up to a few hundred million atoms are produced, which are deeply in the hydrodynamic collisional regime. The macroscopic behavior of the cloud of atoms is dominated by inter-atomic collisions since the mean free path of the individual particles is much smaller than the size of the atomic sample and local equilibrium is established. The influence of the hydrodynamicity on the collective excitations can be investigated by measuring the quadrupole frequency of ultra-cold atomic clouds above the transition temperature Tc, where Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. This quadrupole frequency is determined by measuring the collective shape oscillations of the atomic cloud, where the oscillation frequency is influenced by inter-atomic collisions during the shape oscillations due to the hydrodynamicity of the atomic cloud. The hydrodynamic equations predict the existence of two sound modes in ultra-cold atomic gases below Tc. The speeds of sound are dependent on both the temperature and the chemical potential of the atomic cloud. For low enough temperatures or large enough chemical potential these two speeds of sound become comparable and reaching this regime experimentally allows measuring the speed of sound beyond this avoided crossing. An alternate method of measuring the speed of sound of ultra-cold atomic clouds is exploiting the analogy between a standing sound wave-pattern and high order excitations in BEC's, also referred to as Faraday waves. By exciting the wave-pattern with a frequency and measuring the wavenumber k of the wave-pattern, the speed of sound c can be extracted from the linear dispersion relation. In the process of exciting the standing wave-pattern, remarkable dynamics is discovered in the BECs. As a result of the excitation a large array of other modes are excited next to the wave-pattern. These modes are for example the dipole mode, the axial and radial quadrupole modes, and the scissor mode. This gives rise to complex dynamics in this hydrodynamic quantum mechanical system and although the ultra-cold sample is only excited with a very short pulsed excitation, these modes and the wave-pattern show a large degree of reproducibility during several seconds of time evolution...|$|R
