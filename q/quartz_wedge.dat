5000|$|It {{is often}} {{important}} {{to find out}} whether of the two axes of elasticity (or vibration traces) in the section is that of greater elasticity (or lesser refractive index). The <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge</b> or selenite plate enables us to do this. Suppose a doubly refracting mineral section so placed that it is [...] "extinguished"; if now is rotated through 45 degrees it will be brightly illuminated. If the <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge</b> be passed across it so that the long axis of the wedge is parallel to the axis of elasticity in the section the polarization colors will rise or fall. If they rise the axes of greater elasticity in the two minerals are parallel; if they sink the axis of greater elasticity in the one is parallel to that of lesser elasticity in the other. In the latter case by pushing the wedge sufficiently far complete darkness or compensation will result. Selenite wedges, selenite plates, mica wedges and mica plates are also used for this purpose. A <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge</b> also may be calibrated by determining the amount of double refraction in all parts of its length. If now it be used to produce compensation or complete extinction in any doubly refracting mineral section, we can ascertain what is the strength of the double refraction of the section because it is obviously equal and opposite to that of a known part of the <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to modifications of the microscope's optical system, petrographic microscopes {{allow for the}} insertion of specially-cut oriented filters of biaxial minerals (the <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge,</b> quarter-wave mica plate and half-wave mica plate), into the optical train between the polarizers to identify positive and negative birefringence, and in extreme cases, the mineral order when needed.|$|E
50|$|Babinet was {{interested}} in the optical properties of minerals throughout his career. He designed and created many scientific instruments utilized to determine crystalline structure and polarization properties, including the polariscope and an optical goniometer to measure refractive indices. The Babinet compensator, an accessory useful in polarized light microscopy, was built with twin, opposed quartz wedges having mutually perpendicular crystallographic axes, and is still widely employed in microscopy. This design avoids the problems inherent in the basic <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge,</b> where the zero reading coincides with the thin end of the wedge, which is often lost when grinding the plate during manufacture.|$|E

5000|$|A further {{refinement}} of microscopic methods {{consists of the}} use of strongly convergent polarized light (konoscopic methods). This is obtained by a wide angled achromatic condenser above the polarizer, and a high power microscopic objective. Those sections are most useful which are perpendicular to an optic axis, and consequently remain dark on rotation. If they belong to uniaxial crystals they show a dark cross or convergent light between crossed nicols, the bars of which remain parallel to the wires in the field of the eyepiece. Sections perpendicular to an optic axis of a biaxial mineral under the same conditions show a dark bar which on rotation becomes curved to a hyperbolic shape. If the section is perpendicular to a [...] "bisectrix" [...] (see Crystallography) a black cross is seen which on rotation opens out to form two hyperbolas, the apices of which are turned towards one another. The optic axes emerge at the apices of the hyperbolas and may be surrounded by colored rings, though owing to the thinness of minerals in rock sections these are only seen when the double refraction of the mineral is strong. The distance between the axes as seen in the field of the microscope depends partly on the axial angle of the crystal and partly on the numerical aperture of the objective. If it is measured by means of eye-piece micrometer, the optic axial angle of the mineral can be found by a simple calculation. The <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge,</b> quarter mica plate or selenite plate permit the determination of the positive or negative character of the crystal by the changes in the color or shape of the figures observed in the field. These operations are precisely similar to those employed by the mineralogist in the examination of plates cut from crystals. It is sufficient {{to point out that the}} petrological microscope in its modern development is an optical instrument of great precision, enabling us to determine physical constants of crystallized substances as well as serving to produce magnified images like the ordinary microscope. A great variety of accessory apparatus has been devised to fit it for these special uses.|$|E

40|$|A novel carrier fringe {{technique}} for photoelasticity stress analysis is described and verified experimentally. Linear carrier fringes generated {{by using a}} <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge</b> are superimposed on fringes formed by the stressed model. The resultant fringe pattern is then captured using a charge coupled device camera and stored in a digital frame buffer. A fast Fourier transform method is then used to process the complete photoelastic fringe image over the whole surface of the model. The experiment also uses a minimum spanning tree phase unwrapping strategy to create a continuous map of the whole stress field. Finally, the whole principal stress difference field has been calculated and plotted from one single exposure showing the methods' potential {{for use as a}} reflection analysis system suitable for application to nonstationary objects and complicated stress patterns...|$|E
40|$|The {{refractive}} index of an optically heterogeneous specimen will generally vary in directions parallel and normal to the microscope axis, but a mean index {{can be defined}} such that the optical thickness of the specimen {{is equal to the}} product of the mean index and the specimen thickness. If such a specimen is examined under an inter-ference microscope, the fringe displacement will be zero at those parts of the specimen for which the mean index is equal to the index of the immersion liquid. Thus, by gradually changing the index of the liquid relative to that of the specimen, one can determine {{the manner in which the}} mean index varies from region to region of the specimen. In the present work these changes in relative index have been effected by varying either the wavelength of the incident light or the temperature of the system. The Baker two-beam interference microscope has been successfully used for such investigations. Three types of interference pattern have been tried: (i) a single fringe is made to fill the field of view and the intensity differences between the specimen and the background are studied; (ii) monochromatic fringes are formed in a <b>quartz</b> <b>wedge</b> and their linear displacements are examined; and (iii) a quartz plate is used, channelled spectra being produced by the spectrographic analysis of the interference colours. The first two types can be used with either the temperature or the wavelength varia-tion method, but the third was specifically designed for use with the wavelength variation method. Although these experiments have mostly been carried out on bire-fringent fibres, the techniques are applicable to any kind of object. The attainable accuracy increases with specimen thickness; under favourable circumstances the index at any point of a specimen 10 fi thick should not be in error by more than Â± 3 Xio " 4...|$|E
