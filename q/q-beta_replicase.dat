40|$|A sensitive, nonisotopic {{hybridization}} assay termed "dual capture" is described. The assay rapidly and specifically detects very {{low levels of}} target nucleic acids and organisms. The assay {{is based on the}} principles of sandwich hybridization, reversible target capture, and <b>Q-Beta</b> <b>replicase</b> amplification. The assay can be completed in less than 4 h, and in the described model format, it detects Chlamydia trachomatis rRNA or rDNA. Up to 96 samples can be analyzed simultaneously. The assay employs two types of probes: a test-specific capture probe, which mediates the cycling of the target probe complex on and off derivatized magnetic beads, and a replicatable RNA detector molecule containing a sequence complementary to and adjacent to the capture probe site on the target. Following reversible target capture, detection of the signal is accomplished by replication of the detector molecule by <b>Q-Beta</b> <b>replicase</b> in the presence of propidium iodide. A specific assay signal can be detected from as few as 1, 000 molecules above the background. In a limited study of 94 urogenital samples the assay detected five of the six culture-positive samples and did not detect the C. trachomatis target in 85 of the 88 culture-negative samples...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a study {{conducted}} to evaluate the performance of manual Q-Beta replicase-amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex assay compared with that of culture for detecting M. tuberculosis directly from digested sputum pellets. A total of 261 specimens submitted to three tuberculosis testing laboratories were analyzed. Culture and acid-fast bacillus smear results were provided by the tuberculosis testing laboratories. Of these 261 specimens, 34 (13 % prevalence rate) were positive for M. tuberculosis by culture. The samples were digested and decontaminated by the testing laboratories by using their standard digestion and decontamination procedures. An aliquot of the digested and decontaminated pellet was sent to GENE-TRAK. The digested and decontaminated pellet was neutralized by washing it with 0. 067 M phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8), and the bacteria present in the washed pellet were heat inactivated at 100 degrees C for 15 min. The samples were combined with sample processing buffer containing GuSCN and were treated for 6 min in the GENE-TRAK Sample Processing Instrument to release the nucleic acids. The release rRNA was analyzed in a manual <b>Q-Beta</b> <b>replicase</b> assay format which incorporates elements of sandwich hybridization, reversible target capture, and <b>Q-beta</b> <b>replicase</b> signal amplification technologies. In comparison with culture, the overall assay sensitivity and specificity were 97. 1 and 96. 5 %, respectively. The positive predictive value was 80. 5 %, and the negative predictive value was 99. 5 %. After analysis of discrepant results, the assay sensitivity and specificity were 97. 3 and 97. 8, respectively, and the prevalence rate was 14 %. The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were 87. 8 and 99. 5 %, respectively. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|We {{have adapted}} an assay for the direct {{detection}} of Mycobacterium tuberculosis using a prototype automated instrument platform in which probes are amplified with <b>Q-beta</b> <b>replicase.</b> The assay {{was based on}} amplification of specific detector probe following four cycles of background reduction (reversible target capture) in a closed disposable pack. The assay signal was the time required for fluorescence to exceed background levels (response time [RT]). RT was inversely related {{to the number of}} M. tuberculosis rRNA target molecules in the sample. Equivalent signals and noises were observed in assays containing either sputum or buffer. All mock samples containing > or = 10 CFU of M. tuberculosis responded in the assay (average RT, 13. 91 min), while most (83 %) samples containing as many as 10 (7) CFU of Mycobacterium avium gave no response during a 25 -min amplification reaction. The samples containing M. avium which did respond had an average RT of 17. 04 min. Seventy-five percent (167 of 223) of samples containing no target gave no responses; the remaining 25 % had an average RT of 15. 53 min. Eighty-three frozen sputum samples were tested to develop a candidate cutoff RT for the assay prior to more extensive clinical testing. After resolution of discrepant results and with a 14 -min RT cutoff, 30 of 38 M. tuberculosis-positive samples were positive by the assay; 1 of 45 negative samples responded within 14 min. Assay sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negatives predictive values in this pilot study were 79, 98, 97, and 85 %, respectively...|$|E
40|$|We {{present data}} from a {{clinical}} trial study in which an automated version (Galileo) of a previously described Q-Beta replicase-amplified probe assay (J. S. Shah et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 33 : 1435 - 1441, 1995) {{was used for the}} direct detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in sputum. The assay was designed to target specific regions of 23 S rRNA found in M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, and Mycobacterium microti and had a sensitivity ranging from approximately < 10 to 300 CFU. The assay was tested for cross-hybridization by using large numbers (e. g., 10 (5) to 10 (10) CFU/assay) of 133 other organisms commonly found in respiratory tract samples, including non-M. tuberculosis Mycobacterium spp., other bacteria, fungi, and viruses. All of these competitors tested negative by the assay. Automated assay results for 780 respiratory tract samples (sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) collected and tested at three trial sites in the United States) were compared with the results of culture and acid-fast microscopy. Aliquots of conventionally digested and decontaminated sputum pellets were heated at 100 degrees C and mechanically disrupted prior to hybridization and background reduction, amplification, and detection in a closed disposable test pack. Pertinent elements of individual patient histories relating to tuberculosis exposure, previous active disease, antituberculosis therapy status, etc., were considered in the resolution of discrepant results for 48 (assay false-positive) samples. Seventy-one of 90 (78. 9 %) culture-positive samples were positive when tested in the Galileo assay, while 7 % of culture-negative samples were assay positive, corresponding to a sensitivity of 79 % and a specificity of 93 %. Following resolution of discrepant results by chart review, the sensitivity and specificity for the <b>Q-Beta</b> <b>replicase</b> amplification assay with the Galileo analyzer were 84 and 97 %, respectively. A total of 69. 2 % of smear-negative (culture positive) samples were detected by the assay. Ten test packs at a time were automatically processed by the Galileo analyzer without operator intervention following loading of samples. The first result was reported in approximately 3 h, and the last result was available in 6. 5 h. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a clinical study with a fully automated amplification probe hybridization assay for the detection of pathogens directly from a clinical specimen...|$|E
