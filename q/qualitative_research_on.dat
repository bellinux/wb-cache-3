5000|$|In natural {{sciences}} and social sciences, quantitative {{research is the}} systematic empirical investigation of observable phenomena via statistical, mathematical or computational techniques. [...] The objective of quantitative research is to develop and employ mathematical models, theories and hypotheses pertaining to phenomena. The process of measurement is central to quantitative research because it provides the fundamental connection between empirical observation and mathematical expression of quantitative relationships. Quantitative data is any data that is in numerical form such as statistics, percentages, etc. The researcher analyzes the data {{with the help of}} statistics. The researcher is hoping the numbers will yield an unbiased result that can be generalized to some larger population. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>research,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, asks broad questions and collects word data from phenomena or participants. The researcher looks for themes and describes the information in themes and patterns exclusive to that set of participants.|$|E

40|$|This article reviews a {{large number}} of {{articles}} that derive from <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> leadership that were published prior to 2004 in peer-reviewed journals. The article then goes on to examine critically but appreciatively the ways in which <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> leadership is and is not distinctive. This review shows that while qualitative research has made some important contributions to certain areas of leadership, such as the role of leaders in the change process, it is sometimes not as distinctive, when compared to quantitative research, as might be supposed. The piece also examines studies that combine quantitative with qualitative research. The different ways in which the two approaches are combined is a particular emphasis in this examination. In addition, the article explores the issue of whether the corpus of research that has been accumulated by qualitative researchers can be combined with that of quantitative researchers. A central ingredient of the discussion of qualitative research is the tendency for many researchers not to build sufficiently on the studies of leadership conducted by others. It is argued that giving greater attention to this issue will allow the contributions of <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> <b>on</b> leadership to become clearer...|$|E

Some of the themes or sub –categories under these three main categories include the following: separation, isolation and loneliness, family and economic dependence, communication barriers, physical and psychological illness, transportation and food challenges, and empowerment. These themes or sub-categories were presented alongside the general conditions affecting elderly immigrant women as reported by other literature.
