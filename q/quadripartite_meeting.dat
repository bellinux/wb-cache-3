25|$|On February 27, the {{students}} met with Shwe Mann, the Speaker of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw and the Joint Bill Committee {{to voice their}} concerns over the competing bills but {{they were told that}} the bills were already submitted to the parliament. Nanda Sit Aung, member of the ACDE, said that it was the violation of the quadripartite agreements because the bill that was submitted as the one proposed by students and the NNER was actually the one that everyone agreed at the <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zaw Htay, the Director General of Higher Education Department (Lower Myanmar) {{stated that}} {{negotiations}} were still open, after the students rejected {{a meeting with}} the ministry. He also said that students, parents and experts would be consulted in the process of crafting by-laws Shwe Mann, the speaker of Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, also agreed to accept written submissions to the parliament while EPIC also offered to serve as an intermediary. The students, however, announced that they had no intention to write submissions to the parliament because they were waiting for the <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting.</b>|$|E
25|$|On November 27, {{about fifty}} {{students}} from Mandalay, Sagaing, Monywa and Myingyan staged an unauthorized protest {{in front of}} City Hall in Mandalay to reiterate their demand: to convene a <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting.</b> The police at first stopped the students from exiting Eaindawyar Pagoda, their initial meeting point. The students, however, convinced the police that the officers’ children themselves would benefit from the protests {{and were able to}} march to the City Hall and ended their protest at Mahamuni Buddha Temple, a history significant place where 17 Burmese pro-independence leaders were killed during the colonial era.|$|E

50|$|On {{the night}} of June 16, 1948, the Soviet {{delegation}} unexpectedly withdrew from <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meetings.</b> The commandants and their respective staffs had been quibbling most of the day, having only reached one minor agreement. Towards midnight, Colonel Howley indicated he was tired, asked to be excused, and left his deputy to carry on.|$|R
25|$|On February 4, {{the student}} demonstrators from Ayeyarwady Region have arrived near Kyaunggon after they {{received}} a welcoming reception from the town residents. About 800 people also temporarily joined the students marching from Mandalay {{on their way to}} Taungdwingyi after the leaders gave a speech at Magwe Computer University. The students also planned to stay and protest in Pakokku for three days starting February 5 before they resumed their march to Yangon. At the same time, a committee representing about 260 civil society groups released a statement urging the government to continue <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meetings</b> and to refrain from the use of violence against student protestors.|$|R
25|$|On February 1 as the <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> {{was taking}} place, the NLD {{publicly}} announced that Thein Lwin, its central committee member {{and the chairman}} of National Network for Education Reform, did not represent the party or its policies. It further mentioned in the statement that the NLD could take legal action against Thein Lwin for violating party rules regarding asking permission to participate in organizations independent of the party. Han Tha Myint, a central committee member of the NLD, also stated that Aung San Suu Kyi, the chairman of the NLD, did not support Thein Lwin as his actions could be construed as representative of the party’s stance on the issue. The ACDE promptly responded to that statement the next day by accusing the NLD for attempting to undermine the student protests at such a critical moment.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> {{ended with}} the {{students}} reaching an agreement concerning eight preconditions on further negotiations although the government denied the request to ensure security to demonstrators. However, Aung Min, a President’s Office Minister, told the students that he would ask permission from the president {{the responsibility of the}} students' safety until they arrived in Popa in Mandalay Region. The first three preconditions from the students –issuing a public statement after every meeting, having information on education reforms available to the public, making sure all the parties involved in the meeting have equal opportunities to participate – were readily accepted while agreement on officially recognizing student and teacher unions was reached after four-hour long discussion albeit many details pending for further discussions. Furthermore, the meeting ended without any discussions on the eleven-point demands that the ACDE issued even though the students reached to an official agreement to continue the negotiations on February 3.|$|E
25|$|On November 14, about 350 {{students}} {{gathered in}} front of Maha Bandula Park in downtown Yangon to stage a protest against the National Education Law. The students also later held subsequent protests at Yangon University and Shwedagon Pagoda. Moreover, Kyaw Ko Ko, the chairman of ABFSU, declared that the protest {{was just the beginning}} of the fight to reform National Education Law. He also stated that the main concern against the NEL is the formation of a National Education Commission composed of ministers and government officials that could limit students’ opinions and further reinforce the government control over higher education. The protest also coincided with United States President Barack Obama’s second visit to Yangon although Kyaw Ko Ko claimed that it was not intentional. He added, though, that the students would be ready to seize the opportunity to raise awareness about issues on education. The Action Committee for Democratic Education then requested the government to convene a <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> with its members, NNER, members of Parliament and the government to discuss the students’ concerns. On 17 November, the students announced a 60-day interval for the government to respond to their demands and also threatened that they would stage a nationwide protests if the government didn’t respond within the deadline.|$|E
50|$|As time passed, the <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meetings</b> of the Kommandatura {{got more}} and more heated and cantankerous. The western allied representatives were more or less unified in their view of how Berlin was to be governed, which often starkly contrasted with the Soviet point of view, not {{surprisingly}} so. Issues would be debated for weeks, and even months. One such issue was Kotikov's Fourteen Points regarding the legal and material position of the workers of Berlin. For eight months the Kommandatura debated this topic making no real headway. Without Kommandatura approval, the Soviet Military Administration issued Order No. 20 in their own sector, making all fourteen points law. This did not sit well with the others, nor did it abide the spirit of quadripartite and unanimous city governance.|$|R

25|$|On February 3, {{in front}} of Ministry of Education {{headquarter}} in Naypyidaw, the students announced {{that they would be}} resuming their nationwide protests. Earlier that day, the government declared that the second <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting. During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president. The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president’s advice after a discussion. That early afternoon, the Ministry of Information released photos of government delegates standing in an empty room with a caption saying that the students did not show up to the meeting. Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12. The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south. On the same day, Aung San Su Kyi confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking Thein Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER. Initially silent on the topic, U Thein Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, the NLD {{released}} {{a statement saying that}} Thein Lwin, a member of NNER, was suspended from his position in the party’s central executive committee indefinitely. Another statement released by the NLD also announced the suspension of its Central Education Committee chaired by Thein Lwin. Aung San Su Kyi, the leader of the NLD, also said that it was a conflict of interest for a party member to be involved in an organization independent of the party. Thein Lwin responded by saying that he believed “student demands are righteous”. The statement came out as Thein Lwin along with other education advocates and student representatives attended the third <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> with Deputy Minister of Education and reached an agreement to resume further talks on February 11 at Yangon Region Parliamentary building. At the same time, the students marching from Mandalay were approaching Pyay in Bago Region and were about a mile away from a barricade set up by 200 riot police and 100 Swan Arr Shin members. About 300 residents from nearby towns accompanied the students to protect them due to rumors of a possible crackdown. Meanwhile, the students marching from Tanintharyi Region arrived in Mawlamyine, the capital of Mon State the day before and held several demonstrations joined by the locals (thein lwin suspended). The third group leaving from Ayeyarwady Region reportedly arrived in Maubin, about 100 miles away from Yangon. In Dedaye, in the northwest of Maubin and about 56 miles from Yangon, around 400 riot police were deployed. The student protesters called for negotiations with the police in case of a potential confrontation and the police informed that they were there to provide security not to stop the protests. Moreover, the fourth group of around 300 students left Pakokku, following the path that the group from Mandalay took several weeks ago.|$|E

50|$|For {{the balance}} of June, the Soviets did {{participate}} in limited <b>quadripartite</b> sub-committee <b>meetings,</b> and their clerical staff remained through July. But as of August 1, 1948, they lowered the red flag, removed their files, and the Soviets were gone for good. After that the three western sectors operated independently and unilaterally for a time. They resumed official Kommandatura meetings on November 8, 1948, but then only ever on a tripartite basis.|$|R
2500|$|On January 28, {{the student}} representatives and the {{government}} had a meeting in Naypyidaw – attended by ten student representatives, two members of parliament and Minister Aung Min as well as Deputy Education Minister Thant Shin. [...] The government and the student leaders then released a joint statement announcing that they had agreed to stop the march to Yangon after the <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> which would {{be held at the}} Diamond Jubilee Hall at Yangon University on February 1. The statement also said that 11 demand-points from the students would also be discussed at the meeting on February 1. Meanwhile, the students declared that until they met with their representatives who went to Naypyidaw for the meeting, they would still continue the march. On the other hand, the protesters in Pakokku and Dawei who were planning to join the march suspended their plans.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the fourth}} <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> on February 14 went without any issues, the student leaders and NNER began to craft the {{proposed}} amendment bill, which they finished on February 15. [...] {{and the bill}} was submitted to the parliament on February 16. Student groups from Ayeyarwady Region and Tanintharyi Region decided to suspend their march after hearing {{the result of the}} meeting. Student organizers also stated {{one of the reasons they}} decided to go back was because of Ashin Nyanisarra, one of the most respected monks in Myanmar, who told them to take pride in what they achieved and go back to continue their education for the future of the country. In another statement, Ashin Nyanisarra told the government to forgive the students and to accept their demands. Meanwhile, the main group of protesters from Mandalay continued to march from Minla to Letpadan in Bago Region and planned to arrive in Yangon in ten days [...] despite announcement by the government the day before that it would be taking legal actions against the protesters if they continued their march to Yangon.|$|E
2500|$|On February 22, at a {{press conference}} in Yangon, the {{students}} accused the government for violating the agreements as the government submitted the Ministry of Education’s version of the amendment bill alongside with the one agreed upon at the quadripartite meetings. Earlier that week on February 17, the Ministry of Education presented two proposed bills, claiming that the ministry crafted one of them. The bill that the Ministry of Education proposed, according to Thein Lwin, the chairman of NNER, was the one presented at first at the <b>quadripartite</b> <b>meeting</b> but agreed to be discarded by the government. The competing drafts in the parliament might delay the process and could take up to a month according to Phyo Min Thein, a member of parliament representing the NLD. [...] Despite concerns from the students, the two proposed bills seemed to have some features in common. They both stated that schools and universities will be independent from the National Education Commission; that the school system would cater to students with disabilities; that the students would have the right to choose subjects they want to study except for those mandatory to pass the matriculation; that students and teachers would have the right to form unions and if necessary with financial help from university administration; that schools would be able to choose which language to teach; and that the government would increase the funding to 20% of the national budget in five years.|$|E
