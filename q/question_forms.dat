6000|$|I shall beg leave, before I go any further, to {{take notice}} of some paltry artifices which the abettors of {{election}} as the only lawful title to the crown are ready to employ, in order to render {{the support of the}} just principles of our Constitution a task somewhat invidious. These sophisters substitute a fictitious cause, and feigned personages, in whose favor they suppose you engaged, whenever you defend the inheritable nature of the crown. It is common with them to dispute as if they were in a conflict with some of those exploded fanatics of slavery who formerly maintained, what I believe no creature now maintains, [...] "that the crown is held by divine, hereditary, and indefeasible right." [...] These old fanatics of single arbitrary power dogmatized as if hereditary royalty was the only lawful government in the world,--just as our new fanatics of popular arbitrary power maintain that a popular election is the sole lawful source of authority. The old prerogative enthusiasts, it is true, did speculate foolishly, and perhaps impiously too, as if monarchy had more of a divine sanction than any other mode of government,--and as if a right to govern by inheritance were in strictness indefeasible in every person who should be found in the succession to a throne, and under every circumstance, which no civil or political right can be. But an absurd opinion concerning the king's hereditary right to the crown does not prejudice one that is rational, and bottomed upon solid principles of law and policy. If all the absurd theories of lawyers and divines were to vitiate the objects in which they are conversant, we should have no law and no religion left in the world. But an absurd theory on one side of a <b>question</b> <b>forms</b> no justification for alleging a false fact or promulgating mischievous maxims on the other.|$|E

40|$|Two quite {{different}} reasons for using open-ended {{as opposed to}} close-ended questions can be distinguished. One is to discover the responses that individuals give spontaneously; {{the other is to}} avoid the bias that may result from suggesting responses to individuals. However, open-ended questions also have disadvantages in comparison to close-ended, such as the need for extensive coding and larger item non-response. While this issue has already been well researched for traditional survey questionnaires, not much research has been devoted to it in recently used Web questionnaires. We therefore examine the differences between the open-ended and the close-ended question form in Web questionnaires by means of experiments within the large-scale RIS 2001 Web survey. The question “What is the most important, critical problem the Internet is facing today? ” was asked in an open-ended and two close-ended <b>question</b> <b>forms</b> in a split-ballot experiment. The results show that there were differences between <b>question</b> <b>forms</b> in univariate distributions, though {{no significant differences were found}} in the ranking of values. Close-ended questions in general yield higher percentages than open-ended question for answers that are identical in both <b>question</b> <b>forms.</b> It seems that respondents restricted themselves with apparent ease to the alternatives offered on the close-ended forms, whereas on the open-ended question they produced a much more diverse set of answers. In addition, our results suggest that open-ended questions produce more missing data than close-ended. Moreover, there were more inadequate answers for open-ended question. This suggests that open-ended questions should be more explicit in their wording (at least for Web surveys, as a self administered mode of data collection) than close-ended questions, which are more specified with given response alternatives...|$|E
