2500|$|Of all {{cylinder}} layouts without {{balance shaft}} a straight eight design has very low inherent vibration, while the side-valve layout contains {{the moving parts}} of the valve train within the cast-iron block, enabling it to be very quiet compared to an overhead valve configuration (as in the contemporary Buick engines).

At the time of its use a <b>quiet</b> <b>engine</b> was thought to be a mark of quality in an automobile. Bores need be of small diameter to keep the engine length down and so strokes must be long to obtain larger displacements - such configurations (called [...] "undersquare") exhibit good low-rpm torque and are capable of slow idle speeds, enhancing both drivability and quietness.

50|$|The {{layout of}} the H-drive {{drivetrain}} contributed greatly to its low silhouette, agility and - an important consideration in any vehicle used in the reconnaissance role, an exceptionally <b>quiet</b> <b>engine</b> and running gear. Power was led forward to a centrally-located transfer box and single differential driving separate left and right hand shafts, each in turn running forwards and back to a bevel box powering each wheels. This extremely space-efficient layout resulted in a low-slung vehicle with a flat plate that allowed the Dingo to slide across uneven ground, but this feature made the Dingo extremely vulnerable to mines.|$|E

50|$|The BMW was smoother, more reliable, but as {{expensive}} as the Harley and better suited to a weekend trip than crossing a continent. Large Japanese bikes of the time, such as the Honda CB750 and the Kawasaki Z1 were relatively inexpensive but troubled by vibration, by the need for drive chain maintenance and by gas tanks too small for their thirsty engines. The Gold Wing was aimed at a market segment that did not yet exist: American riders not likely to buy a Harley or BMW but who would open their wallets for an affordable machine offering comfort, endurance, low-maintenance and a high-torque, smooth, <b>quiet</b> <b>engine.</b> Honda would ultimately be quite successful in attracting {{a new kind of}} long distance rider.|$|E

50|$|A {{road test}} of the family saloon by The Times {{motoring}} correspondent published {{at the end of}} June 1931 noted that the seating for five passengers is comfortable and there is a wide view right round. The forward side windows can be wound right down but the large rear windows only as much as a third of the way. The opening windscreen is safety glass with one electric wiper and a reflecting mirror is provided. There are no ashtrays and there were slight squeaks in the body. A stoplight is fitted and a luggage grid. A spare artillery wheel and tyre are fitted in a well on the front wing.

50|$|U-864 was a Type IX U-boat, {{designed}} for ocean-going voyages {{far from home}} ports with limited re-supply. She was on a long-range, covert mission codenamed Operation Caesar to deliver highly sensitive technology to Germany's wartime ally, the Empire of Japan. This included parts for jet engines and missile guidance systems, and 65 tonnes of mercury. She also carried Tadao Yamoto (a Japanese acoustic torpedo expert) and Toshio Nakai (a Japanese fuel expert). Also included were two Messerschmitt engineers, Rudolf ("Rolf") von Chlingensperg and Riclef Schomerus. On 6 February 1945, U-864 passed through the Fedje area (off the coast of Norway) without being detected. During this voyage a normally <b>quiet</b> <b>engine</b> began making an abnormally loud and rhythmic noise that could be easily detected by any ASW equipment in the area. There were many Allied (primarily British) ships, submarines and aircraft in the area on anti-submarine patrol.

30|$|The {{internal}} combustion (IC) engine {{is a major}} source of automobile noise (Sanjid et al. 2014), and as the standards for automobile noise are becoming increasingly strict, there is greater demand for <b>quieter</b> <b>engines.</b> The process of induction plays a large part in creating engine noise. For some small high-speed machines and some other large turbochargers, the induction noise can reach up to 5  dB (A) higher than the engine noise sometimes (Chiatti et al. 2015). Therefore, it is of great significance to find an approach to control induction noise (Mondal et al. 2014).|$|R

In 1968 a Colt 1100F two-door was brought over to the United Kingdom for evaluation, and was also tested by Car Magazine. They praised the revvy engine and the sturdy suspension, but considered the car cramped and said that the ride was bouncy and inclined to pitch. The Colt also had a very <b>quiet</b> <b>engine,</b> with very little road and wind noise. In the end nothing came of it, and Mitsubishi (as the Colt Car Company) stayed out of the UK until 1974.|$|E
