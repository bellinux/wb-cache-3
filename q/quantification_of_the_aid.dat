40|$|Polyisoprenoid {{alcohols}} are {{representatives of}} high-molecular terpenoids. Their hydrocarbon chains are built of 5 {{to more than}} 100 isoprene units giving rise to polymer molecules that differ in chain-length and/or geometrical configuration. Plants {{have been shown to}} accumulate diverse polyisoprenoid mixtures with tissue-specific composition. In this chapter, methods of analysis of polyisoprenoid alcohols in plant material are described, including isolation and purification of polyisoprenoids from plant tissue, fast semiquantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polyisoprenoid profile by thin-layer chromatography (straight phase adsorption and reversed phase partition techniques), and <b>quantification</b> <b>of</b> polyisoprenoids with <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> <b>of</b> high performance liquid chromatography. This approach results in full characterization of complex polyisoprenoid mixtures accumulated in various plant tissues and other matrixes...|$|R
