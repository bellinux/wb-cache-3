40|$|Quantum {{computing}} {{may still}} be decades away from realization but the pieces necessary {{for the construction of}} the first <b>quantum</b> <b>chip</b> are beginning to come together. One piece still eluding researchers is the ability to address individual atoms within a scalable <b>quantum</b> <b>chip</b> structure. The resolution to this issue may be found in any one of several promising implementations, including the use of neutral atoms trapped in 2 D optical lattices. One method of constructing such lattices, which {{has been shown to be}} computationally viable, employs the diffraction pattern just behind a circular aperture. Laser wavelength stability plays a crucial role in this approach, which entails constructing a 2 D optical lattice with an array of pinholes, populating the lattice with atoms collected by a magneto optical trap (MOT), and manipulating the atoms trapped within the lattice structure for quantum computations. Experimental work was done toward achieving the laser wavelength stability required for these tasks. First, we investigated inadequate temperature control of the laser diodes and a thermal mass issue attributed to the laser mounts was resolved. We proceeded to analyze the electronics of the laser locking feedback system, which were failing to hold the lasers steady at a desired wavelength. Several noise sources contributing to signal instability were identified and eliminated, but drifting of the error signal was persistent. A subsequent fix was then made to the locking electronics and sufficient laser wavelength stability was demonstrated when atoms were trapped for the first time in the Cal Poly MOT on September 2, 2011...|$|E

30|$|Two-dimensional multi-quantum dots can be {{realized}} on a mechanically exfoliated graphene flake followed by the hydrogen plasma treatment without executing post-exfoliation thermal annealing. The overlapped Coulomb blockade diamonds observed from the electrical measurements, {{as well as the}} monotonic increase of the number of Coulomb peaks with the ascending temperature, suggest the formation of two-dimensional multi-quantum dots that is unprecedented on the annealed graphene flakes with similar hydrogenation processes. Therefore, we suggest a defect (or vacancy) and impurity-related mechanism to account for the formation of the multi-quantum dots discovered on our device. Further characterizations, such as AFM or SEM, on the atomic structure of un-annealed graphene layers might shed light on the origin of the quantum dot formation, whereas the degree of post-growth annealing could be utilized to engineer the quantum dots in terms of its size, density, shape, or charging states in a cost-effective way for <b>quantum</b> <b>chip</b> device applications.|$|E

Machine {{learning has}} been previously applied to decode the surface code. However, these approaches are not scalable as the training has to be redone for every system size which becomes increasingly difficult. In this work the existence of local decoders for higher dimensional codes leads us to use a low-depth convolutional neural network to locally assign a likelihood of error on each qubit. For noiseless syndrome measurements, numerical simulations show that the decoder has a threshold of around 7. 1 % when applied to the 4 D toric code. When the syndrome measurements are noisy, the decoder performs better for larger code sizes when the error probability is low. We also give theoretical and numerical analysis to show how a convolutional neural network is different from the 1 -nearest neighbor algorithm, which is a baseline machine learning method.

40|$|Quantum {{algorithms}} can {{be described}} by quantum circuits which consist of quantum bits (qubits) and quantum gates. Such a circuit description assumes that any kind of interaction between qubits is possible. However, <b>quantum</b> <b>chips</b> have limited qubits connectivity only allowing, for instance, nearest-neighbor (NN) interactions. That means, qubits need {{to be placed in}} adjacent positions for performing a two-qubit gate. In this thesis, a routing algorithm is proposed where physical qubits or planar-based logical qubits are routed to obey this nearest neighbor constraint in a 2 D qubit topology. This algorithm tries to minimize the circuit latency or communication overhead. The proposed routing algorithm is based on a sliding window principle. Different paths, found by using an adapted breadth-first search algorithm, are evaluated based on the interleaving of the corresponding routing instructions, e. g., SWAP operations with previous instructions, and by looking at the disordering of future qubits. The path that will add the lowest number of cycles to the algorithm is then selected and efficiently inserted {{with the rest of the}} instructions. This process continues until all the instructions inside the quantum algorithm obey the nearest neighbor constraints. The routing algorithm is tested for several real quantum algorithms taken from QLib and ScaffCC, as well as for random generated benchmarks. Taking different alternative paths into account and evaluating those paths for possible interleaving with previous instructions, always has a positive effect to minimize the number of added cycles. The results concerning the evaluation of the disordering of future qubits could have a positive or negative effect on the circuit latency depending on the quantum circuit.

Such advancement is demonstrated by two application examples in <b>quantum</b> optics on <b>chip.</b> In the first example, we show that the nonlinear Kerr effect can be generated and amplified to be comparable with the linear effect in a transmission line resonator (TLR).
