6000|$|Oh what a {{crossing}} for the straighteners {{and the old}} brown dress--which latter appurtenance {{the child}} saw thriftily revived for the possible disasters of travel! The wind {{got up in the}} night and from her little room at the inn Maisie could hear the noise of the sea. The next day it was raining and everything different: this was the case even with Susan Ash, who positively crowed over the bad weather, partly, it seemed, for relish of the time their visitor would have in the boat, and partly to point the moral of the folly of coming to such holes. In the wet, with Sir Claude, Maisie went to the Folkestone packet, on the arrival of which, with many signs of the fray, he made her wait under an umbrella by the quay; whence almost ere the vessel touched, he was to be descried, in quest of their friend, wriggling--that had been his word--through the invalids massed upon the deck. It was long till he reappeared--it was not indeed till every one had landed; when he presented the object of his benevolence in a light that Maisie scarce knew whether to suppose the depth of prostration or the flush of triumph. The lady on his arm, still bent beneath her late ordeal, was muffled in such draperies as had never before offered so much support to so much woe. At the hotel, an hour later, this ambiguity dropped: assisting Mrs. Wix in private to refresh and reinvest herself, Maisie heard from her in detail how little she could have achieved if Sir Claude hadn't put it in her power. It was a phrase that in her room she repeated in connexions indescribable: he had put it in her power to have [...] "changes," [...] as she said, of the most intimate order, adapted to climates and occasions so various as to foreshadow in themselves the stages of a vast itinerary. Cheap weeks would of course be in their place after so much money spent on a governess; sums not grudged, however, by this lady's pupil, even on her feeling her own appearance give rise, through the straighteners, to an attention perceptibly mystified. Sir Claude in truth had had less time to devote to it than to Mrs. Wix's; and moreover she would rather be in her own shoes than in her friend's creaking new ones {{in the event of an}} encounter with Mrs. Beale. Maisie was too lost in the idea of Mrs. Beale's judgement of so much newness to pass any judgement herself. Besides, after much luncheon and many endearments, the question took quite another turn, to say nothing of the pleasure of the child's <b>quick</b> <b>view</b> that there were other eyes than Susan Ash's to open to what she could show. She couldn't show much, alas, till it stopped raining, which it declined to do that day; but this had only the effect of leaving more time for Mrs. Wix's own demonstration. It came as they sat in the little white and gold salon which Maisie thought the loveliest place she had ever seen except perhaps the apartment of the Countess; it came while the hard summer storm lashed the windows and blew in such a chill that Sir Claude, with his hands in his pockets and cigarettes in his teeth, fidgeting, frowning, looking out and turning back, ended by causing a smoky little fire to be made in the dressy little chimney. It came in spite of something that could only be named his air of wishing to put it off; an air that had served him--oh as all his airs served him!--to the extent of his having for a couple of hours confined the conversation to gratuitous jokes and generalities, kept it on the level of the little empty coffee-cups and petits verres (Mrs. Wix had two of each!) that struck Maisie, through the fumes of the French fire and the English tobacco, as a token more than ever that they were launched. She felt now, in close quarters and as clearly as if Mrs. Wix had told her, that what this lady had come over for was not merely to be chaffed and to hear her pupil chaffed; not even to hear Sir Claude, who knew French in perfection, imitate the strange sounds emitted by the English folk at the hotel. It was perhaps half an effect of her present renovations, as if her clothes had been somebody's else: she had at any rate never produced such an impression of high colour, of a redness associated in Maisie's mind at THAT pitch either with measles or with [...] "habits." [...] Her heart was not at all in the gossip about Boulogne; and if her complexion was partly the result of the déjeuner and the petits verres it was also the brave signal of what she was there to say. Maisie knew when this did come how anxiously it had been awaited by the youngest member of the party. [...] "Her ladyship packed me off--she almost put me into the cab!" [...] That was what Mrs. Wix at last brought out.|$|E

Used judiciously in conjunction with the volume of exports, TCI can give <b>quick</b> <b>views</b> of trends, benchmarks and potential. Though there is found to be a positive correlation between the profits and forex earnings, we cannot blindly conclude the increase in the profits is due to the increase in the forex earnings. The TCI is an effective criteria, but need to be complemented with other criteria to have better inferences.|$|R

The site mainly re-transmits TV channels, but also allows users to upload their own videos and shows. Functions such as broadcasting, viewing, channel listing, live chatting, and discussion boards are provided. Users are required to install 'Afreeca Player' for grid delivery. Independent broadcasters called Broadcasting Jockeys (BJs) deliver live broadcasts to viewers, who can add them to their list of favorite channels using an Afreeca Player tool.

Some aid {{in opening}} sequencing files (e.g. DNAapp, see Nguyen, et al., 2014), bringing mobility {{to an analysis}} that was once limited to desktop/laptops. With these apps, pictures of sequences can also be processed (e.g. DNA Shot app) making impromptu lab analysis easier and more convenient than ever before, even without computers. With the sequences available, sequence alignment analyses are typically next used. However for such analysis, the small screen of portable devices often makes it challenging for viewing long sequences and perform other complex analysis. This limitation may in time be addressed by significant developments in the interface and design of smartphone technology, perhaps through gesture or eyeball tracking.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} 4 GB MinoHD {{only has}} a 3.5mm Jack socket (4-way TRRS : Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve or A/V : audio-video) to composite (RCA) output for connecting to a television or input into other media viewing monitors. This was a major drawback to <b>quick</b> <b>viewing</b> of videos on a High Definition Television, considering that the produced video is captured in 720p high definition and composite cables are unable to transmit HD resolution to HD capable televisions. This flaw was corrected in the later released 8 GB version that now harnesses a mini HDMI output port, which now gives the option for Mini HDMI to composite (RCA) or component cables as well as Mini HDMI to HDMI allowing videos to be viewed in full HD on an HD capable television directly from the MinoHD camcorder.|$|R

The updated version featured caching, hardware acceleration, HTML5 video, <b>quick</b> <b>views,</b> cleaner arrangement of photos and infinite scrolling. Microsoft also doubled the file size limit from 50 MB to 100 MB per file. With this update, Microsoft consolidated the different entry points for SkyDrive, such as Windows Live Photos and Windows Live Office, into one single interface. Files and folders shared with a user, {{including those in}} Windows Live Groups, were also accessible in the new interface. On November 29, 2011, Microsoft updated SkyDrive to make sharing and file management easier, as well as HTML5 and other updates.

40|$|Retrieval {{in current}} {{multimedia}} databases is usually limited to browsing and searching based on low-level visual features and explicit textual descriptors. Semantic aspects of visual information are mainly described in full text attributes or mapped onto specialized, application specific description schemes. Result lists of queries are commonly represented by textual descriptions and single key frames. This approach is valid for text documents and images, but is often insufficient to represent video content {{in a meaningful}} way. In this paper we present a multimedia retrieval framework focusing on video objects, which fully relies on the MPEG- 7 standard as information base. It provides a content-based retrieval interface which uses hierarchical content-based video summaries to allow for <b>quick</b> <b>viewing</b> and browsing through search results even on bandwidth limited Web applications. Additionally semantic meaning about video content can be annotated based on domain specific ontologies, enabling a more targeted search for content. Our experiences and results with these techniques {{will be discussed in}} this paper.
