On March 24, 2014, the Senate voted 78-17 to advance the bill to floor consideration. Consideration of the bill was withdrawn, however, the next day, after a decision by Majority Leader Harry Reid. Instead of continuing with this bill and it's controversial International Monetary Fund provisions, the Senate was to take up a House-passed bill already offering Ukraine loan guarantees, amending it to add sanctions provisions.|$|E

50|$|Uganda was {{a member}} of the International Coffee Organization (ICO), a {{consortium}} of coffee-producing nations that set international production quotas and prices. The ICO set Uganda's annual export quota at only 4 percent of worldwide coffee exports. During December 1988, a wave of coffee buying pushed the ICO price up and triggered two increases of 1 million (60- kilogram) bags each in worldwide coffee production limits. The rising demand and rising price resulted in a 1989 global <b>quota</b> <b>increase</b> to 58 million bags. Uganda's export quota rose only by about 3,013 bags, however, bringing it to just over 2.3 million bags. Moreover, Uganda's entire <b>quota</b> <b>increase</b> was allocated to arabica coffee, which was grown primarily in the small southeastern region of Bugisu. In revenue terms, Uganda's overall benefit from the world price increase was small, as prices for robusta coffee—the major export—remained depressed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Increasing IMF quotas (or {{changing}} their distribution) requires {{the approval of}} the United States, which maintains enough votes at the IMF to block such decisions. Any change in the U. S. quota, in turn, must be approved by the U. S. Congress – a feature of U. S. law which gives Congress a central role in quota determination. In this paper, I analyze congressional votes on legislation to increase the U. S. quota subscription to the IMF. I argue that legislators are more likely to support a <b>quota</b> <b>increase</b> (1) the more “liberal ” their ideology, (2) the larger the share of high-skilled “pro-globalization ” voters residing in their districts, and (3) the larger the share of campaign contributions they get from banks that specialize in international lending. Statistical tests of congressional voting on requests for quota increases in 1983 and 1998 provide support for these arguments. 2 1...|$|E

This study addresses several important negotiations, using {{the agricultural sector}} model CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact Analysis), to analyze liberalization scenarios between the European Union and the Mercosur countries focusing particularly on their impacts in Brazil. Four possible agreements between Europe and Mercosur are simulated, including a broader multilateral agreement proposed in the G 20. The results suggest that a bilateral scenario involving larger tariff rate <b>quota</b> <b>increase,</b> as called for by Mercosur, generates larger gains than accepting the European Union proposal of 2004 or further multilateral trade liberalization based on the G 20 proposal. However, much larger increases in tariff rate quotas for all products are not necessarily justified in all cases. Moreover, Brazil's production and export potential is limited by factors other than trade restrictions. Copyright (c) 2009 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|E

40|$|For many fisheries, {{there is}} a need to develop {{appropriate}} indicators, methodologies, and rules for sustainably harvesting marine resources. Complexities of scientific and financial factors often prevent addressing these, but new methodologies offer significant improvements on current and historical approaches. The Australian spanner crab fishery is used to demonstrate this. Between 1999 and 2006, an empirical management procedure using linear regression of fishery catch rates was used to set the annual total allowable catch (quota). A 6 -year increasing trend in catch rates revealed shortcomings in the methodology, with a 68 % increase in quota calculated for the 2007 fishing year. This large <b>quota</b> <b>increase</b> was prevented by management decision rules. A revised empirical management procedure was developed subsequently, and it achieved a better balance between responsiveness and stability. Simulations identified precautionary harvest and catch rate baselines to set quotas that ensured sustainable crab biomass and favourable performance for management and industry. The management procedure was simple to follow, cost-effective, robust to strong trends and changes in catch rates, and adaptable for use in many fisheries. Application of such “tried-and-tested” empirical systems will allow improved management of both data-limited and data-rich fisheries...|$|E
40|$|The {{premise of}} this study is {{represented}} by the idea according to which the information quality, both as an intrinsic message and a transmission modality, influences the learning efficiency. In this attempt, we present some of the ICT applications to sports training activities, aiming at learning one technical element from rhythmic gymnastics. These applications could be used either in the learning process (as an image support for the subjects involved in this task, by facilitating their proper mental representation), or in the teaching approach (by a suggestive presentation of a methodical path in order to acquire the corporal technique elements). We shall focus in this study on the first option. By ICT use, the teacher’s message becomes more consistent by joining images and data that can be (re) visualized during the lesson. Due to the image processing soft, subjects become accustomed in real time with the technical mechanism of the element to be learned. Thus, the intuition principle operates more actively by far.

40|$|To {{understand}} the metal tolerance of a bloom-forming cyanobacterium. Microcystis aeruginosa, we investigated its acclimation to and recovery from cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) exposure. The intracellular Cd and Zn (intra-Ccl and intra-Zn) <b>quotas</b> <b>increased</b> upon acclimation to increased metal concentrations and were reduced following 1 -day or 5 -day recovery. Different acclimation to varying metal concentrations or durations (5 days or 15 days) {{did not have}} significant effects on the short-term uptake of Cd or Zn, whereas a 1 -day recovery period promoted Cd or Zn uptake significantly. The values of median growth-inhibition concentrations (free ion concentration or intracellular <b>quota)</b> <b>increased</b> when the cyanobacterial cells were acclimated to higher Cd or Zn concentrations, indicating that M. aeruginosa became more tolerant to these metals. Consistent with the significant increase in metal uptake, the cyanobacteria become very sensitive to metals following 1 -day recovery. A longer recovery (5 days) led to comparable uptake and toxicity responses to the controls. The efflux rate constants {{were not significantly different}} following metal acclimation. In the subcellular metal measurements, Cd was mostly distributed in the soluble fraction, whereas Zn was distributed evenly in the adsorbed, insoluble and soluble fractions of the cells. This study suggested the strong ability of these cyanobacteria to acclimate to different environments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing quotas to an open access fishery. When quotas are introduced, effort should decrease. This leads to higher prices and lower costs. Thus, overall profits should increase. An empirical analysis of profits in the Norwegian cod fisheries is conducted. Quotas were introduced in this fishery in 1990, and the dataset used covers 1985 - 2005. The research question is: Did profits rise in Norwegian fisheries for cod, after quotas were introduced? Because the quotas limit {{the activity of the}} fishers, the stock is affected. In order to see whether <b>quotas</b> <b>increased</b> profits, it is necessary to do an analysis with levels of stock as it would have developed without the quotas. Therefore a simulation of the stock is done. This is used to simulate landings and profits. The empirical results suggest that there have been a considerable increase in profits for the fishers after 1990. Few variables on effort and opportunities explain profits. Binary variables for years with and without quotas, however, explain a lot of the change in profits. The effects of other changes to policy and market conditions are also controlled for. These indicate that the <b>quotas</b> <b>increased</b> profits in two rounds. First right after the introduction, and then again some years later, as fishers started to trade quotas...|$|R

Material and Methods:All of the alumni whose CBSE results were recorded in the files from 1986 till 2003 (n= 305) were selected in this cross-sectional study. Data were gathered by a questionnaire including the results of CBSE, and educational and demographic data. The prevalence of failure in CBSE was calculated. Chi-square, Fisher exact test, independent t-test, multivariate stepwise linear regression, logistic regression, crude and adjusted odds Ratio were used to analyze the status of the probable risk factors. Results:The prevalence of failure in the CBSE was 4. 9 %. Univariate analysis showed that temporary student transfers to other universities, delay in passing basic sciences courses, low GPA in basic sciences courses and high school, older age and non-regional <b>quota</b> <b>increase</b> the failure risk in CBSE; in this regard, multivariate logistic regression reported that GPA in basic sciences courses is the only significant effective factor. In addition, the basic sciences GPA was reported as the most important influential factor on the score of basic sciences exam.

40|$|In this study, we {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} an increased volumetric water price and {{the implementation of a}} water quota on management decisions, income, income risk and utility of an arable farmer in the Broye River Basin, western Switzerland. We develop a bio-economic whole-farm model, which couples the process-based crop growth model CropSyst with an economic decision model at farm scale and use a genetic algorithm as optimization technique. This integrated modelling approach is employed to optimize the farmer's management decisions with regard to crop land use as well as crop-specific nitrogen fertilization and irrigation intensities under different climate and water policy scenarios. Our results show that the farm's water demand will increase by almost 100 % under climate change. However, both, an increased volumetric water price and a water quota, are under current and future expected climate conditions effective policy measures to reduce the farm's water consumption. At the same time, due to adjustments in the crop mix as well as in crop-specific nitrogen fertilization and irrigation strategies, both policies lead to losses in farm income and in the farmer's utility of only about 10 %. Nevertheless, a higher water price as well as a water <b>quota</b> <b>increase</b> under future expected climate conditions the crop farm's downside risk exposure (i. e. probability of low farm incomes) ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the rapid}} growth of borrowing of the International Monetary Fund during the global financial and economic crisis. According to the Articles of Agreement of the IMF, the basis of its financial resources consists of its own funds created from paid-in capital (quotas) by the Member States. Only if it appears to be that those resources are not sufficient for its ongoing financial operations, the Fund has a possibility to borrow. However, due to the large growth of demand for the Fund's resources induced by the global financial and economic crisis since 2008, the dominant position in the structure of its financial resources has been overtaken by borrowing on bilateral and multilateral grounds. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the reasons why borrowing has by far overgrown the role of supplementary source of the IMF resources during the crisis. The paper starts from the hypothesis that the reasons are of institutional nature since the very method of decision making on overall <b>quota</b> <b>increase</b> did not leave any room for a rapid reaction. Namely, the IMF could only respond quickly and effectively to the sharply increased demand of the Member States hit by the crisis by relying on borrowing.
