50|$|The red-billed <b>quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea),</b> {{also known}} as the red-billed weaver or red-billed dioch, is a small, {{approximately}} 12 cm long and weighing 15-26 g, migratory, sparrow-like bird of the weaver family, Ploceidae, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. It was named by Linnaeus in 1758, who considered it a bunting, but Ludwig Reichenbach assigned it in 1850 to the new genus Quelea. Three subspecies are recognised, with <b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea</b> <b>quelea</b> occurring roughly from Senegal to Chad, Q. q. aethiopica from Sudan to Somalia and Tanzania, and Q. q. lathamii from Gabon to Mozambique and South Africa. Non-breeding birds have light underparts, striped brown upper parts, yellow-edged flight feathers and a reddish bill. Breeding females attain a yellowish bill. Breeding males have a black (or rarely white) facial mask, surrounded by a purplish, pinkish, rusty or yellowish wash on the head and breast. The species avoids forests, deserts and colder areas such as those at high altitude and in southern South Africa. It constructs oval roofed nests woven from strips of grass hanging from thorny branches, sugar cane or reeds. It breeds in very large colonies.|$|E
50|$|The {{cardinal}} <b>quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> cardinalis) is {{a species}} of bird in the Ploceidae family.It is found in Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.|$|E

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{environmental}} contamination and environmental risk posed by air-to-air control operations with ULV formulations of fenthion against the Red-billed <b>Quelea,</b> Que-lea <b>quelea,</b> and possible {{reasons for the}} apparent lack of efficacy achieved during such control actions were investigated. Air-borne residues were monitored using high volume monitoring and pesticide deposition was studied after deliveries of microscopic pesticide droplets above roosting and breeding sites of <b>quelea,</b> when environmental contamination due to primary and secondary drift is likely. Fenthion persisted in environmental samples far longer (64 h in air, 46 days in soil) than reported previously and could be detected as far as 3 km from the spray site. Deposition results showed uneven target site coverage, which may explain the lack of efficacy during aerial control actions. Fenthion was also detected in non-target bird species, confirming the risk of primary and secondary poisoning. Additional observations after fuel-explosion operations against roosts of <b>quelea</b> indicated a high potential risk and mortality of non-target raptor species...|$|R
50|$|Synchronized {{breeding}} {{contributes to}} the ICH in that, as stated previously, more members contribute to a communal roost’s ability to search for more food. The red billed <b>quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea),</b> for instance, breed synchronously, resulting in large groups of juveniles in the same age. The adult quelea leave the nest when their young are about three weeks old, meaning that the young must learn to communicate as a group, and eventually develop into a communal roost where food site information is exchanged efficiently. This is also made easier due to {{the large number of}} members in the group as a result of synchronized breeding.|$|E

50|$|Wading birds, even {{large and}} {{relatively}} slow-moving types {{such as the}} goliath heron (Ardea goliath), tend to be highly cautious about avoiding deep water in crocodile occupied wetlands whereas cormorants and waterfowl forage over deeper water and are easier for crocodiles to ambush, with Egyptian geese (Alopochen aegyptiaca) and spur-winged geese (Plectropterus gambensis) recorded as being taken largely while flightless due to molting their flight feathers. On the contrary, there are several records of them capturing wading birds. Guggisberg (1972) saw multiple cases of predation on marabou storks (Leptoptilos crumenifer) and around Lake Turkana several may frequent heronries to pick off fledglings. In one case, a crocodile was filmed capturing a striated heron (Butorides striata) in mid-flight. Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) {{are known to be}} grabbed while they dive for fish as are possibly African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer) while crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) have reportedly been ambushed on land at carrion. Crocodiles are occasionally successful in grabbing passerines such as weaver birds, including the abundant red-billed <b>quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea),</b> and swallows, having been observed to breach the water and {{in a matter of seconds}} sweep off a branch full of birds with remarkable success. Larger land birds, such as bustards, guineafowl, ground hornbills (Bucorvus sp.) and ostriches (Struthio camelus), may be taken when they come to water to drink but like most birds are seldom harassed and a minor part of the diet.|$|E
5000|$|Different {{subspecies}} are {{distinguished by}} different colour {{patterns of the}} male breeding plumage. In the typical subspecies, Q. <b>quelea</b> <b>quelea,</b> breeding males have a buff crown, nape and underparts and the black mask extends high up the forehead. In [...] Q. quelea lathamii the mask also extends high up the forehead, but the underparts are mainly white. In Q. quelea aethiopica the mask does not extend far above the bill, and the underparts may have a pink wash. There is much variability within subspecies, and some birds cannot be ascribed to a subspecies based on outward appearance alone. Intermediate specimens between subspecies may occur where the ranges of the subspecies overlap because of interbreeding, such as at Lake Chad.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{preference}} for ground-dwelling avian prey, a surprisingly {{considerable number of}} water birds may also be attacked. Waterfowl known to be attacked include the 1.18 kg South African shelduck (Tadorna cana), 1 kg yellow-billed duck (Anas undulata), the 4.43 kg spur-winged goose (Plectropterus gambensis) (Africa’s largest waterfowl species) and especially the peculiar, overly bold and aggressive 1.76 kg Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca), {{which is one of}} the main prey species for martial eagles in Kruger National Park. Larger wading birds are also fairly frequently attacked including herons and egrets, flamingoes storks, ibises, spoonbills and cranes. The diversity and number of storks taken is particularly impressive. They are known to take 8 species of stork, ranging from the smallest known species, the 1.08 kg African openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus), to the tallest species in the world, the 6.16 kg, 1.5 m-tall saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis). One naturalists observed up to a half dozen attacks in different parts of Africa on 3.45 kg white storks (Ciconia ciconia). Short of three attacks on spotted thick-knees (Burhinus capensis), which weigh about 0.42 kg, so far as is known small waders or shorebirds are ignored as prey. Other assorted avian prey may consists of ostrich (Struthio camelus) chicks (frequently resulting in the immediate ire of protective ostrich parents), sandgrouse, pigeons and doves, hornbills and crows. Beyond occasional captures of other birds of prey (covered later), one other impressive avian prey species is the southern ground hornbill (Bucorvus leadbeateri), which at 3.77 kg is probably the world’s largest hornbill. At the other end of the scale, some martial eagles may capture a few small social species of passerine, which are exceptionally small prey (the smallest recorded prey species for the eagle overall), potentially consisting of the 18.6 g red-billed queleas (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea)</b> and the 27.4 g sociable weavers (Philetairus socius), as practically every meat-eating bird in Africa may be attracted to these species’ colonial abundance.|$|E

The spatio temporal distribution of rainfall determines where and when Quelea can breed, as shown for Quelea populations in southern Africa. Numbers and distributions of swarms of desert locusts in four different regions of their huge invasion area (29, 000, 000 km 2) were analyzed as local populations of a metapopulation.

40|$|The Red-billed <b>Quelea,</b> <b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea,</b> {{is a major}} pest {{of small}} grain crops in Zimbabwe, both on {{irrigated}} wheat and barley in winter, and on sorghum and millets in summer.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the feeding ecology of the red-billed <b>quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea)</b> is necessary for a comprehensive assessment of {{the potential impact of}} this species on cereals development. Queleas are reported to subsist primarily on wild Gramineae (Ward 1965 a; Gaston 1976), but their mobility and tendency to feed in large aggregations readily adapts them to becoming a major cereal crop pest (Dyer 2 ̆ 6 Ward 1977). Currently, conflicting evidence exists as to the factors involved in attacks on cereals and the relationship of depredation to the availability of wild foods. In Nigeria, Ward’s (1965 a) findings indicated queleas prefer small wild grass seeds, with cultivated sorghum being extensively damaged only when the supply of grass seeds was depleted. In Ethiopia, however, Jaeger, Erickson 2 ̆ 6 Jaeger (in press) have found queleas dispersing from grassland regions into areas of cereals cultivation where appreciable damage occurs to ripening sorghum at a time when wild grass seeds should be abundantly available. At present the factors affecting depredation of cereals are poorly understood. This paper examines the overall diets of <b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea</b> aethiopica (Sundevall) by sex and age in relation to depredation of the five cereals cultivated in the Awash River Basin {{and in terms of the}} types and sizes of food items eaten. Samples were collected over a one-year period from two ecologically diverse agricultural zones of the Basin, and findings are compared with those of Ward (1965 a) from a considerably different ecological setting in the Lake Chad zone of Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea</b> is {{probably}} the most important avian pest of cereal crops in the sahelian areas of Africa. Its depredations reduce the cereal production of many African nations that lie within its range. To prevent this damage, bird control organizations carry out campaigns to reduce their numbers. Frequently these efforts have given poor crop protection for the cost of control because of inadequate control technology. Factors contributing to the difficulty of carrying out this kind of control are the migrations of the birds which are still incompletely understood, the inaccessability of many nesting areas, the relatively high reproductive potential of Quelea, and the vastness of the territory involved. (The generic name is used throughout this paper to denote the Red-billed (or Sudan) Dioch, <b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea.).</b> In consequence, a general population reduction seems impossible. However, within a broad program of crop protection there are some places and times when destruction of concentrations of Quelea could be a practical means of control.

40|$|Research {{into the}} biology {{and control of}} pest birds in Somalia has {{continued}} intermittently since 1971 under UNDP funding of four projects. Data have been gathered on the identification, distribution, and status of the principal pest species to agriculture. These species include the Red-billed <b>Quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea),</b> of which northern and southern races occur, and several other ploceid weavers (Ploceus spp.) which may damage cereal crops. The movements, food habits, and corresponding impact of these species on agriculture in Somalia are discussed in detail. As {{a result of the}} information obtained during these years of research, emphasis has recently shifted to developing the indirect control capacity of the Bird Control Unit and evaluating methods for directly protecting a crop. Scouting teams for locating concentrations of pest birds have been organized and initial control operations undertaken. Trials of frightening and scaring devices and techniques, physical barriers, and chemical repellents have been evaluated, but only on a limited scale and with variable results.

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{study of}} the roles of vertebrate pests in agriculture in Nigeria is relatively very young, having spanned only two decades. During this period the species composition of vertebrate pests has been determined in some important crop plants like cocoa (Taylor 1961, Everard 1968), oil palm (Greaves 1964), maize (Everard 1966; Funmilayo 1976) and rice (Funmilayo and Akande 1977). The ecology of a few important pest species has been studied. Because of its devastating destruction of many graminaceous crops in Nigeria and over most parts of Africa, the red-billed <b>quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea)</b> has been studied more intensively than other avian pests (Crook 1957; Crook and Ward 1968; Mallamaire 1959; Pope and Ward 1972; Park 1974; Ward 1965 a-d, 1966, 1971, 1972, 1973). Other avian pests whose ecology has been studied include the village weaverbird (Funmilayo 1975; Funmilayo and Akande 1976) and the bush fowl (Akande 1979). The ecology of some mammalian pests has also been studied (Ajayi 1975; Funmilayo 1975, 1979; Anadu 1976; Funmilayo and Akande 1979). A research program has been started at the University of Ibadan on the management, domestication and breeding {{of one of the}} most notorious rodent pests in Nigeria, the cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus).

40|$|In many {{developing}} nations around the world. pest birds are {{a serious threat}} to human food supplies. In the Sahelian zone of Africa, red·billed <b>quelea</b> (<b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea)</b> is of greatest concern. Cereal grain crops within the range of quelea are subject to severe depredations. Therefore, a wide variety of approaches have been taken to alleviate these losses. In 1972 Magor and Ward reported that during the past 20 years, hundreds of millions of birds have been killed by explosives, flame throwers, and lethal chemicals used to control birds assembled at night in roosts and breeding colonies. Despite this huge control effort, there were no long-term reductions in quelea populations (Crook and Ward, 1968). The high cost, possible contamination, and low successes of such operations led to suggestions for a more ecological approach (Jackson and Park, 1973). Crop protection rather than simple population reduction became the goal (Fumilayo and Akande, 1979; Ward, 1979).. In nature, secondary plant substances (many nonlethal) have protected a wide variety of plant species from vertebrate consumption (Rogers, 1978). For example, astringent tannins in some sorghums successfully deter birds (Harris, 1969). Recent studies at the Denver Wildlife Research Center (DWRC) on bird-resistant sorghum (Bullard et aI., 1980; Bullard et aI., 1981) led to the consideration of testing commercial tannins for possible utilization as repellents in topical applications to cereal grain crops. The following studies were conducted to determine tannin efficacy in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|The red-billed <b>quelea</b> <b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea,</b> one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} birds in the world, presents two fundamental conundrums that we investigate here with a novel approach using blood parasite assemblages at two spatial scales, landscape and individual. The quelea of southern Africa Q. q. lathamii are split by a hypothesized migratory divide, where birds follow rain fronts in one of two directions (NW or SE). This divide is not detectable in the host population using microsatellite data, and here we show that it is also not apparent from our large-scale phylogeographical analyses of the haematozoan parasite. At a finer scale, the colourful and variable breeding plumage of male red-billed quelea has not previously shown a correlation with predictors of quality, as it does in many other bird species. The male’s breeding plumage is partially based on carotenoid colouration, the quality of which has been correlated with haematozoan infection in other bird species. However, we found no correlation between intensity of male carotenoid colouration and haematozoan infection. Our results do not contradict the hypothesis that male breeding plumage in this species serves to identify individuals rather than to indicate quality. Finally, we recovered the greatest number of haematozoan lineages from any phylogenetic survey of a single host species to date. Understanding the reasons for the extreme diversity of parasite lineages in this species may assist in explaining the success of the red-billed quelea in anthropogenic landscapes...|$|E

In Spain, an infection of Southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV) in string (climbing) beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) was apparently introduced and spread by sparrows (Passer domesticus) judging from the damage caused on flowers and bean pods.

40|$|Wild {{terrestrial}} birds can act {{as potential}} local spreaders or bridge hosts for avian influenzaviruses (AIVs) between waterfowl (the maintenance hosts of AIVs) and domestic avianpopulations in which AIVs may cause disease. Few studies have investigated this hypothesis,although {{it is an important}} knowledge gap in our understanding of AIV spread within socio-ecosystems. We designed a simple and reproducible approach in an agro-ecosystem inZimbabwe based on: (1) bird counts at key target sites (i. e., wetlands, villages, intensivepoultry production buildings and ostrich farms) to identify which wild birds species co-occur in these different sites and seasons when the risk of AIV transmission through thesepotential bridge hosts is maximal and (2) targeted sampling and testing for AIV infectionin the identified potential bridge hosts. We found that 12 wild bird species represented thevast majority (79 %) of co-occurrences in the different sites, whereas 230 bird species wererecorded in this ecosystem. Specifically, three species – barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, red-billed <b>quelea,</b> <b>Quelea</b> <b>quelea</b> and cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis – represented the main potentialbridge host species (65 % of co-occurrences). In two out of these three species (i. e., barnswallow and red-billed quelea), we detected AIV infections, confirming that they can play abridge function between waterfowl and domestic species in the ecosystem. Our approachcan be easily implemented in other ecosystems to identify potential bridge hosts, and ourresults have implications in terms of surveillance, risk management and control of AIVspread in socio-ecosystems.
