30|$|In our method, {{we define}} the <b>query</b> depth in Neo 4 j as follows: when we <b>query</b> from the {{starting}} node A to node B, we define the <b>query</b> depth as one; further, if we <b>query</b> from node B to another node C, that is, we <b>query</b> from A, through node B, to node C, we define the <b>query</b> depth as two, and so on. The <b>query</b> methods {{are divided into}} single <b>query</b> and traversal <b>query,</b> both of them do multi-query depth <b>query.</b> Although the middle <b>query</b> process of the single <b>query</b> may contain multiple results, it finally returns one <b>query</b> result only. Compared with the single <b>query,</b> traversal <b>query</b> will return all results of every depth, and it will only return {{the number of the}} nodes {{as the result of the}} <b>query</b> since the amount of the data is large. Taking Neo 4 j <b>query</b> as an example, single <b>query</b> and traversal <b>query</b> respectively perform five kinds of <b>queries</b> whose <b>query</b> depths are five. The final result of a single <b>query</b> is only one node; however, the middle result may have multiple nodes. Specially, count <b>query</b> is the <b>query</b> whose <b>query</b> result is the number of nodes, and the traversal <b>query</b> is the <b>query</b> which returns a specific number of nodes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we focus}} on the <b>query</b> problem of {{trajectory}} tracking of moving targets in a wireless sensor network. Our motivation is to design in-network storage and <b>querying</b> protocols to support <b>queries</b> for searching a given target signature in a low <b>query</b> latency, high <b>query</b> reliability, and energy efficient manner. We propose a target trajectory <b>query</b> protocol, which combines index-based <b>query</b> and random <b>query</b> schemes. The <b>query</b> protocol guarantees <b>query</b> reliability and energy efficiency. In an index-based <b>queries</b> scheme, each target trajectory has an index, which is stored at an index node (designated node). <b>Query</b> nodes send <b>query</b> messages to the index node to get results. Naturally, index-based <b>queries</b> can guarantee <b>query</b> reliability, but the disadvantage is the <b>query</b> hotspot problem, which reduces the lifetime of the sensor network. A random <b>queries</b> scheme, which is based on opportunistic target signature propagation, sends <b>query</b> messages in random chosen directions to hit a sensor node that contains the given target signature near the <b>query</b> node. However, <b>queries</b> for targets whose signature propagation is very limited need a large number of random <b>query</b> messages to achieve high <b>query</b> reliability. Our algorithm combines the two <b>query</b> schemes. It takes advantages of both of them, and eliminates each individual’s disadvantages. Performance analysis and simulation studies show that our <b>query</b> protocol is superior to index-based <b>queries</b> in terms of the <b>query</b> hotspot problem, and it is superior to random <b>queries</b> in terms of energy efficiency, <b>query</b> latency, and <b>query</b> reliability.

Their removal from the islands halted a decline of the threatened petrels. Furthermore, a University of New England study published in 2006 reported that the breeding success rates for the eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) and scarlet robin (Petroica boodang) on the New England Tablelands were improved after nests were protected and currawongs culled, and some yellow robins even re-colonised an area where they had become locally extinct.
