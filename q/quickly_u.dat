40|$|Abstract: Why is {{the price}} of renting an {{automobile}} “flat ” as a function its age or odometer? Specifically, why don’t rental car companies offer customers the option of renting older cars at a discount, instead of offering only relatively new cars at full price? We also consider a related puzzle: why do rental car companies trade their vehicles so <b>quickly?</b> Most <b>U.</b> S. companies purchase brand new rental cars and replace them after 2 years or when their odometer exceeds 34, 000 kilometers (km). This is a very costly strategy due to the well known rapid early depreciation in used car prices. We show that economic theory predicts that in a competitive market cars are rented over their full economic lifespan and rental prices are a declining function of their odometer value. Our solution to these puzzles is that actual rental markets are not fully competitive and firms may be behaving suboptimally. We provide a case study of a large rental car company that provided us access to its operating data. We develop a model of the company’s operations that predicts that the company can significantly increase its profits by keeping its rental cars twice as long as it currently does and discounting the rental prices of older vehicles to induce its customers to rent them. The company undertook an experiment to test our model’s predictions. We report initial findings from this experiment, which involved over 4500 rentals of over 500 cars in 4 locations over a 5 month period. The results are consistent with the predictions of our model, and suggest that a properly chosen declining rental price function can increase overall revenues. Profits also increase significantly, since doubling the holding period of rental cars cuts discounted replacement costs by nearly 40 %...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since 1961, the President has had special statutory authority to order the "drawdown" of defense articles [...] such as aircraft, vehicles, various weapons, and spare parts [...] and services or military education and training from Department of Defense (DOD) and military service inventories and transfer them to foreign countries or international organizations. Drawdowns give the President the {{ability to respond to}} U. S. foreign policy and national security objectives, such as counternarcotics efforts, peacekeeping needs, and unforeseen military and nonmilitary emergencies, by providing military assistance without first seeking additional legislative authority or appropriations from Congress. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency's reports to Congress on the costs and delivery status of drawdowns are inaccurate and incomplete. Two principal problems contribute to the agency's inability to meet the reporting requirements. First, its information system for recording drawdown data is outmoded and difficult to use [...] service drawdown reports are in different formats, and any conversion errors have to be manually corrected. Second, the services do not regularly provide updates to the agency on drawdown costs and deliveries, and available information sometimes does not get into the system. Drawdowns benefit the United States and foreign recipients primarily by providing the President the flexibility to address foreign policy and national security objectives quickly. Drawdowns also allow the President to provide defense articles and services to improve foreign recipients' capability to conduct military and police missions in support of U. S. foreign policy. Other benefits cited include improved military-to-military relations between the U. S. military services and the foreign recipients and expanded markets for U. S. defense firms. According to U. S. and foreign military officials, the use of drawdowns presents some concerns. Because drawdowns are used to <b>quickly</b> address <b>U.</b> S. national interests and emergencies, the costs associated with a drawdown, such as refurbishment and transportation, are not budgeted for by the services and are not reimbursed. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{major problem}} in characterising rarity traits is that rare species are less studied than common species. Consequently, {{little is known about}} their distribution, ecology, demography, or behaviour, and their {{categorisation}} as rare may simply be a result of scarcity of data. In particular, {{there is a lack of}} comparative studies of closely-related rare and common species, an issue addressed by this thesis. My research investigated niche differentiation, rarity, and commonness in two sympatric species of rainforest rodents in the genus Uromys, one of which is common while the other is extremely rare, and endeavoured to provide insights into why this is so. This is an increasingly important question as continuing habitat destruction, fragmentation, and over-exploitation threaten the existence of many rare species and significantly decrease populations of what were once common species. The primary aim of the thesis is to clarify the ecological characteristics that make a species more prone to rareness and thus vulnerable to extinction. Prior to this study little was known of the ecology of the rare Pygmy White-tailed Rat Uromys hadrourus and, surprisingly, only basic distribution and population data was available for its sister species the common Giant White-tailed Rat Uromys caudimaculatus. To obtain the data necessary to facilitate an ecological comparison of the two species, a capture-mark-recapture program was conducted. Using the results from this study, niche differentiation analyses were used to compare the ecological and behavioural traits of the two Uromys species. The characteristics recognised in the literature as potentially predisposing a species to rarity were examined in light of the niche analyses. Niche differentiation. There is significant niche differentiation between Uromys caudimaculatus and U. hadrourus but the two species do not appear to occupy completely independent ecological niches. There is overlap in diet with U. hadrourus exploiting some of the softer large-fruited seeds also utilised by U. caudimaculatus. However, the larger size and strong jaws of U. caudimaculatus enable the species to exploit hard-seeded rainforest fruits inaccessible to other rainforest rodents, including U. hadrourus. Both species feed on insects by tearing open decomposing logs and stumps; they also chew the bark of tree buttresses to feed on the sap weeping from the fresh edges of the scars. However, a significant part of the diet of U. hadrourus was obtained from aerial tree roots, a dietary resource not utilised by U. caudimaculatus. Aerial roots primarily occurred on the lower trunks of trees located on the densely vegetated lower slopes, along streams and gullies, and in the wetter areas of the forest. The ability to climb is a significant niche difference between the two Uromys species. The scansorial ability of U. caudimaculatus allows it to access resources in the tree canopy (food and refuges/nesting sites) that are unavailable to the terrestrial U. hadrourus. However, the structure of the hind foot indicates that U. hadrourus was almost certainly scansorial at some stage of its evolution. Differences in body size are also significant. Uromys caudimaculatus is one of the largest species in the genus with a mean body weight three times that of U. hadrourus, the smallest representative of the genus. The larger body size of U. caudimaculatus brings with it a number of ecological advantages; fewer predators and competitors and the ability to easily break into hard seeds inaccessible to other small mammals. The smaller size of U. hadrourus makes it more vulnerable to predation than the larger U. caudimaculatus. Further niche differentiation was evident in the habitat utilised by U. caudimaculatus, which did most of its foraging in the abundant open-understorey forest. In contrast, U. hadrourus was only recorded in the spatially rare and densely-vegetated forest occurring on the lower slopes, along gullies, and 1 st and 2 nd order streams. Differences in behaviour may also play a part in niche differentiation with indications that U. hadrourus is more sedentary than U. caudimaculatus and that the breeding season of U. caudimaculatus may be longer with juveniles dispersing away from the natal area more <b>quickly</b> than juvenile <b>U.</b> hadrourus. Rarity Characteristics. Of the nine ecological variables examined, three were identified as characterising natural rarity in the small mammal assemblage. These comprised habitat specificity, low dispersal ability, and specialism. While it is difficult to determine whether any one of these three characteristics is a precursor of, or makes a greater contribution to species’ rarity, it is more probable that natural rarity depends on a ‘flexible’ amalgam of the three traits. Although possibly an important cause of rarity in some species, it is equally plausible that specialism may evolve as a consequence of rarity. It is also likely that abundance and habitat specificity are strongly regulated by energy (resource) requirements and availability, varying with individual species’ ecology and life-history traits. Dispersal ability is fundamentally interrelated with both habitat specificity and specialism and there are indications that it plays an important role in the maintenance of rarity in this north Queensland assemblage of rainforest small mammals. There were significantly negative associations between three sets of variables: (1) Abundance - Body Size; (2) Habitat - Body Size; and (3) Specialism Index - Body Size, indicating body size has little to do with population density, habitat specificity, or the degree of specialism in this small mammal assemblage. Predation risk is an unknown factor in habitat specificity-dispersal-specialism characteristics of rare species, but there is ample evidence that predation can force changes in species’ habitat use. Animals commonly choose among habitats that differ both in foraging return and mortality hazard, and strong predator pressure has been shown to account for low abundance and small range size of many species. Using the two Uromys as examples of this model, the larger U. caudimaculatus, being less at risk of predation, may have chosen to forage in habitat which maximises its foraging gain; while the smaller and more vulnerable U. hadrourus may have forgone the benefits of increased foraging gain in favour of reducing predation levels by using less risky habitat...|$|R
