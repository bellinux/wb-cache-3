5|$|Though these larger {{philosophical}} {{traditions are}} clear influences on The Age of Reason, Paine owes the greatest intellectual {{debt to the}} English deists of the early eighteenth century, such as Peter Annet. John Toland had argued {{for the use of}} reason in interpreting scripture, Matthew Tindal had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and <b>questioned</b> <b>the</b> existence of miracles, Thomas Morgan had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, Thomas Woolston had <b>questioned</b> <b>the</b> believability of miracles and Thomas Chubb had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in The Age of Reason, albeit less coherently.|$|E
5|$|Both OHSU and {{the city}} of Portland have taken much public {{criticism}} for ballooning development costs. Local television station KATU <b>questioned</b> <b>the</b> relative price of the Portland tram compared to a new tram at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, which was built by the same company, and (as of 2007) was projected to carry 28 percent more passengers three and a half times the distance and eight times the height, but costing only $25million.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{praised the}} film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors {{to present his}} argument, and its {{somewhat}} disheartening ending that leaves the impression that while racism is learned, it cannot be cured.

5000|$|McKenzie's [...] "Questioning Toolkit" [...] lists 17 {{types of}} questions, and {{suggests}} that thinkers need to orchestrate and combine these types. Examples of these <b>question</b> types include <b>the</b> irreverent <b>question,</b> <b>the</b> apparently irrelevant <b>question,</b> <b>the</b> hypothetical <b>question</b> and <b>the</b> unanswerable <b>question.</b> Questions can also be infelicitous, being based on incorrect and illogical premises (e.g. [...] "Why do cats have green wings?").|$|R

5|$|Falun Gong sources {{overseas}} <b>questioned</b> <b>the</b> official Chinese government {{account of}} the event, and apparent inconsistencies in government's official narrative led to a hypothesis that the self-immolation was staged {{by the government to}} justify the persecution against Falun Gong by portraying its practitioners as irrational and suicidal. According to this hypothesis, the self-immolation participants were paid actors, and were presumably assured that the flames would be extinguished before doing real harm.|$|E
5|$|Fenwick's {{beliefs are}} similar to Trollope's own. In his early life, the novelist was a {{supporter}} of the Tractarians. However, beginning in about the mid-1860s, his sympathies tended increasingly toward the Broad church. He defended Bishop Colenso, expressed doubt about the literal truth of the Old Testament, and <b>questioned</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of eternal punishment contained in the Athanasian Creed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea that}} Moore begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> (i.e. assumes <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} in a premise) was first raised by W. Frankena. Since analytic equivalency, for two objects X and Y, logically results in <b>the</b> <b>question</b> [...] "Is {{it true that}} X is Y?" [...] being meaningless (by Moore's own argument), to say that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is meaningless is to concede analytic equivalency. Thus Moore begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> in <b>the</b> second premise. He assumes that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is a meaningful one (i.e. {{that it is an}} open <b>question).</b> This begs <b>the</b> <b>question</b> and <b>the</b> open-question argument thus fails.|$|R

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, {{over the}} night of 26/27December, several attacks were carried out by the Irgun on police stations, Palestine Railways {{installations}} and one British Army armoury.
