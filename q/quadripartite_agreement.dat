50|$|The Four Power Agreement on Berlin {{also known}} as the Berlin Agreement or the <b>Quadripartite</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Berlin was agreed on 3 September 1971 by the four wartime allied powers, {{represented}} by their Ambassadors. The four foreign ministers, Alec Douglas-Home of the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics' Andrei Gromyko, France's Maurice Schumann, and the United States's William P. Rogers signed the agreement and put it into force at a ceremony in Berlin on 3 June 1972. The agreement was not a treaty and required no formal ratification.|$|E
50|$|From {{the legal}} theory {{followed}} by the Western Allies, the occupation of most of Germany ended in 1949 {{with the establishment of}} the Federal Republic of Germany (23 May 1949) and of the German Democratic Republic (7 October 1949). Under Article 127 of the Basic Law (or constitution) of the Federal Republic, provision was made for federal laws to be extended to Greater Berlin (as West Berlin was officially known) as well as Baden, Rhineland-Palatinate and Württemberg-Hohenzollern within one year of its promulgation. However, because the occupation of Berlin could only be ended by a <b>quadripartite</b> <b>agreement,</b> Berlin remained an occupied territory under the formal sovereignty of the allies. Hence, the Basic Law was not fully applicable to West Berlin.|$|E
50|$|During the Kommandatura {{meeting of}} June 16, 1948, the current chairman, French commandant General Ganeval, {{proposed}} that the Soviets rescind Order No. 20, so that the fourteen points could be individually reviewed and discussed. Up until that time the Soviets insisted on an all or nothing approach. They refused to rescind the order unless all other delegations agreed to the fourteen points unanimously and issued a <b>quadripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> {{to the effect of}} the same for the whole of Berlin. Discussions on this and other issues had dragged on for over thirteen hours at that point, and it was nearing midnight. That's when the American commandant, Colonel Howley, asked to be excused, as he had a heavy schedule planned for the following day. Chairman Ganeval gave permission, and Howley left his deputy, Colonel Babcock, in charge, just as he had done in times past when the situation required it.|$|E
5000|$|In 1971, Hillgruber was {{a leading}} critic of the <b>Quadripartite</b> <b>Agreement</b> {{on the status of}} Berlin accusing the West German {{government}} and the three western powers with rights in West Berlin, namely the United States, Great Britain and France of granting approval to what he saw as the illegal Soviet occupation of eastern Germany and the equally illegitimate East German regime {{while at the same time}} accepted the partition of Berlin as permanent. Hillgruber wrote that the agreement had confirmed the [...] "status quo minus" [...] of Berlin, and that the agreement was too vague with the reference to the [...] "existing conditions in the relevant area". Finally, Hillgruber charged that the West had given in by promising to limit contact between West and East Berlin and allowing a Soviet consulate to be established in West Berlin, which Hillgruber claimed was an implicit admission of the Soviet claim that West Berlin was not part of the Federal Republic.|$|E
5000|$|In 1923 Bankside power station, {{rated at}} 64 MW, {{had the largest}} {{generating}} capacity {{of any of the}} electricity companies or municipal undertakings in the London area. The County of London Company had a generating capacity of 39.7 MW; it commissioned the first 100 MW of its Barking ‘A’ power station in 1925, this increased to 200 MW by 1930. [...] The 1919 Act established the principle of equal consideration for the interests of shareholders and consumers of each company. Dividends to shareholders were limited to seven per cent per annum and the amount carried forward in the accounts was also restricted. Profits over and above these conditions formed a ‘consumers’ benefit’ in the form of lower prices. Two-thirds of the consumer’s benefit was to consumers and one sixth each for the company’s employees and for the shareholders. Electricity grid interconnections in the 1930s, stimulated by the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, supported the further commercial integration of the ‘No.1 group’. In 1937 a <b>quadripartite</b> <b>agreement</b> was made between members of the group. [...] The agreement “in the interests of consumers of electricity” was to establish a joint committee; to institute a common commercial procedure; to unify methods of charging consumers; and to avoid duplication and conflicting systems of supply mains involving unnecessary expenditure. The agreement envisaged the establishment of joint showroom premises to promote the use of electricity. In the late 1930s the CLELCo had a showroom at 33 Ludgate Hill in the City of London.|$|E
40|$|Few post-War European {{disputes}} {{have received}} greater long-term attention {{that the question}} of the division of Berlin. During numerous crises, Berlin has been regarded as the greatest existing threat to peace and during the era of detente it has been touted as a barometer of East-West relations. There has always been considerable rhetoric about the need to 2 ̆ 2 resolve 2 ̆ 2 the Berlin problem or, as Khrushchev said, to 2 ̆ 2 normalise 2 ̆ 2 the Berlin situation. The 1971 <b>Quadripartite</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Berlin has been seen by many as an important step in the long approach to a solution. The contributions of this agreement are carefully examined by Honore M. Catudal, Jr. in A Balance Sheet of the <b>Quadripartite</b> <b>Agreement</b> on Berlin (Berlin: Berlin Verlag, 1978). Although the scope of Catudal 2 ̆ 7 s study is narrow, his examination does help the reader chart the evolution of the Berlin situation in terms of several scenarios for possible resolution of this problem...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the final}} report that closed a joint {{collaboration}} effort between DOE and the National Nuclear Energy Commission of Brazil (CNEN). In 2005, DOE and CNEN started a collaborative effort to evaluate measures that can strengthen the effectiveness of international safeguards at a natural uranium conversion plant (NUCP). The work was performed by DOE s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and CNEN. A generic model of a NUCP was developed and typical processing steps were defined. Advanced instrumentation and techniques for verification purposes were identified and investigated. The scope of the work was triggered by the International Atomic Energy Agency s 2003 revised policy concerning {{the starting point of}} safeguards at uranium conversion facilities. Prior to this policy only the final products of the uranium conversion plant were considered to be of composition and purity suitable for use in the nuclear fuel cycle and therefore, subject to the IAEA safeguards control. DOE and CNEN have explored options for implementing the IAEA policy, although Brazil understands that the new policy established by the IAEA is beyond the framework of the <b>Quadripartite</b> <b>Agreement</b> of which {{it is one of the}} parties, together with Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC) and the IAEA. Two technical papers on this subject were published at the 2005 and 2008 INMM Annual Meetings...|$|E
