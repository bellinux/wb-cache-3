50|$|Rangers 6, 7, 8, and 9 {{were called}} Block 3 {{versions}} of the Ranger spacecraft. The spacecraft consisted of a hexagonal aluminum frame base 1.5 m across on which was mounted the propulsion and power units, topped by a truncated conical tower which held the TV cameras. Two solar panel wings, each 739 mm wide by 1537 mm long, extended from opposite edges of the base with a full span of 4.6 m, and a pointable high-gain dish antenna was hinge mounted {{at one of the}} corners of the base away from the solar panels. A cylindrical <b>quasi-omnidirectional</b> <b>antenna</b> was seated on top of the conical tower. The overall height of the spacecraft was 3.6 m.|$|E
