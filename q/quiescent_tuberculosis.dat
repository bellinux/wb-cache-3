50|$|The College {{was able}} to offer four courses to it initial intake of 18 students. These were gardening, bench carpentry, boot and shoe repair and {{surgical}} boot making, and clerical and commercial. These students included ex-miners and ex-servicemen and there disabilities ranged from <b>quiescent</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> and poliomyelitis to limb amputees. Despite their widely varying backgrounds, these students thrived in spite of being away from home {{in an environment that}} was conducive to discussion, debate and friendship helping each other with their problems and frustrations associated with all their disabilities. Throughout the 1950s the college went from strength to strength. It had a close working relationship with the National Coal Board with efforts particular aimed at the mining communities. The college also became a vital link for disabled and handicapped school leavers supplying further education and the college commitments were extended to provide this along with vocational training. 1961 saw the first female students enrolled at the college. At this time new courses were introduced and these included shorthand and typing followed by course in electronic wiring and assembly, and industrial electronics. The college along with the Ministry of Labour developed a pilot sheltered employment project. Workshops on site produced and marketed its own line of gift local cut oak products with the theme of Sherwood Forest and local legendary hero Robin Hood.|$|E
40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} who developed asthma {{after the age}} of 60 years are reported. Attention is drawn to apparent difficulties of diagnosis in this age group. A history of chronic bronchitis is common, and a change in symptoms, especially the abrupt onset of increased breathlessness, wheezing, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, should arouse suspicion of the development of asthma. A past or family history of allergy is confirmatory evidence, as is the presence of blood or sputum eosinophilia. Retrosternal pain is not uncommon, and angina pectoris or left ventricular failure must be excluded. Chest radiographs showed changes consistent with old <b>quiescent</b> <b>tuberculosis</b> in five patients; careful follow-up is therefore essential as asthma in this age group often requires steroid therapy...|$|E
40|$|THE {{confusion}} between syphilis and tuberculosis {{must have}} been a sore trial to the early morbid anatomists, and even to the clinicians. Some of the older writers believed that syphilis tended to protect a patient against tubercu-losis, others that it predisposed him to infection. The more precise methods of laboratory diagnosis have, it is true, produced in recent years a wealth of new material, but they have by no means settled for us this vexed ques-tion. Rather they appear to have complicated certain aspects of it, as, for example, the interpretation of the Wassermann reaction in tuberculosis. Before attempting to draw any conclusions, therefore, it is essential to collect and examine the data. LETIOLOGY Beginning with the question of aetiology, two main issues are involved in the inquiry: (I) the possibility of syphilis preparing the soil for the seed of tuberculosis and (2) the effect of intercurrent syphilis upon an active or <b>quiescent</b> <b>tuberculosis.</b> Except, however, in the case of tuberculous patients who actually develop a chancre and signs of secondary syphilis during the period of observation, {{and in the case of}} childhood tuberculosis with a syphilitic heredity, it is often impossible to decide which is the antecedent disease. It will be therefore best to record first those cases which show evidence of both diseases irrespective of priority. Let us take first the record of positive Wassermann reactions in tubercu-losis institutions and in tuberculous patients generally. Hollander and F. C. Narr 1 have analysed the pub-lished records of different observers. These records sho...|$|E

40|$|Two {{controlled}} {{studies were}} undertaken {{to assess the}} efficacy of streptomycin 1 g. or 0. 75 g.

In the first study which involved patients with residual cavitation at one year, bacteriological relapse requiring treatment occurred in 3 per cent of 87 patients given the SHOW regimen for 12 months as compared with 21 per cent of 94 patients on a placebo, a high proportion of the relapses in the latter occurred in the 2 nd year and with sensitive organisms. In the second study on patients with no residual cavitation at one year, relapse requiring treatment occurred in 2 per cent of 98 patients given the SHOW regimen for 6 months as compared with 1 per cent of 90 patients given isoniazid approximately 4. 5 mg. /kg. daily for 12 months...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the progress over a four-year period of follow-up of 119 {{patients who had}} bacteriologically <b>quiescent</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> {{at the end of}} a year of chemotherapy with either a fully supervised twice-weekly regimen of isoniazid plus streptomycin (SHTW, 66 patients) or a standard self-administered daily regimen of isoniazid plus PAS (PH, 53 patients). (In the second year, that is in the first year of the follow-up, half the patients, selected at random, received maintenance chemotherapy with isoniazid and the other half a placebo.) The condition of the patients in the SHTW and PH series was similar, both at the time of their initial admission to treatment and at the start of the period of follow-up. One patient (PH) died of tuberculosis in the fiftienth month, having had a bacteriological relapse in the fourteenth month. Nine others (five SHTW, four PH) died of non-tuberculous causes. The radiographic progress over the four-year period was similar in the SHTW and the PH series. On average, 42 cultures per patient were examined during the four-year period. A bacteriological relapse occurred in eight SHTW and eight PH patients; however, retreatment became necessary in only three (5...|$|R

The first study was undertaken {{in patients with}} bacteriologically quiescent disease and residual cavitation at 1 year, and investigated the value of isoniazid in a higher daily dose (400 mg.) throughout the second year; this is known to be the optimum therapeutic dose when isoniazid is prescribed alone for 1 year in the initial treatment of the disease. The second study was carried out in patients with bacteriologically quiescent disease and no residual cavitation at 1 year, and sought to determine the value of a shorter duration (6 months) of chemotherapy in the second year with a daily dose of 300 mg. of isoniazid. Neither of the two isoniazid regimens was highly satisfactory, although both appeared to have had some effect in preventing relapse during the 4 -year period of follow-up. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study from}} the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Centre, Madras, {{summarizes}} the progress during {{the second year of}} those patients in a 1 -year comparision of four domiciliary chemotherapeutic regimens (isoniazid plus PAS and three regimens of isoniazid alone) whose pulmonary tuberculosis had attained bacteriological quiescence {{at the end of the}} year of chemotherapy. During the second year, about half of the patients received further chemohterapy, with isoniazid alone, and the remainder received a placebo, calcium gluconate. The main objects of the study were to determine the influence on the progress during the second year of (a) a second yar of chemotherapy with isoniazid alone, (b) residual cavitation at the end of the first year, and (c) the chemotherapeutic regimen received during the first year, and to compare the results with those obtained in an earlier study by the Centre of the progress during the second year of patients with <b>quiescent</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> after a year’s chemotherapy with isoniazid plus PAS at home or in sanatorium. The results of the present study, which was planned on the same lines as the earlier one, showed that relapse in the second year was unrelated to the chmotherapeutic regimen received in the first year, and its was therefore permissble to amalgamate the findings in the two studies. The amalgamated results showed that the relapse rate in the second year was low (5. 9...|$|R
40|$|Whether or {{not there}} is an {{association}} between HLA antigen(s) and/or haplotypes aud relapse in patients successfully treated for pulmonary tuberculosis was examined. Serological determination of HLA -A, - B, -DR and -DQ antigens was carried out in patients with <b>quiescent</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and bacteriologically relapsed patients, after treatment with short course chemotherapy with Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide and Streptomycin or Ethambutol in various combinations for 6 - 8 month Au increased antigen frequency of HLA -Al (P = 0. 03) and B 17 was seen in patients with bacteriological relapse compared with those with quiescent disease. The relative risks (RR) were Al = 2. 8 and B 17 = 3. 2, respectively, The haplotypes Al-B 17 (RR = 3. 3), B 17 -DR 7 (RR = 3. 0), Al-DR 7 (p = 0. 04; RR = 9. 3) were very common in patients with bacteriological relapse. This increase of HLA-Al, B 17 antigens or the haplotypes Al- B 17, B 17 -DR 7 or Al-DR 7 (P = 0. 04) was seen irrespective of the treatment regimen. The present study suggests that HLA -Al (and - B 17) antigen(s), as such, and/or haplotypes Al- : DR 7 or non-HLA genes linked closer to HLA -A, -B and -DR loci may be associated with relapse of pulmonary tuberculosis, after chemotherapy...|$|R
40|$|Single lots of a Chase-Siltzbach type I Kveim test {{material}} {{from each of}} two sarcoid spleens and designated lot 5 of spleen K 12 and lot 1 of spleen K 13 have been validated alongside a single lot (lot 10) of a 'standard' suspension provided by Dr L. E. Siltzbach and prepared identically from the spleen of patient J (SPLEEN J) in New York. Additionally, a half-dilution of lot 5, K 12, was included in this comparison. The reactivity of each suspension was assessed among patients with active and inactive sarcoidosis. The selectivity of each suspension for sarcoidosis was assessed similarly by comparison with results in patients with active and <b>quiescent</b> pulmonary parenchymal <b>tuberculosis</b> and in healthy subjects. All patients were closely matched and two Kveim tests were made in each subject according to a prearranged statistical design. The reactivity of the K 12, K 12 1 / 2 dilution, and K 13 suspensions among patients with active and inactive sarcoidosis was closely similar to that with the 'standard' S 10 suspension and {{in accordance with the}} expected proportions of reactions in patients at different stages of sarcoidosis. The K 12, K 13, and 'standard' S 10 suspensions yielded a negligible proportion of positive reactions among patients with active and <b>quiescent</b> pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> and among healthy subjects: thus, as judged by these tests each suspension showed a high degree of selectivity for sarcoidosis. The results of this validation study are discussed in relation to the results of other studies in which lots 5 and 14 of K 12 and early and late batches of a suspension prepared from another sarcoid spleen at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories designated CSL and provided by Dr T. H. Hurley in Melbourne were employed. Using lot 5 of K 12 positive reactions were found in an appreciable proportion of patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and tuberculous lymphadenitis. A closely similar rate of positive reactions was encountered among patients with Crohn's disease following tests with batch 0025 of CSL suspension and with another lot (lot 14) derived from spleen K 12. A close concordance of results was obtained with lot 5 (K 12) and with batch 0042 CSL among patients with ulcerative colitis, but at a lower rate of reactivity. We conclude that positive reactions also occur in some diseases other than sarcoidosis and consider that the difficulties in determining the criteria for an acceptable test suspension become increasingly apparent as additional Kveim tests are made with one particular lot and with seqential lots of material from a 'validated' tissue source...|$|R

O B J E C T I V E: To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} HLA-Class II genes/gene products on phagocyte enzymes such as lysozyme, ß-glucuronidase and acid phosphatase in the plasma of pulmonary tuberculosis patients. DESIGN : Serological determination of HLA-DR and -DQ antigens {{was carried out in}} 54 active and 84 inactive pulmonary <b>tuberculosis</b> (<b>quiescent)</b> patients and 36 healthy control subjects. The levels of lysozyme, pglucuronidase and acid phosphatase were measured in the plasma of tuberculosis patients and control subjects. RESULTS : Increased lysozyme levels were observed in active pulmonary tuberculosis patients. ß-glucuronidase activity was higher in inactive-TB than in active-TB patients and control subjects. HLA-DR 2 positive patients showed a lower lysozyme level than -DR 2 negative patients. CONCLUSION: Increase in the plasma lysozyme level in active TB reveals the active stage of the disease. Further, increase in the activity of ß-glucuronidase in inactive-TB patients reveals the quiescent stage of the disease. The low level of lysozyme in HLA-DR 2 positive patients may also be one of the possible factors involved in susceptibility to tuberculosis...|$|R
