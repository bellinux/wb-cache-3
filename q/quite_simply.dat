Karnick, National Review (May 10, 2002) — Timothy Hutton, {{who also}} serves as {{executive}} producer for the show, is just brilliant as Archie Goodwin, managing to express the gumshoe's toughness (which I had been rather skeptical {{of his ability to}} do) as effectively as he shows his moral strength and emotional complexity. … Chaykin <b>quite</b> <b>simply</b> is Nero Wolfe, playing the role with impressive confidence and subtlety.|$|E

5000|$|A long-surviving {{story about}} the Potemkin villages was false, even though it became eponymous.

Modern historians, however, consider this scenario at best an exaggeration, and <b>quite</b> possibly <b>simply</b> a malicious rumor spread by Potemkin's opponents.|$|R

25|$|The {{rules of}} the L-system grammar are applied iteratively {{starting}} from the initial state. As many rules as possible are applied simultaneously, per iteration. The fact that each iteration employs as many rules as possible differentiates an L-system from a formal language generated by a formal grammar, which applies only one rule per iteration. If the production rules were to be applied only one at a time, one would <b>quite</b> <b>simply</b> generate a language, rather than an L-system. Thus, L-systems are strict subsets of languages.|$|E
25|$|The film then {{depicts the}} grandfather's {{struggle}} {{to accept the}} reality {{that the only way}} to save his grandson is at the cost of his eyesight. He tries to come to terms with the situation and his personal agony is shown in scenes, like taking second opinion, explaining his grandson the reality and his desire to show him everything possible before his grandson loses his eyesight. For some reason, the surgery has to be postponed by a day. That afternoon, grandfather and grandson disappear from the hospital ward and a frantic search follows. Confronted by an angry surgeon on their return, the grandfather states <b>quite</b> <b>simply</b> that he wanted to show Parshya the sights of the city for one last time.|$|E
25|$|For Metzinger, {{along with}} {{to some extent}} both Gleizes and Malevich, the {{classical}} vision had been an incomplete representation of real things, based on an incomplete set of laws, postulates and theorems. It represented, <b>quite</b> <b>simply,</b> the belief that space {{is the only thing}} that separates two points. It was the belief in the geocentric reality of the observable world, unchanging and immobile. The Cubists had been delighted to discover that the world was in reality dynamic, changing in time, it appeared different depending on the point of view of the observer. And yet each one of these viewpoints were equally valid, there was no preferred reference frame, all reference frames were equal. This underlying symmetry inherent in nature, in fact, is the essence of Einstein's relativity.|$|E

25|$|Although paraboloids are {{difficult}} to make from flat sheets of solid material, they can be made <b>quite</b> <b>simply</b> by rotating open-topped containers which hold liquids. The top surface of a liquid which is being rotated at constant speed around a vertical axis naturally {{takes the form of}} a paraboloid. Centrifugal force causes material to move outward from the axis of rotation until a deep enough depression is formed in the surface for the force to be balanced by the levelling effect of gravity. It turns out that the depression is an exact paraboloid. (See Liquid mirror telescope.) If the material solidifies while it is rotating, the paraboloidal shape is maintained after the rotation stops, and can be used to make a reflector. This rotation technique is sometimes used to make paraboloidal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and has also been used for solar cookers. Devices for constructing such paraboloids are known as rotating furnaces.|$|E

In other words, we provide the initial conditions for a macroscopic treatment of the second stage of the collision. We address in particular the question of how to incorporate the soft component properly, since in addition to the explicitly treated hard partons there exist also soft partons, which contribute substantially for example at RHIC energies and which are <b>quite</b> often <b>simply</b> ignored...|$|R

After they have been cleaned, dry them in a cloth, season the insides slightly with fine salt, dredge a little flour on the fish, and stick a few very small bits of butter on them, but only just sufficient to prevent their becoming dry in the oven; lay them singly on a flat dish, and bake them very gently from fourteen to sixteen minutes.

30|$|Dark photon {{is modeled}} by {{implementing}} a Higgs boson quantum collision under extreme relativistic conditions to {{transform it into}} an activated photon (HDP) to create energy.

500|$|Parker {{made several}} changes from the novel. He titled his script Angel Heart {{as he wanted}} to {{distance}} his film adaptation from the source material. While Falling Angel is set entirely in New York City, Parker had {{the second half of}} his script take place in New Orleans, based on the novel's perpetual allusions to voodoo and the occult. He discussed the story setting change to Hjortsberg, who approved of the decision and said that he had considered setting his novel in New Orleans. Angel Heart is set in the year 1955, whereas in the book, the events take place in 1959. Parker explained, [...] "1955 for me still belonged to the 1940s—and, because of the historical pause button of World War II, conceivably the 1930s—so <b>quite</b> <b>simply,</b> setting it in this year allowed me to give an older look to the film." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 380. ~all to-ruffled~. Milton wrote [...] "all to ruffled," [...] {{which may}} be {{interpreted}} in various ways: (1) all to-ruffled, (2) all too ruffled, (3) all-to ruffled. The first of these is given in the text as it is etymologically correct: to is an intensive prefix as in 'to-break' = to break in pieces; 'to-tear' = to tear asunder, etc.; while all (= <b>quite)</b> is <b>simply</b> an adverb modifying to-ruffled. But about 1500 A.D. this idiom was misunderstood, and the prefix to was detached from the verb and either read along with all (thus all-to = altogether), or confused with too (thus all-to = too too, decidedly too). It is doubtful in which sense Milton used the phrase; like Shakespeare, he may have disregarded its origin. See Morris, § 324; Abbott, §§ 28, 436.|$|R
