40|$|The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} flooding {{across the globe}} in recent times and the attendant devastating impact has heightened anxiety among the people, investors, investment advisers, policy makers and prompted media attention. Recent research efforts {{have focused on the}} assessment of the impacts on people, environments, activities, future implications and mechanisms of arresting the menace. This study contributes to this body of knowledge by examining the perception of valuation experts on flood risk on residential property value in Lagos State. Questionnaires are administered to <b>qualified</b> <b>estate</b> surveyors and valuers from 78 Estate Surveying and Valuation Firms across Lagos State. Data were analysed with tables, percentages, 4 -point Likert scale and mean ranking (RII). Result shows that majority of the valuation experts admits that the incidence of flooding is on the rise but differ significantly on the impact on property value. The study further reveals that there is no particular approach to flood risk analysis commonly adopted by the valuation experts. The study therefore suggests that since there are risks and impact differentials, approach to flood risk analysis should take into consideration the location and neighbourhood peculiarities with respect to the source(s) and nature of flood risks. This would assist in providing a more objective and reliable estimates of flood impact on residential property value...|$|E

In 1956 he was a joint founder, with his former army comrade Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw (a Deputy Lieutenant for Bedfordshire, knighted by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for exports), of the leading fork-lift truck company Lancer Boss, a major employer in Leighton Buzzard, which went into receivership in 1994 due to problems with its German affiliate. Following his marriage in 1973, he retired from the business, having been a director for 17 years, and returned to Dunster, where he obtained a lease of Home Farm from the Crown Commissioners. He has a daughter Serena and a son, Hugh, <b>qualified</b> in <b>estate</b> management, whom he hopes will succeed him in the Home Farm tenancy, and who is also heir to his uncle at East Quantoxhead.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. There {{are real}} {{uncertainty}} about the interpretation of section 3 (3) (a) (1 A) of the Estate Duty Act when the buy-and-sell agreement comes to mind. The uncertainty started with the definition of "person" in the Estate Duty Act, because the trust was not so commonly used {{at the time when}} the act came into force. Unfortunately the trust doesn't fall under the definition of "person" and therefore cannot <b>qualify</b> for the <b>estate</b> duty benefit. The big question arises whether the insured life can <b>qualify</b> for the <b>estate</b> duty benefit if the interest of the company is situated in 'n inter vivos trust. According to Magnum Financial Holdings (Pty) Ltd) (in Liquidation) v Summerly and Another NNO 1984 1 SA 160 (W) the court decided that the trust should be recognised as a "debtor" for all practical purposes. The trustees are authorised to conclude transactions on behalf of the trust. That means that the trust are managed by the trustees and that the trust cannot exist without the trustees. The trustees have a key-person position in the trust. My conclusion is that for the sake of section 3 (3) (a) (1 A) of the Estate Duty Act the inter vivos trust should be recognised as a person. In that case all the requirements of the section will be satisfied, and if the insured life was a trustee of the trust, he/she should enjoy the estate duty benefit. There are two solutions to the problem we face. Either the definition of "trust" or "person" should be amended in the Estate Duty Act. The definition of "trust" should include a trust as a person and the definition of "person" should include a person as a trust. That way the trust and section 3 (3) (a) (1 A) of the Estate Duty Act can be reconciled. Master...|$|R

40|$|Na temelju arhivskih izvora i arheoloških istraživanja, autorica analizira uvjete razvoja srednjovjekovne Kostajnice s obzirom na prostornu organizaciju srednjovjekovne Hrvatske, odnose regionalnih urbanih središta te prometnih i trgovačkih pravaca. Smještena između srednjovjekovnih regionalnih središta Gore na zapadu i Dubice na istoku, Kostajnica iako samo subregionalno središte Pounja, u razdoblju srednjeg vijeka dobiva važne vojne, crkvene, prometne i trgovačke funkcije, zahvaljujući kojima će se krajem srednjeg vijeka izdignuti u manje utvrđeno gradsko naselje - trgovište. Analizom povijesnih izvora prvi put je načinjena rekonstrukcija urbane topografije Kostajnice u srednjem vijeku te postavljena teza o njezinoj mogućoj genezi. Based on the archival {{sources and}} archaeological research, the author {{analyses}} {{the conditions of}} the development of medieval Kostajnica with regard to the spatial organisation of medieval Croatia – that is, relations between regional urban centres and routes of traffic and trade. Based on the charters discussed in the article, it is evident that Kostajnica undoubtedly experienced significant changes in its development during the Middle Ages. From its first mentions in the thirteenth century, when it was usually <b>qualified</b> as an <b>estate</b> (terra), and later as a smaller fortification (castellum), from the fifteenth century onwards it is regularly called a castle (castrum), to be mentioned as a borough (oppidum) {{for the first time in}} a charter of 1492. These terminological changes in the status of this settlement testify to the importance of the development that Kostajnica experienced during the Middle Ages, rising from the centre of a feudal estate into a smaller fortified urban settlement – a borough. By means of the analysis of its central functions, it may be concluded that Kostajnica at the close of the Middle Ages had developed functions in defence, economy and administration, and that, as such, it had good conditions for the development of its urban functions. Regarding the level of centrality, it had the character of a borough (oppidum), whose influence spread over the wider area on the north and south of the River Una and was, together with Dubica, the main centre of the lower Pounje (the area around the Una) during the Middle Ages. By means of the analysis of historical sources, a reconstruction of the urban topography of Kostajnica in the Middle Ages has been made for the first time, allowing a formulation of a hypothesis of possible lines of its genesis. In the topographical sense medieval Kostajnica developed as a triangle defined by the church of St. Michael in the north, the fortification that later became the castle on the River Una and the Franciscan convent placed on the east entrance in the town. Such a topography of the town was decisively influenced by the configuration of the area and the system of traffic communications with the settlement itself. The part of Kostajnica founded around the church of St. Michael was the oldest part of the settlement, while only in later periods of the Middle Ages did the settlement spread downhill towards the Una valley and a suburbium form besides the Franciscan convent. By the building of the fortification, the suburbium on the bank and the river crossing over Una definitely took on the character of the centre of settlement and organisation of the urban lifestyle...|$|R
40|$|U radu se prikazuje povijest turopoljske plemićke obitelji Krupić iz Velike Mlake od prvog spomena 1439. g., do kraja 16. stoljeća. Ovdje se prikazuju pripadnici obitelji koji su živjeli u srednjem vijeku, jer u Turopolju nastupa novo razdoblje obnovom bratstva 1560. godine. Obitelj se može pratiti u izvorima do kraja 17. stoljeća kada izumire u muškoj liniji. Identificiraju se članovi obitelji i prikazuju njihovi posjedi, odnos Krupića prema turopoljskoj općini te doseljavanje i život nekih pripadnika obitelji na Gradecu. Daje se i kratak prilog problematici položaja žena unutar plemićkih obitelji. Kao prilog donosi se njihovo rodoslovlje u navedenom razdoblju. In {{this article}} the author depicts {{the history of}} the Krupić family of Velika Mlaka from the first mention in the sources until the late sixteenth century, when in Turopolje there started the new period of local history with the revival of the claims of the nobility of the area through common descent from the same blood line and lineage and the renewal of local autonomy, even though {{the history of the}} Krupić family itself may be {{followed}} in the sources even further (until the late seventeenth century, when they became extinct in the male line). The first mentioned member of the family was Benedict Krupić, who started the rise of the Krupići in the noble milieu of Turopolje from 1439 with his marriage to Scolastica, a daughter of George of Mlaka. Through that marriage, he transferred his residence from the noble village of Kurilovec to the noble village of Mlaka and received as his possession an <b>estate</b> <b>qualified</b> as Scolastica’s quarta puellaris in Mlaka with an additional possession where their family house was situated. He started to become actively involved in the political life of the noble community and bought some more estates in Turopolje to improve his social and economic status. Accordingly, his heirs inherited a good economic basis for their further developments. He had five male heirs, and from four of them emerged the third generation of the Krupići. Benedict Krupić {{is a good example of}} a nobleman who was well integrated into the noble community of Turoplje, but also on the micro-level into that of the village of Mlaka. The situation of the second and the third generation of the Krupići is somewhat different. Still, it seems that rather strong family cohesion is visible in the second generation. Because of the great number of family members belonging to the third generation, the Krupići disintegrated into smaller branches, which corresponded to the closer nuclear families (e. g. the male members and their children). However, the larger family cohesion is also apparent from numerous examples from sources. It has to be emphasised that for some branches the inherited economic basis was not good enough to maintain a large family, as happened in the case of Thomas, son of Benedict, who had seven sons. Consequently he bought some more estates in Mlaka, which was the first indicator of long-term planning to enlarge the main estate. The Krupići had their estates in the villages of Mlaka, Kurilovec and Donja Lomnica, but also various arable lands and hayfields in Turopolje. They also managed to group together various parcels of vineyard land on the hills of Markušev and Persinov Vrh. In the later charters those parcels are treated as hereditary. The process of estate division started with the Krupići in the third generation, a process that fits the general model of nobility of the Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia. It seems that the division did not weaken their economic power, because they managed to compensate for the losses in different ways (e. g. by marriage or plain purchase of the new possessions). The Krupići were active and well-respected members of the noble community of Turopolje, and in this article the author offers an overview of their services – from the most distinguished ones such as comes terrestris to the important ones of peace arbitrators. It is also important to indicate that by following the activities of the Krupići, the political history of Turopolje may be followed too. They participated in the disputes with Margrave George of Brandenburg or Count Nicholas of Zrin, but they also witnessed the acceptance of Ambrose Gregorijanec and Matthew Slatinski into the noble community of Turopolje. Because of their services they travelled to medieval Buda, Vienna and Pressburg. Some of the family members also settled in Zagreb, the centre of political and economic power of contemporary Slavonia, which attracted various newcomers, noblemen included. The best-known story about the Krupići is the case of the goldsmith Peter Krupić, because of his long-term dispute with Stephan Gregorijanec, a Slavonian magnate and owner of the castle of Medvedgrad. The story was widely popularised in the nineteenth-century historical novel of August Šenoa (The Goldsmith’s Precious). Female family members were also mentioned in the urban settlement of Zagreb, where they owned properties jointly with their spouses, and it is interesting to note that some of them were married twice (which was also a common practice of the people who resided there). However, the Krupići in Zagreb did not lose their contact with Mlaka, and nor did they renounce their noble status. Although the noble community of Turopolje is suitable for researching the history of women, only a relatively small amount of sources depict the lives of the female members of the Krupići. However, all of the women mentioned as wives of the Krupići or their daughters showed a certain endogamy in choosing a spouse: if it was possible, even taking one from their own village; if not, from the other villages of Turopolje. On the other hand, it is visible that the Krupići (and the whole noble community of Turopolje in general) were quite tolerant in their marriage strategies, so they welcomed newcomers into their family, even to the degree of allowing morganatic marriages and producing illegitimate offspring. The history of the Krupići of Velika Mlaka can be used as a paradigm for the functioning of the noble families of Turopolje, but also of medieval Slavonia in general, as a peripheral region of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary-Croatia; demonstrating this was the main intention of this article. In the appendix, the genealogy of the Krupići in the period of the fifteenth and the sixteenth century has been given...|$|R
