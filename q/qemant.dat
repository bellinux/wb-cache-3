More recently, Gamst reported homosexual relations among shepherd boys of the Cushitic-speaking <b>Qemant</b> (Kemant) of central Ethiopia.

50|$|The <b>Qemant</b> {{are divided}} into two patrilineal moieties, the Keber and the Yetanti; the Keber is higher in rank. A {{traditional}} <b>Qemant</b> can only marry {{a member of the}} other moiety, so, while the moieties are exogamous, <b>Qemant</b> society as a whole is endogamous.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Qemant</b> {{traditionally}} practiced {{a religion}} {{which is often}} described as [...] "Pagan-Hebraic," [...] combining elements from both Judaism and paganism. According to the American scholar Frederic C. Gamst, their [...] "Hebraism is an ancient form and unaffected by Hebraic change of the past two millennia". A recent sociolinguistic survey notes that the <b>Qemant</b> religion is in a very precarious situation since very few people still adhere to it. According to this study, the ratio of those who follow the <b>Qemant</b> religion vs. those who are baptized and converted to Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity is about 1% vs. 99%.|$|E

50|$|Qimant is the {{original}} language of the <b>Qemant</b> people of Semien Gondar Zone and Ethiopia. Although the ethnic population of the <b>Qemant</b> was 172,327 at the 1994 census, {{only a very small}} fraction of these speak the language nowadays. All speakers live either in Chilga woreda or in Lay Armachiho woreda. The number of first-language speakers is 1625, the number of second language speakers 3450. All speakers of the language are older than 30 years, and more than 75% are older than 50 years. The language is no longer passed on to the next generation of speakers. Most ethnic <b>Qemant</b> people speak Amharic. Qimant is not spoken in public or even at house as a means of day communication any more, but is reduced to a secret code.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the <b>Qemant</b> are unknown {{due to lack of}} a written history. According to oral tradition, the founder of the <b>Qemant</b> was a man called Anayer, who {{is said to have been}} a {{grandson}} of Canaan, son of Ham, son of Noah. After seven years of famine in his own country, he is said to have come to the area of Lake Tana, in Ethiopia. As he traveled with his wife and children, he met the founder of the Beta Israel, who tradition states were traveling in the same direction.|$|E

5000|$|According to {{traditional}} Ethiopian histories, Canaan's son Arwadi (lit.

There is further an Ethiopian tradition that two other Canaanite tribes, viz. the Sinites and Zemarites, also entered Ethiopia {{at the time it was}} ruled by the Kingdom of Kush, and became the Shanqella and Weyto peoples, respectively. The <b>Qemant</b> relate that they share their Canaanite origin with the other Agaw groups The Omotic speaking Shinasha have a similar tradition of descent from Canaan's son Hamati Other claims to Canaanite descent are made by the Efik, the Yoruba the Hausa and other African tribes.|$|E

[...] Gobat knew little more about this [...] "small Pagan people inhabiting the mountains {{in the vicinity of}} Gondar." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to {{traditional}} Amharic-speaking historians, the <b>Qemant</b> were descended from Canaan through his son Arwadi ('the Arvadite') and grandson Anayer.

5000|$|There are two {{orders of}} priesthood, the kamazana, the higher, of the Keber moiety, and the abayegariya, the lower, of the Yetanti moiety.

5000|$|Kayla {{is one of}} {{the names}} of the Beta Israel {{community}} among their neighbours, after which the Kayla language is named.

Speakers of Agaw languages, such as <b>Qemant</b> citizens, told researchers that Kayla means [...] "one who has not crossed the stream" [...] or [...] "he or they that have not crossed". This refers to the observance of Shabbat rules among Ethiopian Jews, necessitating the avoidance of activities prohibited on Shabbat.|$|E
