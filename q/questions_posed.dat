5|$|In May 2009, Ganguly {{was removed}} from the {{captaincy}} of the KKR for the 2009 season of the IPL, and was replaced by McCullum. The decision was questioned by media and other players of the team, when KKR finished {{at the bottom of the}} ranking table with three wins and ten losses. After that, Bengali television channel Zee Bangla roped him as the host of the reality quiz show titled Dadagiri Unlimited. It presented participants from the 19districts of West Bengal, who had to answer <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> by Ganguly. By August, he was appointed the chairman of CAB's Cricket Development Committee. The job of the committee is to receive a report from the selectors at the end of every cricket season, assess the accountability of the selectors and make necessary recommendations. He played for the Ranji cup in the Bengal team in October 2009. Ganguly scored 110 in the match against Delhi and was involved in a partnership of 222 runs with Wriddhiman Saha.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain and}} most of the crew of the shipall {{nationals}} of the Philippineshad to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which required them to remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a federal grand jury investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also partly responsible. The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the New Carissa crew.|$|E

5|$|The {{publication}} debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times and The Globe and Mail, holding the position on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Generally well received by critics, Outliers was considered more personal than Gladwell's other works, and some reviews commented on how much Outliers felt like an autobiography. Reviews praised the connection that Gladwell draws between his own background {{and the rest of the}} publication to conclude the book. Reviewers also appreciated the <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> by Outliers, finding it important to determine how much individual potential is ignored by society. However, the lessons learned were considered anticlimactic and dispiriting. The writing style, though deemed easy to understand, was criticized for oversimplifying complex social phenomena.|$|E

25|$|While an {{election}} petition is pursued similarly to normal civil claims, a judge sitting in {{an election}} court holds more of a inquisitorial role. This inquisitorial power requires the judge to examine and investigate possible electoral malpractice in the electoral area as a whole {{as opposed to being}} limited to determining the <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> by the petition. To aid its decision, the court has the power to require the attendance of any person as a witness, and to examine such a witness even if they are not called by either of the opposing parties. Witnesses are required to answer all <b>questions</b> <b>posed</b> to them, but none of their answers may be admitted as evidence against them in future court proceedings except in cases of perjury proceeding against the witness in respect of the evidence given.|$|E
