40|$|Abstract Background A {{previous}} report {{showed that the}} open field behavior of rats sensitized to the dopamine agonist <b>quinpirole</b> satisfies 5 performance criteria for compulsive checking behavior. In an effort to extend the parallel between the drug-induced phenomenon and human obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), {{the present study investigated}} whether the checking behavior of <b>quinpirole</b> rats is subject to interruption, which is an attribute characteristic of OCD compulsions. For this purpose, the rat's home-cage was placed into the open field at the beginning or the middle of a 2 -hr test. Results Introduction of the home-cage reduced checking behavior, as rats stayed inside the cage. After 40 min, checking resurfaced, as <b>quinpirole</b> rats exited the home-cage often. An unfamiliar cage had no such effects on <b>quinpirole</b> rats or saline controls. Conclusions Checking behavior induced by <b>quinpirole</b> is not irrepressible but can be suspended. Results strengthen the <b>quinpirole</b> preparation as an animal model of OCD compulsive checking. </p...|$|E

Using field potential recording and patch-clamp recording, we evaluated influence of MPTP-reduced dopaminergic afferent in basolateral amygdala (BLA), a main region for affective regulation, on excitatory–inhibitory circuits and synaptic plasticity. Field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) slopes at external capsule-BLA synapses were increased in MPTP-mice with decreases in paired-pulse facilitation and long-term potentiation amplitude, which were corrected by bath-application of D 2 R agonist <b>quinpirole</b> or cannabinoid type 1 receptors agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2, but not D 1 R agonist SKF 38393. Compared to single waveform fEPSP in control mice, a multi-spike waveform fEPSP {{was observed in}} MPTP-mice with prolongation of duration {{and an increase in}} paired-pulse inhibition, which were recovered by BLA-injection of <b>quinpirole</b> for 2 days rather than bath-application. Density of GABA-evoked current (IGABA) in BLA principal neurons and GABAAR-α 2 subunit expression were reduced in MPTP-mice, which were recovered by administration of <b>quinpirole.</b> Decline of PKC phosphorylation in BLA of MPTP-mice was corrected by bath-application of <b>quinpirole,</b> but not SKF 38393. In MPTP-mice, BLA-injection of <b>quinpirole</b> or PKC activator PMA could recover GABAAR expression, which was sensitive to PKC inhibitor GF 109203 X. The impairment of long-term depression (LTD) in MPTP-mice was rescued by bath-application of GABAAR agonist muscimol or BLA-injection of <b>quinpirole</b> and PMA. Finally, BLA-injection of muscimol, <b>quinpirole</b> or PMA relieved anxiety-like behaviors in MPTP-mice. The results indicate that the MPTP-induced dopamine depletion in BLA principal neurons through reducing D 2 R-mediated PKC phosphorylation suppresses GABAAR expression and activity, which impairs GABAAR-mediated inhibition and LTD induction leading to anxiety-like behaviors...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that repeated administrations of <b>quinpirole,</b> a D 2 /D 3 dopamine receptor agonist, facilitate instrumental behavior in rats {{given the choice}} between operant and free access to water (contrafreeloading: CFL). The goal {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effects of repeated daily administrations of <b>quinpirole</b> (0. 5 mg/kg i. p.) on the appetitive versus the consummatory component of water-reinforced behavior, under two experimental conditions. Under one condition, the rats were given access to tap water according to an FR 3 schedule of reinforcement. Under the second condition, the rats were given the choice between operant and free access to water. Five major findings were obtained. First, acutely <b>quinpirole</b> suppressed operant behavior and, therefore, water intake for at least I h. Second, upon repeated administrations tolerance developed to the suppressant effect of <b>quinpirole</b> on instrumental behavior but only to a lesser extent to the antidipsic effect, dissociating the appetitive from the consummatory components of water-reinforced behavior. Third, in CFL conditions <b>quinpirole</b> induced a progressively larger preference for the operant access. Fourth, even when the rats were given the choice between free access to highly palatable saccharine (0. 05 or 0. 01 %) solutions and operant access to tap water, <b>quinpirole</b> shifted the animals towards the operant access. Fifth, repeated <b>quinpirole</b> produced lasting consequences on drinking behavior, since after rehydration and under drug-free conditions quinpirole-pretreated rats ingested larger amounts of water than control rats. In conclusion, the repeated activation of D 2 /D 3 receptors appears to induce the rats to perseverate in performing needless instrumental behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The mesolimbic {{dopamine}} (DA) {{system is}} involved in the rewarding process of drugs of abuse and is activated during the anticipation of drug availability. However, the neurocircuitry that regulates ethanol (EtOH) -seeking has not been adequately investigated. The objectives of the present study were to determine 1) whether the posterior ventral tegmental area (p-VTA) mediates EtOH-seeking, 2) whether microinjections of EtOH into the p-VTA could stimulate EtOH-seeking, and (3) the involvement of p-VTA DA neurons in EtOH-seeking. Alcohol-preferring rats were trained to self-administer 15 % EtOH and water. After 10 weeks, rats underwent extinction training, followed by 2 weeks in their home cages. During the home-cage period, rats were then bilaterally implanted with guide cannulae aimed at the p-VTA or anterior ventral tegmental area (a-VTA). EtOH-seeking was assessed by the Pavlovian spontaneous recovery model. Separate experiments examined the effects of: 1) microinjection of <b>quinpirole</b> into the p-VTA, 2) EtOH microinjected into the p-VTA, 3) coadministration of EtOH and <b>quinpirole</b> into the p-VTA, 4) microinjection of <b>quinpirole</b> into the a-VTA, and 5) microinjection of EtOH into the a-VTA. <b>Quinpirole</b> microinjected into the p-VTA reduced EtOH-seeking. Microinjections of EtOH into the p-VTA increased EtOH-seeking. Pretreatment with both <b>quinpirole</b> and EtOH into the p-VTA reduced EtOH-seeking. Microinjections of <b>quinpirole</b> or EtOH into the a-VTA did not alter EtOH-seeking. Overall, the results suggest that the p-VTA is a neuroanatomical substrate mediating alcohol-seeking behavior and that activation of local DA neurons is involved...|$|E

Furthermore, the possible role of σ 1 receptors (σ 1 Rs) in the cocaine-provoked amplification of D 2 receptor (D 2 R) -induced reduction of K+-evoked [3 H]-DA and glutamate release from rat striatal synaptosomes, has also been investigated. The dopamine D 2 -likeR agonist <b>quinpirole</b> (10 nM- 1 μM), concentration-dependently reduced K+-evoked [3 H]-DA and glutamate release from rat striatal synaptosomes. The σ 1 R antagonist BD 1063 (100 nM), amplified the effects of <b>quinpirole</b> (10 and 100 nM) on K+-evoked [3 H]-DA, but not glutamate, release. Nanomolar cocaine concentrations significantly enhanced the <b>quinpirole</b> (100 nM) -induced decrease of K+-evoked [3 H]-DA and glutamate release from rat striatal synaptosomes. In the presence of BD 1063 (10 nM), cocaine failed to amplify the <b>quinpirole</b> (100 nM) -induced effects. In cotransfected σ 1 R and D 2 LR HEK 293 T cells, <b>quinpirole</b> had a reduced potency to inhibit the CREB signal versus D 2 LR singly transfected cells.

In an established rodent model of OCD checking behaviour, <b>quinpirole</b> (dopamine D 2 / 3 -receptor agonist) increased checking in open-field tests, indicating dopaminergic modulation of checking-like behaviours. We designed a novel operant paradigm for rats (observing response task (ORT)) to further examine cognitive processes underpinning checking behaviour and clarify {{how and why}} checking develops. We investigated i) how <b>quinpirole</b> increases checking, ii) dependence of these effects on D 2 / 3 receptor function (following treatment with D 2 / 3 receptor antagonist sulpiride) and iii) effects of reward uncertainty. In the ORT, rats pressed an 'observing' lever {{for information about the}} location of an 'active' lever that provided food reinforcement. High- and low-checkers (defined from baseline observing) received <b>quinpirole</b> (0. 5 mg/kg, 10 treatments) or vehicle. Parametric task manipulations assessed observing/checking under increasing task demands relating to reinforcement uncertainty (variable response requirement and active-lever location switching). Treatment with sulpiride further probed the pharmacological basis of long-term behavioural changes. <b>Quinpirole</b> selectively increased checking, both functional observing lever presses (OLPs) and non-functional extra OLPs (EOLPs). The increase in OLPs and EOLPs was long-lasting, without further <b>quinpirole</b> administration. <b>Quinpirole</b> did not affect the immediate ability to use information from checking.

Sulpiride reduced non-functional EOLPs in QNP rats but had no effect on functional OLPs.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether nAChRs and D 2 receptors co-exist {{and interact}} {{on the same}} nerve endings using synaptosomes prelabeled with [3 H]DA and exposed to nicotinic anddopaminergic receptor ligands. The nicotinic agonists (-) nicotine or epibatidine provoked [3 H]DA release which was inhibited by <b>quinpirole.</b> This effect was blocked by sulpiride and raclopride. The [3 H]DA overflow evoked by 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP) was markedly inhibited by <b>quinpirole.</b> This inhibitory effect did not change either in absence or in presence of (-) nicotine when the nAChRs were desensitized. The inhibitory effect of <b>quinpirole</b> disappeared after a preincubation with this drug. However, the stimulatory effect of (-) nicotine did not change when the D 2 receptors were desensitized. (-) Nicotine and 4 -AP were able to stimulate [3 H]DA overflow also in mouse synaptosomes and this overflow was strongly inhibited by <b>quinpirole.</b> In the nAChR subunits β 2 knockout mice the (-) nicotineevoked [3 H]DA overflow did not occur anymore but <b>quinpirole</b> {{was still able to}} inhibit the [3 H]DA overflow elicited by 4 -AP. To conclude: in rat and mouse the (-) nicotine evokedrelease can be modulated by D 2 autoreceptors coexisting in the same DA terminals and nAChRs function is independent from the activation of D 2 autoreceptors which themselves may function independently from the activation of presynaptic nAChRs...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the role of dopamine (DA) DI receptors in the control of striatal acetylcholine (ACh) transmission, we studied the effects of SCH 39166 (D- 1 receptor antagonist), alone or in combination with <b>quinpirole</b> (D- 2 /D- 3 agonist) or PD 128, 907 (D- 3 agonist) on ACh and DA release. <b>Quinpirole</b> reduced DA and ACh release; PD 128, 907 decreased DA but not ACh release. SCH 39166 stimulated DA and decreased ACh release. Pretreatment with <b>quinpirole</b> reduced or prevented (depending on the dose) the stimulation of DA release while potentiating the decrease of ACh release elicited by SCH 39166. Similarly, SCH 39166 administered following PD 128, 907 did not stimulate DA release, further decreasing ACh release. These results indicate that <b>quinpirole</b> or PD 128, 907 affect the actions of SCH 39166 on DA and ACh release in opposite manner, counteracting the increase of DA release and potentiating the reduction of ACh release. These data support the tenet that endogenous DA exerts a stimulatory input on striatal ACh neurotransmission mediated by D- 1 receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between muscarinic-cholinergic and dopaminergic {{systems in the}} modulation of memory storage of Y-maze discrimination (YMD) task was examined in C 57 BL/ 6 and DBA/ 2 strains of mice. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, post-training systemic (i. p.) administration of the D 2 -agonist <b>quinpirole</b> facilitated retention and the D 2 -antagonist (-) -sulpiride impaired retention. Opposite effects were observed in DBA/ 2 strain. The facilitating or impairing effects of <b>quinpirole</b> and (-) -sulpiride were blocked by simultaneous post-training administration of muscarinic-cholinergic agonists and antagonists. The memory enhancing effects of the cholinergic agonist oxotremorine were not blocked by simultaneous administration of sulpiride in C 57 BL/ 6 mice or <b>quinpirole</b> in DBA/ 2 mice. Furthermore, the memory impairing effects of the cholinergic antagonist atropine were not blocked by simultaneous administration of <b>quinpirole</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 mice or sulpiride in DBA/ 2 mice.

40|$|Sensorimotor gating, a neural process {{severely}} disrupted {{in patients}} with schizophrenia, can be measured by assessing prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle responses. PPI is disrupted in experimental animals by stimulation of D 2 -like dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). We ex-amined the effect of repeated treatment with a selective dopa-mine D 2 -like receptor agonist, <b>quinpirole,</b> and characterized the molecular substrates of the resulting PPI adaptation.

40|$|Rats emit two {{distinct}} types of ultrasonic vocalizations in adulthood: 22 kHz (aversive situation), and 50 kHz calls (appetitive situation). The present project is focussed on pharmacological studies of 50 kHz vocalizations. The 50 kHz calls are elicited from dopaminergic activation in the meso limbic pathway and are emitted in such appetitive situations as social contact(s), sexual encounters, food reward, etc. Eighty-five male rats were stereotaxically implanted with bilateral guide cannulae in the nucleus accumbens shell (A= 9. 7, L= 1. 2, V= 6. 7). <b>Quinpirole,</b> a D 2 /D 3 dopaminergic agonist, was injected in low doses to the nucleus accumbens shell {{in an attempt}} to elicit 50 kHz vocalizations. A dose response was obtained for the low dose range of <b>quinpirole</b> for six doses: 0. 025 Jlg, 0. 06 Jlg, 0. 12 Jlg, 0. 25 Jlg, 0. 5 Jlg, and 1. 0 Jlg. It was found that only application of the 0. 25 Jlg dose of <b>quinpirole</b> and the 7 Jlg dose of amphetamine (positive control) significantly increased the total number of 50 kHz calls (p < 0. 006 and p < 0. 004 respectively); and particularly significantly increased the frequency modulated type of these calls (p < 0. 01, and p < 0. 006 respectively). In a double injection procedure, the dose of 0. 25 Jlg <b>quinpirole</b> was antagonized with raclopride (D 2 antagonist) or U 99194 A maleate (D 3 antagonist) {{in an attempt to}} antagonize the response. The 0. 25 Jlg dose of <b>quinpirole</b> was successfully antagonized by pre-treatment with an equimolar dose of U 99194 A maleate (p < 0. 008) but not with raclopride. The 7 Jlg amphetamine response was also antagonized with an equimolar dose of raclopride. Based on these results, it seems that low doses of <b>quinpirole,</b> particularly the 0. 25 Jlg dose, are capable of increasing 50 kHz vocalizations in rats and do so by activation of the D 3 dopamine receptor. This is not a biphasic response as seen with locomotor studies. Also noteworthy is the increase in frequency modulated 50 kHz calls elicited by the 0. 25 Jlg dose of <b>quinpirole</b> indicating a possible increase in positive affect...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} two D 3 / 2 {{dopamine}} receptor agonists, LY- 171555 (<b>quinpirole)</b> and 7 -hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl- 2 -aminotetralin (7 -OH-DPAT) on spontaneous [3 H]-acetylcholine ([3 H]-ACh) release were investigated in rat striatal synaptosomes. <b>Quinpirole</b> and 7 -OH-DPAT inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the basal efflux of [3 H]-ACh with similar Emax (maximal inhibitory effect) values (29. 95 ± 2. 91 % and 33. 19 ± 1. 21 %, respectively). Significant differences were obtained between the pEC 50 (−log of molar concentration) of <b>quinpirole</b> (7. 87 ± 0. 12) and 7 -OH-DPAT (7. 21 ± 0. 17; P< 0. 01). Different concentrations (0. 3 – 10 [*]nM) of haloperidol (D 2 / 3 dopamine receptor antagonist) {{shifted to the}} right the concentration-response curves elicited by <b>quinpirole</b> and 7 -OH-DPAT, without modifications in the Emax. Slopes of a Schild plot obtained with haloperidol {{in the presence of}} <b>quinpirole</b> and 7 -OH-DPAT were not signficantly different from unity (0. 85 ± 0. 05 and 1. 17 ± 0. 11, respectively) and consequently haloperidol interacted with a homogeneous receptor population. The pKB values of haloperidol obtained from Schild regression were 9. 96 ± 0. 15 (in presence of <b>quinpirole)</b> and 9. 90 ± 0. 09 (in presence of 7 -OH-DPAT). Specific binding of [3 H]-YM- 09151 - 2 to membranes of striatal synaptosomes and cells expressing D 2 and D 3 dopamine receptors was inhibited by haloperidol. Analysis of competition curves revealed the existence of a single population of receptors. There were no differences between the estimated pKi (−log of molar concentration) values for synaptosomes (8. 96 ± 0. 02) and cells expressing D 2 receptors (8. 81 ± 0. 05), but the pKi value from cells expressing D 3 dopamine receptors differed significantly (8. 48 ± 0. 06; P< 0. 01). In conclusion, the data obtained in the present study indicate that <b>quinpirole</b> and 7 -OH-DPAT, two D 3 / 2 dopamine receptor agonists, inhibit the spontaneous [3 H]-ACh efflux and this effect is competitively antagonized by haloperidol and probably mediated through dopamine D 2 receptors...|$|E
40|$|In normal common {{marmosets}} {{administration of}} the D- 1 /D- 2 agonist apomorphine or the selective D- 2 agonist <b>quinpirole</b> caused a dose-dependent increase in motor activity and induced stereotyped behaviour. Both the selective D- 2 antagonist raclopride and the selective D- 1 antagonist SCH 23390 inhibited normal locomotor activity and induced catalepsy. Quinpirole- and apomorphine-induced motor activity were potently inhibited by pretreatment with raclopride. The effects of <b>quinpirole,</b> but not apomorphine, were weakly inhibited by SCH 23390. The selective D- 1 partial agonist SKF 38393 decreased motor activity and did not induce grooming, oral movements or other behaviours. SKF 38393 inhibited motor activity induced by the administration of <b>quinpirole</b> but did not alter apomorphine-induced motor behaviour. Locomotor activity in normal common marmosets appears to be mediated mainly via D- 2 systems. In contrast to rodents, administration of SKF 38393 does not induce behavioural activation and there {{does not appear to}} be a facilitating effect of D- 1 systems on D- 2 function in the normal common marmoset. However, the ability of both SKF 38393 and SCH 23390 to inhibit <b>quinpirole</b> locomotor activity suggests some interaction between D- 1 and D- 2 systems to occur in this species...|$|E
40|$|International audienceChronic {{modifications}} of dopamine transmission alter striatal dendritic spines. Here, {{we show that}} spine density and length are increased in the nucleus accumbens 24 h after a single injection of caffeine or <b>quinpirole,</b> a dopamine D 2 /D 3 dopamine receptors agonist, whereas the dopamine antagonist haloperidol has opposite effects. These effects are absent in mice lacking β-adducin, a protein that stabilizes actin/spectrin cortical cytoskeleton and modulates synaptic plasticity. Phosphorylation of adducin (Ser 713 in β-adducin), which disrupts actin/spectrin interaction, is increased by <b>quinpirole,</b> haloperidol, or caffeine. We previously demonstrated that DARPP- 32 interacts with β-adducin and facilitates its phosphorylation. <b>Quinpirole</b> increased DARPP- 32 phosphorylation at Thr 75 and haloperidol at Ser 97, two modifications that can have similar consequences on adducin phosphorylation through distinct mechanisms. Experiments in DARPP- 32 mutant mice confirmed that the apparently paradoxical similar effects of <b>quinpirole</b> and haloperidol on adducin phosphorylation may result from differential effects of these drugs on DARPP- 32 phosphorylation at Thr 75 and Ser 97.

40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways {{play a crucial}} role in the neurobiology of the nervous system. In the present study, dopamine receptor-mediated regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) was examined in rats in which the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway was unilaterally lesioned by 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA). Subcutaneous injections of the D 2 receptor agonist <b>quinpirole</b> significantly increased tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK 1 / 2 in lesioned striatum, whereas the D 1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 failed to activate ERKs. Quinpirole-induced phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 was seen as early as 3 min and peaked at 15 min after the challenge. In parallel, striatal ERK kinase activity, measured by the in vitro kinase assay, was increased 2. 5 -fold on the lesioned side after the administration of <b>quinpirole.</b> Immunohistochemical examination of brain sections after <b>quinpirole</b> administration revealed significan...|$|E
40|$|Incubation of rat striatal synaptosomes {{with the}} {{adenosine}} receptor agonist 2 -chloroadenosine (2 -CADO) produced a concentration-dependent increase of dopamine (DA) synthesis (about 50 % of control value). The effect was not additive with the stimulation produced by either 10 microM forskolin or 2 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Pretreatment of striatal synaptosomes with 2 -CADO produced an activation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) which withstood washing and lysing of the tissue. This activation was largely {{independent of the}} presence of Ca 2 + ion in the preincubation medium and, when analyzed as a function of different concentrations of the pterin cofactor 6 -methyl- 5, 6, 7, 8 -tetrahydropterin (0. 08 - 0. 4 mM), it was associated with an apparent increase in the Vmax of the enzyme. <b>Quinpirole,</b> a selective D 2 DA receptor agonist, reduced control synaptosomal DA synthesis and caused a persistent inhibition of TH activity. When added together with 2 -CADO, <b>quinpirole</b> depressed the stimulation of DA synthesis and TH activity produced by the adenosine analog. The effect of <b>quinpirole</b> was stereospecifically antagonized by the D 2 DA antagonist sulpiride. <b>Quinpirole</b> also inhibited the activation of TH elicited by a submaximal concentration of forskolin, but not that produced by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The inhibitory effect of <b>quinpirole</b> on basal and 2 -CADO-stimulated TH activities was mimicked by DA.

On number trials, the duration of the sound sequence was held constant at 4 s, and the number of sounds was either 2 or 8. Psychophysical functions for time and number were obtained by presenting unreinforced sequences of intermediate duration or number. In agreement with previous research, sensitivity to variation in time was greater than variation in number. Rats received injections of the specific D 2 agonist, <b>quinpirole</b> (0. 08 mg/kg), or saline. <b>Quinpirole</b> significantly attenuated control by both time and number, but it did not increase behavioral estimates of time or number.

The steepness of the psychophysical functions for both time and number was reduced in a dose-related fashion without any evidence of an increase in the estimation of time or number. The similarity of the effect of <b>quinpirole</b> on both time and number processing is consistent with the idea that the same internal mechanism is used for timing and counting. However, it is not consistent with the idea that D 2 dopamine agonists selectively increase the rate of the internal clock, which is assumed to underlie performance in a temporal bisection procedure. <b>Quinpirole</b> (at doses between 0. 02 and 0. 08 mg/kg) reduces sensitivity t...|$|E
40|$|Prepulse {{inhibition}} (PPI) of acoustic {{startle response}} is impaired {{in patients with}} schizophrenia and in animals acutely treated with dopamine agonists and NMDA antagonists. In this study, we investigated {{the time course of}} PPI disruption induced by repeated amphetamine, <b>quinpirole,</b> phencyclidine (PCP), and dizocilpine (MK- 801) treatment. We focused on how PPI disruption development was influenced by drug administration regimens, comparing a constant versus an escalating dosing regimen. Male Sprague–Dawley rats were repeatedly treated with amphetamine (1. 25 – 5. 0 mg/kg, or constant 5. 0 mg/kg, sc), PCP (0. 50 – 2. 0 mg/kg, or constant 0. 5, 1. 0 or 2. 0 mg/kg, sc), <b>quinpirole</b> (0. 03 – 0. 12 mg/kg, or constant 0. 12 mg/kg, sc), MK- 801 (0. 025 – 0. 10 mg/kg, or constant 0. 10 mg/kg, sc) or vehicle (saline) and tested for PPI once daily for 6 consecutive days. When amphetamine 5. 0 mg/kg or <b>quinpirole</b> 0. 12 mg/kg was administrated on a constant dosing schedule, both drugs disrupted PPI upon acute administration, but had no effect after repeated treatment and testing (days 2 – 5). However, when amphetamine 5. 0 mg/kg or <b>quinpirole</b> 0. 12 mg/kg was preceded by two lower doses in an escalating dosing regimen, both drugs still disrupted PPI on days 5 and 6 when the constant amphetamine and <b>quinpirole</b> had no effect. For PCP and MK- 801, repeated treatment under both regimens produced a stable and persistent disruption of PPI. Startle magnitude increased progressively and dose-dependently under both regimens for all drugs except for <b>quinpirole,</b> which caused a decrease. These results suggest that the drug dosing schedule, rather than the absolute amount of drug that an animal receives, has a greater impact on the development of PPI-disruptive effect of dopamine agonists than NMDA antagonists.
