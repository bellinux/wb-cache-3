60|$|This, as the {{proximate}} cause of our railway system, {{has changed the}} face of the country, the course of trade, and the habits of the people. Consider, first, the complicated sets of changes that precede the making of every railway--the provisional arrangements, the meetings, the registration, the trial section, the parliamentary survey, the lithographed plans, the books of reference, the local deposits and notices, the application to Parliament, the passing Standing-Orders Committee, the first, second, and third readings: each of which brief heads indicates a multiplicity of transactions, and the development of sundry occupations--as those of engineers, surveyors, lithographers, parliamentary agents, share-brokers; and the creation of sundry others--as those of traffic-takers, reference-takers. Consider, next, the yet more marked changes implied in railway construction--the cuttings, embankings, tunnellings, diversions of roads; the building of bridges, and stations; the laying down of ballast, sleepers, and rails; the making of engines, tenders, carriages, and waggons: which processes, acting upon numerous trades, increase the importation of timber, the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> the manufacture of iron, the mining of coal, the burning of bricks: institute a variety of special manufactures weekly advertised in the Railway Times; and, finally, open the way to sundry new occupations, as those of drivers, stokers, cleaners, plate-layers, etc., etc. And then consider the changes, more numerous and involved still, which railways in action produce on the community at large. The organisation of every business is more or less modified: ease of communication makes it better to do directly what was before done by proxy; agencies are established where previously they would not have paid; goods are obtained from remote wholesale houses instead of near retail ones; and commodities are used which distance once rendered inaccessible. Again, the rapidity and small cost of carriage tend to specialise more than ever the industries of different districts--to confine each manufacture to the parts in which, from local advantages, it can be best carried on. Further, the diminished cost of carriage, facilitating distribution, equalises prices, and also, on the average, lowers prices: thus bringing divers articles within the means of those before unable to buy them, and so increasing their comforts and improving their habits. At the same time the practice of travelling is immensely extended. Classes who never before thought of it, take annual trips to the sea; visit their distant relations; make tours; and so we are benefited in body, feelings, and intellect. Moreover, the more prompt transmission of letters and of news produces further changes--makes the pulse of the nation faster. Yet more, there arises a wide dissemination of cheap literature through railway book-stalls, and of advertisements in railway carriages: both of them aiding ulterior progress.|$|E
60|$|Space permitting, {{we might}} {{show how the}} {{localization}} o£ special industries in special parts of a kingdom, {{as well as the}} minute subdivision of labour in the making of each commodity, are similarly determined. Or, turning to a somewhat different order of illustrations, we might dwell on the multitudinous changes--material, intellectual, moral,--caused by printing; or the further extensive series of changes wrought by gunpowder. But leaving the intermediate phases of social development, let us take a few illustrations from its most recent and its passing phases. To trace the effects of steam-power, in its manifold applications to mining, navigation, and manufactures of all kinds, would carry us into unmanageable detail. Let us confine ourselves to the latest embodiment of steam power--the locomotive engine. This, as the proximate cause of our railway system, has changed the face of the country, the course of trade, and the habits of the people. Consider, first, the complicated sets of changes that precede the making of every railway--the provisional arrangements, the meetings, the registration, the trial section, the parliamentary survey, the lithographed plans, the books of reference, the local deposits and notices, the application to Parliament, the passing Standing Orders Committee, the first, second, and third readings: each of which brief heads indicates a multiplicity of transactions, and the extra development of sundry occupations--as those of engineers, surveyors, lithographers, parliamentary agents, share-brokers; and the creation of sundry others--as those of traffic-takers, reference-takers. Consider, next, the yet more marked changes implied in railway construction--the cuttings, embankings, tunnellings, diversions of roads; the building of bridges and stations, the laying down of ballast, sleepers, and rails; the making of engines, tenders, carriages, and waggons: which processes, acting on numerous trades, increase the importation of timber, the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> the manufacture of iron, the mining of coal, the burning of bricks; institute a variety of special manufactures weekly advertised in the Railway Times; and, finally, open the way to sundry new occupations, as those of drivers, stokers, cleaners, plate-layers, &c., &c. And then consider the changes, still more numerous and involved, which railways in action produce on the community at large. Business agencies are established where previously they would not have paid; goods are obtained from remote wholesale houses instead of near retail ones; and commodities are used which distance once rendered inaccessible. Again, the diminished cost of carriage tends to specialize more than ever the industries of different districts--to confine each manufacture to the parts in which, from local advantages, it can be best carried on. Further, the fall in freights, facilitating distribution, equalizes prices, and also, on the average, lowers prices: thus bringing divers articles within the means of those before unable to buy them, and so increasing their comforts and improving their habits. At the same time the practice of travelling is immensely extended. People who never before dreamed of it, take trips to the sea; visit their distant relations; make tours; and so we are benefited in body, feelings, and ideas. The more prompt transmission of letters and of news produces other marked changes--makes the pulse of the nation faster. Once more, there arises a wide dissemination of cheap literature through railway book-stalls, and of advertisements in railway carriages: both of them aiding ulterior progress. And the countless changes here briefly indicated are consequent on the invention of the locomotive engine. The social organism has been rendered more heterogeneous in virtue of the many new occupations introduced, and the many old ones further specialized; prices of nearly all things in every place have been altered; each trader has modified his way of doing business; and every person has been affected in his actions, thoughts, emotions.|$|E
50|$|The catacombs {{underwent}} {{various other}} phases of use.

50|$|Industrial and {{manufacturing}} activities were smaller. The largest such activities were the mining and <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stones,</b> which provided basic construction {{materials for the}} buildings of that period. In manufacturing, production was on a relatively small scale, and generally consisted of workshops and small factories that employed at most dozens of workers. However, some brick factories employed hundreds of workers.|$|R
50|$|Derbyshire is {{a largely}} rural county, and {{contains}} {{much of the}} Peak District National Park. Past industries have included coal-mining, and <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> continues in the county. Industry is located mainly in and around Derby. The bedrock {{of much of the}} county is carboniferous limestone, with areas of sandstone and millstone Grit, these stones providing the major building materials for the churches.|$|E
50|$|The <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> in Quorn {{began at}} a very early age at Buddon Wood, on the edge of the parish. Granite {{millstones}} were quarried in the early Iron Age, and under the Romans stone was quarried for building in Leicester. Some of the larger millstones can still be seen in the area, however these days they are either used as garden ornaments, or worked into seats or slabs.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 18th Century, the {{entrance}} to the harbour was near to the church. Attempts at reclamation of the harbour, which were unsuccessful due to locals removing building materials, resulted in the harbour being moved. The church was undermined by the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> from the beach, which accounts for the large dressed blocks leading along the beach to Priory Bay. A small gun battery, which has been lost to the sea, once defended the entrance.|$|E

He {{and his wife}} moved into the Hall in 1870 when Whitworth had largely retired and was using his energies to direct the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> from Whitworths quarry. The gardens were designed by Edward Milner; the architect for the 1872 renovation was T. Roger Smith, followed in 1879 by Edward Middleton Barry. A noted feature was the rockery, which Sir Joseph Whitworth had constructed out of a sandstone quarry.|$|E
50|$|Child {{abuse and}} neglect are widespread, as is child labor. The U.S. Department of Labor's List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor {{reported}} 5 goods produced under such working conditions in Paraguay. These included the production of bricks, the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> the production of cotton and sugarcane as well as pornography. The National Commission to Prevent and Eradicate the Exploitation of Children, the Secretariat for Children and Adolescents (SNNA), and the Integral Adolescent Attention Service seek to protect children and adolescents from abuse. There are hostels, shelters, and children's homes and orphanages around the country.|$|E
50|$|Along the new {{railroad}} {{sprung up}} the new platted towns of Loveland and Berthoud, named respectively after the president and chief surveyor of the Colorado Central. Likewise Wellington (founded in 1903) was named for a railroad employee. The Greeley, Salt Lake and Pacific Railroad arrived three years later as {{a subsidiary of the}} Union Pacific Railroad, with the intention of creating a transcontinental line over Cameron Pass. Although the line was never extended over the mountains, it opened up the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> for the railroad at Stout, furnishing another industry for the region. The brief attempt at the mining of gold in the region centered at the now ghost town of Manhattan in the Poudre Canyon.|$|E

5000|$|In 1884, at the Wealaka Mission Miss Denton {{was married}} to Col. Lee W. Lindsey (born 1845, Ohio. He served in an Ohio {{regiment}} of cavalry during the American Civil War, and after peace was restored, went south and lived for several years in Alabama, and superintended the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> for {{the building of the}} first machine shops at Birmingham. He became a building contractor, and during the 1870s, moved to the Creek Nation of Indian Territory. Colonel Lindsey completed the walls and enclosure of the old council house of the Creek Nation at Okmulgee. They moved to Tulsa, establishing a home there in 1886, and for many years, was one of the central figures in Northeastern Oklahoma.|$|E
5000|$|The barrage {{will not}} create a [...] "lagoon"—as both opponents and {{supporters}} have sometimes claimed. Tidal power stations by definition require that the tide flows through the barrage, but the tidal range in the Severn would be halved. There are claims that the migration of fish would be hampered, but these are contested. The Severn bore would also be eliminated. Any barrage {{would be likely to}} stimulate coastal erosion in some areas, and create a negative visual impact upon the landscape (subjective, similar to wind turbines). There would also be negative consequences of the huge amount of concrete (and other materials) needed, with the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> likely to impact on other areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} parish {{church was}} built in 1649 from local stone. This can be confirmed by the passing of an Act of the Scottish Parliament (in July 1649) in favour of the parishioners of New Kilpatrick and {{against one of the}} parish heritors, Sir Umphra Colquhoun of Balvie (now Mains). It seems that Colquhoun had agreed to the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> from his land to build the church, but {{at some point during the}} building process (at least halfway), he had confiscated the workmen's tools and prevented the work from continuing by charging the workers with lawburrows. For this to be the case, Colquhoun must have argued that the work in some way caused him to fear for his safety, and the workers would have had to place a deposit with the court, which would be forfeited if they continued. Colquhoun lost the petition, and the church was completed. The current New Kilpatrick Church {{was built in}} 1807, and subsequently enlarged in 1873-85 and in 1908. Electric lights were installed in 1923. The church for many years placed assistant ministers within the parish at Netherton and Temple, Blairdardie, Drumchapel and Westerton. The church is also one of the principal performing venues of the Bearsden Choir.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess {{the long-term effects of}} the Roman occupation on the native inhabitants of Cumbria. Everyone would certainly have been aware of their arrival in the area, and their final departure, but the locals were left much more to their own devices than those in the south of England. No doubt there was some Romanisation of the local culture, specifically among the governing élites who worked closely with the Roman military. Also, near the forts and associated 'vici', the rural population would have been providing foodstuffs and other goods (such as hides, wool, horn). Industrial working, such as the production of pottery, mining of lead, copper, <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone,</b> although undoubtedly managed by the Roman forces, would have employed local people. So, there would probably have been a fair amount of contact, wiiling or not, between the Roman and Celtic peoples. The evidence gleaned from artefacts such as the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan (also known as the Ilam Pan), suggests that a Romano-British adaptation of Celtic art persisted in Cumbria. One expert says that: [...] "...Celtic tradition survived in Roman disguise...", and that [...] "the Romanisation of Britain was in many ways nothing but a surface veneer." [...] (The pan was probably a souvenir of Hadrian's Wall, inscribed with the names of some of the Cumbrian forts in the 2nd century, along with the name of the owner, perhaps an ex-soldier, showing that the Wall was noteworthy enough in Roman times to be remembered).|$|E

40|$|The {{coronation}} of Queen Victoria in 1837 saw {{the start}} of perhaps the most dynamic and innovative period in Britain’s history. It {{was a period of}} massive industrial expansion and exploitation at home and abroad. The pace of this development was matched by a rapid growth in population. New towns and cities mushroomed around the main industrial centres. Agricultural and industrial practices went through a period of unprecedented change as the insatiable needs of this growing urban population had to be met. Our natural resources had to be exploited to their fullest extent to house this growing urban workforce. The <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> for building purposes was no different from any other industry at this time with activity in the quarries reaching a peak {{by the end of the}} century...|$|E

40|$|Archaeology {{involves}} creating meaningful {{narratives of}} prehistoric societies, using only {{the remains of}} their material culture. This study focuses on Neolithic rock-art in two very different regions – Jämtland (Northern Sweden) and Cumbria (North West England) – seeking to explore, directly, the ‘meaningfulness’ of this art. During the Neolithic period in Britain (c. 4000 - 2400 BC) and Northern Sweden (c. 4000 - 1800 BC), rocky outcrops were elaborated either by pecking abstract designs (Britain) or by carving and painting animal and human representations (Northern Sweden). Prehistoric rock-art in Britain and Scandinavia is usually understood and made ‘meaningful’ in relation to one, or a combination of, methodological approaches: it may be understood {{as part of the}} landscape (experienced through the human body (phenomenology)), or given meaning in light of ethnographic evidence. All of these approaches, however, ignore the subtle ways in which the rock-art itself was structured. The study, presented here, employed three methodological approaches in order to attempt to understand rock-art in a new and, arguably, more meaningful way. Firstly, a structure- based approach involved establishing the primary methods that the carvers used to create meaningful rock-art narratives. Secondly, a discourse- based approach was used to uncover how these basic design forms were articulated, to allow communication and dialogue of Neolithic ideas into the sphere of social practice (discourse being an attempt to identify themes within the rock-art narratives, which act as intermediaries between structure and agency). Finally, the third agency- based approach blends structure with discourse (agency allowed meaningful social action to occur during the Neolithic). The structure-based approach in Cumbria revealed that the art of the central fells region was based on the manipulation of natural and cultural cups or circles into linear patterns. This is in contrast with the approach in eastern Cumbria, where the reverse was found- with lines being manipulated into circular shapes. In Jämtland, the fundamental structure of the art was based on the division of elk into both male/female and moving/stationary categories. The results of the discourse methodology revealed that three themes dictated the style of rock-art carvings during the Neolithic, in both Cumbria and Jämtland; naturalistic, stylised and abstract. The agency approach concluded that the visual statements made using the rock-art were examples of agents’ changing relationship with the natural world and the resources it contained- especially the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> for axes. Metaphorically, it is argued that the three changing discourses of rock-art were a reflection of the changing relationship people had with the <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> and its exchange. One of the main implications of this research is the finding that there is still a place for investigating rock-art and material/visual culture. Furthermore, using the methodological approach of this research, we {{are in a position to}} explore some of the deeper dimensions of visual culture, and its relationship to social structure and agency, in the Neolithic...|$|E
40|$|The ancient Dalmatian {{autonomous}} communes, Korčula included, excel {{the usual}} average {{development in a}} number of ways. While the commune of Korčula included the whole island, the city lies in its extreme north-eastern strategical part. Important pre-historical finds, discovered in the Vela Splilja cave in the vicinity of Vela Luka, remind those found on the Hvar Island. The first author to mention Korčula was an ancient Greek one, the 4 th century B. C. writer Pseudo-Skalax, who called the island Kerkyra mèlaina. There is a variant form i. e. Korkyra mèlaina, Latin Corcyra nigra, or only Korkyra or Corcyra, respectively. According to ancient authors, the city was founded by Cnidans. A grecian inscription, telling about the colonisation by Grecian settlers, and the foundation of the city, found near Lumbarda, {{is one of the most}} important. A Roman inscription refers to the temple of the deity Venera Pelagia. Reliable information about the present city go back to the mid- 10 th century A. D. Significant finds, dating from the early middle ages, were discovered on the Majsan Islet situated to the east of the city. The city statute, dating from 1265 (the oldest in Dalmatia) has been preserved. Its institutions concerning the salvage of shipwrecked vessels, with their 15 th century modifications, are progressive ones. One of the first agrarian reforms in this country took place during the period from 1409 to 1411. The 15 th century regulations concerning the construction of the city were also very progressive. The building of ships and <b>quarrying</b> <b>of</b> <b>stone</b> reached an extraordinary development. The latter was crowned by construction of buildings and artistic stone-cutting. The quarried stone was also copiously exported. The planning of the city was a regular, semielliptical one. Owing to its strategical position, the city and its environs were the scene of a series of battles: in the years 1000, 1298, 1354, 1409, 1483, and 1571. The Russians and the French collided there in the Napoleonic time. The city has seen several sieges and blockades. The English held Korčula from 1813 to 1815 and left two monuments there. In addition to excellent buildings, among which belongs the Cathedral, Korčula boasts other monuments, such as two 15 th century polyptychs painted by Blaž of Trogir, Byzantine ikons, the altar canvas by Tintoretto, some paintings by Tripun Kokolja, a silver cross by the 15 th century Dubrovnik master Progonović, a painted crucifix from the same century by George Petrović (now in the church of the Franciscan monastery at Orebić), and 16 th century sculptures cut in wood by Frano Čučić from Korčula. A 12 th century Korčulan anthology contains information from the times of the Croatian national dynasty. The beginnings of literature in the Croatian language can be traced as far back as the 14 th century, but the poets of importance appear from the 16 th century on: Ivan Vidali, Petar Kanavelić, and Augustin Draginić being the most notable among them. Their work is permeated by the Croatian and Slavic patriotism. The Croatian national life in Korčula has showed itself in various ways, such as through folk-songs, warrior dances with swords in the villages (»Kumpanija«) and in the city (»Moreška«) with dialogues in the Croatian language. The »Moreška« dance has a cosmopolitan character. A number of famous men were born on the island. Some of them became famous abroad. The sculptor Frane Kršinić from Lumbarda is worthly of mentioning among those living at present. Korčula’s past, particularly its values in the fields of culture and art have been scientifically extolled by Cvito Fisković, the person celebrated by us to-day...|$|E
