5|$|His lasting {{significance}} is <b>questionable.</b> He was immensely industrious, an exceptional administrator, and was well-connected to leading politicians and aristocrats. But his accomplishments as Archbishop of Canterbury were modest.|$|E
5|$|Jones {{was also}} accused {{excessive}} spending, <b>questionable</b> real estate transactions, and was sued for racial discrimination (see Controversies section below).|$|E
5|$|Aspirin, {{either by}} itself or in a {{combined}} formulation, effectively treats {{certain types of}} a headache, but its efficacy may be <b>questionable</b> for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.|$|E
5|$|During the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Mitchell began having knee problems, {{requiring}} a first surgery {{to clean up}} debris and a second surgery after re-injuring the knee during rehabilitation prior to the 2012–13 King's training camp. Mitchell was out {{for the remainder of}} the 2012–13 season and <b>questionable</b> for the 2013–14 season.|$|E
5|$|Eureka {{has been}} read in many ways, {{in part because}} Poe's sincerity in the work is <b>questionable.</b> It has been {{considered}} prophetically scientific, intuitively romantic, and even calculatingly ironic. Lacking scientific proof, Poe {{said it was not}} his goal to prove what he says to be true, but to convince through suggestion.|$|E
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is that there may be some unfairness where <b>questionable</b> executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, {{the owners}} (Kingdom Holding Company) signed a {{development}} agreement with Emaar Properties PJSC. The final {{height of the}} building was <b>questionable,</b> {{but it was still}} listed to be over 1 kilometre. Kingdom Holding said construction was progressing.|$|E
5|$|Nikephoros is {{no longer}} {{mentioned}} by name after 792; instead, the brothers are mentioned collectively. It is therefore <b>questionable</b> whether he is {{to be included in}} subsequent events, although traditionally (including in reference works like the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium) it is held that he did share in his brothers' fate and died after 812.|$|E
5|$|Non-free {{includes}} packages {{which do}} not comply with the DFSG, such as documentation with invariant sections and proprietary software, and legally <b>questionable</b> packages. Contrib includes packages which do comply with the DFSG but fail other requirements. For example, they may depend on packages which are in non-free or requires such for building them.|$|E
5|$|The New World quails are small, plump {{terrestrial}} birds only distantly {{related to}} the quails of the Old World, but named for their similar appearance and habits. One confirmed species and one of <b>questionable</b> origin have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The archaeological {{record for}} this period is {{relatively}} scant, although improving. Toponymy provides significant {{information about the}} Scandinavian presence and examples of Norse runes provide further useful evidence. There is a significant corpus of material from the Gaelic oral tradition that relates to this period, but its value is <b>questionable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The family Charadriidae {{includes}} the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. They are small- to medium-sized birds with compact bodies, short thick necks, and long, usually pointed, wings. They are usually found in open country worldwide, mostly in habitats near water. Eight confirmed species {{and one of}} <b>questionable</b> origin have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and conchiolin (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the <b>questionable</b> exception of Cobcrephora.|$|E
5|$|The {{records of}} the Australian Board of Control attest to board member Clem Jones's protestations against Meckiff's {{inclusion}} when the selectors' proposed team list was submitted for approval. Jones cited the bowler's <b>questionable</b> action but the Chairman Ewart Macmillan rejected his objection as unconstitutional. Two other board members attempted to overrule the chairman, but their motion was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Almost all the {{surviving}} source material is of <b>questionable</b> reliability. The two witnesses who gave evidence, Robert Stubbs and James Kelsall, were strongly motivated to exonerate themselves from blame. It {{is possible that}} the figures concerning the number of slaves killed, the amount of water that remained on the ship, and the distance beyond Jamaica that Zong had mistakenly sailed are inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|Although {{drivers were}} not listed, Tom Kristensen's {{injury in the}} opening round of the 2007 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters season made his {{participation}} in the race <b>questionable.</b> As the driver with the most wins at Le Mans, he {{was intended to be}} part of Audi's factory team. Fellow Audi DTM driver Mattias Ekström was nominated as his possible replacement by Audi. However, on 11 June 2007 Kristensen was cleared by doctors to race, leaving Ekström's services unneeded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the draft, Islanders general manager Mike Milbury told reporters Torres' chances of {{immediately}} joining the NHL was <b>questionable.</b> Following his first NHL training camp in New York, Torres was returned to Brampton in late September. Playing his third and final OHL season, Torres recorded 33 goals and 70 points over 55 games in 2000–01 and was named to the league's second all-star team once more. The Battalion advanced to {{the second round of the}} playoffs, where they were eliminated. Torres had 11 points in eight post-season contests.|$|E
5|$|Atomic carbon {{is a very}} {{short-lived}} species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized {{in various}} multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamond. Once considered exotic, fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanobuds and nanofibers. Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as lonsdaleite (<b>questionable),</b> glassy carbon, carbon nanofoam and linear acetylenic carbon (carbyne).|$|E
5|$|By 1898, American {{financier}} Charles Tyson Yerkes {{had made}} a large fortune developing the electric tramway and elevated railway systems in Chicago, but his <b>questionable</b> business methods, which included bribery and blackmail, had finally drawn the disapproving attention of the public. Yerkes had unsuccessfully attempted to bribe the city council and Illinois state legislature into granting him a 100-year franchise for the tramway system. Following a public backlash, he sold his Chicago investments and {{turned his attention to}} opportunities in London.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Sihanouk's {{delicate}} {{domestic and foreign}} policy balancing act was beginning to go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam. These concessions made <b>questionable</b> Cambodia's neutrality, which had been guaranteed by the Geneva Conference of 1954.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} better {{team for the}} {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable to beat the Independiente defence, with their shooting in front of goal being the culprit. Both sides questioned some of the referee's decisions. Liverpool believed they should have had two penalties, while Independiente felt that the assistant referee's decisions were <b>questionable.</b> Incidentally, the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E
5|$|Finches are {{seed-eating}} passerine {{birds that}} are small to moderately large {{and have a}} strong beak, usually conical and in some species very large. All have twelve tail feathers and nine primaries. These birds have a bouncing flight with alternating bouts of flapping and gliding on closed wings, and most sing well. Ten confirmed species and two species of <b>questionable</b> origin have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for <b>questionable</b> investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While {{the existence of a}} greater concentration of nerve endings at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve endings.|$|E
5|$|Hull worked {{two jobs}} in 2006–07. He {{served as a}} special {{assistant}} to the team president of the Dallas Stars and provided studio analysis for NHL on NBC telecasts. He left NBC after one season when he was named a special adviser to the team's hockey operations department. Hull was promoted to interim co-general manager of the Stars, sharing the role with Les Jackson after Doug Armstrong was fired on November 13, 2007. ESPN analyst Scott Burnside criticized the promotion of Hull, noting his lack of front office experience and <b>questionable</b> work ethic.|$|E
5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service {{on the grounds that}} they were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably <b>questionable.</b> Troops in all of these classes would fight together on the battlefield, with the exception of the most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{took his}} Senate seat in January 1935. As a {{freshman}}, {{he sat in}} the back row of the chamber next to fellow freshman Harry Truman, and the pair quickly became friends. Minton was made a member of a special Lobby Investigation Committee chaired by Senator Hugo Black, that was set up to look into <b>questionable</b> lobbyist groups. According to professor of political science Linda C. Gugin, a Minton biographer, in practice the committee's investigations were politically motivated and directed against groups that were challenging New Deal legislation.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the many}} factors in his success was Como's insistence on his {{principles}} of good taste; if he considered something to be in bad or <b>questionable</b> taste, {{it was not in}} the show or broadcast. When a remark made by Julius La Rosa about television personality Arthur Godfrey on The Perry Como Show was misconstrued, Como offered an on-air apology {{at the beginning of his}} next show, against the advice of his staff.|$|E
5|$|Other scholars, however, {{argue that}} {{hereditary}} illegitimacy is not listed among the indiscretions of the Wicked Priest, {{and that this}} interpretation has been foisted upon the text by decades of <b>questionable</b> interpretation. Collins argues further {{that there is no}} evidence in the Community Rule or the Damascus Document to support the view that the Qumran community was concerned with the legitimacy of a non-Zadokite High Priest.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Cipriano was The Philadelphia Inquirers {{religion}} {{reporter for}} about a year in 1993. During that time he was called several times by Tierney on behalf of Tierney's client, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. After leaving the religion reporter position, Cipriano wrote articles for the Sunday paper, where in 1997 he wrote a profile on Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. The profile turned into an investigative piece as Cipriano obtained documents detailing US$5 million in <b>questionable</b> spending and how the church was spending millions in the suburbs while cutting inner-city services.|$|E
5|$|Recordings {{with the}} Parental Advisory label are often {{released}} alongside censored versions that {{reduce or eliminate}} the <b>questionable</b> material. Several retailers will distribute all varieties of the product, occasionally with an increased price for censored versions, while some sellers offer the amended pressings as their main options and choose not to distribute the explicit counterparts. However, the label has been questioned for its perceived ineffectiveness in limiting the amount of inappropriate material that young audiences are exposed to.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{changed the}} team kit for their 1964-65 European Cup second round tie versus R.S.C. Anderlecht. He felt {{the players in}} the new all-red would appear more intimidating than in the {{previous}} red shirts, white shorts and white socks. Liverpool lost in the semi-final to Internazionale. Shankly felt the referee biased allowing <b>questionable</b> Italian goals. In the 1965 FA Cup Final Hunt put Liverpool ahead in extra time. Leeds United's Billy Bremner equalised. St John then scored for a 2–1 first ever Liverpool FA Cup triumph. Defence of their League title ended in seventh place.|$|E
5|$|Sprigg {{continued}} to be active in Cumberland city politics. In early 1906, Sprigg was {{a spokesperson for the}} Associated Merchants organization, which had hired an independent auditor to investigate the city government's <b>questionable</b> accounting and appropriation practices. The independent auditor uncovered gross mismanagement, and the Associated Merchants, with Sprigg as their spokesperson, urged the Cumberland city council to take action.|$|E
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the night shark extends along the outer continental shelves and upper continental slopes of the Atlantic Ocean, from the U.S. state of Massachusetts to Argentina in the west, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and from Senegal to northern Namibia in the east. In United States waters, it is relatively common off North Carolina and Florida (particularly the Florida Straits) and rarer elsewhere. There are <b>questionable</b> reports of this species off the Pacific coast of Panama.|$|E
5|$|The drug {{strontium}} ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and {{lessen the}} incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also {{increases the risk of}} venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also <b>questionable,</b> since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} <b>questionable.</b> The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed fission reactor, and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{takes place}} on and around Independence Day 1966 and re-introduces the Betty Francis {{character}} into the narrative. Betty finds herself {{in a state of}} depression and experiences a health scare following an unsettling weight gain. Meanwhile, Don and Harry collide with Baby Boomers while trying to meet with The Rolling Stones for a client. The rivalry between old guard Roger and an ascending Pete continues as Peggy hires a new copywriter with a <b>questionable</b> personality but high talent.|$|E
