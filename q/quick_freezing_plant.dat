40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the freezing point (Tf) of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fish burger using the cooling curve and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) method. Cooling curves were obtained for two household refrigerators, a freezer with no <b>quick</b> <b>freeze</b> function and another one equipped with a <b>quick</b> <b>freeze</b> compartment. Freezing point, freezing time and freezing rates were determined from the cooling curves. The freezers showed slow freezing rates ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 40 cm/h. The <b>quick</b> <b>freeze</b> function improved the freezing process, as it significantly reduced the freezing times by significantly increasing freezing rates. Tf of the tilapia fish burger was (− 2. 7 ± 0. 1) °C and no significant difference between freezing rates and the DSC method was observed.

Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved their grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season. Freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing). The freezing kinetics is important to preserve the food quality and texture. <b>Quicker</b> <b>freezing</b> generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure.

40|$|Effects of {{modified}} cornstarch concentration, {{freezing rate}} and thawing mode on quality properties of mashed potatoes were examined. The product was tested by oscillatory rheometry, instrumental texture profile analysis (ITPA) and cone penetration, colour, dry matter (DM) and sensory analyses. Oscillatory parameters showed that increasing starch concentration {{resulted in a}} softer product in which gel strength decreased {{in direct proportion to}} concentration in quick-frozen and microwave-thawed product. <b>Quick</b> <b>freezing</b> made for firmer mashed potatoes, whereas oscillatory, ITPA and penetration parameters were lower in the samples thawed at 4 °C Starch concentration and instrumental consistency and firmness were directly proportional to one another. Adding starch at the highest concentration, <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> and slow thawing produced a lighter-coloured mashed potato, although the loss of colour in the processed product was not detected by panellists in the microwave-thawed samples. DM was higher in the quick-frozen samples and lower in air-thawed samples. The factors studied affected different sensory texture parameters but had hardly any effect on attributes perceived during final and residual phases of mastication. Only starch concentration had a significant effect on sensory acceptability, but interactions between factors showed that starch addition followed by <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> was judged undesirable by the panellists due to excessive softening. Oscillatory parameters correlated well with sensory texture attributes and proved quite precise.

This study evaluates three different freezing methods, namely cryogenic freezing (CF) using liquid nitrogen; individual <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> (IQF) and conventional slow freezing (CSF) in preserving the quality and stability of dates during frozen storage. Fresh dates were frozen utilizing the three methods. The produced frozen dates were frozen stored for nine months. The color values, textural parameters, and nutrition qualities were measured for fresh dates before freezing and for the frozen dates every three months during the frozen storage. The frozen dates’ color values were affected by the freezing method and the frozen storage period. There are substantial differences in the quality of the frozen fruits in favor of cryogenic freezing followed by individual <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> compared to the conventional slow freezing. The results revealed large disparity among the times of freezing of the three methods. The freezing time accounted to 10 min for CF, and around 80 min for IQF, and 1800 min for CSF method...|$|R

EMC 2016. 5846 International audienceThe “unroofing” {{technique}} {{has been successfully}} used to observe the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (PM) using either light or electron microscopy. Combined to transmission electron microscopy (TEM), it is an invaluable method to reveal {{the composition of the}} PM and to directly observe macromolecular complexes including the cytoskeleton and endocytic membrane invaginations. This method has been optimized over decades to preserve membranes close to their native states by the combination of <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> of exposed membranes, followed by deep etching and rotary replication (the so-called “QF-DE-RR” technique). However, a serious setback in implementing unroofing combined with QF-DE-RR stems from the necessity to use complicated apparatus, such as <b>quick</b> <b>freezing</b> and freeze-fracturing devices, along with strong expertise to handle them. Moreover, the technical complexity renders these techniques time consuming and reduces the number of samples that can be processed simultaneously. Here, we present a simple and straightforward protocol for observation of the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane which only requires chemical treatment of samples prior to replication This method has been optimized towards sample preparation at room temperature, chemical fixation, dehydration, solvent drying and sequential metal coating. Moreover, this technique is easily amenable to higher throughput. We compared either TEM or high resolution SEM analysis of unroofed membranes from adherent cells and show {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} each technique towards visualization of the cytoskeleton and different endocytic structures such as clathrin coated pits and caveolae...|$|R
