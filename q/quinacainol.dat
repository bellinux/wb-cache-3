The electrophysiological actions of <b>quinacainol</b> were investigated on sodium (I(Na)), transient outward (i(to)) and sustained-outward plateau (iKsus) potassium currents in rat isolated cardiac myocytes using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique and compared with quinidine. 2. <b>Quinacainol</b> blocked sodium currents in a concentration-dependent manner and with a potency {{similar to that of}} quinidine (mean (+/-SEM) EC 50 50 +/- 12 vs 95 +/- 25 micromol/L for quinidine and <b>quinacainol,</b> respectively). However, <b>quinacainol</b> had a considerably prolonged onset and recovery from block compared with quinidine. 3. Neither <b>quinacainol</b> nor quinidine significantly changed the steady state voltage dependence of activation of sodium currents. Quinidine produced a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence for sodium current inactivation, but no such shift was observed with <b>quinacainol</b> at doses that produced a substantial current block. 4. Although <b>quinacainol</b> did not effectively block voltage-dependent potassium currents, even at concentrations as high as 1. 5 mmol/L, quinidine, at a half-maximal sodium channel-blocking concentration, reduced peak i(to) current amplitude, increased the rate of inactivation of i(to) and blocked iKsus. 5. These results indicate that <b>quinacainol,</b> a quinidine analogue, blocks sodium currents in cardiac myocytes with little effect on i(to) or iKsus potassium currents, which suggests that <b>quinacainol</b> may be exerting class 1 c anti-arrhythmic actions.
