40|$|Abstract. A <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> of {{a magnet}} and {{magnetic}} fluid {{is used as}} a piston in a U-tube. Applying reciprocating travelling magnetic field produces reciprocating motion of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system.</b> In this study, vibration properties of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> are investigated experimentally. Three types of vibration mode of the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> appear and the mode depends on the frequency and intensity of travelling magnetic field and the shape of the magnet. Basically the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> follows the travelling magnetic field in the range of low frequency, while the system cannot follow the travelling field when the frequency of the travelling magnetic field is high. However, when the magnet is sphere or short cylinder, the other type of vibration appears in the range of low frequency and the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> intermittently tracks the travelling magnetic field...|$|R

30|$|As {{far as we}} know, {{there are}} a lot of papers dealing with the ISS of {{individual}} control systems but few papers dealing with the ISS of CCSs. In general, the study of ISS for CCSs is complex, because it is very difficult to straightly construct an appropriate Lyapunov function for CCSs. However, in [5], Li and Shuai studied the global-stability problem of equilibrium and developed a systematic approach that allows one to construct global Lyapunov functions for large-scale <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> from building blocks of individual vertex systems. Later, this technique was appropriately developed and extended to some other <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b> In [6 – 8] several delayed <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> were discussed, and some sufficient conditions were obtained. Li et al. in [9 – 12] investigated the stochastic stability of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> with both white noise and color noise. Moreover, by using this technique, Su et al. derived sufficient conditions ensuring global stability of discrete-time <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [13, 14], and Zhang et al. extended this technique to multi-dispersal <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> [15]. Besides, this technique is also applied to many practical applications, such as biological systems [16 – 18], neural networks [19, 20], and mechanical systems [20 – 23]. Hence, the graph theory is a great method in the study of <b>coupled</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
