40|$|The <b>quack</b> {{and wheat}} <b>grasses</b> of Iowa, eastern North America, and the Rocky Mountains are important, {{not only as}} weeds, but as forage plants. One of the most {{valuable}} of these is the western wheat grass, ranging from the eastern slopes of the Rockies into western Iowa. Besides this species there are several others more or less common in the western and northwestern portion in the state. Some of these are considered valuable as forage plants, yet during the past season many complaints have been made of the abundance and weedy nature of the <b>quack</b> <b>grasses</b> in North America. It seems wise, therefore, to consider the <b>quack</b> and wheat <b>grasses</b> not only as weeds, but also from the standpoint of their value as forage plants...|$|R

40|$|A {{strain of}} Ascochyta agropyrina var. nana was {{isolated}} from Elytrigia repens (<b>quack</b> <b>grass),</b> a noxious perennial weed widespread through the cold {{regions of the}} northen and southern hemispheres. Papyracillic acid was isolated {{for the first time}} from the fungal solid culture and identified using spectroscopic methods, including X-ray diffractometric and CD analysis for the assignment of the relative and absolute stereochemistries. Some key derivatives were prepared and used in a structure−activity relationship study. Tested by leaf disk-puncture assay, papyracillic acid at the concentration of 1 mg/mL was shown to be phytotoxic both for the host plant and a number of nonhost plants of the fungus. Papyracillic acid was active against bacteria (Xanthomonas campestris and Bacillus subtilis) and the fungus Candida tropicalis at 6 μg/disk. Derivatives of papyracillic acid were significantly less active than original toxin. However, the monoacetyl derivative of the toxin did not possess antimicrobial activity but remained highly phytotoxic to <b>quack</b> <b>grass.</b> Hence, papyracillic acid and its analogues have potential as nonselective herbicides of natural origin. Some structure−activity relationship observations for papyracillic acid and its derivatives were also made...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} weeds {{continues}} to interest the farmers of the state, as much, perhaps, as any problem {{connected with the}} farm. An abundance of weeds in a crop seriously interferes with production, not only by shading and crowding the agricultural crop, but by removing useful and necessary constituents from the soil. We receive annually many inquiries from farmers who desire information about the character of weeds, and the best methods of dealing with them. The results of some experiments conducted by the Botanical Section to determine the value of several means of weed extermination are presented in this bulletin. W e are indebted to Professor J. B.

Bulletin 88 contains the studies for 1906, bulletin 99 the studies for 1907, and the present publication contains the results of our work for 1908 and 1909. Since the operation of the Iowa law it has been our experience that the quality of the seed sold to the farmers is much better than formerly. Hundreds of samples sent to us by the farmers of this state for analysis indicate that they desire to protect themselves from the introduction of noxious weeds, especially dodder, <b>quack</b> <b>grass,</b> buckhorn, dock, and Canada thistle.

50|$|Tan spot {{is found}} {{primarily}} on wheat, {{but is also}} found to infect other cereals and grasses including triticale, barley, and rye, but are less frequently affected.Other grass species effected by the pathogen include Siberian wheat grass, sand bluestem, meadow brome, sheep fescue, June grass, little bluestem, green foxtail, needle and thread, and tall wheatgrass.While these are not necessarily agriculture crop hosts such as wheat, the pathogen is able to form and survive on many grass hosts, which can eventually venture into wheat fields. Other important grass susceptible hosts include smooth brome {{which can be found}} in pastures, as well as <b>quack</b> <b>grass</b> that is found in the environment and considered a weed in many agricultural crops. Lesions typically appear on both upper and lower leaf surfaces, and initially are tan to brown specks. Eventually, the tan to brown specks expand to larger irregular, oval, lens-shaped, ellipse, tan blotches with a yellow ring around them. The yellow ring {{is often referred to as}} a halo, yellow discoloration as chlorosis, and browning/death of leaf tissue as necrosis. The development of a dark brown to black spot in the center the lesion is characteristic of the disease. If warmer temperatures and moist conditions persist, spores known as conidia will move up plant as secondary inoculum and can also infect head/spikes. Symptoms on the head are indistinct, but can cause brownish glumes, and grains can have a reddish appearance similar to the pathogen Fusarium.|$|R
40|$|Elytrigia repens L. Desv. ex Nevski (commonly {{known as}} <b>quack</b> <b>grass),</b> is a {{perennial}} weed widespread through the cold temperate regions {{all over the}} world. It is managed only by chemical herbicides 1, 2 because it easily spreads by seed and rhizomes and produces allelopathic metabolites suppressing the growth of other plants. In surveys carried out with the aim to find pathogens of this species, which could have potential as biological agents for its control, a fungus was isolated from naturally diseased leaves of this species and identified as Ascochyta agropyrina (Fairman) Trotter var. nana Punith. Due to {{the interest of the}} authors in studying species belonging to the genus Ascochyta as sources of biologically active metabolites, a previous study led to the isolation of a main phytotoxin from the solid culture of this fungus and to its identification as papyracillic acid. 3 On liquid medium A. agropyrina produces different toxins the main one of which, named agropyrenol, was characterized as a new disubstituted benzaldehyde {{on the basis of its}} chemical and spectroscopic properties. Other two new minor metabolites were isolated from the same culture and named agropyrenal and agropyrenone, respectively. They were characterized as a trisubstituted naphthalene carbaldehyde and a pentasubstituted 3 H-benzofuranone, respectively. When assayed on leaves of some weedy plants, i. e. Mercurialis annua, Chenopodium album and Setaria viridis, agropyrenol proved to be phytotoxic, causing the appearance of necrotic lesions, agropyrenal was less active, while agropyrenone was inactive. None of compounds showed antibiotic, fungicidal or zootoxic activity.

25|$|Southern hairy-nosed wombats, {{along with}} other wombat species, select native {{perennial}} grasses and sedges, but do consume introduced pasture species, forbs, and the leaves of woody shrubs if their favoured food is not available. Much of the southern hairy-nosed wombat's diet is Stipa nitida, which grows around its warren complex and is trimmed as it grazes. This creates an area with a higher density of new green shoots, a sign of delayed growth of individual <b>grass.</b> The <b>teeth</b> of the wombat are more effective in grinding food into small particles than the western grey kangaroo. Its digestive tract has a tiny caecum and a colon divided into parts. The anterior part is relatively small and serves as the site for fermentation, while the posterior part is larger and is where water is reabsorbed. The wombat conserves water by recycling more urea to the colon rather than releasing it as urine. Wombats release less than other herbivorous mammals. As such, the southern hairy-nosed wombat produces very dry faeces, with water contents as low as 40%.|$|R

40|$|Extant rhinos are {{the largest}} extant herbivores exhibiting dietary specialisations for both browse and grass. However, the {{adaptive}} value of the wear-induced tooth morphology in rhinos has not been widely studied, and data on individual cusp and tooth positions have rarely been published. We evaluated upper cheek dentition of browsing Diceros bicornis and Rhinoceros sondaicus, mixed-feeding R. unicornis and grazing Ceratotherium simum using an extended mesowear method adapted for rhinos. We included single cusp scoring (EM(R) -S) to investigate inter-cusp and inter-tooth wear patterns. In accordance with previous reports, general mesowear patterns in D. bicornis and R. sondaicus were attrition-dominated and C. simum abrasion-dominated, reflecting their respective diets. Mesowear patterns for R. unicornis were more attrition-dominated than anticipated by the grass-dominated diet, which may indicate a low intake of environmental abrasives. EM(R) -S increased differentiation power compared to classical mesowear, with significant inter-cusp and inter-tooth differences detected. In D. bicornis, the anterior cusp was consistently more abrasion-dominated than the posterior. Wear differences in cusp position may relate to morphological adaptations to dietary regimes. Heterogeneous occlusal surfaces may facilitate the comminution of heterogeneous browse, whereas uniform, broad grinding surfaces may enhance the comminution of physically more homogeneous <b>grass.</b> A negative <b>tooth</b> wear gradient was found in D. bicornis, R. sondaicus and R. unicornis, with wear patterns becoming less abrasion-dominated from premolars to molars.

5000|$|Between 1692 and 1806, {{only four}} {{descriptions}} of frozen mammoths {{were published in}} Europe. None of the remains of those five were preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the Lena River in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the ivory trade. While in Yakutsk in 1806, Michael Friedrich Adams heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18 kg (40 lb) of hair. During his return voyage he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed {{were the ones that}} Shumachov had sold. Adams brought it to the Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius. The Kunstkamera, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This {{was one of the first}} attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward.
