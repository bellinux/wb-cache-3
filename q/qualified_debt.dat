5000|$|REMICs abolish {{many of the}} inefficiencies of collateralized {{mortgage}} obligations (CMOs) {{and offer}} issuers more options and greater flexibility. [...] REMICs have no minimum equity requirements, so REMICs can sell all of their assets rather than retain some to meet collateralization requirements. Since regular interests automatically <b>qualify</b> as <b>debt,</b> REMICs also avoid the awkward reinvestment risk that CMO issuers bear to indicate debt. REMICs also may make monthly distributions to investors where CMOs make quarterly payments. REMIC residual interests enjoy more liquidity than owner’s trusts, which restrict equity interest and personal liability transfers. REMICs offer more flexibility than CMOs, as issuers can choose any legal entity and type of securities. The REMIC’s multiple-class capabilities also permit issuers to offer different servicing priorities along with varying maturity dates, lowering default risks and reducing the need for credit enhancement. [...] REMICs are also fairly user-friendly, as the REMIC election is not difficult, and the extensive guidance in the Code and in the regulations offers “a high degree of certainty with respect to tax treatment {{that may not be}} available for other types of MBSs.” ...|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. This mini {{dissertation}} analyses {{the claims}} that Uganda is the success {{story of the}} Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Uganda was the first country to <b>qualify</b> for <b>debt</b> relief under this debt management programme, and {{has a reputation for}} being able to address its economic and social problems simultaneously. Furthermore, the manner in which Uganda has engaged with civil society has also received praise. Thus, some scholars believe that the country offers a model example for indicating the effectiveness of debt management programmes in general, and the HIPC Initiative in particular. However, other scholars are more critical, claiming that the successes that Uganda has experienced under the HIPC Initiative have been short lived, and have also compounded the country‘s indebtedness. There is therefore a robust debate in the literature regarding this topic as some scholars take a more optimistic view {{of the impact of the}} HIPC Initiative in Uganda, and other scholars take a more pessimistic stance. This mini dissertation surveys these contrasting views in the literature, and argues that because the HIPC Initiative failed to deliver the promises that it made Uganda was unable to sustain its achievements under the programme. The dissertation concludes that Uganda is not an HIPC Initiative success story...|$|R
40|$|Similar to Mozambique, Zambia’s {{political}} economy is {{heavily influenced by}} a transition from a single-party to multi-party, democratic regime (1991). A small, landlocked country in southern Africa, Zambia ranked slightly higher (166 / 177 opposed to 168 / 177 respectively) than Mozambique in the 2005 HDR. Important national development challenges include the HIV/AIDs pandemic (1 in 5 adults infected) (Christian Aid), regional and urban/rural cleavages and large external <b>debt,</b> despite <b>qualifying</b> for <b>debt</b> relief under the HIPC initiative, {{as well as more}} recently, through the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.

Over the past fifteen years, Zambia has enjoyed sustained economic growth, and increasing foreign and domestic investment (Larmer 2005).

40|$|Section 385 of the Internal Revenue Code {{authorized}} the Treasury to prescribe regulations to help both courts and taxpayers determine whether {{an interest in}} a corporation <b>qualified</b> as <b>debt</b> or equity for federal income tax purposes. On December 29, 1980, Treasury Decision 7747 was issued stating the final regulations for determining whether certain interests in a corporation {{should be treated as}} stock or indebtedness. The regulations are intended to provide certainty through objective tests for an area heretofore plagued by confusion. The new rules will generally apply to certain interests in small, closely held corporations created after April 30, 1980. The regulations, however, are a departure from the goals stated by Congress in 1969. The regulations will serve to eliminate controversy in numerous cases, but they will also cause problems for many corporations not publicly traded or widely held. This Note will deal with some of the binding and conclusive determinations contained in the regulations. Section II will present some of the reasons for financing a corporation with debt.

50|$|For {{certain types}} of companies, {{different}} recognition criteria may apply, for instance, the option to recognise financial assets at either acquisition cost or fair value is unaivalable to investment funds which must necessarily use fair value, as laid out by the Law of 17 December 2010. Tax rules significantly affect accounting practice in Luxembourg, for instance, some instruments may <b>qualify</b> as <b>debt</b> instruments under Lux GAAP while they are recognised as equity instruments above, for instance Convertible Preferred Equity Certificates (CPECs) which consist of preference shares which pay an interest to the investor but are accounted for as debt while they would typically meet the recognition criteria as an equity instrument under IAS 32. Generally speaking, substance over form has been made a non-mandatory accounting principle with the Law of 30 July 2013, and the legal substance of contracts usually takes precedence under Lux GAAP as opposed to economic substance under IFRS, similar to accounting principles in France. Similarly, legal rules applicable to companies in Luxembourg also affect accounting, especially the Law of 10 August 1915 as amended, which constitutes the main law for commercial companies. For instance, article 49 of the 1915 Law contains strict rules concerning the purchase of own shares, which translate into a specific accounting treatment whereby the own shares must be neutralised and allocated to a specific reserve.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Using Ghana as an illustrative case study, {{this article}} {{examines}} the ideology and intentions which underpin the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper required for approval by the IMF and World Bank to <b>qualify</b> for <b>debt</b> relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries initiative. This article critically examines the functions assigned to governmental and non-governmental agencies within the social sector generally and the Department of Social Welfare specifically. Conditions at the Department of Social Welfare are explored through data gathered from semi-structured interviews with frontline social workers. These document the day-to-day realities of social work practice in Ghana and the relationship of the Department of Social Welfare with the non-governmental sector in the delivery of welfare services. • Findings: Social workers at the Department of Social Welfare report chronic under-funding which undermines even the most rudimentary activities. They also describe difficulties in holding NGOs to account {{due to the lack of}} logistical support and the inability to enforce compliance with statutory requirements. • Applications: Across the sub-Saharan region are government departments responsible for the delivery of social services and operating within the social policy frameworks created by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers required for debt relief. Evidence produced by this case study has implications for similar sub-Saharan countries implementing a social policy based on the neoliberal precepts if the New Policy Agenda.

50|$|After the {{government}} privatized the giant parastatal mining company Zambian Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), donors resumed balance-of-payment support. The final transfer of ZCCM's assets occurred on March 31, 2000. Although balance-of-payment payments {{are not the}} answer to Zambia's long-term debt problems, it will {{in the short term}} provide {{the government}} some breathing room to implement further economic reforms. The government has, however, spent much of its foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the exchange rate mechanism. To continue to do so, however, would jeopardize Zambia's <b>debt</b> relief. Zambia <b>qualified</b> for HIPC <b>debt</b> relief in 2000, contingent upon the country meeting certain performance criteria, and this should offer a long-term solution to Zambia's debt situation. In January 2003, the Zambian Government informed the International Monetary Fund and World Bank that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatization of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities.|$|R
40|$|Malawi and Zambia {{are poor}} and heavily indebted {{countries}} whose dependence on foreign aid is pronounced. They both <b>qualify</b> for <b>debt</b> relief {{in terms of the}} Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) initiative {{under the auspices of the}} Bretton Woods institutions, provided they formulate a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) that satisfies the new ‘process’ conditionality which emphasises broad participation. In grappling with the PRSP process the stakeholders (the state, non-state actors, and donors) appear to have produced credible policy documents with a measure of ‘national ownership’. On a comparative note, it is significant that civil society organisations played an active role in both Malawi and Zambia in formulating the PRSP and thus lent the outcome some legitimacy. It is also significant that in both countries the national assemblies were marginalised in these policy-making exercises, which were driven by the respective executive branches of government, notably the Ministries of Finance. In the case of Malawi the modest involvement by parliament was attributable mainly to its general subordination to the executive in a presidential system of government, while the coincidence of the PRSP process and the 2001 elections was the main explanatory factor in Zambia. The donors found themselves in an ambivalent position. On the one hand, in the interest of creating national ownership of the PRSP they were expected to keep their hands off. On the other hand, they were apprehensive that the substantive nature of the final document would not satisfy the World Bank and IMF eligibility criteria for debt relief. Hence, they took active part in the process...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of taxes on financing decision {{has long been}} discussed and different opinions exist concerning this subject. However, the importance of tax shield must not be underestimated because taxes can alter the effective interest rate of an instrument significantly. Generally {{it is assumed that}} payments of instrument that provide for revenue based compensation are not tax deductible because these instruments are normally qualified as equity. However, a detailed analysis of the various tax laws shows that this need not necessarily be the case. Payments that depend on the profits of a corporation can obtain an interest treatment if an instrument is structured according to the qualification criteria of a specific tax law. The deductibility can then decrease the effective interest rate of the issuing corporation. If a debt treatment can be obtained the question of the timing of interest payments has to be answered. In contrast to dividend distributions interest payments generally are not deductible as they occur but as they accrue. Especially in the case of fluctuating payments it is normally obligatory to determine the deductible amount in each accrual period. The time value of money aspect of interest payments is implemented differently in the various tax laws and can therefore change the effective tax rate. However, it is of great importance to consider these aspects before the issuance of a specific instrument. The first part of the paper analyses the necessary requirements for a debt treatment and possible obstacles to an interest deduction. In order to <b>qualify</b> for a <b>debt</b> treatment {{it is important to consider}} these facts before the issue of an instrument because a later reclassification of the instrument might change the cost of capital substantially. Even if an instrument is <b>qualified</b> as <b>debt</b> an interest deduction can be denied due to various limitations and restrictions. The second part of the paper examines the timing of revenue based payments that are considered as interest. Depending on the situation the taxpayer may or may not choose one of the described methods. However, it is important to know the impact of each method in order to able to determine the cost of a specific instrument. Another question raised in this paper concerns the discount rate used for the net present calculation and if the method used by IRS is of economic substance. This paper demonstrates the {{influence of}} the different methods of taxing revenue based payments and shows that the preferable method depends on the development of the profits. This paper emphasizes the impact of taxes on revenue based payments and the importance of the various approaches of tax authorities to execute such compensations.

40|$|By general agreement, one of {{the main}} {{obstacles}} to the growth of producer cooperatives is difficult investment financing, due to inadequate capitalisation levels and the resulting inability to lodge sufficient collateral with lenders. Moreover, worker-owned firms are considered not very reliable because they suffer from problems of moral hazard and insufficient commitment. Unfortunately, the literature on this issue is not extensive and has weaknesses that are highlighted in the paper. By means of its critical analisys, it is possible to provide evidence that the funding difficulties caused by the particular structure of cooperative firms can be effectively tackled by creating an institutional framework within which cooperatives would be offered a wider range of organisational options comparable to those open to traditional enterprises. Finally, it is proved that the willingness of members to fund the operations of their cooperative with loan capital {{may not be enough to}} mobilise external credit.

40|$|Given {{the ongoing}} {{work on a}} {{multilateral}} restructuring process for sovereign debt in the UN, consideration of the content and implementation of a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM) is timely. The framework {{and content of the}} SDRM proposed here differs from earlier proposals in several important respects. For the classification and supermajority voting of claims in the approval a restructuring plan, it would mimic the structure and operation of the model collective action clauses (Model CACs) proposed by the International Capital Markets Association. Restructuring under a <b>qualified</b> sovereign <b>debt</b> restructuring law (QSDRL) would be guided by four principles: (i) observe the KISS (keep it simple, stupid) principle, (ii) follow the Model CACs, (iii) limit the discretion of an administrator of a proceeding, and (iv) address only major current problems. A convention would oblige each adopting state to recognize and enforce a restructuring plan approved under a QSDRL of another adopting state. This obligation would be subject to exceptions along the lines of those under the New York Convention on arbitral awards. The QSDRL would employ novel methods of binding creditors under an approved restructuring plan. The convention would specify the requirements for a QSDRL while leaving implementing legislation to adopting states wishing to enact a QSDRL. A QSDRL would address many matters normally covered in an insolvency law, such as the requirements for approval of a plan. But it would not provide for the cramdown of dissenting classes of creditors, which would offend the norm of supermajority voting and require a tribunal with substantial discretion. It also would not provide for priority interim financing, as priority rules necessarily would offend the KISS principle and could be addressed outside the QSDRL. The proposed QSDRL would embrace a voluntary, contractual, and market-based approach—standards advocated by SDRM opponents such as the United States, the EU, and the IMF...|$|R
