5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of <b>quantum</b> <b>optics.</b> Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E

25|$|Modern optics {{encompasses}} {{the areas of}} optical science and engineering that became popular in the 20th century. These areas of optical science typically relate to the electromagnetic or quantum properties of light but do include other topics. A major subfield of modern optics, <b>quantum</b> <b>optics,</b> deals with specifically quantum mechanical properties of light. <b>Quantum</b> <b>optics</b> is not just theoretical; some modern devices, such as lasers, have principles of operation that depend on quantum mechanics. Light detectors, such as photomultipliers and channeltrons, respond to individual photons. Electronic image sensors, such as CCDs, exhibit shot noise corresponding to the statistics of individual photon events. Light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells, too, cannot be understood without quantum mechanics. In the study of these devices, <b>quantum</b> <b>optics</b> often overlaps with quantum electronics.|$|E

25|$|Since the mid-20th century, it {{has been}} {{understood}} that Maxwell's equations are not exact, but a classical field theory approximation of {{some aspects of the}} fundamental theory of quantum electrodynamics, although some quantum features, such as quantum entanglement, are completely absent and in no way approximated. (For example, quantum cryptography has no approximate version in Maxwell theory.) In many situations, though, deviations from Maxwell's equations are immeasurably small.

Its speculative modern developments include string theory and quantum gravity theories. It also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} with the {{addition}} of multiple walkers, quantum walks on a line can be transformed into lattice graphs of higher dimension. Thus, multi-walker walks can simulate single-walker walks on higher dimensional graphs and vice versa. This exponential complexity opens up new applications for present-day quantum walk experiments. We discuss the applications of such higher-dimensional structures and how they relate to linear <b>optics</b> <b>quantum</b> computing. In particular we show that multi-walker quantum walks are equivalent to the BosonSampling model for linear <b>optics</b> <b>quantum</b> computation proposed by Aaronson & Arkhipov. With the addition of control over phase-defects in the lattice, which can be simulated with entangling gates, asymmetric lattice structures can be constructed which are universal for quantum computation.
