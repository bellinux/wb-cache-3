50|$|The {{simplest}} <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> {{is commonly}} called Passive <b>Quenching</b> <b>Circuit</b> and {{composed of a}} single resistor in series to the SPAD. This experimental setup has been employed since the early studies on the avalanche breakdown in junctions. The avalanche current self-quenches simply because it develops a voltage drop across a high-value ballast load RL (about 100 kΩ or more). After the quenching of the avalanche current, the SPAD bias VD slowly recovers to Va, and therefore the detector {{is ready to be}} ignited again. A detailed description of the quenching process is reported by Zappa et al.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—An ever {{wider variety}} of {{applications}} employ Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) {{for the detection of}} faint optical signals. SPADs are p-n junction biased above the breakdown voltage and operate in Geiger-mode: each electron-hole pair can trigger an avalanche multiplication process that causes the current to swiftly rise to its final value. Additional quenching electronics is necessary for a SPAD proper working. The additional electronics characteristics directly affect the system’s obtainable performances. Different <b>quenching</b> <b>circuits</b> affect the detector performances in different ways. In the last 15 years there has been considerable development in the integration of the quenching circuitry directly with the detector, thus leading to improved performances. This paper reviews {{the state of the art}} of this evolution, examining and comparing different classes of <b>quenching</b> <b>circuits</b> and explaining their mode of operations, their advantages and disadvantages...|$|R
40|$|We {{characterize}} {{three different}} quenching circuits for InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) operated in gated mode: i) a simple passive quenching circuit; ii) an active quenching circuit; and iii) a fast active <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit.</b> For each of these, we acquire {{the shape of}} the avalanche current, at different excess biases, by reconstructing the waveform of the photons emitted from the detector during an avalanche and we simultaneously measure the afterpulsing probability and the dependence of dark count rate on gate period (to estimate the maximum count rate). We prove that the avalanche charge reduction is in agreement with the reduction of afterpulsing probability, giving a four-time decrease in afterpulsing when employing the fast active <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> compared to the simple passive <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit...</b>|$|E
30|$|For {{each of our}} APDs we used {{a passive}} <b>{{quenching}}</b> <b>circuit</b> with quenching resistance of 403  kΩ, similar to that described in Ref. [26] as a passive <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> with current-mode output. This type of <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> is appropriate for a quantum receiver satellite because of its simplicity and robustness, protecting against excessive current due to, e.g., bright illumination or charged particles, or accidental high voltage spikes. Its maximum detection rate of 0.2 - 0.4  Mcps is lower compared to active quenching circuits, but sufficient for the detection rates expected in near-term QKD applications [8]. Conveniently, the long (about 0.5 to 1 μs) dead-time of this circuit suppresses afterpulsing, even at low temperatures. Circuits for all APDs in a group were mounted on the same circuit board, outputting avalanche pulses through coaxial signal cables connected to each detector’s cathode.|$|E

40|$|The {{integrated}} circuit design of Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) with <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> in CMOS is highly desirable photon detection at high rates, but low counting rates constrain image acquisition rates and dynamic range. The characterization should primarily define the dead time of quenching SPAD circuit {{in order to}} estimate the SPAD performance prior fabrication. This paper reports the development and characterization of the mathematical model SPAD on passively quenched SPAD circuit with ballast resistor. An improved model in defining the dead time (tD) response for SPAD is used to characterize the performance of 8 × 1 passively quenched SPAD array. The time response for both quenching and recharging time are developed for 180 nm depletion layer which means low voltage technology. Hence that, the 8 × 1 passively SPAD array circuit is designed by using Silterra 180 nm CMOS technology for uncorrelated time measurements with on-chip 4 -bit counter to improve the counting rate.

40|$|Single photon {{avalanche}} detectors (SPADs) {{have attracted}} increasing attention {{because of their}} critical roles in many important applications such as quantum cryptography, optical time-domain reflectometry, time-resolved spectroscopy, non-line-of-sight optical communication, space communication and light detection and ranging. Although Silicon SPADs are limited to wavelength below 1. 1 um, III-V based SPADs with Separate Absorption and Multiplication (SAM) structure are of special interest in the telecommunication wavelengths, exhibiting superior performance with high single photon detection efficiency and low dark count rate. Conventionally, due to the self- sustaining nature of avalanche, operation of SPADs requires integration of external <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> to achieve both quenching and recovering capabilities. Integration of external <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> with III-V SPADs, however, adds substantial complexity to device fabrication, especially for array detectors when each individual detector requires an external <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit.</b> Here, we present single photon avalanche detectors featuring a Transient Carrier Buffer (TCB) layer to form an energy barrier which can tentatively stop avalanche-generated carriers, demonstrating self-quenching and self-recovering capabilities. For this self-quenching and self-recovering SPAD, the escape rate of those stopped avalanche carriers from the barrier determines the self-recovery time and thus count rate of the single-photon detector. A physical model has been developed to simulate the dynamic characteristics of the detector. The simulation results agree well with the experimental data, and the self- recovery time {{is found to be}} reduced with increasing temperature, the magnitude of overbias, the dosage in the charge layer and the barrier height. In addition, thermionic emission shows a stronger dependence on temperature and a weaker dependence on device bias and charge layer dosage than tunneling. The model contains no fitting parameters and therefore can be used to model and predict the device behavior...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{monolithic}} circuit {{has been}} designed for ac-tive-quenching and active-reset of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), which operate above the breakdown voltage BD for detecting single photons. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first fully integrated circuit of this kind ever reported. It can operate with any available SPAD device, since it generates pulses high enough to quench detectors biased up to 20 V above BD. The deadtime after each photon detection is adjustable; the minimum value is 50 ns, corresponding to 20 Mcounts/s maximum saturated photon-counting rate. The power dissipation is low (20 -mW standby), suitable also for portable instruments. The small size and high reliability of the circuit make it possible to develop miniaturized detector modules and SPAD-array detector instruments.

30|$|For {{a quantum}} {{communications}} protocol such as QKD, the afterpulsing peak {{contributes to the}} quantum bit error rate (QBER), and it is thus desirable to remove the peak by extending the dead time out to the flattened region [28, 29, 38]. In practice, this can be performed by discarding all counts {{before the end of}} a user-selected dead time in post-processing [40, 41] or by using an active <b>quenching</b> <b>circuit</b> [42]. Such additional dead time, however, limits the maximum detection rate [27, 28]. Because long distance transmissions reduce the expected detection rate [43], the amount of additional dead time could be optimized to balance the QBER with the detection rate to maximize the final key rate [37, 40, 41].|$|E

In order to rapidly discharge a magnet, one has to put enough resistance across the lead. The resistance in this case is varistor that is put across the magnet in the event of a power outage. The resistance consists of several diodes, which act as constant voltage resistors and the resistance of the cables connecting the magnets in the circuit to each other and to the power supply.
