25|$|Rochester's {{expressway}} system, {{conceived in}} the 1950s, {{was designed as}} two concentric circles with feeder expressways from the west, south and east. The system allows for <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> within the metropolitan area {{and a lack of}} the traffic gridlock typically found in cities of comparable size; in part this is because the system was designed to accommodate an anticipated year-2000 metro population of 5 million, whereas the present-day population is just over one million.|$|E
25|$|Aviation {{has become}} an {{important}} passenger transport mode since the 1960s. Aircraft is the commonly used mode of transport on longer distances, and the routes between Oslo and Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger are all among the largest in Europe. On long distances, such as Oslo-Bodø and longer, air travel {{is by far the}} leading travel method. In Western and Northern Norway, with difficult terrain, obstacling fjords and lack of rail transport, regional airline travel provides <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> within the region or to the capital.|$|E
25|$|Ruter {{attempted}} to base its right-of-way {{planning for the}} tramway along the regulated right-of-way of the people mover. However, this was not compatible as the premise for the people mover {{was that it would}} run elevated for its route, thus avoiding conflicts with road traffic. This issue made the tramway route unfeasible in the old route and Ruter therefore had to design a new route. Ruter was established as a common transit agency for Oslo and Akershus in May 2008, and took over the responsibility for planning. Ruter has since published a series of reports looking at the various modes and routes. It thereby concluded that a tramway would not be suitable and eventually landed on that a metro line exclusively in a tunnel via Skøyen to Majorstuen would be preferable. It cited the need for <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> speeds to the city center, connection with the other transit systems and sufficient capacity to handle increased development at Fornebu. The metro alternative was approved of by Akershus County Council in December 2012 and Oslo Municipal Council in April 2013.|$|E

500|$|Adventure mode is the {{secondary}} game mode in Dwarf Fortress. Unlike Fortress mode, Adventure mode has the player control a single character. In Adventure mode, character creation works {{similar to other}} role-playing games, with the player choosing the name, gender, race and personality of the character. Players also select from a choice of various skills and attributes, such as strength and agility. Like in Fortress mode, these skills further improve normally through exercised use unlike regular experience. They play in the same generated worlds, and these worlds continue to develop and advance while time passes as in Fortress mode. The character starts off in a random town, depending on the character's race, and can interact with the various non-player characters (NPCs). NPCs can speak about the surrounding areas or offer to follow and help the player. Quests are given via a [...] "rumor" [...] system, where rumors can spread among the NPCs, or players can decide to serve a leader and attain quests from them. Characters can also write poems, books and music compositions, based on procedurally generated forms and styles. The player can choose to form a site and build using materials they collect. Players can use the <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> mode to quickly travel between geographical regions.|$|E
50|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to Crusader: No Remorse. The player controls the Silencer as he fights {{his way through the}} levels. Teleportation pads are used for <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> within and between levels.|$|E

50|$|Students {{may find}} it fun to plot Flat Stanley's travels on maps and share the {{contents}} of the journal. Often, a Flat Stanley returns with a photo or postcard from his visit. Some teachers prefer to use e-mail for its <b>quicker</b> <b>travel</b> time.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some commentators {{that the level of}} congestion that society tolerates is a rational (though not necessarily conscious) choice between the costs of improving the transportation system (in infrastructure or management) and the benefits of <b>quicker</b> <b>travel.</b> Others link it largely to subjective lifestyle choices, differentiating between car-owning and car-free households.|$|R
5000|$|In Okage: Shadow King, {{the player}} {{character}} Ari proceeds through {{the game by}} visiting towns, traveling across the overworld and exploring dungeons.

50|$|The Eastern Railway and South Eastern Railway section are {{connected}} by two links, one is Lilua-Tikiapara link, and other is Rajchandrapur/Dankuni-Maurigram link, currently used by goods trains and Sealdah-Puri Duronto Express.

60|$|Mr. Douglass {{was an old}} colored man {{who lived}} fully {{half a mile from}} the village; but Reddy's eagerness caused <b>quick</b> <b>travelling,</b> and in a {{surprisingly}} short time he was back breathless and happy. The coveted horse was to be theirs for as long a time as they wanted him, provided they fed him well, and did not attempt to harness him into a wagon.|$|R

5|$|Prior to 1989 {{there were}} four local trains in each {{direction}} from Oslo to Hønefoss; followed by on rush hour service each, but this single service has since been terminated; mainly due to <b>quicker</b> <b>travel</b> times by coaches. The Ringerike Line would allow the Oslo Commuter Rail once again to serve Ringerike; other places served usually have one hourly service, with additional services in rush hour. Reducing travel time from Hønefoss to Oslo to 30 minutes would probably cause larger population growth in Ringerike.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{difference}} between Islandian {{culture and the}} West is that Islandians reject most modern Western technology. It is a rural society with an arcadian philosophy, which Dorn humorously describes as [...] "enlightened Hedonism". They're not interested in building railroads for <b>quick</b> <b>travel.</b> But they do not reject all Western technology; they use a few Western inventions that they judge to be worthwhile, such as modern rifles, and Singer sewing machines.|$|E

25|$|With the {{introduction}} of the B-Line, almost all other local bus services traveling between Richmond and Vancouver were eliminated, resulting in most commuters having to transfer from a local service to the B-Line. As a result of the added transfer and <b>quicker</b> <b>travel</b> times of the B-Line that did not materialize, commute times for passengers increased even though a commute time savings of several minutes had been promised. Within a few years, rush hours routes were created which effectively restored direct rush hour service from most urban areas of Richmond to Vancouver.|$|R
50|$|Before it was re-constructed, {{there was}} a huge demand for an airport in the region, for <b>quicker</b> <b>travel</b> to capital Dhaka. Local organisations held many strikes and demonstrations for its construction. The airport was finally built in 1985 on 163 acres of land, at cost of BDT 4 million. It was officially inaugurated by the then {{president}} Abdur Rahman Biswas on 3 December 1995. Aero Bengal Airlines, a private airline, was the first airline to launch flights to the airport. National carrier, Biman started their services on November 1995.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{the first}} part of the Asker Line opened between Sandvika and Asker, with new double track running {{parallel}} to the old Drammen Line, allowing <b>quicker</b> <b>travel</b> times to Asker. The second section, between Lysaker and Sandvika, was opened in 2011, and reduced travel time west of Lysaker by about seven minutes. The project also included a full upgrade of Lysaker Station. There are plans to build two more tracks from Lysaker to Oslo Central Station, including a new tunnel under central Oslo. This project is not decided.|$|R
5000|$|Cais do Sodré is {{a station}} on the Green Line of the Lisbon Metro. [...] It {{is located in the}} Praça Duque da Terceira, {{connecting}} to the Cais do Sodré railway station and with a boat station (allowing for <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> between Lisbon and Cacilhas, Seixal and Montijo. This metro station was built by Pedro Botelho and Nuno Teotónio Pereira and the art work was done by António Dacosta, which left some of his drawings {{to be used in the}} station after his death, with some help from the painter Pedro Morais.|$|E
5000|$|Players {{can obtain}} the other equipable items from crafting, the ingame store, trade NPC's, {{reaching}} certain levels of Mastery, or via ingame badges. These items include rings, alternative character costumes (which unlock as your character increases in level), tomes, allies (permanent pets that boost the player character's stats), wings, mounts, boats, sails, flasks (which are consumed {{to restore the}} player character's health), fishing rods, mag riders ( [...] a form of <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> mount limited to use on train-like mono-rails), and Emblems, which add to or alter the benefits provided by Flasks.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is played}} from a first-person perspective. Melee combat is {{performed}} by using the mouse, and dragging the cursor across the screen to attack. Magic is used by cycling through a menu found by clicking the appropriate button on the main game screen, then clicking the spell to be used, and its target. The game world is very large. Players may explore outside cities into the wild. There they may find inns, farms, small towns, dungeons, and other places of interest. Unlike later installments in the series, Arena has no set overworld, (the wilderness constantly generates) so the player must use the <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> feature to get from on {{area of the world}} to another.|$|E

They named the proposal the Advanced Passenger Train. Jones took the proposal to the BR chairman, Stanley Raymond, who liked the idea. However, the board was unable to provide enough funding to develop it, and encouraged Jones to approach the Ministry of Transport for additional funding.|$|R
50|$|Mirror {{planes were}} {{introduced}} in the Third Edition Manual of the Planes as an optional group of transitive planes. They are small planes that each connect {{to a group of}} mirrors that can be located in any other planes throughout the multiverse. A mirror plane {{takes the form of a}} long, winding corridor with the mirrors it attaches to hanging like windows along the walls. Mirror planes allow <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> between the various mirrors that are linked to each, but each plane contains a mirror version of any traveler that enters it. This mirror version has an opposite alignment and will seek to slay his real self to take his place. All mirrors connect to a mirror plane, though each mirror plane usually has only five to twenty mirrors connecting to it.|$|E
50|$|Travel {{around the}} island can be slow and dangerous, and items {{purchased}} by the player {{may be necessary to}} pass through obstacles or avoid loss of men. (For example, if the player has a shovel, men can be rescued from avalanches and cave-ins; a machete may be needed to pass through dense jungle; an amulet is needed to cure swamp fever, etc.) If a player is lucky, a magic carpet might be found in a chest or be obtained from a friendly wizard or warlock. This allows <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> across the island; riding a magic carpet avoids monster battles but also skips over buildings and ruins that may contain treasure. Horses can also be obtained with a similar effect; however, the player must have a sufficient quantity of horses to carry the team, while only one magic carpet is required.|$|E
5000|$|Such {{regulations}} must be predictable, reproducible, {{and enforced}} otherwise {{there will be}} a sacrifice of clean water for development in the case of wetlands regulation (or vice versa), or sacrifice safe travel for <b>quick</b> <b>travel</b> (or vice versa) in the case of speed limits. Determining which wetlands are regulated under section 404 of the Clean Water Act or Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act is termed [...] "jurisdictional determination". Determining the boundary of wetland, whether jurisdictional under sections 404 or 10, or not jurisdictional but still meeting the technical definition of a wetland, that is having the soils, vegetation and hydrology criterion met is called a [...] "wetland delineation", and generally is performed by college graduates with natural science or biology degrees working for engineering firms or environmental consulting firms who are familiar with the 1987 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Wetland delineation manual.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{a two-way}} avenue, the Theatre District portion was changed in 1980 to a one-way going north {{with only a}} bus only lane going south. [...] "The Environmental Protection Agency was {{concerned}} with the air quality in downtown Minneapolis. Turning the streets into one-way lowered the near dangerous high levels of pollution". [...] However, on October 10, 2009, it was changed back to a two-way avenue, with its bike lanes being transferred one block west to First Avenue (which was also switched from one-way to two-way at the same time). This change was hoped by the city to create urban vibrancy, <b>quicker</b> <b>travel</b> times to destination, and to avoid confusing one-ways.|$|R
50|$|Travelling Salesman is a 2012 {{intellectual}} thriller {{film about}} four mathematicians solving the P versus NP problem, {{one of the}} most challenging mathematical problems in history. The title refers to the Travelling salesman problem, an optimization problem that acts like a key to solving other mathematical problems that are thought to be hard; it has been proven that a <b>quick</b> <b>travelling</b> salesman algorithm, if one exists, could be converted into quick algorithms for many other difficult tasks, such as factoring large numbers. Since many cryptographic schemes rely on the difficulty of factoring integers to protect their data, this would allow access to private data like personal correspondence, bank accounts and, possibly, government secrets.|$|R
