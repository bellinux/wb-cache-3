5|$|Robert Bigham Brode {{was born}} in Walla Walla, Washington, on June 12, 1900, the son of Howard S. Brode, a {{professor}} of biology at Whitman College, and his wife Martha Catherine née Bigham. He was the second of a set of <b>quadruplets,</b> being born between his brothers Wallace and Malcolm, the fourth child died within weeks of being born. They also had an older brother, James Stanley. All four attended Whitman College, and went on to earn doctorates and have distinguished careers as scientists and academics.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quadruplets</b> {{are much}} rarer than twins or triplets. As of 2007, there were {{approximately}} 3500 sets recorded worldwide. Quadruplet births {{are becoming increasingly}} common due to fertility treatments. There are around 70 sets of all-identical <b>quadruplets</b> worldwide. Many sets of <b>quadruplets</b> contain a mixture of identical and fraternal siblings, such as three identical and one fraternal, two identical and two fraternal, or two pairs of identicals. One famous set of identical <b>quadruplets</b> was the Genain <b>quadruplets,</b> all of whom developed schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Identical {{triplets}} or <b>quadruplets</b> {{are very}} rare and result {{when the original}} fertilized egg splits {{and then one of}} the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for <b>quadruplets).</b> The odds of having identical triplets is unclear. News articles and other non-scientific organizations give odds from one in 60,000 to one in 200 million pregnancies.|$|E

25|$|In humans, {{the average}} length of {{pregnancy}} (two weeks fewer than gestation) is 38 weeks with a single fetus. This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for <b>quadruplets.</b> With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.|$|E
25|$|Sometime {{after her}} {{recovery}} from cancer, Scully began to regularly attend Mass again. At {{the request of}} Father McCue, Scully got involved in a case concerning a paraplegic girl who {{was found dead in}} a kneeling position with her palms outstretched and eye sockets charred. After Scully discovered the girl was part of a set of <b>quadruplets</b> and two more were murdered, Father McCue shared with her the story of the seraphim and the nephilim, which Scully interpreted as a possible explanation for the deformations and deaths of the girls. Scully continued to have visions of Emily, and when the last girl died, Scully believed she was returning the girl to God. Upon her return to Washington D.C., she went to confession to gain peace of mind and acceptance for Emily's death. In confession she regretted her decision of letting the girl go. This suggests Scully had doubts about her faith.|$|E

40|$|In Type III seesaw {{model the}} heavy neutrinos are {{contained}} in leptonic triplet representations. The Yukawa couplings of the triplet fermion and the left-handed neutrinos with the doublet Higgs field produce the Dirac mass terms. Together with the Majorana masses for the leptonic triplets, the light neutrinos obtain non-zero seesaw masses. We {{point out that it}} is also possible to have a <b>quadruplet</b> Higgs field to produce the Dirac mass terms to facilitate the seesaw mechanism. The vacuum expectation value of the <b>quadruplet</b> Higgs is constrained to be small by electroweak precision data. Therefore the Yukawa couplings of a <b>quadruplet</b> can be much larger than those for a doublet. We also find that unlike the usual Type III seesaw model where at least two copies of leptonic triplets are needed, with both doublet and <b>quadruplet</b> Higgs representations, just one leptonic triplet is possible to have a phenomenologically acceptable model because light neutrino masses can receive sizable contributions at both tree and one loop levels. Large Yukawa couplings of the <b>quadruplet</b> can induce observable effects for lepton flavor violating processes μ→ e γ and μ - e conversion. Implications of the recent μ→ eγ limit from MEG and also limit on μ - e conversion on Au are also given. Some interesting collider signatures for the doubly charged Higgs boson in the <b>quadruplet</b> are discussed. Comment: Latex 11 pages, 1 figure. A few references adde...|$|R

Makeup artist Laverne Basham and hairstylist Anji Bemben {{were given the}} task of creating four distinct looks for the <b>quadruplets,</b> all played by Emily Perkins.

This model combines geometrical ray tracing, coordinate transformation, and Fresnel diffraction integral to capture the <b>quadruplet</b> beams propagating in four different directions and the typically non planar geometry of the hohlraum wall. The results demonstrate that the optical field distribution arises mainly from individual beam diffraction, and the interference with other beams in the <b>quadruplet</b> hardly devotes to the distribution. A movie is also produced to interpret the spatio and temporal evolution of the optical field on a cylindrical hohlraum wall. (c) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|Multiples {{are also}} {{known to have}} a higher {{mortality}} rate. [...] It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. [...] A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of quintuplets, 17 sets of <b>quadruplets,</b> and 228 sets of triplets. [...] By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for <b>quadruplets.</b> This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses.|$|E
2500|$|Today many {{multiple}} pregnancies are {{the result}} of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). In a study in 1997 of 2,173 embryo transfers performed as part of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), 34% were successfully delivered pregnancies. The overall multiple pregnancy rate was 31.3% (24.7% twins, 5.8% triplets, and [...]08% <b>quadruplets).</b> Because IVFs are producing more multiples, a number of efforts are being made {{to reduce the risk of}} multiple births- specifically triplets or more. Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.|$|E

This thesis had three objectives: 1) convert the existing image theory models called URTEXT and WEDGE into a high level scripting language called MATLAB™ by Math Works, 2) linearize the existing <b>quadruplet</b> expansion program to increase speed, and 3) to incorporate the Arctan approximation of the Rayleigh reflection coefficient into the <b>quadruplet</b> expansion for the fast bottom case.

Objective 3 incorporated the Arctan approximation of the reflection coefficient for a fast bottom into the <b>quadruplet</b> expansion, but due to the inaccuracy of the reflection coefficient after the second <b>quadruplet,</b> the results were not favorable.
