The hybrids are of the branch-line type, which can be machined in a split block configuration on a CNC milling machine. The prototype designs are for the WR- 10 band (75 – 110 GHz), but the dimensions are chosen to allow scaling to any waveguide band up to ~ 700 GHz.

40|$|Solid-state {{frequency}} multipliers {{are used}} to produce tunable broadband sources at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. The maximum power produced by a single chip {{is limited by the}} electrical breakdown of the semiconductor and by the thermal management properties of the chip. The solution is to split the drive power to a frequency tripler using waveguides to divide the power among four chips, then recombine the output power from the four chips back into a single waveguide. To achieve this, a waveguide branchline <b>quadrature</b> <b>hybrid</b> coupler splits a 100 -GHz input signal into two paths with a 90 relative phase shift. These two paths are split again by a pair of waveguide Y-junctions. The signals from the four outputs of the Y-junctions are tripled in frequency using balanced Schottky diode frequency triplers before being recombined with another pair of Y-junctions. A final waveguide branchline <b>quadrature</b> <b>hybrid</b> coupler completes the combination. Using four chips instead of one enables using four-times higher power input, and produces a nearly four-fold power output as compared to using a single chip. The phase shifts introduced by the <b>quadrature</b> <b>hybrid</b> couplers provide isolation for the input and output waveguides, effectively eliminating standing waves between it and surrounding components. This is accomplished without introducing the high losses and expense of ferrite isolators.
