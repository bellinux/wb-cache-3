60|$|The man <b>with</b> the <b>battered</b> <b>face</b> {{locked the}} door, {{and hung up}} the key as directed, merely remarking, with a laugh, that we were safe enough anyhow, and {{that if we were}} humbugging him it would be worse for us in the long-run.|$|R
50|$|SunTrust Park (Atlanta Braves) - Opened in 2017, this retro-modern {{design has}} {{cantilevered}} {{middle and upper}} decks to place fans closer to the action, plus a canopy covering about 60% of the seats. The park is oriented <b>with</b> the <b>batter</b> <b>facing</b> southwest (an uncommon feature), giving fans seated behind home plate views of the Atlanta skyline. While the outfield distances are only slightly asymmetrical, the outfield walls vary dramatically in height throughout the stadium.|$|R
50|$|After barely saving her life, Nick and {{his fellow}} EMT Charles both {{make it to the}} hospital. Nick faces {{suspension}} from the dangerous tactic taken to save the woman's life. After leaving the hospital, they come across an office building with a janitor <b>with</b> a <b>battered</b> <b>face.</b> He was the only survivor of the outbreak in the office building. After treating him, Nick and a few police officers at the scene move up to the lawyers office to see nine horribly calcified bodies.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, in 1968, after outpointing Leotis Martin, he got {{a rematch}} with Frazier for the heavyweight title in Philadelphia. After a grueling fifteen rounds Bonavena lost the rematch by decision, fighting more defensively than previous. He did leave <b>with</b> a seriously <b>battered</b> <b>face</b> photographed in the Ring magazine. However, he had won respect.|$|R
5000|$|The team {{chartered}} {{an overall}} successful opening month, finishing with a 15-11 record (.577 winning percentage) and {{in first place}} in the NL Central. However, it was not without challenges: the rest of the division played also very competitively, with the Milwaukee Brewers, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cincinnati Reds each finished the month within one game of the Cardinals. [...] An outstanding effort by the starting pitching won all 15 games in the month (2.15 ERA in 167 innings, and 1.152 WHIP with 8.2 SO per nine innings) and timely hitting (.350 BA, [...]940 OPS with RISP) covered for an otherwise dismal offense (.245 BA, 20 home runs and [...]677 OPS) and dysfunctional bullpen (0-5, 5.82 ERA in 66 innings). [...] Starting pitcher Adam Wainwright began the season with 34 2/3 consecutive innings without issuing a walk, the longest such streak in team history since 1913, when Slim Sallee began the season with 40 consecutive innings (the team record). Wainwright led the league <b>with</b> 171 <b>batters</b> <b>faced</b> and in pitching 44 1/3 innings. Wainwright and Lance Lynn tied for the NL lead with four wins each, while Jake Westbrook led the league with a 0.98 ERA. Rookie Shelby Miller finished the month with a 2.05 ERA, 1.011 WHIP and 9.7 strikeouts per nine innings.|$|R
60|$|Reaching an {{outlying}} farm, he breakfasted {{and rested}} a while, {{after which he}} rode on to the Indian reservation, where he found signs of recent trouble. A man to whom he was at first refused access lay <b>with</b> a badly <b>battered</b> <b>face</b> in a shack which stood beside a few acres of roughly broken land; another man suffering from what looked like an ax wound sat huddled in dirty blankets in a teepee. It was obvious that a fight, which Flett suspected {{was the result of}} a drunken orgy, had been in progress not long before; but he could find no liquor nor any man actually under its influence, though the appearance of several suggested that they were recovering from a debauch. He discovered, however, in a poplar thicket the hide of a steer, from which a recent breeze had swept its covering of snow. This was a serious matter, and though the brand had been removed, Flett identified the skin as having belonged to an animal reported to him as missing.|$|R

50|$|Architects Populous (née HOK Sport) and Antoine Predock's design pulled restaurants, {{administrative}} {{offices and}} other amenities {{away from the}} seating bowl itself into other buildings surrounding the bowl.

Unlike many outdoor ballparks, in which the <b>batter</b> <b>faces</b> northeast, at Petco the <b>batter</b> <b>faces</b> due north, and fans in the grandstands are treated to a view of San Diego Bay and the San Diego skyline beyond the left field seats, as well as a view of Balboa Park, which contains the San Diego Zoo, beyond center field. The San Diego Union-Tribune honored the ballpark in 2006 with an Orchid award for its design.|$|R
