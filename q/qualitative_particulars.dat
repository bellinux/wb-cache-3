40|$|Aumann (1976) {{put forward}} a formal {{definition}} of common knowledge {{and used it to}} prove that two ""like minded"" individuals cannot ""agree to disagree"" in the following sense. If they start from a common prior and update the probability of an event E (using Bayes'' rule) on the basis of private information, then it cannot be common knowledge between them that individual 1 assigns probability p to E and individual 2 assigns probability q to E with p Â¹ q. In other words, if their posteriors of event E are common knowledge then they must coincide. Aumann''s Agreement Theorem has given rise to a large literature which we review in this paper. The results are classified according to whether they are probabilistic (Bayesian) or <b>qualitative.</b> <b>Particular</b> attention is paid to the issue of how to interpret the notion of Harsanyi consistency as a (local) property of belief hierarchies. ...|$|R

These solutions are known as travelling fronts (or travelling waves) and {{play an important role}} in the long-time behaviour of the solutions of the parabolic system.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we provide}} an {{algebraic}} approach to Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), which allows a unified treatment of MDPs and includes many existing models (quantitative or <b>qualitative)</b> as <b>particular</b> cases. In algebraic MDPs, rewards {{are expressed in}} a semiring structure, uncertainty is represented by a decomposable plausibility measure valued on a second semiring structure, and preferences over policies are represented by Generalized Expected Utility. We recast the problem of finding an optimal policy at a finite horizon as an algebraic path problem in a decision rule graph where arcs are valued by functions, which justifies {{the use of the}} Jacobi algorithm to solve algebraic Bellman equations. In order to show the potential of this general approach, we exhibit new variations of MDPs, admitting complete or partial preference structures, as well as probabilistic or possibilistic representation of uncertainty...|$|R

Hydrocarbons are modelled with the Soave-Redlick-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equations of states. Numerical results show no <b>particular</b> <b>qualitative</b> difference between the two equations of states. Furthermore, in general the moment method proves to be an excellent method for solving phase equilibria of polydisperse systems, showing excellent agreement with previous results and allowing a great improvement in generality of the numerical scheme and speed of computation.

We prove existence and uniqueness of positive solutions of the regularized problem in a space of Radon measures. It is shown that these solutions satisfy suitable entropy inequalities. We also study their <b>qualitative</b> properties, in <b>particular</b> proving that the singular {{part of the solution}} with respect to the Lebesgue measure is constant in time...|$|R

For properly chosen input signals, there exists a steady state with a residual network.

In <b>particular,</b> our extensive numerical simulations show that this STDP-driven resulting network is robust under variations of the model parameters. Comment: 16 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} is a platform where researchers juggle creative imagination {{on one hand}} and a set of principles prescribed by a <b>particular</b> <b>qualitative</b> method on the other hand. Recently, the presenters conducted a qualitative recursive frame analysis to analyze progress notes conducted by Marriage and Family Therapist trainees at a university clinic. The presenters found its analysis process complex and fluid due to the creative nature of its analysis.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relevance of}} qualitative inquiry to policymaking and practice; {{against the background of}} recent attacks on educational research generally, and on <b>qualitative</b> work in <b>particular.</b> It outlines the contribution of the latter, referring to some examples of this kind of work {{over the past couple of}} decades. The discussion is organised around the five capacities ascribed to symbolic interactionist/phenomenological research by David Hargreaves in an article published in 1978 : 'appreciative', 'designatory', 'reflective', 'immunological', and 'corrective'. It is argued that today there is more need than ever for research serving these functions...|$|R

Practical examples for neutral systems include population ecology, heat exchanges, mechanics, and economics; see [1]–[4]. In <b>particular,</b> <b>qualitative</b> analysis such as periodicity and stability of solutions of NFDEs has been studied extensively by many authors.

In <b>particular,</b> <b>qualitative</b> surface features, such as the sign of the Gaussian curvature, can be computed in some cases directly from the shading. Finally, a method to compute the direction of the illuminant (assuming a single point light source) from shading on occluding contours is shown...|$|R
