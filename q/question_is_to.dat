25|$|Reproductive {{advantages}} of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the {{advantages of}} the hermaphrodite forms – in maximum diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of {{at least half of the}} diversity. So, the main <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2009, Václav Havel, {{the first}} {{president}} of the Czech Republic, and other European politicians and thinkers wrote: [...] "First, a big power will always find or engineer a pretext to invade a neighbour whose independence it resents. We should remember that Hitler accused the Poles of commencing hostilities in 1939, just as Stalin pinned the blame on the Finns when he invaded their country in 1940. Similarly, in the case of Georgia and Russia, the critical <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> determine which country invaded the other, rather than which soldier shot the first bullet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{first step}} in {{answering}} this <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> complete an installation analysis. The {{next step is to}} complete a commercial infrastructure analysis. USPACOM relied upon two different DoD organizations for CIP assessments: Balanced Survivability Assessments, or BSAs, and Mission Assurance Assessments. [...] The BSA is a two-week mission-focused assessment at a military installation or designated site. [...] A Mission Assurance Assessment is unique because it uses an area assessment approach to focus on both commercial and military asset vulnerabilities and dependencies. [...] The final step to determine vulnerabilities is to integrate the two analyses and assessments. [...] With its critical assets and their vulnerabilities identified, USPACOM is ready to perform risk management activities to decide {{what can be done to}} protect the mission-critical assets.|$|E

2500|$|Most tellingly, {{hearing the}} Eroica {{inspired}} Berlioz to widen his horizons {{for the first}} time past opera and other vocal works and consider the expressive power of purely instrumental music. Prior to this, he had defaulted to the dominant view of the Parisian music establishment, as typified by Le Sueur: that the symphony was a lesser form of composition that Mozart and Haydn had already taken as far as possible. Berlioz would go on to find instrumental music to be far more penetrating in expression and articulation than vocal setting. [...] "Now that I have heard that terrifying giant Beethoven", he wrote, [...] "I know exactly where my musical art stands; the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> take it from there and push it further." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche {{believed}} {{the search for}} truth, or 'the will to truth', was {{a consequence of the}} will to power of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the will to power, and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in Beyond Good and Evil, [...] "The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding..." [...] (aphorism 4). He proposed the will to power as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.|$|E
2500|$|... "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" [...] (1950) was {{the first}} {{published}} paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine intelligence. Turing begins the 1950 paper with the claim, [...] "I propose to consider the question 'Can machines think? As he highlights, the traditional approach to such a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> start with definitions, defining both the terms [...] "machine" [...] and [...] "intelligence". Turing chooses not to do so; instead he replaces the question with a new one, [...] "which {{is closely related to}} it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words." [...] In essence he proposes to change the question from [...] "Can machines think?" [...] to [...] "Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?" [...] The advantage of the new question, Turing argues, is that it draws [...] "a fairly sharp line between the physical and intellectual capacities of a man." ...|$|E
