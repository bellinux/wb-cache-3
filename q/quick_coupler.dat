5000|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} {{in the design of}} quick couplers. The initial divergence is between those that can pick up any of a range of buckets and attachments by clamping onto the mounting pins for the attachment (known as [...] "pin grabbers" [...] or [...] "pin couplers") and those that work only with buckets and attachments designed to suit that <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> (known as [...] "dedicated"). The claimed advantage of pin-grabbers is flexibility in use in that a machine owner can use a variety of buckets and attachments without changing the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> or buying an adaptor. The claimed advantages of dedicated couplers depend on their individual design but often include better performance and smaller size.|$|E
50|$|Semi-automatic: With {{this type}} the {{hydraulic}} {{system of the}} machine is used to operate the main attachment mechanism but the manual operation of a safety device is necessary at the coupler itself {{to ensure that the}} bucket or attachment is safely locked onto the coupler. The safety device is intended to prevent the release of the bucket or attachment in the event of the failure of the hydraulic system, or other major failure of the attachment mechanism. The safety device is most commonly a pin that must be inserted to prevent one of the components in the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> moving to release the bucket or attachment but some designs require the manual operation of a lever on the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>couplers</b> are devices {{installed}} at the outer end of the work equipment of various types of construction and earth-moving machines. They facilitate the rapid exchange of working tools or buckets. <b>Quick</b> <b>couplers</b> are most common on hydraulic excavators and compact excavators and on the backhoe equipment of backhoe loaders, but are also installed on telescopic handlers, wheel loaders (loading shovels), skid-steer loaders and the loader equipment of backhoe-loaders. They are also occasionally installed on attachments installed on agricultural tractors.Quick couplers do not normally have a specific function themselves in {{that they do not}} carry out handling or digging operations, but when installed on a machine they {{become a part of the}} overall system. They are usually mounted on the machine by means of the pins that would otherwise be the mountings for the bucket or attachment.This article concentrates on <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> installed on excavators and similar equipment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>couplers</b> (also called <b>quick</b> hitches) {{are used}} with {{construction}} machines {{to allow the}} rapid change of buckets and attachments on the machine. They remove the need to use hammers to manually drive out and insert the mounting pins for attachments. They also bring with them additional safety risks that must be overcome by careful design and manufacture, and proper use.|$|R
50|$|Fatalities have {{occurred}} due to buckets being accidentally released from work equipment during operation. Released buckets have hit bystanders causing fatal injuries. These {{have been reported}} in most detail in the UK, but there are reports of fatalities in Australia, the Republic of Ireland and the USA (reference required).The causes of the fatal accidents are not always the same and the views of safety authorities in different countries differ on how to reduce risk. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) analysed the accident data and concluded that all of the known fatalities were caused by the operator not inserting the safety pin in semi-automatic couplers. Even without the safety pin inserted the buckets would not have been released unless there had been a failure of some part of the mechanism, or some error in operation by the operator. The HSE concluded that {{the most effective way to}} reduce the risk of further accidents was for semi-automatic couplers to be withdrawn from sale. The suppliers of these couplers agreed to this voluntarily so semi-automatic couplers were withdrawn from sale in the UK by around October 2008.Safety authorities in other countries have taken a different approach. In Australia the authorities took the view that the problems were caused by designs of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> that did not incorporate a safety pin. That is, they believe that semi-automatics are fundamentally safe. The Australian standard for <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> published by Standards Australia, AS 4774 - 2008 therefore does not exclude this design option. It is therefore obvious that the views of the safety authorities of the UK and Australia on what constitutes a safe design are very divergent.In the UK some major construction contractors have written their own specifications for <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> allowed on sites under their control. That is, they have pursued site safety via a procurement policy. An alternative approach has been put forward by the Strategic Forum Plant Safety Group. A working party under this group has drawn up a best practice guide that has been endorsed, inter alia, by the HSE. This provides an alternative route to site safety: adhering to best practice in the use of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{market for}} quick {{couplers}} is mainly supplied {{by a large}} number of small and medium-sized enterprises. Many of the manufacturers of quick couplers are small, flexible and innovative, leading to the wide variation in design concepts. Many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of construction equipment market a range of quick couplers. Some of these are designed and manufactured by the OEM but more often they are the products of one of the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> manufacturers branded by the OEM and sold through the OEM's distribution chain or installed by the OEM in their factory.In addition to the supply route from the OEMs many distributors of construction machinery will install quick couplers onto machines before delivery at the request of a customer. <b>Quick</b> <b>coupler</b> manufacturers will also sell direct to end-users and usually complete the installation as part of the sale.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{hydraulic}} excavator capabilities have expanded far beyond excavation tasks. With {{the advent of}} hydraulic powered attachments such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment, actually serves as an effective tool carrier. Many excavators feature <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite.|$|E
5000|$|A {{tiltrotator}} (known under {{a number}} of trade names) is an hydraulic attachment/tool used on most excavators, and backhoes between 3-30 tons in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, and Norway). A tiltrotator is mounted on the excavator such that the excavator bucket can be rotated through 360 degrees and one tilts +/- 45 degrees, {{in order to increase}} the flexibility and precision of the excavator. A tiltrotator can best be described as a wrist between the arm of the excavator and bucket, (or whatever other tool is fitted to the tiltrotator's <b>quick</b> <b>coupler).</b> With its integral <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> and rotary swivel, the tiltrotator can also use extra hydraulic functions to power and manipulate other worktools below it such as a breaker, grapple or an auger, which can be attached to the quickcoupler on the tiltrotator, for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the excavator's utilization on the jobsite. control systems which allows the operator to operate the machine fully through the joysticks. Recognized control systems are SVAB, ICS by Indexator, Engcon Microprop DC2 and Steelwrist XControl G2. The tiltrotator is nowadays controlled through machines two or four electro-proportionally controlled hydraulic lines.|$|E
5000|$|A European {{standard}} {{in place since}} 1996 gives some guidance on the safety of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> (EN474-1). However, this standard is unclear in many aspects leading to uncertainty as to whether semi-automatic couplers comply with it or not. Because of this the UK government launched a [...] "safeguard action" [...] under the Machinery Safety Directive (98/37/EC) challenging {{the validity of the}} standard and demanding that it be improved. The European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) have therefore undertaken to revise the relevant section of the standard.Because of the divergence in design concepts and in opinions on how to manage the associated risks the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has undertaken to draft an International Standard on the safety of <b>quick</b> <b>couplers.</b> This project is being undertaken by Technical Committee 127 (ISO TC/127). A Working Group was set up to draft the standard, which will be reviewed internationally through normal ISO procedures and will be published as ISO 13031. This work will probably be completed in 2013. The intention in Europe is that, subject to the standard being suitable, the ISO standard would then be adopted as the standard for Europe.|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{a new approach}} of an intelligent equipment attachment identification system based on passive radio frequency sensing technology that provides operators with the assurance the correct attachment is used while all hydraulic functions, which are so far set manually, are maintained. The article first provides {{an introduction to the}} technology of quick coupling devices and its advantages and current limitations. Concluding from corresponding safety statistics that fatal accidents involving <b>quick</b> <b>couplers</b> are on the rise, the developed identification and control system as well as the experimental test environment and measurement procedure are introduced. Results show that an intelligent quick coupling system for equipment attachment selection and operation can provide equipment operators with additional, safe and productive alternatives to existing malfunctioning systems or practices...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{availability}} of lightweight aluminum tubing in quantity, irrigation by sprinkling has expanded rapidly in the United States {{as well as other}} areas of the world. <b>Quick</b> <b>couplers,</b> better pumps, and more dependable power units and power supplies have also contributed to the increased use of sprinkler irrigation. Future land developments will probably be more favorable to sprinkler irrigation since many of the areas best suited for surface irrigation have already been developed. Sprinkler irrigation can be an efficient way of applying water, and as water supply becomes more and more a limiting factor, more efficient methods for its use must be employed. Because of its relative newness, its rapid growth, and its aesthetic appeal, sprinkler irrigation has received much publicity. Advertising has cited the tremendous savings in water, labor, and investment together with increased quality, yield, and profits as a result of using sprinkler irrigation. It is doubtful that the plant knows or cares how it gets its water as long as it can have it where and when required...|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic {{excavator}} capabilities {{have expanded}} far beyond excavation tasks with buckets. With {{the advent of}} hydraulic-powered attachments such as a breaker, a grapple or an auger, the excavator is frequently used in many applications other than excavation. Many excavators feature a <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's utilization on the jobsite. Excavators are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Most wheeled, compact and some medium-sized (11 to 18-tonne) excavators have a backfill (or dozer) blade. This is a horizontal bulldozer-like blade attached to the undercarriage and is used for levelling and pushing removed material back into a hole.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of {{hydraulic}} powered attachments such as a tiltrotator, breaker, a grapple or an auger, the backhoe is frequently used in many applications other than excavation and with the tiltrotator attachment, serves as an effective tool carrier. Many backhoes feature <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> (quick-attach) mounting systems for simplified attachment mounting, dramatically increasing the machine's utilization on the job site. Backhoes are usually employed together with loaders and bulldozers. Excavators that use a backhoe are sometimes called [...] "trackhoes" [...] by {{people who do not}} realize the name is due to the action of the bucket, not its location on a backhoe loader.|$|E
50|$|While the {{front-end}} loaders on CUT size tractors {{are capable}} of many tasks, given their relatively small size and low capacities when compared to commercial loaders, the compact loaders can be made more useful with some simple options. A toothbar is commonly added to {{the front edge of}} a loader bucket to aid with digging. Some loaders are equipped with a <b>quick</b> <b>coupler,</b> otherwise known as a quick attach (QA) system. The QA system allows the bucket to be removed easily and other tools to be added in its place. Common additions include a set of pallet forks for lifting pallets of goods or a bale spear for lifting hay bales.|$|E
2500|$|Various designs exist, and {{specific}} installations can be tailored {{for a given}} port based on considerations such as vessel size, cargo flow rate and cargo temperature. [...] Environmental constraints, such as the range of tide, wind conditions, and earthquake tolerance, can also affect choice of loading arm.

Lincoln developed the first portable oil drain and a <b>quick</b> detachable air <b>coupler.</b> These innovations led to complete lubrication pumps and swivel assemblies that dispensed lubricant directly from the original refinery container to an automobile on an overhead lift. Service stations, car dealers and mechanics began to heavily promote their lubrication services and Lincoln developed white drum sleeves to cover the refinery containers. (Fox) ...|$|R
5000|$|Backhoe loaders {{are very}} common {{and can be}} used {{for a wide variety of}} tasks: construction, small demolitions, light {{transportation}} of building materials, powering building equipment, digging holes/excavation, landscaping, breaking asphalt, and paving roads. Often, the backhoe bucket can also be replaced with powered attachments such as a breaker, grapple, auger, or a stump grinder. Enhanced articulation of attachments can be achieved with intermediate attachments such as the tiltrotator. Many backhoes feature <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> (quick-attach) mounting systems and auxiliary hydraulic circuits for simplified attachment mounting, increasing the machine's utilization on the job site. Some loader buckets have a retractable bottom or [...] "clamshell", enabling it to empty its load more quickly and efficiently. Retractable-bottom loader buckets are also often used for grading and scraping. The front assembly may be a removable attachment or permanently mounted.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based upon the work done at Westinghouse {{electric}} company (WEC) in Västerås during the spring semester of 2015 and describes the development of a <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> with associated blade changing tool. These are meant to be used together with a sawing tool that the company uses for the dismantling of nuclear reactors, which is performed under water. The aim of the thesis was to develop a complete manufacturing documentation with drawings and related CAD models which Westinghouse later can use to manufacture the tool and the <b>quick</b> <b>coupler.</b> It was also included in the assignment to, if necessary, modify parts of the saw tool to adapt these to the intended blade changing tool. A number of visits to the company's workshop was made during the time to study the saw that the thesis {{is based upon}}. The purpose of these visits was to get a better idea of the dimensions, construction and the field of use of the saw. On three of those occasions various engineers and consultants accompanied us to discuss possible problems with different ideas. This was interspersed with information in the form of literature studies on quick couplers to create a clearer picture {{of the nature of the}} task. When enough information had been gathered a functional analysis was made to divide the main problem into sub this phase the idea and concept generating process took place. The methods used for this was mainly brain writing and brainstorming. When enough ideas and concepts had been generated the most promising ideas was selected by using an evaluation matrix, in which the various suggestions were weighted against the parameters that our supervisor thought mattered the most. The next step was to create a computer model of the best concept and finding suitable components in worm gear, electric motor, planetary gears, screws, etc. During the modeling phase further developed of the concept was made until the tool and <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> received its final shape whereupon the manufacturing documentation was created...|$|E
40|$|As a way {{to reduce}} water losses in furrow {{irrigation}} systems, used in fresh market tomato production, farmers are improperly distributing water into the field using plastic hose. The objective of this work was to study the suitability of using <b>quick</b> <b>coupler</b> sprinkler as hose connectors for water distribution in tomato plantation. The first step {{of the study was}} to assess the current hose field operation for tomato growers. Subsequently, four models of quick couplers sprinklers available in the market were tested in laboratory to determine the coefficient of resistance, the equivalent tube length, the head loss curve and the linking efficiency. As result, a structural design for hose connectors was presented using the model of coupling with the best hydraulic performance. Additionally, some technical recommendations on its use in irrigation water distribution are highlighted. Despite the requirement for additional field trials, the proposed system has potential to optimize the water use efficiency, to improve workers ergonomic conditions, and ensure good profitability to the producer...|$|E
