40|$|Thesis (M. Consumer Science) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. <b>Textile</b> <b>product</b> {{labels are}} {{provided}} on the clothing and household <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> to assist consumers with important product information. However, the assumption cannot {{be made that}} because the label is available on these products {{it will be used}} by consumers. Consumers do not base their pre– and post–purchasing decisions on reality but rather on what they perceive to be the reality. Thus consumers’ perceptions of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels need to be studied as it influences their pre– and post–purchasing decisions and use of these labels. Consumers use their perceptions as a frame of reference for making purchasing decisions. This study determined consumers’ perceptions, in order to form a better understanding of their textile pre– and post–purchasing decisions. However, perception is not a singular concept but an interactive process. Therefore, the present study, done in the Gauteng Province, aimed to determine consumers’ perceptions of clothing and household textile labels, by focusing on the perceptual process of consumers. The first objective was to determine consumers’ awareness of labels on clothing and household <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> Secondly, it was determined whether consumers’ attention is drawn to labels of clothing and household <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> Thirdly it was determined whether labels on <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> are important to consumers and finally, whether consumers interpret labels on <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> An interviewer–administered questionnaire was used as the data collection technique. A total of 411 questionnaires were administered by trained fieldworkers. The study location was three different regions in Gauteng Province, namely: Pretoria, Vereeniging and the West Rand. Public locations were used for the recruitment of respondents selected within the three regions, which included: schools, retirement villages, parking areas and government institutions. This contributed to the probability that a diverse group of respondents participated. The study population consisted of 44. 5 % males and 55. 5 % females. The home languages most spoken among the respondents were English (20. 9 %), Afrikaans (21. 1 %) or isiZulu (16. 5 %). Respondents generally tended to have a positive perception regarding <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels. The results illustrated that respondents tended to agree to be aware of label information and that the front and back panels of the label draw their attention. However respondents tended to be neutral as to whether the information is important enough to read. Respondents mostly agreed that they interpret the symbols on <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels. Although respondents tended to perceive <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels positively, it still remains unclear whether it is important enough for consumers to use these labels found on <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> By striving to improve consumers’ perceptions regarding <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels through better labelling initiatives and consumer education on labels, consumers might view labels as important and use them before and after purchasing a <b>textile</b> <b>product.</b> This will in effect teach consumers how to clean and maintain <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> to extend the product’s lifespan. This would in turn contribute to the consumer’s pre– and post–purchasing satisfaction. This study additionally found that respondents’ perceptions of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels were influenced by some of their demographic characteristics. Although there were no large effect sizes which illustrated practical significance, there were some small to medium tendencies regarding respondents’ perceptions of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels and their demographic characteristics. Different tendencies were especially found when analysing the relationships between respondents’ perceptions and age or language. Older respondents (60 and older) tended to have a more positive perception of <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels than younger respondents (18 to 29 years). In addition, respondents with an African language as their home language seemed to differ from Afrikaans and English respondents. To understand South African consumers fully, researchers should understand the diversity and political history of South Africa, by focusing on cultural differences and reasons thereof. Different age generations need to be examined in further South African studies {{in order to determine the}} perceptions of consumers from different age groups regarding <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> labels.

These methods include brand extension, brand licensing, acquisition of patent rights and co-branding, that is the strategy of double branding products when two distinct partner brand names are used on one product. Different {{studies show that the}} influence of co-branding on the behaviour of the consumer and their perception of products is high. For the authors, it was important to demonstrate the impact of co-branding on customer prefer-ences concerning <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> for the example chosen. The aim of the research was to identify behaviours of consumers from the Lodz Voivodeship (Poland) when a co-branding strategy is used. As was proved in the study, the consumers give priority to a co-branded <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> in relation to a classic <b>textile</b> <b>product.</b> However, at the same time, those con-sumers do not give priority to a more expensive co-branded <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> in relation to the classic <b>textile</b> <b>product.</b> As was also proved in the study, the preferences of different groups of customers are not the same and the demographic, socio-professional and geographical characteristics of customers influence their behaviour towards the example of a co-brande...|$|R

40|$|Although textile {{industry}} and <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> {{belong to the}} strategic sub sector of manufacturing industry in Indonesia, they are facing pro-blems {{on the availability of}} energy, old production machines, and the flooding of imported products into the domestic market. This study  is aimed to analyze the efficiency and productivity as performance indicators and how the efficiency and import penetration affect the productivity of {{textile industry}} and <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> The methods of data analysis used in this research are divided in two phases. The first phase, the non-metric approach of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is applied to measure the efficiency and productivity. Secondly, the fixed effect model of econometric regression approach is used to find out the effects of efficiency and import penetration on the productivity of textile industry and <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> The result shows that the average level of efficiency of textile industry and <b>textile</b> <b>products</b> during the period of 2004 – 2008 is about 40 percent with a growth rate of average productivity increases 2. 4 percent. Whereas, the econometric estimation results indicate that the increase of efficiency will positively and significantly affect the productivity of textile industry and <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> On the other hand, the increase of import penetration will negatively affect the productivity of this industry.

30|$|Lastly, {{findings}} {{provide some}} support {{for the application of}} Handfield et al.’s (2001) environmental product design and development model to the experience of DfE-oriented designers of interior <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> Most notably, the creative exploration theme identified in the present study is similar to the product design stage in the Handfield et al. (2001) model; the stage during which decisions related to product specifications, including raw material selection are made. Prominent differences between these conceptualizations of the design process include the emphasis that designers in this study placed upon research and resources as well as consumer need and trend identification, which clearly delineated these as unique phases in the design of interior <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> This difference may, in part be explained by the ‘fashion’ aspect of interior <b>textile</b> <b>products.</b> This may also explain the difference in the product launch stage which is somewhat similar to the conclusion of the design process as described by the designers in this study; however, the focus among interior textile designers was market acceptance rather than assessment of the environmental impacts of the products; any reference to interior <b>textile</b> <b>product</b> evaluation {{at this stage of the}} process was in the form of consumer feedback/satisfaction.|$|R
