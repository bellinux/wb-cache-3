40|$|Various aspects {{related to}} {{controlling}} induction motor are investigated. Direct torque control is an original high performance control {{strategy in the}} field of AC drive. In this proposed method, the control system is based on Space Vector Modulation (SVM), amplitude of <b>voltage</b> in direct- <b>quadrature</b> reference frame (d-q reference) and angle of stator flux. Amplitude of stator voltage is controlled by PI torque and PI flux controller. The stator flux angle is adjusted by rotor angular frequency and slip angular frequency. Then, the reference torque and the estimated torque is applied to the input of PI torque controller and the control <b>quadrature</b> axis <b>voltage</b> is determined. The control d-axis voltage is determined from the flux calculator. These q and d axis voltage are converted into amplitude voltage. By applying polar to Cartesian on amplitude voltage and stator flux angle, direct <b>voltage</b> and <b>quadratures</b> <b>voltage</b> are generated. The reference stator voltages in d-q are calculated based on forcing the stator voltage error to zero at next sampling period.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{provides}} the theoretical {{basis for the}} measurement of reactive and distortion powers from the wavelet transforms. The measurement of reactive power relies {{on the use of}} broad-band phase-shift networks to create concurrent in-phase currents and <b>quadrature</b> <b>voltages.</b> The wavelet real power computation resulting from these 90 phase-shift networks yields the reactive power associated with each wavelet frequency level or subband. The distortion power at each wavelet subband is then derived from the real, reactive and apparent powers of the subband, where the apparent power is the product of the v; i element pair's subband rms voltage and current. The advantage of viewing the real and reactive powers in the wavelet domain is that the domain preserves both the frequency and time relationship of these powers. In addition, the reactive power associated with each wavelet subband is a signed quantity and thus has a direction associated with it. This permits tracking the reactive power flow in each subband through the power system. Index Terms—Digital signal processing, phase shift networks, measurement, power, RMS, subband, wavelets.

First, the data acquisition system (DAS) commanded a direct digital synthesizer to start the FM sweep and then collected all voltage samples. This architecture insured phase coherence between the transmit FM sweep and the sampled voltages, which is critical for the Doppler processing that detects target phase changes over several successive FM sweeps. Second, a 5 -m range resolution was achieved by increasing the FM bandwidth to over 36 MHz and decreasing the DAS sample rate to 500 kHz, enabling the use of an inexpensive DAS. Third, the Doppler processing at each range was achieved using two fast Fourier transforms (FFTs), i. e., a range FFT converted FM sweep voltages into in-phase and <b>quadrature</b> <b>voltages</b> I and Q at each range, and a Doppler FFT converted I and Q voltages from consecutive sweeps into the Doppler velocity power spectra.
