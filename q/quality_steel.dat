5|$|The Brandenburg-class {{ships were}} the first ocean-going battleships built for the German navy, and marked the {{beginning}} of German naval expansion. Previous classes included several types of ironclad ships, including coastal defense ships and armored frigates. The ships were unique for the time in that they were armed with six large-caliber guns instead of four, as was standard on contemporary ships in other navies. The class comprised four ships: Brandenburg, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm, Weissenburg, and Wörth. Of the four ships, Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm and Weissenburg were more advanced, in that their armor was composed of higher <b>quality</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} Fortune 500 {{iron and steel}} {{manufacturers}} with world headquarters in Ohio: AK Steel, located in Westchester, Timken Company, located in Canton, and Worthington Industries, located in Columbus. Other notable companies include Russia-based Severstal, which has facilities located in Warren and Steubenville, Luxembourg-based Mittal Steel USA, which has facilities in Columbus and Cleveland, United States Steel Corporation in Lorain, Cliffs Natural Resources in Cleveland, and Republic Engineered Products, North America's largest supplier of specialty bar <b>quality</b> <b>steel,</b> located in Canton. V Star Steel, a subsidiary of France-based Vallourec, broke ground on a $650 million production facility in Youngstown in June 2010.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> in turn fed the shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
50|$|Bulat {{became popular}} in cannon manufacturing, until the Bessemer process {{was able to}} make the same <b>quality</b> <b>steels</b> for far less money.|$|R
50|$|Typically a European MTC will be {{produced}} to EN 10204. High <b>quality</b> <b>steels</b> for pressure vessel of structural purposes will be declared to 3.1 or 3.2 or certificated to 4.1 or 4.2.|$|R
50|$|In the 1890s, Hermann Röchling (1872-1955) {{gradually}} {{took over}} the responsibilities of his father, Carl. Under his direction, the pre-industrial ironworks developed into a modern blast furnace plant, which was also able to produce the <b>quality</b> <b>steels</b> that were increasingly in demand.|$|R
5|$|The Sanjō branch, {{named after}} a street in Kyoto and founded by Sanjō Munechika around 1000, is the oldest school in Yamashiro Province. In the early Kamakura period {{it was the most}} {{advanced}} school of swordsmanship in Japan. Sanjō Munechika's pieces, together with those of Yasutsuna from Hōki Province, consist of some of the oldest curved Japanese swords and mark the start of the old sword (kotō) period. Sanjō school's sugata is characterized by a much narrower upper area compared to the bottom, small kissaki, torii-zori and deep koshi-zori. The jihada uses good <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> with abundant ji-nie and chikei, small mokume-hada mixed with wavy, large hada. The hamon is bright and covered with thick nioi. It is based on suguha mixed with small chōji midare. Hataraki appear along the temper line.|$|E
25|$|A Swedish {{copy of the}} L-35 Lahti, the Husqvarna m/40, saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the Swedish military until the 1980s. The m/40s had similar design and firing mechanisms to the Finnish L-35s but suffered lower reliability from the lower <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> used in manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{as early}} as 500 BC, {{although}} certainly by 200 AD, high <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> was produced in southern India by the crucible technique. In this system, high-purity wrought iron, charcoal, and glass were mixed in a crucible and heated until the iron melted and absorbed the carbon. Iron chain was used in Indian suspension bridges {{as early as}} the 4th century.|$|E
5000|$|The {{crucible}} process {{continued to}} be used for specialty steels, but is today obsolete. Similar <b>quality</b> <b>steels</b> are now made with an electric arc furnace.

25|$|Khanda is a double-edge {{straight}} sword. It {{is often}} featured in religious iconography, theatre and art depicting the ancient history of India. Some communities venerate the weapon {{as a symbol}} of Shiva. It is a common weapon in the martial arts in the Indian subcontinent. Khanda often appears in Hindu, Buddhist and Sikh scriptures and art. In Sri Lanka, a unique wind furnace was used to produce the high <b>quality</b> <b>steel.</b> This gave the blade a very hard cutting edge and beautiful patterns. For these reasons it became a very popular trading material.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} issued public tenders {{for construction}} of the ships in June 1883, and on 3 July {{it was announced that}} John Roach & Sons had won all four contracts. Roach immediately went to work on construction of the ships, but continual design changes submitted by the Navy, in addition to shortages of the high <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> demanded by Navy inspectors, soon had construction falling well behind schedule. Roach found himself faced with mounting financial losses. A fire in the shipyard and the loss of two steamers in which Roach had part ownership depleted cash reserves still further.|$|E
25|$|The Arthashastra and the Edicts of Ashoka are {{the primary}} written records of the Mauryan times. Archaeologically, this period falls into the era of Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW). The Mauryan Empire {{was based on a}} modern and {{efficient}} economy and society. However, the sale of merchandise was closely regulated by the government. Although there was no banking in the Mauryan society, usury was customary. A significant amount of written records on slavery are found, suggesting a prevalence thereof. During this period, a high <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> called Wootz steel was developed in south India and was later exported to China and Arabia.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, the {{experience}} of the intellectual classes following the Hundred Flowers Campaign silenced those aware of the folly of such a plan. According to his private doctor, Li Zhisui, Mao and his entourage visited traditional steel works in Manchuria in January 1959 where he found out that high <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> could only be produced in large-scale factories using reliable fuel such as coal. However, he decided not to order a halt to the backyard steel furnaces so as not to dampen the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. The program was only quietly abandoned much later in that year.|$|E
25|$|An early written {{reference}} to a fish hook is found with {{reference to}} the Leviathan in the Book of Job 41:1; Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? Fish hooks have been crafted from all sorts of materials including wood, animal and human bone, horn, shells, stone, bronze, iron up to present day materials. In many cases, hooks were created from multiple materials to leverage the strength and positive characteristics of each material. Norwegians as late as the 1950s still used juniper wood to craft Burbot hooks. <b>Quality</b> <b>steel</b> hooks began to make their appearance in Europe in the 17th century and hook making became a task for specialists.|$|E
25|$|Seeing an {{opportunity}} to relieve festering debts from the land and glass businesses, the western partners sought Gallatin's advice and political pull in the state government to acquire an arms contract. Initially against the idea, the mounting debts forced Gallatin to reconsider. He signed a contract in January 1799 to produce 2000 muskets with bayonets. The Gallatin partners subcontracted Melchior Baker of Haydentown to make the muskets. Lack of skilled labor and <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> supported by poor management plagued the business. By April 1801, only 600 muskets had been delivered, fifteen months behind schedule. Seeing only complete financial ruin if he remained in the agreement, Gallatin transferred all contractual obligations to Melchior Baker and Abraham Stewart.|$|E
50|$|Crankshafts {{can also}} be {{machined}} out of a billet, often a bar of high <b>quality</b> vacuum remelted <b>steel.</b> Though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesn’t follow {{the shape of the}} crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since higher <b>quality</b> <b>steels,</b> which normally are difficult to forge, can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines, the high material cost, and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is needed, this production method allows small production runs without high costs.|$|R
50|$|Anosov {{received}} {{international attention}} for his writings on {{the manufacture of}} iron and his re-discovery of the secret of Damascene steel, previously thought lost in the Middle Ages. He explained {{the effect of the}} chemical composition, structure and treatment of steel on its properties. His findings formed the basis for the science of <b>quality</b> <b>steels.</b> Anosov summed up his studies in his now classic treatise, Damascene steels (1841), which was immediately translated into German and French.|$|R
40|$|As {{discussed}} {{in detail in}} the Appendix, copper is detrimental to the properties of steel. Copper is present in most forms of recycled swap, such as bundles and shredded scrap. Typical levels of copper in these forms of swap are 0. 2 to 0. 4 %, whereas critical grades of steel require less than 0. 1 and often 0. 06 % Cu. Therefore, these forms of scrap cannot be used alone to produce <b>quality</b> <b>steels.</b> Steelmaker...|$|R

500|$|Once more, Gates {{planned to}} get back into the steel industry. [...] In 1903, he began buying shares of Republic Steel. Its two main {{competitors}} were in the US South-Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, and the Sloss-Sheffield Iron and Steel Company in Alabama. [...] All three were able to use inexpensive Southern iron ore to produce <b>quality</b> <b>steel</b> with the open hearth process, making the price of the steel produced with it cheaper. The minerals needed for the open hearth process were readily found in Alabama. Gates envisioned bringing Republic, Tennessee Coal and Iron and Sloss-Sheffield together into a steel trust to challenge J. P. Morgan's U. S. Steel. When August Belmont, Jr. resigned his seat on Republic's board to concentrate on consolidating the New York transit system, Gates was elected to fill Belmont's seat.|$|E
500|$|Even in {{a narrow}} range of {{concentrations}} of mixtures of carbon and iron that make a steel, {{a number of different}} metallurgical structures, with very different properties can form. Understanding such properties is essential to making <b>quality</b> <b>steel.</b> At room temperature, the most stable form of pure iron is the body-centered cubic (BCC) structure called alpha iron or α-iron. It is a fairly soft metal that can dissolve only a small concentration of carbon, no more than 0.005% at [...] and 0.021 wt% at [...] The inclusion of carbon in alpha iron is called ferrite. At 910°C pure iron transforms into a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure, called gamma iron or γ-iron. The inclusion of carbon in gamma iron is called austenite. The more open FCC structure of austenite can dissolve considerably more carbon, as much as 2.1% (38 times that of ferrite) carbon at , which reflects the upper carbon content of steel, beyond which is cast iron. When carbon moves out of solution with iron it forms a very hard, but brittle material called cementite (Fe3C).|$|E
