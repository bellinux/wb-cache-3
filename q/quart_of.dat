500|$|Another form of wife selling was by deed of conveyance. Although {{initially}} {{much less}} common than sale by auction, the practice became more widespread after the 1850s, as popular opinion {{turned against the}} market sale of a wife. The issue of the commonly perceived legitimacy of wife selling was also brought to the government. In 1881, Home Secretary William Harcourt was asked to comment on an incident in Sheffield, in which a man sold his wife for a <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> beer. Harcourt replied: [...] "no impression exists anywhere in England that the selling of wives is legitimate", and [...] "that no such practice as wife selling exists", but as late as 1889, {{a member of the}} Salvation Army sold his wife for a shilling in Hucknall Torkard, Nottinghamshire, and subsequently led her by the halter to her buyer's house, the last case in which the use of a halter is mentioned. The most recent case of an English wife sale was reported in 1913, when a woman giving evidence in a Leeds police court during a maintenance case claimed that her husband had sold her to one of his workmates for £1 (equivalent to about £ in [...] ). The manner of her sale is unrecorded.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{articles}} reporting on Heikkinen’s All-American selection focused on his academic performance and on his love of poetry. While at Michigan, Heikkinen was also {{the president of the}} undergraduate “M” club in 1938 and president of U-M’s senior honor society, “Michigamua.” Detroit News sports editor H.G. Salsinger wrote that Heikkinen “writes poetry, and one of his poems appeared in a literary publication in 1938.” The Associated press noted that Heikkinen was “a high-ranking student whose hobby is poetry” An Ann Arbor paper wrote: “He’s extremely intelligent, dabbling in such fields as creative writing, drama, and poetry with considerable vim and no little skill during his spare moments. He is completely unassuming, unusually quiet, and above all a real gentleman." [...] In August 1939, Heikkinen was hired by a magazine to write a story on college football. Newspapers reported that Heikkinen was “collecting dividends on the reputation he made as a poet and writer as an undergraduate.” In 1937, Heikkinen was the subject of an article titled, “But He’s No Sissy.” The articles noted that Heikkinen “adheres strictly to a liquid diet” and drank a full <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> milk after every game as part of a special diet due to a stomach disorder.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{initiative}} was usually the husband's, the wife {{had to agree}} to the sale. An 1824 report from Manchester says that [...] "after several biddings she [...] was knocked down for 5s; but not liking the purchaser, she was put up again for 3s and a <b>quart</b> <b>of</b> ale". Frequently the wife was already living with her new partner. In one case in 1804 a London shopkeeper found his wife in bed with a stranger to him, who, following an altercation, offered to purchase the wife. The shopkeeper agreed, and in this instance the sale may have been an acceptable method of resolving the situation. However, the sale was sometimes spontaneous, and the wife could find herself the subject of bids from total strangers. In March 1766, a carpenter from Southwark sold his wife [...] "in a fit of conjugal indifference at the alehouse". Once sober, the man asked his wife to return, and after she refused he hanged himself. A domestic fight might sometimes precede the sale of a wife, but in most recorded cases the intent was to end a marriage in a way that gave it the legitimacy of a divorce. In some cases the wife arranged for her own sale, and even provided the money for her agent to buy her out of her marriage, such as an 1822 case in Plymouth.|$|E
