40|$|A herd with 850 milking cows was {{analyzed}} by Cornell University's Quality Milk Production Services. Milk quality, milking procedures, environmental factors, and general {{success of the}} farm were assessed. The cows are housed in a freestall, fed a total mixed ration, and are milking about 69 pounds per cow per day. The farm, operating {{in conjunction with a}} larger dairy, strives to decrease subclinical mastitis incidence, improve teat end health, increase production to over 27, 000 lbs, and decrease bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC) to less than 150, 000 cells/mL. Suggestions were made to increase cow comfort and profitability by bedding the cows more adequately and by keeping the cross-over alleys clean. We also suggested that the producer milks all chronically infected cows in a separate pen, last. We advised using a <b>quarter</b> <b>milker</b> for cows with high somatic cell count to lower the BTSCC and increase premium payments for quality...|$|E
40|$|An {{individual}} <b>quarter</b> <b>milker</b> {{was used}} to measure milk yields at staggered 20 -s intervals from 198 Holstein cows in the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center herd. Several flow rate variables were calculated. The 2792 quarter samples of milk yield were taken during afternoon milkings. Yields and rates of individual quarters were examined as were effects of lactation, stage of lactation, machine, and cow. Differences between rear and front quarters were. 78  kg for yield and. 12  kg/min for maximum rate. Differences between left and right quarters were. 02  kg/min for maximum rate and. 10  kg for yield during the period of maximum rate. Yields departed from front-rear and left-right side patterns. This lack of symmetry, interactions of front-rear by side, for the yield traits may have been from permanent environmental causes such as developmental error, mastitis, or injury. Cow effects were important for all traits as were the effects of lactation, stage of lactation, and machine for many of the traits. Repeatabilities were. 63 for maximum rate and. 60 for average rate. Designers of milking machines may wish to account for differences between quarters in newer milking machines...|$|E
