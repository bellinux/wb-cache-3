40|$|In {{this paper}} the eect of the break <b>quantity</b> rule <b>on</b> the <b>inventory</b> costs in a 1 {warehouse, N{retailers {{distribution}} system is analyzed. The break quantity rule is to deliver large {{orders from the}} warehouse, and small orders from the nearest retailer, where a so{called break quantity determines whether an order is small or large. Under the assumptions that the stock at the warehouse can only be used to satisfy large orders, and that demand dur-ing the leadtimes is normally distributed, an expression for the inventory costs is derived. The objective {{of this paper is}} to provide insight into the eect of the break <b>quantity</b> rule <b>on</b> the <b>inventory</b> holding costs, and therefore we present extensive computational results, showing that in many cases the rule leads to a signicant cost reduction...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} analyzing the impact of joint decision policies on channel coordination in a system consisting of a supplier {{and a group of}} homogeneous buyers. The joint decision policy characterized by the unit selling price and the order quantity is coordinated through quantity discounts and franchise fees. Both the annual demand rate and the operating cost [...] -including the purchase, ordering, and inventory holding costs [...] -depend on the joint decision policy employed. This paper contributes by integrating work addressing <b>quantity</b> discounts <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> and ordering policies and work focusing on the control mechanism provided by quantity discounts in channel coordination. It is shown that the optimal all-unit quantity discount policy is equivalent to the optimal incremental quantity discount policy in achieving channel coordination. Furthermore, it is shown that quantity discounts alone are not sufficient to guarantee joint profit maximization. The analyses of the general models are illustrated by specific analytical results obtained for a given demand function. production/inventory, policies, pricing, deterministic models, marketing, pricing, price-sensitivity, purchasing...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the loss-averse retailer’s ordering policies for perishable product with customer returns. With {{the introduction of}} the segmental loss utility function, we depict the retailer’s loss aversion decision bias and establish the loss-averse retailer’s ordering policy model. We derive that the loss-averse retailer’s optimal order quantity with customer returns exists and is unique. By comparison, we obtain that both the risk-neutral and the loss-averse retailer’s optimal order <b>quantities</b> depend <b>on</b> the <b>inventory</b> holding cost and the marginal shortage cost. Through the sensitivity analysis, we also discuss the effect of loss-averse coefficient and the ratio of return on the loss-averse retailer’s optimal order quantity with customer returns...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} - The paper explores and {{describes}} the impact of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy within a production and assembly plant, and proposes a model for assessing {{the impact of the}} technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - The empirical investigation, based on case study research, focuses on an RFID implementation at a supplier of injection-moulded, surface-treated plastic to the automotive industry. This implementation {{is one of the few}} item-level, open-loop RFID implementations in the automotive industry. Findings - The empirical study provides insights into how inventory accuracy has been improved and made attainable in practice by implementing RFID, and indicates that the technology ensures inventory inaccuracy will be kept at minimum. As a result, an analytical model is presented which identifies the impact of RFID technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Research limitations/implications - The case study and context need to be considered when generalising upon the findings. Furthermore, it is hoped future research could further develop the model presented and test it against implementation practice. Practical implications - RFID technology provides practitioners with the opportunity to eliminate waste, and improve production and assembly performance. The research provides practitioners with experience of, and insights into how a production and assembly plant has improved inventory accuracy by implementing RFID technology. In particular, practitioners are provided with a model which enables them to assess the impact of RFID <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy. Original/value of paper - This paper contributes to the RFID community by providing empirical insights into the impact of RFID technology <b>on</b> <b>inventory</b> accuracy, but also more broadly into logistics and operations management research...|$|R
