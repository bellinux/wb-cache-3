40|$|Ceramic nano-pigments {{have been}} {{recently}} developed for ink-jet printing decoration of ceramic tiles by the <b>quadrichromy</b> technology (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colours). The colouring mechanisms {{and performance of}} these nano-pigments (CoAl 2 O 4, Au, (Ti,Cr,Sb) O 2, CoFe 2 O 4) were investigated by DRS, XRD and colourimetry. Nano-pigments were dispersed in several ceramic glazes and glassy coatings and their colour performance {{compared with that of}} conventional micro-pigments. Each nano-pigment is characterized by its own colour mechanism and chemico-physical stability in ceramic applications. Intense colours are achievable, besides the very small particle size of pigments (1200 ?C) due to particle growth (e. g. Au) or dissolution in the glassy phase (e. g. titania) ...|$|E
