40|$|The subject {{developed}} in my thesis {{relates to the}} "Exclusions from prohibition of quantitative restrictions". The origin of these exclusions {{can be found in}} the internal market law and more precisely in the free movement of goods. The free movement of goods is one of the four fundamental freedoms on which is based the internal market of the European Union. The free movement of goods is ensured by removing fiscal and non-fiscal barriers that hinder trade between Member States and which are prohibited between Member States. The fiscal barriers involve the prohibition between Member States of customs duties, all charges having equivalent effect and other fiscal barriers such as internal taxations. The non fiscal barriers involve direct <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> which are quotas and bans, as well as measures having equivalent effect to <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> (MEE). These non fiscal barriers are prohibited but they can be justified in some cases. Direct <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> almost disappeared while measures having equivalent effect to <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> may exist in various forms and variations. Measures having equivalent effect on imports are prohibited by the article 34 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU.

5000|$|The case {{concerned}} {{the sale of}} [...] "Cassis de Dijon" [...] (a type of crème de cassis) in Germany by an importer and retailer (Rewe). Crème de cassis is a blackcurrant liqueur produced in France containing 15% to 20% alcohol by volume. The German government had a law stipulating that products sold as fruit liqueur had to contain at least 25% alcohol by volume. Therefore, the Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein (a section of the German Federal Ministry of Finance) told Rewe that the Cassis de Dijon might be imported: on the other hand, it advised the importer that its marketing wasn't allowed in Germany. The importer argued that this represented an effect equivalent to a <b>quantitative</b> <b>restriction</b> on trade in breach of article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.|$|E

5000|$|Mexico {{brings the}} {{complaint}} through GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) dispute resolution system utilizing the WTO committee {{arguing that the}} US MMPA product ban on tuna imports was inconsistent with the provisions of GATT. Mexico argues through WTO panel dispute resolution mechanism that the import prohibition was inconsistent with Article XI, Article XIII, Article III of GATT. Mexico also claimed that the embargo {{did not meet the}} exceptions of Article XX. Article III refers to the National treatment provision and the fact that countries must apply tariffs equally to similar products of all other contracting parties. This also brings to debate the Product vs. process debate. Also known as PPM's (Process and Production Methods), referring to desire of some countries to regulate international trade on like for like goods {{on the basis of their}} process technologies or harvesting techniques in this case. Although the intention of the embargo is to bring to light the externalities of dolphin casualties due to the purse-seine harvesting techniques, the issue of PPMs is that the process is irrelevant if the product is the same. Developing countries have historically been wary of including PPM's in the WTO. The fear being that this will create an imposition of environmental, technological and other qualitative standards with high thresholds set by industrialized countries thus creating a technical disadvantage for developing countries. Essentially what Mexico argues is that MMPA is discriminating against like products based on their production methods. Article XI addresses the <b>quantitative</b> <b>restriction</b> provision which involves the dispute over embargoes vs. tariffs. Article XI says that a country is permitted to impose tariffs as a trade restriction but prohibits any type of non-tariff restriction such as quotas or limiting importing/ exporting licenses. Further, Mexico argues the Article XX provision of GATT is inconsistent with that of the MMPA. Specifically Article XX(b) and XX(g) which refer to the allowance of trade restrictions when it is deemed [...] "necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health" [...] or [...] "relating to the conservation of exhaustible natural resources". The issue with Article XX is that even while it may be valid, it cannot be applied outside the jurisdiction of the United States, hence making the argument in the favor of Mexico. The outcome of this challenge fell in the favor of Mexico however these findings were not adopted formally due to the upcoming NAFTA negotiations, however the argument was revisited in the Dolphin Tuna II case in 1992.|$|E

40|$|The {{popularity}} of mobile and networked applications {{has resulted in}} an increased demand for execution “sandboxes”—environments that impose irrevocable restrictions on resource usage. Existing approaches rely on kernel modification for enforcing <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> (e. g., limiting CPU utilization of an application to 25 %). However, the general applicability of such approaches is constrained by the difficulty of modifying shrink-wrapped operating systems such as Windows NT. This paper presents a user-level sandboxing approach for enforcing <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on resource usage of applications. Our approach actively monitors an application’s interactions with the underlying system, proactively controlling them to enforce the desired behavior. Our approach leverages a core set of user-level mechanisms that are available in most modern operating systems: fine-grained timers, monitoring infrastructure, debugger processes, priority-based scheduling, and pagebased memory protection. We describe implementation of a sandbox on Windows NT that imposes <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> on CPU, memory, and network usage. Our results show that application usage of system resources can be restricted to within 3 % of desired limits with minimal run-time overhead. ...|$|R

30|$|The nineties {{represent}} {{a paradigm shift}} in India’s economic policy making. The period witnessed significant changes in trade and industrial policies opening more avenues for private initiatives in the economy signaling {{a departure from the}} state-directed planned industrialization. The policy changes involved a concerted effort to integrate India {{with the rest of the}} world, by liberalizing trade, which could be classified into two broad groups: (a) those which were intended to reduce domestic distortions and (b) those intended to ease trade with the rest of the world. The rationale for import liberalisation by way of reduction in tariff rates and a movement away from the <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> was to bring cost reduction via lowering the prices of intermediate inputs and to enhance competitiveness of the final products. Controls via <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> which accounted for 90 per cent of items in the pre 1991 era, decreased dramatically to 51 per cent even as early as in 1994 – 95 (Joshi and Little, 1996). Along with this movement away from <b>quantitative</b> <b>restrictions</b> there were also substantial reductions in the tariff rate, from 77 per cent in 1989 – 90 to 29 per cent in 2005 – 06 (Kathuria et al., 2011).|$|R
