50|$|The shikimate pathway {{consists}} of seven enzymatic reactions by which phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate are converted to chorismate, the common precursor of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan.

Chorismate and several other intermediates of the pathway serve as precursors for a number of other metabolites, such as folates, <b>quinates,</b> and quinones. The four enzymes that precede shikimate kinase in the pathway are DAHP synthase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, and shikimate dehydrogenase, and the two that follow it are EPSP synthase and chorismate synthase. The shikimate pathway is not found in humans and other animals, which must obtain the aromatic amino acids from their food.|$|R

Plants treated with herbicides that inhibit amino acid biosynthesis (branched-chain and aromatic) accumulate <b>quinate</b> in their leaves. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate whether <b>quinate</b> mimics the effects of herbicides in plants. In pea plants, exogenous application of <b>quinate</b> through the nutrient solution was compared with leaf spraying at a concentration of 4 and 400 mM, respectively, and evaluated in parallel to the effects of herbicides. The analysis facilitated an assessment of the phytotoxicity and potential use of <b>quinate</b> as a natural herbicide. The application of <b>quinate</b> through the nutrient solution, but not the spray, was lethal, although both treatments affected plant growth. <b>Quinate</b> was absorbed and translocated to other plant organs remote from the application site, and an increase in the levels of aromatic amino acids and caffeic acid (that is, compounds located after <b>quinate</b> in the shikimate biosynthesis pathway) was detected, which indicates that <b>quinate</b> was metabolized and incorporated into the shikimate pathway. Exogenous application of <b>quinate</b> affected the carbohydrate content in the leaves and roots in a way similar to the toxic effects of herbicides. The phytotoxic effects of <b>quinate</b> reported in this study suggest that this compound deregulates the shikimate pathway and mimics some physiological effects described in the mode of action of herbicides inhibiting amino acid biosynthesis.

We characterized the dual-substrate quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (QSDH) from Corynebacterium glutamicum (CglQSDH) kinetically and revealed a clear substrate preference of CglQSDH for <b>quinate</b> compared with shikimate both at the pH optimum and in a physiological pH range, which is a remarkable contrast to closely related SDH/QDH enzymes.

40|$|The quinic acid ulitization (qut) pathway in Aspergillus nidulans is a {{dispensable}} carbon utilization pathway that catabolizes <b>quinate</b> to protocatechuate via dehydroquinate and dehydroshikimate(DHS). At {{the usual}} in vitro growth pH of 6. 5, <b>quinate</b> enters the mycelium {{by means of}} a specific permease and is converted into PCA by the sequential action of the enzymes <b>quinate</b> dehydrogenase, 3 -dehydroquinase and DHS dehydratase. The extent of control on metabolic flux exerted by the permease and the three pathway enzymes was investigated by applying the techniques of Metabolic Control Analysis. The flux control coefficients {{for each of the three}} <b>quinate</b> pathway enzymes were determined empirically, and the flux control coefficient of the <b>quinate</b> permease was inferred by use of the summation theorem. There measurements implied that, under the standard growth conditions used, the values for the flux control coefficients of the components of the <b>quinate</b> pathway were: <b>quinate</b> permease, 0. 43; <b>quinate</b> dehydrogenase, 0. 36; dehydroquinase, 0. 18; DHS dehydratase, < 0, 03. Attempts to partially decouple <b>quinate</b> permease from the control over flux by measuring flux at pH 3. 5 (when a significant percentage of the soluble <b>quinate</b> is protonated and able to enter the mycelium without the aid of a permease) led to an increase of approx. 50 % in the flux control coefficient for dehydroquinase. Taken together with the fact that A. nidulans has a very efficient pH homeostasis mechanism, these experiments are consistent with the view that <b>quinate</b> permease exerts a high degree of control over pathway flux under the standard laboratory growth conditions at pH 6. 5. The enzymes <b>quinate</b> dehydrogenase and 3 -dehydroquinase have previously been overproduced in Escherichia coli, and protocols for their purification published. The remaining qut pathway enzyme DHS dehydratase was overproduced in E. coli and a purification protocol established. The purified DHS dehydratase was shown to have a K(m) of 530 microM for its substrate DHS and a requirement for bivalent metal cations that could be fulfilled by Mg(2 +), Mn(2 +) or Zn(2 +). All three qut pathway enzymes were purified in bulk and their elasticity coefficients with respect to the three <b>quinate</b> pathway intermediates were derived over a range of concentrations in a core tricine/NaOH buffer, augmented with necessary cofactors and bivalent cations as appropriate. Using these empirically determined relative values, in conjunction with the connectivity theorem, the relative ratios of the flux control coefficients for the various <b>quinate</b> pathway enzymes, and how this control shifts between them, was determined over a range of possible metabolic concentrations. These calculations, although clearly subject to caveates about the relationswhip between kinetic measurements in vitro and the situation in vivo, were able to successfully predict the hiearchy of control observed under the standard laboratory growth conditions. The calculations imply that the hierarchy of control exerted by the <b>quinate</b> pathway enzymes is stable and relatively insensitive to changing metabolite concentrations in the ranges most likely to correspond to those found in vivo. The effects of substituting the type I 3 -dehydroquinases from Salmonella typhi and the A. nidulans AROM protein (a pentadomain protein catalysing the conversion of 3 -deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonic acid 7 -phosphate into 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate), and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis type II 3 -dehydroquinase, in the <b>quinate</b> pathway were investigated and found to have an effect.

40|$|The shikimate pathway is a {{metabolic}} {{route for}} the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (AAAs) (i. e. phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan). A key enzyme of shikimate pathway (5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase, EPSPS) {{is the target}} of the widely used herbicide glyphosate. <b>Quinate</b> is a compound synthesized in plants through a side branch of the shikimate pathway. Glyphosate provokes <b>quinate</b> accumulation and exogenous <b>quinate</b> application to plants shows a potential role of <b>quinate</b> in the toxicity of the herbicide glyphosate. Based on this, we hypothesized that the role of <b>quinate</b> accumulation in the toxicity of the glyphosate would be mediated by a deregulation of the shikimate pathway. In this study the effect of the glyphosate and of the exogenous <b>quinate</b> was evaluated in roots of pea plants by analyzing the time course of a full metabolic map of several metabolites of shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways. Glyphosate application induced an increase of the 3 -deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate- 7 -phosphate synthase (DAHPS, first enzyme of the shikimate pathway) protein and accumulation of metabolites upstream of the enzyme EPSPS. No common effects on the metabolites and regulation of shikimate pathway were detected between <b>quinate</b> and glyphosate treatments, supporting that the importance of <b>quinate</b> in the mode of action of glyphosate is not mediated by a common alteration of the regulation of the shikimate pathway.

40|$|To date, three {{different}} functional classes of bacterial shikimate/quinate dehydrogenases {{have been identified}} and {{are referred to as}} AroE, SDH-L and YdiB. The enzyme AroE and the catalytically much slower SDH-L clearly prefer NADP+/NADPH as the cosubstrate and are specific for (dehydro-) shikimate, whereas in YdiB the differences in affinity for NADP+/NADPH versus NAD+/NADH as well as for (dehydro-) shikimate versus (dehydro-) <b>quinate</b> are marginal. These three subclasses have a similar three-dimensional fold and hence all belong to the same structural class of proteins. In this paper, the crystal structure of an enzyme from Corynebacterium glutamicum is presented that clearly prefers NAD+ as a cosubstrate and that demonstrates a higher catalytic efficiency for <b>quinate</b> rather than shikimate. While the kinetic constants for this enzyme clearly differ from those reported for AroE, SDH-L and YdiB, the three-dimensional structure of this protein is similar to members of these three subclasses. Thus, the enzyme described here belongs to a new functional class of the shikimate/quinate dehydrogenase family. The different substrate and cosubstrate specificities of this enzyme relative to all other known bacterial shikimate/quinate dehydrogenases are discussed by means of analyzing the crystal structure and derived models. It is proposed that in contrast to shikimate, <b>quinate</b> forms a hydrogen bond to the NAD+. In addition, it is suggested that the hydroxyl group of a conserved active-site threonine hydrogen bonds to <b>quinate</b> more effectively than to shikimate. Also, the hydroxyl group of a conserved tyrosine approaches the carboxylate group of <b>quinate</b> more closely than it does the carboxylate group of shikimate. Taken together, these factors most likely lead to a lower Michaelis constant and therefore to a higher catalytic efficiency for <b>quinate.</b> The active site of the dehydrogenase reported here is larger than those of other known shikimate/quinate dehydrogenases, which may explain why <b>quinate</b> is easily accommodated within the catalytic cleft...|$|E

On the chromosome of C. glutamicum, the qsuD gene is located in a gene cluster also containing qsuA, qsuB, and qsuC genes, which are probably involved in the quinate/shikimate utilization pathway to form protocatechuate. Reverse transcriptase PCR analyses revealed that the expression of the qsuABCD genes was markedly induced during growth with either <b>quinate</b> or shikimate relative to expression during growth with glucose. The induction level by shikimate was significantly decreased by the disruption of qsuR, which is located immediately upstream of qsuA in the opposite direction and encodes a LysR-type transcriptional regulator, suggesting that QsuR acts as an activator of the qsuABCD genes.

Slow-growing B. japonicum I- 110 demonstrated positive chemotaxis to shikimate, <b>quinate,</b> protocatechuate, and vanillate; threshold concentrations for the compounds were as low as 10 (- 6) M.

40|$|VanK is {{the fourth}} member of the {{ubiquitous}} major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins to be identified that, together with PcaK, BenK, and MucK, contributes to aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP 1. VanK and PcaK have overlapping specificity for p-hydroxybenzoate and, most clearly, for protocatechuate: inactivation of both proteins severely impairs growth with protocatechuate, and the activity of either protein alone can mask the phenotype associated with inactivation of its homolog. Furthermore, vanK pcaK double-knockout mutants appear completely unable to grow in liquid culture with the hydroaromatic compound <b>quinate,</b> although such cells on plates convert <b>quinate</b> to protocatechuate, which then accumulates extracellularly and is readily visible as purple staining. This provides genetic evidence that <b>quinate</b> is converted to protocatechuate in the periplasm and {{is in line with}} the early argument that <b>quinate</b> catabolism should be physically separated from aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the cytoplasm so as to avoid potential competition for intermediates common to both pathways. Previous studies of aromatic catabolism in Acinetobacter have taken advantage of the ability to select directly strains that contain a spontaneous mutation blocking the β-ketoadipate pathway and preventing the toxic accumulation of carboxymuconate. By using this procedure, strains with a mutation in structural or regulatory genes blocking degradation of vanillate, p-hydroxybenzoate, or protocatechuate were selected. In this study, the overlapping specificity of the VanK and PcaK permeases was exploited to directly select strains with a mutation in either vanK or pcaK. Spontaneous mutations identified in vanK include a hot spot for frameshift mutation due to contraction of a G 6 mononucleotide repeat as well as point mutations producing amino acid substitutions useful for analysis of VanK structure and function. Preliminary second-site suppression analysis using transformation-facilitated PCR mutagenesis in one VanK mutant gave results similar to those using LacY, the prototypic member of the major facilitator superfamily, consistent with the two proteins having a similar mechanism of action.

30|$|Antioxidants {{represented}} a broad class of compounds available {{from many different}} foodstuffs (Carlsen et al. 2010). Rice bran is a promising candidate for dietary supplementation and nutritional therapy for prevention of chronic and infectious disease via its antioxidant composition. A majority of the rice bran antioxidants (e.g. 4 -guanidinobutanoate and taurine from amino acids, tocopherols and tocotrienols from cofactors & vitamins, and ergothioneine and <b>quinate</b> from secondarymetabolites) work through different mechanisms to combat lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, protein modification, and enzyme inactivation caused by free radicals, in particular reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Lü et al. 2010; Nimse and Pal, 2015). Oxidative stress caused by free radicals damages host cells and may initiate early stage development of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, cataracts, diabetes, and kidney disease (Morales-González, 2013). Antioxidants from rice bran can safely interact with and detoxify free radicals to stop the chain of damaging reactions for disease prevention (Iqbal et al. 2005; Jun et al. 2012; Parrado et al. 2006; Parrado et al. 2003). For example, <b>quinate,</b> an antioxidant that is naturally synthesized in plants and microorganisms is now described from rice bran via metabolomics (Fig.  4). It was shown that consumption of 3000 milligrams of quinic acid ammonium chelate per day can regulate activation of NF-kB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) and enhances DNA repair by increasing serum thiol levels (Pero et al. 2009). Rice bran derived <b>quinate</b> merits further evaluation for similar antioxidant activities.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{analysis}} of 16 recessive pca mutants in Aspergillus niduluns deficient in the metabolism of protocatechuic acid (PCA) has revealed seven functional genes. The seven gene loci are distributed over three chromosomes: pcaA, pcaC and pcaD on linkage group 11; pcaE, pcaF and pcaC on group V, and pcaB on group VIII, where it shows linkage (recombination frequency (RF) = 6. 9 %) to the qut gene cluster controlling {{the degradation of}} quinic acid to PCA. Only two of the pca gene loci are closely linked: pcaE and pcoC (RF = 043 %). The properties of the 4 uz and pca mutants clearly demonstrate the separate identity and regulation of the converging pathways from <b>quinate</b> or benzoate to PCA, which in tun is oxidatively degraded through P-ketoadipate to TCA intermediates. Similarly, the mutants are not affected in the metabolism of salicylate to catechol and its oxidation to P-ketoadipate, although two genes (pcaA and pcaF) are required for the further metabolism of P-ketoadipate. Catechol dioxygenase is induced by growth {{in the presence of}} salicylate, and PCA dioxygenase by benzoate or <b>quinate.</b> Three groups of pca mutants (pcaB, pcaD and pcaE) are deficient in the induction of PCA oxygenase and accumulate PCA when grown in the presence of <b>quinate</b> or benzoate. All three pcaE mutants and the single pcaA strain totally lack PCA oxygenase activity, while a single pcaB mutant strain has properties tentatively suggesting a positive role in the induction of the PCA pathway...|$|E
