50|$|For a cube of size :Every cube move can be {{considered}} as a permutation. The relationship between the cube state after a move with that before a move can be expressed mathematically using Group Theory to quantify permutations. Since every move can {{be considered}} as a sequence of <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> rotations, it is appropriate to examine what is involved in a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> rotation. Except for the absolute centre cubie for odd size cubes, during the <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> the cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories (also referred to as a 4-cycle movement since four <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> will restore the cubies in the specified trajectory to their original positions). A <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> of a 4-cubie set can be represented by three swaps as indicated below where swap 1-2 means the contents of cubicle 1 is swapped with the contents of cubicle 2, etc.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, the {{rotation}} group is nonabelian. That is, {{the order in}} which rotations are composed makes a difference. For example, a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> around the positive x-axis followed by a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> around the positive y-axis is a different rotation than the one obtained by first rotating around y and then x.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> from prone compared with supine and prone positioning in maintaining respiratory function in premature infants managed in a neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: The study was a prospective, randomised, cross-over trial with concealed allocation and intention to treat analysis. Fifty-four infants ? 32 weeks gestation were randomly allocated to the order of the positions supine, prone and <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> from prone. Distribution of ventilation was assessed by measurement of regional impedance amplitude, global inhomogeneity index and phase angle analysis using electrical impedance tomography 30 min after each position change. Physiological characteristics of heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation and inspired oxygen were also measured. Results: There was a significant difference between positions for RR with the RR in <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> from prone significantly lower than for supine (mean difference 6. 53 breaths/min; 2. 04 - 11. 02), but not compared with the prone position. No significant differences between positions were found for any of the other outcomes measured. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> from prone had an immediate positive positional effect on the RR of premature infants. The position of <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> from prone was comparable with prone in the maintenance of lung function and had a superior effect over supine on RR. These findings support the view that a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> from prone can be confidently used in neonatal nurseries to manage premature infants...|$|R

Geographical terminology is convenient to describe the embeddings. We study shortest segments of the embedded curve with no clockwise <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> (bays) and a prescribed number of anti clockwise <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> (headlands). We also study embeddings which either maximise or minimise the number of <b>quarter</b> <b>turns.</b> Enumerative questions related to these embeddings have recently been studied by Kwong and Rogers, as Hamiltonian cycles in grid graphs. ...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two common}} ways {{to measure the}} length of a {{solution}} to Rubik's Cube. The first is to count the number of <b>quarter</b> <b>turns.</b> The second is to count the number of outer-layer twists, called [...] "face turns". A move to turn an outer layer two <b>quarter</b> (90°) <b>turns</b> in the same direction would be counted as two moves in the <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> metric (QTM), but as one turn in the face metric (FTM, or HTM [...] "Half Turn Metric", or OBTM [...] "Outer Block Turn Metric").|$|R

25|$|Marking the Rubik's Cube's centres {{increases}} its difficulty {{because this}} expands {{the set of}} distinguishable possible configurations. There are 46/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres, since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, {{there will always be}} an even number of centre squares requiring a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn.</b> Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3×1019) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×1022).|$|R
5000|$|A {{butterfly}} valve {{is from a}} family of valves called quarter-turn valves. In operation, the valve is fully open or closed when the disc is rotated a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn.</b> The [...] "butterfly" [...] is a metal disc mounted on a rod. When the valve is closed, the disc is turned so that it completely blocks off the passageway. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> so that it allows an almost unrestricted passage of the fluid. The valve may also be opened incrementally to throttle flow.|$|R
30|$|All palatal {{expanders}} (tooth-tissue supported, Haas type) were manufactured, cemented, and activated {{according to}} the following protocol: at initial activation, the appliances received two <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> (0.4  mm).

The subjects were seen at weekly intervals for approximately 3  weeks. When the desired overcorrection for each patient was achieved, the appliance was stabilized. Expansion was considered adequate when the occlusal aspect of the maxillary lingual cusp of upper first molars contacted the occlusal aspect of the facial cusp of the mandibular lower first molars. The expander was in situ during the expansion and stabilization period for a mean time of 7  months (range 5 – 9  months). After the removal of the expander, a loose, removable acrylic plate was placed within 48  h. Generally, each patient wore the acrylic plate for a variable amount of time (minimum 8  h/day).|$|R
50|$|This {{argument}} was not improved upon for many years. Also, {{it is not}} a constructive proof: it does not exhibit a concrete position that needs this many moves. It was conjectured that the so-called superflip would be a position that is very difficult. A Rubik's Cube is in the superflip pattern when each corner piece is in the correct position, but each edge piece is incorrectly oriented. In 1992, a solution for the superflip with 20 face turns was found by Dik T. Winter, of which the minimality was shown in 1995 by Michael Reid, providing a new lower bound for the diameter of the cube group. Also in 1995, a solution for superflip in 24 <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> was found by Michael Reid, with its minimality proven by Jerry Bryan. In 1998, a new position requiring more than 24 <b>quarter</b> <b>turns</b> to solve was found. The position, which was called a 'superflip composed with four spot' needs 26 <b>quarter</b> <b>turns.</b>|$|R

50|$|The parity of a {{permutation}} {{refers to}} whether that permutation is even or odd. An even permutation {{is one that}} can be represented by an even number of swaps while an odd permutation is {{one that can be}} represented by an odd number of swaps. An odd permutation followed by an odd permutation will represent an overall even permutation (adding two odd numbers always returns an even number). Since a <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> is made up of a number of 4-cycles each involving three swaps, if the number of 4-cycles is odd, overall parity of the <b>quarter</b> <b>turn</b> permutation will be odd and vice versa.|$|R
