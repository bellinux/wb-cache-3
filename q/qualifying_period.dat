5|$|In {{the first}} three years of the awards, actresses were {{nominated}} as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award. However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into threeparts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 16th or lower were eliminated. The second <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> lasted for 15minutes, {{at the end of}} which the fastest ten cars went into the final period, to determine their grid positions for the race. Cars failing to make the final period were allowed to be refuelled before the race but those competing in it were not, and so carried more fuel than they had done in the earlier qualifying sessions.|$|E

However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots. The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film. Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.|$|E

5|$|The second <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> {{was fifteen}} minutes in length, {{and was used}} to set {{positions}} eleven through to sixteen. It was once again topped by Nico Rosberg, {{who was the first}} person to set a time under 1:43.000 all weekend. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton locked his brakes on the approach to turn 7, damaging his race tyres. Hamilton narrowly avoided elimination, setting a time good enough to proceed on his last attempt. Romain Grosjean was eliminated in eleventh, having overcome issues with his brake balance. Nico Hülkenberg was a surprise elimination in twelfth, having run consistently at the front of the field throughout the weekend. His elimination was attributed to a miscommunication between himself and his engineer over the amount of fuel he had on board. Carlos Sainz Jr. and Fernando Alonso finished thirteenth and fourteenth to fill the seventh row of the grid, ahead of Gutiérrez.|$|E
5|$|Friday afternoon's {{qualifying}} session ran for 30-minutes. Qualifying {{was divided}} into two groups of thirteen cars, with the odd numbered vehicles in Group A and the even numbered cars in Group B. The drivers' fastest lap times determined the starting order for the first race. The driver who won the pole position was awarded four points that went towards the Drivers' and Teams' Championship races. Light rain fell as the session started with some drivers electing to equip the super soft tyres to their cars while other competitors chose to utilise wet-weather compounds. Rossi clinched the second pole position of his GP2 Series career with a time of one minute and 37.019 seconds. The achievement ended Vandoorne's run of consecutive pole positions which started at the 2014 Spa-Francorchamps round. He was joined on the grid's front row by Marciello who was three-tenths of a second off Rossi's pace and had the pole until the latter's lap. Marciello pushed hard and narrowly avoided losing control of his car at Massenet's barriers. Pic qualified third and Vandoorne was fourth. Sergey Sirotkin improved his lap time late in the <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> to start from fifth place. He shared the third row with Julián Leal who was ahead of Nick Yelloly and Jordan King. Canamasas and de Jong completed the top ten qualifiers; de Jong slid into the Mirabeau barrier in the closing minutes of qualifying.|$|E

30|$|Overall, {{seasonal}} {{workers in}} France are, under certain conditions, eligible for both unemployment and retirement pensions upon {{the same conditions}} as French nationals. On {{the face of it}} France and Germany seem to restrict the social security rights of seasonal workers less than their Pacific counterparts. However, foreign seasonal workers in Germany are often obliged to contribute to the unemployment and retirement scheme without being able to meet the <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> to access these services. The situation is different in France as seasonal workers enjoy total equality with French nationals {{and at the same time}} are able to meet the <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> to access these services. However contributions are mandatory without the possibility to opt out.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to bring}} an {{appreciation}} of legal form, technicalities, and legislative drafting to growing interdisciplinary literatures on time and governance. Scholarship across politics, geography, science studies and anthropology continues to trace the productive force and specific qualities of diverse temporal horizons. At the same time socio-legal scholars increasingly focus {{on the work of}} making and negotiating law, engaging with the dogged, everyday work of legal experts and bureaucrats. Yet little attention has been paid, to date, to the work of legislative drafters. This paper follows the ‘legal lives’ of <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> on family-friendly employment rights. As examples of legal technicalities that work with time, <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> form {{an important part of the}} regulatory structure that separates precarious workers from ‘regular’ employees in UK law. Drawing on documentary research and interviews with policy experts, union activists and legislative drafters, this paper focuses on the formal qualities of <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods,</b> arguing that these legal technicalities conjure time and legal form as inextricable. Whenever law becomes relevant to conversations about time and governance, we could usefully pay attention to the idiosyncrasies and controversies occupying legal form and legislative drafting...|$|R
25|$|Pietersen is {{eligible}} {{to play for}} England as he has an English mother. After a <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> of four years playing at English county level, he was called up almost immediately for his international debut against Zimbabwe in 2004.|$|E
25|$|The {{qualifying}} format was {{adjusted to}} allow drivers {{more time to}} complete flying laps in Q3. The final <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> was extended to twelve minutes in length, with Q1 scaled back to eighteen minutes to keep the entire session within one hour.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{incident}} {{occurred at the}} Hungarian GP, a suspension spring came off Barrichello's car during the third <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> and struck Felipe Massa's helmet that left the Ferrari driver briefly unconscious as he crashed head-on into a tyre barrier, sustaining a serious head injury.|$|E

30|$|An optimum {{level of}} social {{security}} rights consequently ensures equal treatment with nationals {{in the area of}} work-related rights. However, the contributions for social security benefits should be either made optional or the <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> for seasonal workers should be shortened, enabling them to benefit from these services.|$|R
25|$|Certain special {{conditions}} also applied governing the award of the Atlantic Star for those Naval personnel who had entered {{service in the}} qualifying sea area {{less than six months}} {{before the end of the}} <b>qualifying</b> <b>period,</b> provided it was the last operational theatre in which they served.|$|E
25|$|The <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> {{was reduced}} to fifteen years with effect from 1 December 1977.

25|$|When it {{was instituted}} in 1848, the medal could be awarded after 21 years of {{unblemished}} service.

The time served requirement was finally reduced to fifteen years with effect from 1 December 1977.|$|E
50|$|Many {{people are}} still {{reluctant}} to draft a proper will, or make bad ones which later prove invalid, or can easily be contested.

30|$|In {{this context}} {{unemployment}} and retirement schemes seem to either create an unprofitable financial burden for seasonal workers or are simply unnecessary or not applicable for them. In consequence, {{a model of}} best practice should enable migrants to meet the <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> in order to profit from social security rights, make the contributions optional, or create different ways of social security protection, for example through separate insurance coverage.|$|R
50|$|The {{operational}} area {{was defined as}} being divided into two zones - Zone 1 (Iraq and Kuwait) and Zone 2 (elsewhere within the Gulf region). <b>Qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> of service varied depending on {{the area in which}} personnel were based. The medal was awarded with the clasp 19 Mar to 28 Apr 2003 to those who participated in combat operations in Iraq; those who served before the invasion, or who served in its aftermath, were recognised by the award of the medal alone.|$|R
25|$|The medal was {{originally}} awarded to soldiers of good conduct who had completed 21 {{years of service}} in the infantry or 24 years in the cavalry. From 1870, the <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> was reduced and the medal was awarded to soldiers of good conduct who had completed 18 years of service.|$|E
25|$|From 1949, the {{required}} period of qualifying service {{was reduced to}} a minimum twelve years of commissioned service in the Territorial Force and the Auxiliary forces of the Commonwealth. In respect of officers whose service terminated before 3 September 1939, the <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> of commissioned service remained twenty years.|$|E
25|$|The medal {{could be}} awarded to {{part-time}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve ratings after {{twelve years of}} efficient service, not necessarily continuous.

The clasp to the medal could be awarded for a second twelve-year <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> of service.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decoration}} {{is awarded}} to officers and non-commissioned {{members of the}} Regular and Reserve forces, including honorary appointments within the Canadian Armed Forces. However, time served while on the Supplementary Reserve List does not apply.

50|$|As with Malaysian {{personnel}}, awards {{may also}} be made to those whose service was cut short {{as a result of}} death or injury as a result of service in these areas. Those personnel who served in an indirect or support role must have served at least six months during the <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> of service. The start date for the medal is 31 August 1957, the date of Malaysia's independence. The cut-off date for service in Singapore is shorter due to Singapore's independence from the Federation of Malaysia on 9 August 1965.|$|R

25|$|For persons {{normally}} {{resident in}} the United Kingdom, the requirement was 1,080 days (three years) {{of service in}} the United Kingdom or 90 days (three months) of service in a Mine and Bomb Disposal Unit.

25|$|The Volunteer Long Service Medal {{was instituted}} in 1894 as {{an award for}} long service by other ranks in the {{part-time}} Volunteer Force of the United Kingdom, {{as well as to}} officers who had served in the ranks but who had not qualified for the award of the Volunteer Officers' Decoration. The <b>qualifying</b> <b>period</b> of service was twenty years.|$|E
30|$|Access {{to social}} {{security}} protection is important for migrants {{in order to reduce}} their vulnerability. As they move between countries and labour markets special provisions in the social security system should ensure that migrants can adequately manage their risks (Sabates-Wheeler, 2009 : 3). Thus seasonal workers are particularly interested in being able to access social security rights without long <b>qualifying</b> <b>periods</b> and also in keeping the overall cost for social security low (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, International Organization for Migration, and International Labour Office 2006 : 154, 157).|$|R
