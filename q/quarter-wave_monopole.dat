5000|$|Small antennas {{around one}} {{wavelength}} in size, such as <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopoles</b> and half-wave dipoles, don't have much directivity (gain); they are omnidirectional antennas which radiate radio waves {{over a wide}} angle. To create a high gain antenna, which radiates radio waves in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used. One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic reflectors, horns or dielectric lenses which change {{the direction of the}} radio waves by reflection or refraction, to focus the radio waves from a single low gain antenna into a beam. This type is called an aperture antenna.|$|R

A factor of 4 decrease in both the real and imaginary parts of the mutual coupling is observed when considering a poor ground versus a perfectly conducting one, for <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopoles</b> in receiving mode.

5000|$|Although the {{official}} ITU definition of extremely low frequencies is 3 Hz to 30 Hz, the wider band of frequencies of 3 Hz to 3 kHz with corresponding wavelengths from 100,000 km to 100 km. {{is used for}} ELF communication and are commonly called ELF waves. [...] The frequency used in the U.S. and Russian transmitters, about 80 Hz, generates waves 3750 km (2300 miles) long, roughly {{one quarter of the}} Earth's diameter. ELF waves have been used in very few manmade communications systems because of the difficulty of building efficient antennas for such long waves. Ordinary types of antenna (half-wave dipoles and <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopoles)</b> cannot be built for such extremely long waves because of their size. A half wave dipole for 80 Hz would be 1162 miles long. So even the largest practical antennas for ELF frequencies are very electrically short, very much smaller than the wavelength of the waves they radiate. [...] The disadvantage of this is that the efficiency of an antenna drops as its size is reduced below a wavelength. [...] An antenna's radiation resistance, and the amount of power it radiates, is proportional to (L/λ)2 where L is its length and λ is the wavelength. So even physically large ELF antennas have very small radiation resistance, and so radiate {{only a tiny fraction of}} the input power as ELF waves; most of the power applied to them is dissipated as heat in various ohmic resistances in the antenna. [...] ELF antennas must be tens to hundreds of kilometers long, and must be driven by powerful transmitters in the megawatt range, to produce even a few watts of ELF radiation. Fortunately, the attenuation of ELF waves with distance is so low (1 - 2 dB per 1000 km) that a few watts of radiated power is enough to communicate worldwide.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper investigates a {{miniaturized}} resonant antenna that comprises a meandered monopole and {{a partial}} ground plane. A bandwidth enhancement is found using the ground plane {{on the back}} side of the circuit board where the entire communication system resides. The meandered monopole together with the ground plane forms a wideband dipole antenna. The design shows over 25 % 10 dB impedance bandwidth at 2. 5 GHz ISM band with a monopole area of 300 mils by 166 mils on a small circuit board and a backside ground plane 1500 mils by 600 mils. The wire length is about one third and the Q factor is about twice as compared against the case of using a straight <b>quarter-wave</b> microstrip <b>monopole.</b> The antenna Q factor as a function of the ground plane area is characterized. The use of circuit ground as a part of an antenna should find useful applications in portable wireless systems. Good agreements are found between simulated and measured antenna gain patterns and return loss. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} form is the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole</b> which is one-quarter of a {{wavelength}} long and has a gain of 5.12 dBi when mounted over a ground plane. Monopoles have an omnidirectional radiation pattern, so they are used for broad coverage of an area, and have vertical polarization. The ground waves used for broadcasting at low frequencies must be vertically polarized, so large vertical monopole antennas are used for broadcasting in the MF, LF, and VLF bands. Small monopoles are used as nondirectional antennas on portable radios in the HF, VHF, and UHF bands.|$|E
50|$|The {{monopole}} is a resonant antenna; the rod {{functions as}} an open resonator for radio waves, oscillating with standing waves of {{voltage and current}} along its length. Therefore, {{the length of the}} antenna is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves it is used with. The most common form is the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole,</b> in which the antenna is approximately ¼ of the wavelength of the radio waves. The monopole antenna was invented in 1895 by radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi; for this reason it is sometimes called the Marconi antenna. Common types of monopole antenna are the whip, rubber ducky, helical, random wire, umbrella, inverted-L and T-antenna, inverted-F, mast radiator, and ground plane antennas.|$|E
5000|$|The inverted-F antenna is an {{evolution}} of the basic <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole</b> antenna. The wire F-type antenna was invented in the 1940s.

50|$|The {{length of}} an antenna {{is related to}} the length of the radio waves used. The UHF antenna is stubby and short; at UHF {{frequencies}} a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole,</b> the most common omnidirectional antenna is between 2.5 and 25 cm long. UHF wavelengths are short enough that efficient transmitting antennas are small enough to mount on handheld and mobile devices, so these frequencies are used for two way land mobile radio systems, such as walkie-talkies, two way radios in vehicles, and for portable wireless devices; cordless phones and cell phones. Omnidirectional UHF antennas used on mobile devices are usually short whips, sleeve dipoles, rubber ducky antennas or the planar inverted F antenna (PIFA) used in cellphones. Higher gain omnidirectional UHF antennas can be made of collinear arrays of dipoles and are used for mobile base stations and cellular base station antennas.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{circumference}} of the helix is significantly less than a wavelength and its pitch (axial distance between successive turns) is significantly {{less than a quarter}} wavelength, the antenna is called a normal-mode helix. The antenna acts similar to a monopole antenna, with an omnidirectional radiation pattern, radiating equal power in all directions perpendicular to the antenna's axis. However, because of the inductance added by the helical shape, the antenna acts like a inductively loaded monopole; at its resonant frequency it is shorter than a quarter-wavelength long. Therefore, normal-mode helices can be used as electrically short monopoles, an alternative to center- or base-loaded whip antennas, in applications where a full sized <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole</b> would be too big. As with other electrically short antennas, the gain, and thus the communication range, of the helix will be less than that of a full sized antenna. Their compact size makes [...] "helicals" [...] useful as antennas for mobile and portable communications equipment on the HF, VHF, and UHF bands.|$|E
5000|$|A {{horn antenna}} {{is used to}} {{transmit}} radio waves from a waveguide (a metal pipe used to carry radio waves) out into space, or collect radio waves into a waveguide for reception. It typically consists of a short length of rectangular or cylindrical metal tube (the waveguide), closed at one end, flaring into an open-ended conical or pyramidal shaped horn on the other end. [...] The radio waves are usually introduced into the waveguide by a coaxial cable attached to the side, with the central conductor projecting into the waveguide to form a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole</b> antenna. The waves then radiate out the horn end in a narrow beam. In some equipment the radio waves are conducted between the transmitter or receiver and the antenna by a waveguide; {{in this case the}} horn is attached {{to the end of the}} waveguide. In outdoor horns, such as the feed horns of satellite dishes, the open mouth of the horn is often covered by a plastic sheet transparent to radio waves, to exclude moisture.|$|E
50|$|They {{are used}} as {{transmitting}} antennas below 1 MHz, in the LF and particularly the VLF bands, at frequencies sufficiently low that it is impractical to build a full size <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole</b> antenna. Either the central mast itself, insulated from the ground, {{is connected to the}} transmitter and serves as the radiating element, or vertical wires parallel to the mast. At the low frequencies used the height of the mast is typically 1/10 to 1/40 of a wavelength, so it makes a very electrically short antenna, and by itself would have very low radiation resistance and be a very inefficient radiator. The function of the umbrella-wires is to add capacitance {{to the top of the}} antenna, improving the current distribution on the vertical mast radiator to increase the radiation resistance and radiated power. The umbrella wires serve as the plate of a capacitor, with the ground serving as the other plate, which is charged and discharged by the radio frequency current from the tramsmitter. Umbrella antennas with heights of 15 to 460 metres are in service. The tallest umbrella antennas are actually used by Lualualei VLF transmitter, INS Kattabomman and the CHAYKA-transmitters at Inta and Dudinka.|$|E
50|$|The {{arithmetic}} mean between 30 Ω and 77 Ω is 53.5 Ω; the geometric mean is 48 Ω. The selection of 50 Ω as {{a compromise between}} power-handling capability and attenuation is in general cited {{as the reason for}} the number. 50 Ω also works out tolerably well because it corresponds approximately to the drive impedance (ideally 36 ohms) of a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole,</b> mounted on a less than optimum ground plane such as a vehicle roof. The match is better at low frequencies, such as for CB Radio around 27 MHz, where the roof dimensions are much less than a quarter wavelength, and relatively poor at higher frequencies, VHF and UHF, where the roof dimensions may be several wavelengths. The match is at best poor, because the antenna drive impedance, due to the imperfect ground plane, is reactive rather than purely resistive, and so a 36 ohm coaxial cable would not match properly either. Installations which need exact matching will use some kind of matching circuit {{at the base of the}} antenna, or elsewhere, in conjunction with a carefully chosen (in terms of wavelength) length of coaxial, such that a proper match is achieved, which will be only over a fairly narrow frequency range.|$|E
50|$|A {{monopole}} can be visualized (right) {{as being}} formed by replacing {{the bottom half}} of a vertical dipole antenna (c) with a conducting plane (ground plane) at right-angles to the remaining half. If the ground plane is large enough, the radio waves from the remaining upper half of the dipole (a) reflected from the ground plane will seem to come from an image antenna (b) forming the missing half of the dipole, which adds to the direct radiation to form a dipole radiation pattern. So the pattern of a monopole with a perfectly conducting, infinite ground plane is identical to the top half of a dipole pattern, with its maximum radiation in the horizontal direction, perpendicular to the antenna. Because it radiates only into the space above the ground plane, or half the space of a dipole antenna, a monopole antenna will have a gain of twice (3 dB greater than) the gain of a similar dipole antenna, and a radiation resistance half that of a dipole. Since a half-wave dipole has a gain of 2.19 dBi and a radiation resistance of 73 ohms, a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>monopole,</b> the most common type, will have a gain of 2.19 + 3 = 5.19 dBi and a radiation resistance of about 36.8 ohms if it is mounted above a good ground plane.|$|E
