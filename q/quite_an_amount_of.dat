2500|$|Jardine, one {{of seven}} children, was born in 1784 on a small farm near Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, Scotland. [...] His father, Andrew Jardine (abt. 1750- d. 1793), {{died when he was}} nine, leaving the family in some {{economic}} difficulty. Though struggling to make ends meet, Jardine's older brother David (1776-1827) provided him with money to attend school. Jardine began to acquire credentials at the age of sixteen. In 1800 he entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School where he took classes in anatomy, medical practice, and obstetrics among others. While his schooling was in progress, Jardine was apprenticed to a surgeon who would provide housing, food, and the essential acquaintance with a hospital practice, with the money his older brother, David, provided. He graduated from the Edinburgh Medical School on 2 March 1802, and was presented a full diploma from the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. He chose to join the service of the British East India Company and in 1802 at the age of 18 boarded the East Indiaman Brunswick. On 15March, after satisfying the entry requirements, William Jardine, was paid two months advanced wages as a surgeon's mate in the East India Company’s Maritime Marine Service. One advantage of service with the East India Company was that employees were allowed to trade in goods on their own account. Each employee was allowed cargo space equivalent to two chests or about a hundred pounds of cargo. Jardine engaged in this trade with exceptional dexterity, even leasing the apportioned cargo space of other crew members who did not have interest in using the space, and was able to save <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> money.|$|E

To be legally defensible in the US, in particular for high-stakes assessments, and meet the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing, a cutscore cannot be arbitrarily determined; it must be empirically justified. For example, the organization cannot merely decide that the cutscore will be 70% correct. Instead, a study is conducted to determine what score best differentiates the classifications of examinees, such as competent vs. incompetent. Such studies require <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> resources, involving a number of professionals, in particular with psychometric background.

They have already attained <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> success with their three specials, which were each priced INR 100, in past years.

5000|$|Lloofbat/Aceps Gevoya/Splatnarnt/Mane Tath Storp - Four {{different}} games {{which involved}} unscrambling words {{associated with the}} theme, which was also scrambled.

This segment was produced by Janet Perlman. Splatnarnt (transplant), which was produced by Fred Garbers, involved a mad scientist and his female assistant creating a monster, as the viewers unscramble inner parts of the body. Mane Tath Storp (name that sport), which was produced by Bill Davis, appeared in game-show format, in which different contestants have a sport described to them. Both they, and the viewer, have to unscramble its name. After each segment, the voice-over summed up the previous action with the key words back in their scrambled states. Additionally, in the episodes in which they appeared, they were the final game of the show.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the legal}} rights of Ottoman women were {{relatively}} the same, {{the customs of}} marriage were slightly different. Marriage {{was a chance to}} change your status - [...] "For slave women, emancipation sealed by marriage could make the difference between impoverished freedom and entitled socioeconomic standing" [...] (Zilfi 162). There were two main possibilities when it came to slave marriages: they could be married off to another slave or to a free person for a price. However, no matter which happened, a slave is still a slave and that meant that [...] "any property that they acquired in marriage rebounded to the slave owner" [...] (Zilfi 162). Slave women could be sold, freed, and then married to their new master {{as in the case of}} Sehriban (Zilfi 167), who married a statesman named Ahmed Midhat Pasha. He paid <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> currency for her. This was apparently the way to be as [...] "harem-reared slave girls were molded into well-bred and indebted replicas of their wealthy and well-placed mistresses" [...] and, thus, well-trained wives (Zilfi 168).|$|E
5000|$|The sun emits an {{enormous}} amount of energy, which would be harmful to human beings if not for the vapours and gases in the atmosphere, like water (clouds), ozone, and others, through which the sunlight is filtered. In the figure it can clearly be seen that [...] "cold" [...] CO2 filters the solar radiation around 4.3 µm. An Infrared detector which uses this frequency is therefore solar blind. Not all manufacturers of flame detectors use sharp filters for the 4.3 µm radiation and thus still pick up <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> sunlight. These cheap flame detectors are hardly usable for outdoor applications. Between 0.7 µm and approx. 3 µm there is relatively large absorption of sunlight. Hence, this frequency range is used for flame detection by a few flame detector manufacturers (in combination with other sensors like ultraviolet, visible light, or near infrared). The big economical advantage is that detector windows can be made of quartz instead of expensive sapphire. These electro-optical sensor combinations also enable the detection of non-hydrocarbons like hydrogen fires without the risk of false alarms caused by artificial light or electrical welding.|$|E

5000|$|The band's {{first single}} [...] "Flight from Ashiya" [...] (b/w [...] "Holidaymaker") was {{released}} on 15 September 1967 by Fontana Records, a little earlier than the band's first album Tangerine Dream. The song was telling about an impending plane crash. The single got critical acclaim and <b>quite</b> <b>an</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> radio airplay but failed to reach the charts. Years later, the song has appeared on many compilation albums, including Nuggets II: Original Artyfacts from the British Empire and Beyond, 1964-1969, the second box set of the Nuggets series and Acid Drops, Spacedust & Flying Saucers: Psychedelic Confectionery. Two months later, Tangerine Dream - also produced by Dick Leahy - was released. The album included [...] "Flight From Ashiya", [...] "Please Excuse My Face" [...] and [...] "Dive into Yesterday" [...] which are now considered some of the band's best songs. Meanwhile the band were aired performing live on several BBC radio shows. A new single was released in 1968 called [...] "Jenny Artichoke" [...] (b/w [...] "Just How Much You Are") that was inspired by Donovan's, [...] "Jennifer Juniper". After the release the band traveled around Europe, and when in Netherlands supported Country Joe and the Fish at the Amsterdam Concert Hall. Faintly Blowing, again produced by Leahy, was released later, in 1969 by Fontana Records. This time the band's sound was heavier but the tracks still included psychedelic elements with notable lyrics but it failed to reach the charts. After the failure of Faintly Blowing, they released two more singles and, after a radio session in BBC Maida Vale Studios, the band took a new name to avoid confusion with the US group.|$|E
