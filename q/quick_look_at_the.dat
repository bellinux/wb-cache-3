25|$|The taskbar {{has seen}} the biggest visual changes, where the old Quick Launch toolbar has been {{replaced}} {{with the ability to}} pin applications to taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable Jump Lists to allow easy access to common tasks. The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the Show desktop icon. By default, hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> desktop. In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly (8 pixels) wider in order to accommodate being pressed by a finger. Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them.|$|E

She was dressed with an amount of care and a smartness of detail that seemed somewhat uncalled for on the Indian Ocean. A cruise on a P. and O. steamer is not a garden party. Her chair was most luxurious, and had her name painted on it, back and front, in very large letters, with undue obtrusiveness. I read it from where I sat, [...] "Lady Meadowcroft." ...|$|E

The darkness hid the expression upon Bridge's face, but his conviction that the girl was pretty was unaltered. The light of the match had revealed an oval face surrounded by dark, dishevelled tresses, red, full lips, and large, dark eyes.|$|E

Looking at the {{condition}} of both horses and the saddle and ropes, Lucy saw what a fight there had been, and a race! Where was the rider? Thrown, surely, and back on the trail, perhaps dead or maimed.|$|E

Reddy Fox gave one <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> foot of the old tree trunk and saw a gun pointed at him and behind the gun the freckled face of Farmer Brown's boy. Reddy Fox gave a little gasp of fright and turned so suddenly that he almost fell flat. Then he began to run as never in his life had he run before. It seemed as though his flying feet hardly touched the grass. His eyes were popping out with fright as with every jump he tried to run just a wee bit faster.|$|E

The curtain had risen again without his reappearing and without Nick's returning. Indeed by the time Nick slipped in {{a good deal of the}} third act was over; and even then, even when the curtain descended, Peter had not come back. Nick sat down in silence to watch the stage, to which the breathless attention of his companions seemed attached, though Biddy after a moment threw round at him a single <b>quick</b> <b>look.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the act they were all occupied with the recalls, the applause and the responsive loveliness of Juliet as she was led out--Mercutio had to give her up to Romeo--and even for a few minutes after the deafening roar had subsided nothing was said among the three.

40|$|Saturn's {{magnetosphere}} {{is often}} referred to as "intermediate between the cases of the Earth and Jupiter". Due to very limited measurements of Saturn's magnetosphere and auroral activity, however, it has never been clear in detail what this statement means. A recent campaign of HST STIS UV imaging of Saturn's aurora has been carried out over 8 - 30 Jan. 2004 concurrent with measurements of the approaching solar wind by Cassini. This imaging set is much more comprehensive than any earlier observations of Saturn's aurora, obtained at a time when Saturn's southern auroral oval is completely visible due to the large apparent tilt of Saturn. The data provide the opportunity to determine the mean distribution of the auroral emissions, the degree of corotation of any bright regions, any variations with local time of the emissions, the latitudinal motions of the main oval with time and location, and other parameters. In addition, each of these can be compared with the approaching solar wind conditions and Saturn's kilometric radiation (SKR) intensity from Cassini measurements. <b>Quick</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> data from HST and Cassini demonstrate that the measurements have been made successfully, and the coverage includes dramatic variations in Saturn's auroral activity as well as at least two solar wind shocks passing Cassini. This presentation will concentrate on the measured properties of Saturn's aurora in the context of comparisons with the magnetospheres of the Earth and Jupiter...|$|R

40|$|While {{quantitative}} analysis software eg. SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) {{have been in}} vogue amongst researchers for some time, qualitative analysis software has taken a lot longer to acquire an audience. However, the use of software {{for the purpose of}} qualitative analysis can provide tangible benefits. Appropriate software can shorten analysis timeframes, can provide more thorough and rigorous coding and interpretation, and provide researchers with enhanced data management. This chapter examines qualitative data analysis; illuminating some of the difficulties and moves to a discussion on the often contentious use of analytical software. Evidence within the chapter points to the clear advantages that qualitative data analysis software can provide users. One such product – QSR NVivo – is discussed with an expansion on the benefits that this product offers qualitative researchers. The reader is also taken by the hand for a brief practical overview of the program. The chapter concludes with a <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what <b>the</b> future has on offer for researchers contemplating the use of this software...|$|R
