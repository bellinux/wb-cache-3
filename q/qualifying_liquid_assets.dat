40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploration}} of the relationships among the firm's financial structure, its choice of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> holdings, and growth. We present a theoretical model of the firm where external finance is costly and where retaining earnings as <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> serves a precautionary motive. One of the predictions of this model is that a long-term reliance on high levels of debt finance tends to be associated with high levels of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> holding. We test this empirically by estimating the determinants of <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> holdings using panel data sets of Belgian and UK firms. We find evidence of a positive relation between leverage and <b>liquid</b> <b>asset</b> holding. This result leads us to identify a possible linkage from high debt to high liquidity to slow growth. In light of this we discuss the possible implications of the development of stock markets, private equity, and venture capital markets. ...|$|R

In this paper, we address this question, focusing on liquidity constraints and uninsurable idiosyncratic risk. We consider a search model where agents use <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> to smooth individual income shocks. We show that {{the response of}} this economy to aggregate shocks depends on the {{rate of return on}} <b>liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> In economies where <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> pay a low return, agents hold smaller liquid reserves and the response of the economy tends to be larger. In this case, agents expect to be liquidity constrained and, due to a self-insurance motive, their consumption decisions are more sensitive to changes in expected income. On the other hand, in economies where <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> pay a large return, agents hold larger reserves and their consumption decisions are more insulated from income uncertainty.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} how {{liquidity}} premia {{are affected by}} the supplies of various types of assets. Specifically, we examine how the supply of government debt affects the real interest rate and the liquidity premium in the economy. More importantly, we examine how the financial sector satisfies the demand for liquidity by transforming illiquid <b>assets</b> into <b>liquid</b> <b>assets,</b> and thereby how the private supply of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> is affected by the supply of government debt. We also show that a rise in uncertainty (i. e., risk premia) hampers the ability of financial institutions to provide <b>liquid</b> <b>assets,</b> and hence may lead to a contraction in the supply of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> in addition to a rise in the liquidity premium. Hence, this paper establishes a close connection between risk premia and liquidity premia. This feature arises naturally out of our model, and as well seems to be a reasonable characterization of current events. The end result is a general equilibrium model that endogenizes the supply of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> and their rate of return. Using quarterly U. S. data from 1950 to 2008, we show that central predictions of the model find strong support in the data. ...|$|R

We also find evidence that stock returns and trading volume for high-tech firms are higher with increases in <b>liquid</b> <b>assets,</b> although the volume reaction to increases in <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> is stronger than the return reaction, perhaps indicating clientele shifts.

40|$|Under Basel III rules, banks become {{subject to}} a {{liquidity}} coverage ratio (LCR) from 2015 onwards, to promote short-term resilience. We investigate the effects of such liquidity regulation on bank <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities. Results indicate co-integration of <b>liquid</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities, to maintain a minimum short-term liquidity buffer. Still, microprudential regulation has not prevented an aggregate liquidity cycle characterised by a pro-cyclical pattern {{in the size of}} balance sheets and risk taking. Our error correction regressions indicate that adjustment in the liquidity ratio is balanced towards the liability side, especially when the liquidity ratio is below its long-term equilibrium. This finding contrasts established wisdom that the LCR is mainly driven by changes in <b>liquid</b> <b>assets.</b> Policy implications focus on the need to complement microprudential regulation with a macroprudential approach.
