Testing practice has a critical place during the design, implementation and integration of software, hardware and complex systems composed of these. Cost of failures caused by bugs that could not be detected and fixed early in the process increase in a multiplicative way and adversely affect the overall projects costs. However, trying to do comprehensive tests generating correct outputs is also costly both time-wise and money-wise. Combinatorial Testing Techniques (CTT) have been a preferred method in software testing due to their <b>quantifiable</b> <b>case</b> coverage guarantees and appropriateness for automation. We observed that, Complex Event Processing (CEP) engines - commonly used today for real-time analysis over critical, high-volume signal processing applications (e. g. mobile communication, sensors, radar) - are NOT being systematically tested with approaches such as CTT. In this paper, we uniquely show applicability of CTT to CEP for fast creation of continuous query test suites and obtain promising results. TÜBİTAK; European Commissio...|$|E
40|$|The recent Federal Communications Commission rule {{making for}} low power FM radio {{has been widely}} {{reported}} as an instance where Congress sharply rebuked the Commission for enacting rules too favorable to entrants. Because rival policy optima are <b>quantifiable</b> in this <b>case,</b> the preferences of consumers, Congress and the Commission can be directly compared. While differences in policy preferences of Congress and the regulatory agency were visible to interest groups, they appear extremely modest {{when compared to the}} open entry (welfare maximizing) policy alternative. A financial event study reveals that incumbent broadcast station equity values were neither threatened by the Commission's low power FM rules, nor materially enhanced by their reversal in Congress. This lends empirical support to the Congressional Dominance view of regulation, and illustrates the margins on which blame- and credit-shifting strategies are utilized by policy makers. ...|$|R
40|$|The Federal Communications Commission rule {{making for}} low power FM radio was widely {{reported}} as an instance where Congress sharply rebuked a regulatory agency for enacting rules too favorable to entrants. Theories of bureaucratic control generally agree that when such events occur, policy differences of Congress {{and the agency}} must be large. Because rival policy positions are <b>quantifiable</b> in this <b>case,</b> the preferences of Congress and the Commission can be directly evaluated. While {{the distance between the}} policy position of the Commission and Congress appear large, they signified a negligible increment in competition when compared to a benchmark efficient policy. A financial event study supports this interpretation, as radio broadcasters equity values were not materially affected by either events in Congress or the Commission. Thus, even marginal differences may prompt a costly intervention by Congress to ostensibly discipline an agency. ...|$|R
40|$|Trade fairs {{represent}} a hot {{subject in the}} contemporary theory, {{as well as in}} the contemporary practice of modern successful international and local enterprises, organizers and owners of exhibition space. The domestic literature provides certain sources and papers which discuss the topic in theory, but there is an evident lack of strategic approach towards trade fairs as the instrument of sales improvement, as well as the obvious lack of practical approach of enterprises at trade fairs, and the lack of real measurement of the results obtained. This paper proves that the representation on a trade fair had positive effect on the sales results, as well as on the creation of interest and the increase of awareness of the existence of a company and its products. The analysis proves that under certain conditions the gain rate on the investment is calculable and <b>quantifiable,</b> in the <b>case</b> of trade fair representation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To pilot {{a method}} of {{assessing}} psychological care by general practitioners. DESIGN [...] Prospective examination of psychological care given in general practice by using general health questionnaire with predetermined <b>quantifiable</b> and <b>case</b> specific indices of outcome established at the original consultation. SETTING [...] Rural general practice in Clwyd, North Wales. SUBJECTS [...] 447 consecutive adult general practice attenders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Three month follow up consultation rates, one year retrospective consultation rates, continuity of care, changes in general health questionnaire scores at follow up, general satisfaction, and acceptability of outcome measures. RESULTS [...] The principal and trainee identified 72 patients with psychological problems, 46 of whom had new conditions. 133 patients scored over 6 on the 28 item general health questionnaire, 33 of whom were identified as new cases by the general practitioners. 62 patients were seen at follow up, including 23 patients identified by the questionnaire but not by the doctor. The doctors used diagnostic terms to describe the presenting condition in 38 cases. At three month follow up the general health questionnaire scores had fallen by more than 5 points in 22 / 39 patients identified and managed by doctors and 11 / 23 identified by the questionnaire. The agreed index of good outcome was almost or completely achieved by 20 of the 39 patients managed by doctors. CONCLUSION [...] Quantifiable methods of {{evaluating the quality of}} the structure, process, and outcome of psychological care can be achieved in general practice...|$|R
40|$|Ciguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP), a {{significant}} {{public health problem}} in the Pacific, is intrinsically linked {{to the health of}} coral reef ecosystems. Incidence data on CFP could therefore be used, in theory, as indicators of disruption to coral reefs. Some disruptions, such as increasing sea surface temperatures, result from global environmental change [...] therefore suggesting that CFP is likely to become an increasing public health problem in the region. The proactive management of increasing numbers of cases will depend on an understanding of the ecology of the disease, sound health surveillance systems to report cases of CFP including appropriate <b>case</b> definitions, and <b>quantifiable</b> correlations between <b>case</b> numbers and environmental variables. Here, we briefly review the knowledge about these components in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), including summarising regional variation in symptoms of CFP cases, investigating media as an enhanced surveillance tool, and summarising regional environmental drivers of CFP cases. We conclude that CFP could be an important indicator of the health of reef ecosystems in the face of global climate change and more novel approaches such as combining environmental and health data, need to be implemented to improve surveillance of CFP...|$|R
40|$|All authors {{agree that}} {{posterior}} crossbite is a malocclusion that affects mandibular growth and {{may lead to}} skeletal asymmetry but there are few data on which age these modifications are easily quantifiable. For this study, the researchers used x-ray records of 217 children between 6 and 9 years of age, in the mixed dentition stage and with unilateral posterior crossbite. All the horizontal variables were traced and evaluated by the principal researcher, using the tpsDig version 2 computer program. Subsequently, a descriptive and statistical analysis was carried out, using the SPSS 17. 0 for Windows program. After analysing the vertical mandibular traces on the x-rays, the researchers found, in all <b>cases,</b> <b>quantifiable</b> differences between the crossbite side and the non-crossbite side. The differences between horizontal variables were statistically significant (p< 0. 005) {{for the entire sample}} (H 3 -H 4), in the group of boys (H 3 -H 4) and in the 7 -year old age group (H 1 -H 2 and H 3 -H 4). Differences were observed {{in the size of the}} horizontal measures between the crossbite side and the non-crossbite side. Some of these differences were significant as a function of the sex and age of the study sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} an {{investigation}} into the teaching decisions that mathematics teachers make over time. I view a mathematics classroom as a didactical system of teacher, learners and content within an educational institution, where content is the material that brings teachers and learners together. Within such a system I view the teacherâs role as making content available to learners. Prior research has often investigated the teacherâs role by comparing teaching practices nationally or internationally, but these comparisons have tended to use the lesson as the unit of analysis. I propose that how teachers make content available can change {{over the course of a}} series of lessons and so my study used the lesson series as the unit of analysis. I purposefully designed the study so that it involved four cases, which allowed me to explore the role of the teacher and the topic in how content was made available. To investigate how teachers made content available to learners in each case, I developed an analytical approach from which I could study the modes of teacher interaction that featured across the lesson series, the forms of mathematical content made available and the sequencing of these forms. Attending to forms of content â rather than content itself â allowed for comparison of teaching of different topics. This original analytical approach represents a contribution to both mathematics education and mixed methods research. Within this small sample of <b>cases,</b> <b>quantifiable</b> differences were identified in how content was made available between classwork and seatwork, from lesson to lesson and between cases. Between-case differences in the nature of teaching âbetween-the-desksâ during seatwork were also identified. These differences illuminated teaching decisions to which teachers and classroom researchers may not routinely attend. The findings therefore contribute â and identify additional lines of enquiry that might contribute further â to a more extensive understanding of teaching practices. </p...|$|R
