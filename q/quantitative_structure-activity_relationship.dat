25|$|A {{new study}} using {{comparative}} molecular field analysis (CoMFA) to establish three-dimensional <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationship</b> (3D QSAR), while searching for novel active pharmacophores as potentially potent HGMR inhibitors, was recently published. Using this novel technique researchers {{were able to}} screen for compounds with high screening scores. In addition to the conventional statin-like compounds with HMG-like moiety, eight additional compounds with completely different pharmacophore structure were found. This structure-based virtual screening procedure is considered promising for rational quest and optimization of potential novel HGMR inhibitors.|$|E

The agency's toxicology work involves pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure–activity</b> <b>relationship</b> methods, and benchmark dose modeling, as well as establishing minimal risk levels for human exposure to hazardous substances. One model developed by the toxicology laboratory showed that children were much more susceptible than adults to chemical exposure from inhalation and oral exposure.

The <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationships</b> models were built using a data set of 52 CB 1 ligands that can be used as anti-obesity agents. Significant correlation coefficients (hologram <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> relationships: r 2 = 0. 91, q 2 = 0. 78; comparative molecular field analysis: r 2 = 0. 98, q 2 = 0. 77) were obtained, indicating the potential of these 2 D and 3 D models for untested compounds. The models were then used to predict the potency of an external test set, and the predicted (calculated) values are in good agreement with the experimental results. The final <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationships</b> models, along with the information obtained from 2 D contribution maps and 3 D contour maps, obtained in this study are useful tools for the design of novel CB 1 ligands with improved anti-obesity potency.

25|$|Ligand-based drug design (or {{indirect}} drug design) {{relies on}} knowledge of other molecules that bind to the biological target of interest. These other molecules {{may be used}} to derive a pharmacophore model that defines the minimum necessary structural characteristics a molecule must possess in order to bind to the target.

50|$|David Lee had {{a strong}} {{background}} in <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationships</b> (QSAR) after a post-doctoral year with Professors Manfred Wolff and Peter Kollman where he used the Prophet system. Looking over the QSAR (<b>quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationships)</b> of the triketones, David Lee saw a potential discrepancy in the existing structure-activity analysis. Other than the 2-chloro-4-nitro substitution pattern, no other triketones with electron-withdrawing substituents in the 4-position had ever been prepared. He hypothesized that {{the activity of the}} triketones could be correlated to the electron withdrawing ability of the substituents. The activity of the 2-chloro-4-nitro analog was an outlier, and it was theorized that perhaps the nitro group was being reduced in vivo. The 4-methylsulfonyl group was then prepared to test this hypothesis, and what was to become the commercial herbicide Mikado (II) was prepared. The prospect of improving the biological activity with new aromatic substitution patterns totally rejuvenated work on the triketones.|$|R

ABSTRACT: <b>Quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationships</b> (QSAR) attempts to find consistent relationships between the variations in the values of molecular properties and the biological activity {{for a series of}} compounds. These physicochemical descriptors, which include parameters to account for hydrophobicity, topology, electronic properties, and steric effects, are determined empirically or, more recently, by computational methods. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationships</b> (Q SAR) generally {{take the form of a}} linear equation where the biological activity is dependent variable. Biological activity is depended on the parameters and the coefficients. Parameters are computed for each molecule in the series. Coefficients are calculated by fitting variations in the parameters. Intermediate values of the biological activity are obtained by some formulas. These formulas are worked in tabulated values of biological activity in <b>Quantitative</b> <b>structure-activity</b> <b>relationships.</b> These formulas are worked in the conditions and all conditions are based on the position of the point lies in the table. Derived formulas using Newton’s method for interpolation are worked in conditions which are depending on the point lies. If the point lies in the upper half then used Newton’s forward interpolation formula. If the point lies in the lower half then we used Newton’s backward interpolation formula.
