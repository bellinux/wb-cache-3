And {{in this work}} the compact form mathematical model for current <b>mode</b> <b>signalling</b> in VLSI interconnects is presented. RLC interconnect line is modelled using characteristic impedance of transmission line and inductive effect. The on-chip inductance effect is dominant at lower technology node is emulated into an equivalent resistance. First order transfer function is designed using finite difference equation, Laplace transform and by applying the boundary conditions at the source and load termination. It has been observed that the dominant pole determines system response and delay in the proposed model. The novel proposed current mode model shows superior performance as compared to voltage <b>mode</b> <b>signalling.</b> Analysis shows that current <b>mode</b> <b>signalling</b> in VLSI interconnects provides 2. 8 times better delay performance than voltage mode.

40|$|Currently, the {{presence}} of significant RE noise on twisted pair loops prevents mass deployment of high-speed Digital Subscriber Loop (DSL) technology. DSL technology generally uses bandwidth within the frequency spectrum range of 10 kHz up to 10 MHz. Unfortunately this same spectrum is presently allocated for private, governmental and public radio communications. As well, due to limited cable balance, twisted pair copper cables are highly susceptible to ingress from noise sources present within the DSL frequency bandwidth. This thesis presents a new architecture to reduce radio frequency interference (RFI) noise at the receiver by exploiting the transmission characteristics of twisted pair wire. A novel technique is proposed in this thesis to reduce common-mode noise coupled into the differential <b>mode</b> <b>signal</b> of a twisted pair cable, by adding an identical but inverted version of the common <b>mode</b> <b>signal</b> component. The resulting signal is the differential <b>mode</b> <b>signal</b> without the common mode RFI noise.

In this paper, closed-form expression of delay model based on the effective lumped element resistance and capacitance approximation of distributed RC lines are presented. A new closed-form solution of delay under step input excitation is developed. The usefulness of this solution is that both resistive and capacitive load termination is accurately modeled for use in current <b>mode</b> <b>signaling.</b> Comparison of simulation results with other established models justifies the accuracy of our approach...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the stabilization problem for a class of discrete-time Markovian jump linear systems with time-delays both in the system state and in the <b>mode</b> <b>signal.</b> The delay in the system state may be time-varying. The delay in the <b>mode</b> <b>signal</b> is manifested as a constant mismatch of the modes between the controller and the system. We first show that the resulting closed-loop system is a time-varying delayed Markovian jump linear system with extended state space. Then a sufficient condition is proposed for the design of a controller such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable. Finally, numerical simulation is used to illustrate the developed theory. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Since bandwidth is related to power dissipation, the adaptive bus attains energy efficient data transmission by expending minimum power required to support the bus signal activity. The design method is based on statistical analysis of address streams extracted for typical benchmark programs using a microprocessor time-based simulator in combination with circuitlevel power analysis.
