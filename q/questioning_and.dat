5|$|In Milford, Massachusetts, men in Hazmat suits drop a woman (Maria Dizzia) {{out of a}} white van, {{who then}} enters a nearby diner. Suffering from memory loss, the woman becomes irritated under a cop's <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> causes the other patrons' brains to boil and then explode; she dies soon after in the same fashion.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for <b>questioning,</b> <b>and</b> knowing {{that there is not}} enough evidence to warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
5|$|Unlike a teacher-student relationship, {{in which}} the student memorizes and repeats the {{material}} back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student {{in the position of}} analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text.|$|E
30|$|As {{indicated}} in the “Results” section, both research questions were clearly answered.

In a state of semi-stupefaction after all the <b>questionings</b> <b>and</b> examinings and blusterings, they were finally allowed to go {{straight}} across Paris. But this meant another wild tussle with a Paris taxi-driver, in the filtering snow. So they were deposited in the Gare de Lyon.|$|R
5|$|While {{the plane}} {{suffered}} relatively little damage, the suspect incurred {{first and second}} degree burns to his hands, as well as second-degree burns to his right inner thigh and genitalia. Two other passengers were also injured. When the plane landed, Abdulmutallab was handed over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, and taken into custody for <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> treatment of his injuries in a secured room of the burn unit of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. Schuringa was also taken to the hospital. One other passenger incurred minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{forty minutes}} after his collapse, a police {{helicopter}} took Simpson to nearby Avignon hospital, {{where he was}} pronounced dead at 5:40p.m. Dumas refused to sign a burial certificate and a poisons expert from Marseille was commissioned to conduct an autopsy. Two empty tubes of amphetamines and a half-full tube {{were found in the}} rear pocket of his racing jersey, one of which was labelled Tonedron. The British team was called in for <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> their baggage was searched. Two of the Belgian soigneurs– who looked after riders on the British team including Simpson– locked themselves in their room, got drunk and did not come out.|$|E
5|$|As Raskolnikov and Porfiry {{continue}} to meet, Raskolnikov's motives {{for the crime}} become exposed. Porfiry becomes increasingly certain of the man's guilt, but has no concrete evidence or witnesses with which to back up this suspicion. Furthermore, another man admits to committing the crime under <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> arrest. However, Raskolnikov's nerves {{continue to}} wear thinner, and he is constantly struggling {{with the idea of}} confessing, though he knows that he can never be truly convicted. He turns to Sonya for support and confesses his crime to her. By coincidence, Svidrigaïlov has taken up residence in a room next to Sonya's and overhears the entire confession. When the two men meet face to face, Svidrigaïlov acknowledges this fact, and suggests that he may use it against him, should he need to. Svidrigaïlov also speaks of his own past, and Raskolnikov grows to suspect that the rumors about his having committed several murders are true. In a later conversation with Dunya, Svidrigaïlov denies that he had a hand in the death of his wife.|$|E

5|$|Having {{recovered}} {{enough from}} {{the events of the}} previous episode, Olivia is released from the hospital, and is watched by the shapeshifter who has killed Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) and adopted his appearance. Peter (Joshua Jackson) learns of mysterious disappearances taking place in Lansdale, and the Fringe team arrives to investigate. Walter finds a blue, paralytic substance at the scene, which he suspects is from mutated DNA. The investigation leads to a local resident, Andre Hughes (John Savage), who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth. Olivia begins to develop super-hearing as a result of crossing to the parallel universe, and hears someone else in Hughes' house despite his saying he's the only one there. She ventures upstairs to investigate; after failing to find anything, she accidentally fires her weapon, narrowly missing Peter. They bring Hughes in for <b>questioning,</b> <b>and</b> he refuses to give them a blood sample for their investigation.|$|E
5|$|Jigsaw then leads Tapp to the asylum's crematorium, {{where he}} informs Tapp {{that some people}} {{actually}} desire his tests, much to Tapp's surprise. At the crematorium is Obi Tate, an arsonist who had put advertisements in the newspaper seeking for Jigsaw to test him. Tapp saves him from a burning furnace, but Obi is still frustrated {{because he wanted to}} survive his own test. Feeling that Tapp is throwing away a gift from Jigsaw, Obi runs away. Tapp then ventures through a theater, where he finds evidence that a former Jigsaw victim being held there. He soon finds that it is Jeff Thomas, the man who was saved by Sing while he and Tapp were in Jigsaw's lair. Jeff has since become suicidal from Tapp's incessant <b>questioning,</b> <b>and</b> has been recaptured by Jigsaw. Tapp saves Thomas from a wall of spikes. Thomas is still frustrated, so he runs away, wounded. As this was the last victim in the asylum, Tapp is free to pursue Jigsaw, but encounters Pighead again. Jigsaw informs Tapp that Pighead wishes to surpass Jigsaw and sabotage Tapp's game, so he must be stopped. Tapp confronts and kills Pighead; Jigsaw rhetorically asks him if he's a murderer, {{in order to get a}} key to proceed.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) {{continues}} his {{investigation into the}} shooting death of small-time drug peddler Charles Courtland Cox, who he suspects was killed by police during a botched crackhouse raid. As the involved police officers turn over their guns for testing, the press reports heavily on the story, which results in pressure from the department heads to solve the case. Pembleton aggressively questions several officers, but none are cooperative. Gee (Yaphet Kotto) is angry with Pembleton's focus on the police and demands civilian suspects be pursued. Howard (Melissa Leo) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) canvas the neighborhood of the shooting and find most residents do not trust the police, who they feel are {{responsible for the death of}} one of their own. However, one woman named Dale (June Thorne) tells Bayliss her grandson, Lane Staley (Isaiah Washington) witnessed the shooting. Staley is brought in to the station for <b>questioning</b> <b>and,</b> while Pembleton plans to question him as an eyewitness, Gee demands he be treated as a suspect.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} well known ACLU successes came in the 1960s, when the ACLU prevailed {{in a string of}} cases {{limiting}} the power of police to gather evidence; in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio, the Supreme court required states to obtain a warrant before searching a person's home. The Gideon v. Wainwright decision in 1963 provided legal representation to indigents. In 1964, the ACLU persuaded the Court, in Escobedo v. Illinois, to permit suspects to have an attorney present during <b>questioning.</b> <b>And,</b> in 1966, Miranda v. Arizona federal decision required police to notify suspects of their constitutional rights, which was later extended to juveniles in the following year's in re Gault (1967) federal ruling. Although many law enforcement officials criticized the ACLU for expanding the rights of suspects, police officers themselves took advantage of the ACLU. For example, when the ACLU represented New York City policemen in their lawsuit which objected to searches of their workplace lockers. In the late 1960s, civilian review boards in New York City and Philadelphia were abolished, over the ACLU's objection.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} Law marked {{the start of}} a new chapter for Smuts. The {{preceding}} years at Stellenbosch had been ones of tremendous intellectual development. From the narrow focus of his upbringing, his outlook had now expanded, awakening within him a consciousness of the breadth of knowledge now open before him. Smuts, though remaining an adherent of the Church, and respectful of the Bible and its teachings, had developed a more <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> critical outlook during the course of his studies. Whereas at the outset of his university career he was content to follow his parents' wishes and be ordained into the Church, as his time at Victoria College came to an end he found himself more and more unwilling to commit to this path. Though he had now as yet wholly rejected the idea of ordination, he wished for a period of more diversified study before making that decision. So it was that Smuts came to select Law, rather than Divinity or Philosophy - the logical choices for a future Minister of Religion.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting to overwhelm the storytelling.|$|E

40|$|Interviewers' <b>questioning</b> {{behavior}} <b>and</b> predictive {{validity of}} applicant ratings varies considerably in unstructured interviews. A model hypothesizing {{a relationship between}} these variables is tested in this study. The model proposes {{that the relationship between}} interviewer <b>questioning</b> behavior <b>and</b> evaluation validity is mediated by the diagnosticity of applicant information that is collected during the interview. The process and content of three interviewers' questioning of 149 candidates for an entry-level correctional officer position was examined. Although the complete information gathering model was not supported, a robust relationship between <b>questioning</b> behavior <b>and</b> information diagnosticity emerged. Furthermore, the validity of individual interviewers' applicant evaluations varied considerably. These results reinforce the existence of differences in interviewers' <b>questioning</b> behavior <b>and</b> differences in the quality of applicant information they gather. Because differences in questioning behavior correspond to differences in the predictive validity of applicant ratings, both these variables should be monitored at the individual interviewer level...|$|R
25|$|Miranda v. Arizona, , was a {{landmark}} {{decision of the}} United States Supreme Court. In a 5–4 majority, the Court held that both inculpatory and exculpatory statements made in response to interrogation by a defendant in police custody will be admissible at trial only if the prosecution can show that the defendant was informed {{of the right to}} consult with an attorney before and during <b>questioning</b> <b>and</b> of the right against self-incrimination before police <b>questioning,</b> <b>and</b> that the defendant not only understood these rights, but voluntarily waived them.|$|E
