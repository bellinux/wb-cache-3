50|$|All these {{calculations}} {{to produce}} a <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> (or range) and azimuth were done manually using instruments, tablulated, data of the moment, and approximations until battlefield computers started appearing in the 1960s and 1970s. While some early calculators copied the manual method (typically substituting polynomials for tabulated data), computers use a different approach. They simulate a shell's trajectory by 'flying' it in short steps and applying data about the conditions affecting the trajectory at each step. This simulation is repeated until it produces a <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> and azimuth that lands the shell within the required 'closing' distance of the target coordinates. NATO has a standard ballistic model for computer calculations and has expanded {{the scope of this}} into the NATO Armaments Ballistic Kernel (NABK) within the SG2 Shareable (Fire Control) Software Suite (S4).|$|E
50|$|Directors {{transmit}} {{three important}} calculated firing {{solutions to the}} anti-aircraft gun firing crew: the correct firing azimuth and <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> calculated to determine where exactly to aim the gun, and for guns that use ammunition with timed fuzes, the director also provides the flight time for the projectile so the fuze can be set to detonate {{in close proximity to}} the target.|$|E
50|$|Firing {{data has}} to be {{calculated}} and {{is the key to}} indirect fire; the arrangements for this have varied widely. Firing data has two components: <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> and azimuth, to these may be added the size of propelling charge and the fuze setting. The process to produce firing data is sometimes called technical fire control. Before computers, some armies set the range on the gun's sights, which mechanically corrected it for the gun's muzzle velocity. For the first few decades of indirect fire, firing data were calculated by the observer, who then adjusted the fall of shot onto the target.|$|E
50|$|When first {{introduced}} in the British Royal Artillery, the L7 or L7A1 dial sight and its carrier, incorporating an integral elevation scale and internal lighting powered by Trilux nuclear light sources, was used to aim the gun for indirect fire. The L7 sight is {{a modified version of}} a German Leitz instrument. Since the light gun entered service after the introduction of field artillery computer equipment (FACE), it never, unlike the Abbot, had gun rules (large slide rule like instruments used at each gun to convert range in metres to tangent elevation in mils, taking account of muzzle velocity). Therefore, it has a single <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> scale. These optical indirect fire sights are now only used in recruit training.|$|E
50|$|The Battery FDC computes firing data—ammunition to be used, powder charge, fuse settings, the {{direction}} to the target, and the <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> {{to be fired}} at to reach the target, what gun will fire any rounds needed for adjusting on the target, {{and the number of}} rounds to be fired on the target by each gun once the target has been accurately located—to the guns. Traditionally this data is relayed via radio or wire communications as a warning order to the guns, followed by orders specifying the type of ammunition and fuse setting, direction, and the elevation needed to reach the target, and the method of adjustment or orders for fire for effect (FFE). However, in more advanced artillery units, this data is relayed through a digital radio link.|$|E
50|$|In 1925 the British {{adopted a}} new {{instrument}} developed by Vickers. It was a mechanical analogue computer Predictor AA No 1. Given the target height its operators tracked {{the target and}} the predictor produced bearing, <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> and fuze setting. These were passed electrically to the guns where they were displayed on repeater dials to the layers who 'matched pointers' (target data and the gun's actual data) to lay the guns. This system of repeater electrical dials built on the arrangements introduced by British coast artillery in the 1880s, and coast artillery was the background of many AA officers. Similar systems were adopted in other countries and for example the later Sperry device, designated M3A3 in the US was also used by Britain as the Predictor AA No 2. Height finders were also increasing in size, in Britain, the World War I Barr & Stroud UB 2 (7 feet optical base) {{was replaced by the}} UB 7 (9 feet optical base) and the UB 10 (18 feet optical base, only used on static AA sites). Goertz in Germany and Levallois in France produced 5 metre instruments.|$|E

40|$|A target {{localization}} algorithm, {{which uses}} the measurement information from onboard GPS and onboard laser detector {{to acquire the}} target position, is proposed to obtain the accurate position of ground target in real time in the trajectory correction process of semi-active laser terminal correction projectile. A target localization model is established according to projectile position, attitude and line-of-sight angle. The effects of measurement errors of projectile position, attitude and line-of-sight angle on localization accuracy at different <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> angles are analyzed through Monte-Carlo simulation. The simulation {{results show that the}} measurement error of line-of-sight angle has the largest influence on the localization accuracy. The localization accuracy decreases with the increase in <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> angle. However, the maximum localization accuracy is less than 7 [*]m. The proposed algorithm meets the accuracy and real-time requirements of target localization...|$|E

40|$|Flight {{tests of}} fifteen T- 231 70 -mm HEAA rocket {{projectiles}} (flight {{components of the}} T- 263 HEAA rounds) were made at the Langley Pilotless AIrcraft Research Station at Wallops Island, VA., to obtain flight trajectories at high <b>quadrant</b> <b>elevation</b> launchings and to obtain drag data. Although all rounds were of the same general type, there were differences in nozzle cant angles, number of nozzles per round, shape of head and fuse, motor case length, and type of propellant. All projectiles were launched at an elevation angle of 60 deg. Two of the projectiles tumbled; the remaining thirteen flew successfully. Maximum velocities varied between 2, 775 and 3, 185 feet per second. The time to reach maximum velocity varied between 1. 3 and 1. 95 seconds. Altitude measured 10 seconds after launching varied between 13, 950 and 14, 915 feet, ad maximum altitude varied between 19, 500 and 21, 000 feet. Drag coefficients were obtained over a range of Mach number from 0. 7 to 2. 6. Maximum drag coefficients varied between 0. 45 and 0. 50. Results obtained from the last five rounds hwich were identical within manufacturing tolerances were in close agreement...|$|E
