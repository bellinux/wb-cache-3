Also this type of array exhibited a 1 to 1 linear displacement, - from the location of the point source to its respective, parallel, location on the image plane. In other words, from x to x + δx. For example, other point sources were similarly displaced from x' to x' + δx', from x^ to x^ + δx^, and from x^^ to x^^ + δx^^, and so on. Instead of functioning as a light concentrator, this performs the function of conventional lens imaging with a 1 to 1 correspondence, albeit with a point source.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} and fabrication of silicon-based phononic band gap crystals {{has been gaining}} interest since phononic band gap crystals have implications in fundamental science and display the potential for application in engineering by providing a relatively new platform for the realization of sensors and signal processing elements. The seminal study of phononic band gap phenomenon for classical elastic wave localization in structures with periodicity in two- or three-physical dimensions occurred in the early 1990 ’s. Micro-integration of silicon devices that leverage this phenomenon followed from the mid- 2000 ’s until the present. The reported micro-integration relies on exotic piezoelectric transduction, phononic band gap crystals that are etched into semi-infinite or finite-thickness slabs which support surface or slab waves, phononic band gap crystals of numerous lattice constants in dimension and phononic band gap crystal truncation by homogeneous mediums or piezoelectric transducers. The thesis reports, {{to the best of}} the author's knowledge, for the first time, the theory, design methodology and experiment of an electrostatically actuated silicon-plate phononic band gap <b>quasi-crystal</b> architecture, which may serve as a platform {{for the development of a}} new generation of silicon-integrated sensors, signal processing elements and improved mechanical systems. Electrostatic actuation mitigates the utilization of piezoelectric transducers and provides action at a distance type forces so that the phononic band gap <b>quasi-crystal</b> edges may be free standing for potentially reduced anchor and substrate mode loss and improved energy confinement compared with traditional surface and slab wave phononic band gap crystals. The proposed phononic band gap <b>quasi-crystal</b> architecture is physically scaled for fabrication as MEMS in a silicon-on-insulator process. Reasonable experimental verification of the model of the electrostatically actuated phononic band gap <b>quasi-crystal</b> architecture is obtained through extensive dynamic harmonic analysis and mode shape topography measurements utilizing optical non-destructive laser-Doppler velocimetry. We have utilized our devices to obtain fundamental information regarding novel transduction mechanisms and behavioral characteristics of the phononic band gap <b>quasi-crystal</b> architecture.

40|$|Crystal graphs, in {{the sense}} of Kashiwara, carry a natural monoid {{structure}} given by identifying words labelling vertices that appear in the same position of isomorphic components of the crystal. In the particular case of the crystal graph for the q-analogue of the special linear Lie algebra sl_n, this monoid is the celebrated plactic monoid, whose elements can be identified with Young tableaux. The crystal graph and the so-called Kashiwara operators interact beautifully with the combinatorics of Young tableaux and with the Robinson [...] Schensted [...] Knuth correspondence and so provide powerful combinatorial tools to work with them. This paper constructs an analogous `quasi-crystal' structure for the hypoplactic monoid, whose elements can be identified with quasi-ribbon tableaux and whose connection with the theory of quasi-symmetric functions echoes the connection of the plactic monoid with the theory of symmetric functions. This <b>quasi-crystal</b> structure and the associated quasi-Kashiwara operators are shown to interact just as neatly with the combinatorics of quasi-ribbon tableaux and with the hypoplactic version of the Robinson [...] Schensted [...] Knuth correspondence.
