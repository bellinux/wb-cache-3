40|$|Objective: This {{pilot study}} {{examines}} the potential {{utility of the}} Perception of Interprofessional Collaboration Model and the Shared Decision Making scales in evaluating the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> in child mental health collaborative care.   Methods: 96 primary care professionals working with children and youth responded to an internet survey which included the Perception of Interprofessional Collaboration Model scale (PINCOM-Q) and an adapted version of a Shared Decision Making scale (Échelle de confort décisionnel, partenaire - ECD-P). The perceptions of child mental health professionals were {{compared with those of}} other professionals working with children.   Results: The PINCOM- Q and the ECD-P scales had an excellent internal consistency and they were moderately correlated. Child mental health professionals' Individual Interprofessional Collaboration scores from the PINCOM-Q Individual aspects subscale were better than that of other child professionals. Conclusion: These scales may be interesting instruments to measure the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> in child mental health collaborative care settings. Research needs to replicate these findings and to determine whether the quality of collaboration is a predictor of mental health outcome. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: With {{the growing}} {{complexity}} {{of products and}} processes in a globalized market, companies are required to strive for a new <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership.</b> In Smart Networks, networking of partners goes beyond mere organizational networking, but involves also networking on the levels of knowledge and information/communication technology (ICT). The setup of ICT networking in newly formed Smart Networks requires not only information about already existing ICT infrastructure, but also {{a clear understanding of}} the organizational interconnections and knowledge interdependencies. This paper presents how the respective knowledge can be identified, visualized, and structured through information models in order to obtain decision support for the introduction of additional ICT support for the collaboration within a Smart Network. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{benefits}} and drawbacks <b>of</b> potential <b>partnership</b> dissolution through an infinite-period, dynamic game-theoretic model of learning and endogenous dissolution. As partners learn about the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> their <b>partnership</b> relative to their outside opportunities, the rents associated with the partnership change, effecting a related change in the strangth of incentives to provide effort. The paper develops an incentive-constrained dynamic programming algorithm for the computation of optimal symmetric equilibria of dynamic games with known worst punishments (such as dissolution here). The scheme is much simpler than the more general set-valued approach pioneered by Abreu, Pearce, and Stacchetti in that it only requires the computation of one value function at each iteration. The algorithm is then used to show that rather mild supermodularity conditions lead to effort levels in the optimal equilibria which rise in the expected <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partnership...</b>|$|R

40|$|For this study, we used {{data from}} the Finnish Womans Life Course and Family Formation Survey to study the {{decision}} to have or {{not to have a}} third child among women who had two children. Our results show that almost one half of the respondents in our sample (n= 636) desired to have three or more children, but only 19 per cent intended to have a third birth, while 30 per cent were uncertain about their intentions. We also found that a considerable proportion of the respondents had decided to stop childbearing at a lower parity than desired. To study what determines womens decision to have a third child we estimated three logistic regression models of the determinants of third-birth intentions and their uncertainty, separately for all women at parity two and for those who desired to have three or more children. The results indicate that the factors associated with the intention to cease childbearing differ from those associated with the certainty of intention. Familial and attitudinal factors, such as the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership,</b> genders of the existing children, and family values, were independently associated with womens intentions to continue childbearing after two children or stop at parity two.

40|$|Since 2001, Ghana has {{introduced}} a number of forest-based strategies to improve the livelihoods of forest communities, restore the country’s forest cover and address timber deficits. Among these strategies is the modified taungya system (MTS). Through a mix of qualitative methods, field observations, and a household survey among 146 MTS farmers from eight villages in the Tano Offin, Tain II and Yaya Forest Reserve areas in the high forest zone, this paper explores the challenges related to MTS management in Ghana. Results indicate {{that the lack of}} regular income from timber until tree harvesting, the delay in signing MTS agreements, the absence of a clear mechanism for sharing the 40 % timber benefits among individual farmers, restrictions on tree and crop species allowed under the MTS, and inadequate support and supervision from the implementing agency demotivate farmers to invest labour in farm maintenance. The study also reveals that the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> among the actors impacts on the performance of the scheme: a co-management arrangement exclusively between the Forestry Commission and MTS farmer groups generated poorer results in terms {{of the quality of the}} timber stands, income-generating potential and motivation of the actors involved. The continued commitment of both participating farmer groups and coordinating agencies is key to the performance of the MTS. Lastly, the prospects for future income from timber revenues determine to a large extent farmers’ commitment to tree maintenance in the MTS. Linking up with the concepts of interactive and landscape governance and partnerships, the authors make recommendations to overcome these challenges...|$|E

Participants consisted of 48 teachers (24 Co-teach partnerships) and 162 students with disabilities in grades 6 - 8 who were enrolled in a Co-teach class <b>of</b> the study?s <b>partnerships</b> during the 2007 - 08 school year. The CO-ACT examines <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> Co-teach <b>partnerships</b> through measurement <b>of</b> various factors linked to Co-teaching best practices, and provides a scoring system identifying partnerships as exemplary and non-exemplary. Student academic outcome data consisted of district-designed local assessments and statewide assessment measures. Student academic outcome data was collected and analyzed for students with disabilities in identified Co-teach partnerships. Four areas were examined in relation to the CO-ACT and its ability to predict student academic outcomes: a) whether the CO-ACT was able to predict student academic outcomes; b) the importance of the individual factors; c) the impact of the degree of Co-teacher agreement of practices; and d) analysis of these areas by subject area (math, reading, science and social studies). These four qualities were the basis for the four research questions for the study. Specifically, the aim {{of the study was to}} identify correlations among the <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> each Co-teach <b>partnership,</b> and to determine whether there was a relationship between the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partnership</b> and student academic performance. Study findings indicated that in the area of math and science some CO-ACT factors were statistically significant in predicting student academic outcomes. However, when taking all study analysis into consideration, overall the results indicated that the CO-ACT did not provide statistically or practically significant predictions of student academic outcomes. Although the CO-ACT was designed to measure the presence of behaviors within a Co-teach setting that are reflected within the Co-teach literature as best practices, the exemplary or non-exemplary practices of Co-teachers did not appear to correlate with student academic outcomes. Implications of findings and recommendations for further research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Best Start is an area-based early {{childhood}} intervention where projects are developed and implemented through a community partnership. A core tenet {{of the initiative}} is that implementing projects through a partnership generates greater value than would be expected if projects were undertaken independently by partner members. In this study we examine whether: (1) Best Start is effective in increasing the proportion of infants being fully breastfed at 3 months and 6 months. (2) The quality of community partnerships is a potential mechanism for change. Methods Best Start was implemented in Victoria, Australia. The study examined breastfeeding rates before and after Best Start in sites with Best Start breastfeeding projects compared {{to the rest of}} state. The relationship between partnership quality scores and breastfeeding percentages was also examined. Both analyses controlled for socioeconomic and demographic differences and clustering by area. Results Best Start targeted some of the most socially disadvantaged communities in Victoria. In the 3 years of its operation, the rates of fully breastfeeding at 3 months (OR 1. 30, 95 % CI 1. 14 - 1. 47) and 6 months (OR 1. 33, 95 % CI 1. 1 - 1. 61) increased in Best Start sites compared {{to the rest of the}} state. <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> scores was positively associated with increased percentages of fully breastfeeding (3 months=OR 1. 03, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 1. 06; 6 months=OR 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 98 - 1. 08).

40|$|Partnership {{work with}} service users and carers {{in social work}} {{education}} is a policy requirement, {{and it is also}} central to the anti-oppressive and rights-based values of social work. This paper reports research findings which are drawn from an educational context, but are also relevant to the wider field of health and social care. The research team undertook a systematic knowledge review using the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and Coordinating Centre system, which had been used in health and education, but which had not previously been used in social care and social work. This involved an extensive search of electronic databases and rigorous screening to identify studies which had sufficient relevance to be subjected to detailed analysis. The research team also undertook a practice survey of the teaching, learning and assessment of partnership in prequalifying programmes in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. This involved three stages: a document search; telephone interviews; and focus groups held with students, academic staff, and service users and carers. Throughout the research process, the interdisciplinary team was advised and supported by a stakeholder group which consisted of service users and carers, students, and employer representatives. In {{the second part of the}} paper, subsequent discussion explores key findings from the research, including the disputed nature of the concept of partnership, models of partnership work within social work education and the dearth of research on partnership outcomes. Five related questions are identified as a means of interrogating the robustness of the research process and findings. The paper concludes by arguing for work to be done to theorise partnership, and to develop effective strategies for improving the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> working in education, and health and social care practice...|$|E
40|$|Education {{shapes the}} present and the future. Teachers are one of the crucial {{elements}} of this future making. Primary school teachers may be accepted as the basement constructors of the education building. Pedagogy courses, which are studied as Generic Education Courses in this thesis, may be described as the cement of this building. An academic article published in the Turkish Social Research Journal (TSA, August, 2008) by Aydın et al. has triggered the author of this thesis to do a research study of this topic. The article was questioning the quality of this constructive relationship in primary school teacher training. As pedagogy courses are important and there are debates about the quality of primary school teacher education, this research examines how the theory-practice relationship of pedagogy courses is understood, and how the management of education systems and faculties can enhance the quality of teacher education in Turkey. Although the main focus was on teacher education in Turkey, data were also collected in England. The intention was not to conduct a detailed comparative study but rather to use the information from the English context to further understanding of the relevant teacher education issues in Turkey. Using a mixed method approach to data collection, information was gathered in both Turkey and England from teachers, teacher educators and student teachers. The main findings in this research can be listed as: Theory is conceived to have a relationship with practice. They cannot be separated completely. Each group of respondents see the strength/weakness of the relationship at different levels. While the Turkish context has challenging issues of management structures and systems and personnel quality (e. g. work ethic) that need to be addressed, the English context deals with details for the wellbeing of teacher education. Finally, the two contexts are recognized to be significantly different in terms of teacher education. Furthermore, the Turkish teacher education system may need to be rehabilitated or redesigned regarding its hierarchical connection with upper bodies, reconsidering the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership</b> with schools, and inner strategical changes at education faculties. ...|$|E

40|$|Psoriasis is {{a common}} chronic disease ofskin and joints that {{can have an impact}} on {{partnership}} and sexuality. This impact was investigated in this retrospective, non-randomizedstudy with a questionnaire in cooperation with the patient organisation "Psoriasisbund", the Institute of Sexual Medicine and the Dermatology Department of the University of Berlin. We developed a psoriasis-specific questionnaire in addition to the questionnaire for sexual medicine in chronic diseases (SFCE). With 1090 questionnaires we were able to gain information about partnership, disease and coping with the disease. A speciality of the study was that we asked the partners, too. 747 partners answered the questionnaire. 21 % of the people with psoriasis in this study live alone. The average age of the people with psoriasis surveyed is 51 years; half of them is between 42 and 60. Half of them display a "Psoriasis Area and Severity Index" (PASI) between 10 and 24, more than the half have problems with the joints and more than one third have pain of the joints. One third suffers from depression. These facts make clear that the half of the people surveyed feel a strong or very strong sexual and social impact of the disease. An increasing number of people suffer from sexual dysorders {{during the course of the}} disease. All kinds of sexual dysorders found increasingly in women, whereas men suffer more often from dyspareunia, erectile disorder and sexual aversion. The risk of sexual disorder is linked with the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership,</b> an additional depression and the sexual disorder before the onset of the psoriasis. There is no connection between the severity of the psoriasis, psoriasis of the nails and communication in the partnership (measured by the Hahlweg scale). But a strong itch can worsen the behaviour during conflicts. One fifth of the people with psoriasis are afraid of failing sexual performance; women suffer more than men. In addition some partners mention sexual disorders, but these less common and less severe. People with psoriasis wish special advice for sexual issues. Only five percent of the people who want advice received it from medical staff. Clinical experience shows that patients are thankful for advice about the impact of the psoriasis on partnership and sexuality.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{internationalization}} of small medium enterprises {{is a risky}} and tough path {{that is hard to}} pass alone, especially if the entry market is Russia. Due to significant institutional barriers, such as weak legislation and law enforcement system, corruption in all branches of power, economical instability, administrative obstacles and extensive bureaucracy, existence of shadow economy and criminal gangs, cultural and geographical distance, more and more SMEs choose partnership as an entry mode to the Russian market. The assistance of Russian counterparty can make it possible to overcome all these barriers and helps to acquire local market expertise, necessary for business network expansion. However in academic literature there is no deterministic answer to the question about how to select an appropriate partner in emerging market and which partner evaluation criteria should be taken into account. This study attempts to shed light on partner selection criteria in context of Russia. The research framework was designed by merging three different theoretical concepts, such as network approach, partner selection and social capital. In this study, as a methodology the case study of one Taiwanese small -sized firm, which has accumulated more than 10 years internationalization experience in the Russian market is analyzed. Through the semi structural, in depth interview with co-owner of this company I have found there exist strong relationships among firm's social capital, partner selection and network expansion in this case study. The results of my research suggest that Russian counterparty's connections in local market and their strength, position inside the industry close to the main central actors, partner's reputation and professionalism play the critical role in the process of partner selection in context of Russia. Despite the fact that partner's insufficient language congruency and experience in international business can significantly increase the transaction costs, these problems, from our respondent's perspective, did not affect the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>partnership.</b> The extensive partner's social capital positively influence on the processes of trust building, joint-problem solving and knowledge transfer. However long-term dyadic relationships in foreign market could become constraint of business network expansion and should be replaced by multilateral links with local actors. 對中小企業來說，國際化的過程是一條有相當程度風險並且很難獨自通過的路徑，尤其是如果進入的市場是俄羅斯。由於俄羅斯顯著的制度性障礙，例如薄弱的立法和執法體系、權力體系的貪污腐敗、經濟不穩定性、行政和廣泛的官僚障礙、存在影子經濟和犯罪集團、文化上與實質上的距離等，越來越多中小企業選擇並且注重合作夥伴關係作為進入俄羅斯市場的模式。運用這種合作模式來拓展業務網路對於中小企業來說必要的，透過俄羅斯合作伙伴的援助可以克服種種障礙，並幫助獲取當地市場的專業知識。然而，在學術文獻上並沒有針對〝如何在新興市場中選擇一個合適的合作夥伴以及哪一個合作夥伴的評價標準應考慮在內〞作確定的解答。 本研究的焦點是探討在俄羅斯選擇合作夥伴的準則。本研究是以三種不同理論概念合併的方法來設計研究架構，如國際企業網絡、選擇合作夥伴的標準以及社會資本。本研究採用一家台灣小型公司的個案作為研究對象，該公司已經在俄羅斯市場累計超過 10 年國際化經驗。通過對這家公司的所有人深入採訪以後，發現了社會資本、合作夥伴的選擇和網絡擴展之間有高強度的關係。 研究結果顯示，俄羅斯夥伴在當地市場的連接性和他們的實力強度、在該產業內靠近核心的位置、合作夥伴的信譽、可靠度和專業性，這些都是選擇合作夥伴的關鍵。儘管合作夥伴在國際語言溝通以及國際經驗不足的事實會導致國際業務交易成本顯著的提高，但從受訪者的角度來看，並不會使成本劇烈的提高。廣泛合作夥伴的社會資本正向地影響了建立信任的過程、解決共同問題和知識移轉等。然而長期的二元關係，在國外市場有可能成為企業網絡擴張的約束並且應改為與當地成員的多邊連結。Chapter 1 Introduction	 1 1. 2 Objectives	 2 1. 3 Outline	 3 Chapter 2 Literature Review	 4 2. 1 Process theories VS variance theories	 4 2. 2 The internationalization process model	 5 2. 3 The network approach. 	 6 2. 4 Partner selection	 10 2. 5 Social capital	 17 2. 6 Propositions development	 21 Chapter 4 Empirical Results	 34 Chapter 5 Conclusion and Suggestion	 46 5. 1 Conclusions	 46 5. 2 Research Implications	 55 5. 3 Limitations and future research directions	 57 References	 59 Appendix A. 	 6...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{considers}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> university-community engagement as {{a significant}} factor in educating the deliberate professional. Partnerships between universities and community organisations are increasingly based on provision of professional placements, enabling students to meet professional registration requirements and facilitating future employment. When these partnerships are based upon constructive and reciprocal engagement, they have the potential to be powerful mechanisms in achieving university and community goals and enhancing education of deliberate professionals. A problem lies, however, in the unevenness in the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> these <b>partnerships.</b> At their best, mutual benefit is often fortuitous. At their worst, there is one-sided benefit, largely for the university. It is argued in this chapter that universities should approach the establishment and management <b>of</b> these <b>partnerships</b> with greater deliberateness of intent with focus on the interests of the community.

No differences in importance ratings among parents of children ages birth to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, and 6 to 12 years emerged, but there were differences among satisfaction ratings, with parents of older children reporting lower satisfaction. Exploratory analyses relating satisfaction levels across other demographic variables also took place. Implications of these findings for future research and application are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{need for}} {{successful}} collaborative strategies is an enduring problem in natural resource management. Several <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> “successful” <b>partnerships</b> {{have been identified}} but few empirical studies have tested these claims against the information sharing structure <b>of</b> “unsuccessful” <b>partnerships.</b> This paper examines the ego networks of members in a partnership that has not successfully reached its goals as an illustration {{of the ways in}} which external ties relate to attitudes and relationships within a partnership. By focusing on information sharing frequencies, member ideologies, and power structure among organizations involved in a groundwater controversy, we test the extent to which the process and outcomes of participation align with conditions often used to indicate “success”. Results show that individuals who think that science is objective maintain information sharing ego networks that include a larger proportion of ties outside <b>of</b> the <b>partnership</b> than those who consider science to be less certain. Individuals who consider themselves a member <b>of</b> the <b>partnership</b> are more central to the network of organizations invited to join the partnership and maintain a greater proportions of unique ties relative to ties common across multiple actors. This case study challenges widely held assumptions about the properties of successful collaborations and supports claims that scientific discourse can be used to obscure debates over values...|$|R
40|$|NATO {{partnership}} policy now figures {{high among}} the Alliance’s diplomatic initiatives. Originated as {{an ad hoc}} experiment to engage former communist countries, partnerships have later evolved into a broad and articulated network including more than fourty states and International Organizations. Especially after the 2010 strategic review, <b>partnerships</b> represent one <b>of</b> NATO’s main instruments to enhance cooperative security. However, such ambitious goals {{do not seem to}} be backed by a coherent long-term strategy: on the contrary, the evolution and rationale <b>of</b> NATO <b>partnership</b> policy seem to be born out serendipity rather than design. So, 25 years after its inception, very few would object that such a policy presents mixed results. The aim of this paper is to discuss the promises and limits <b>of</b> NATO <b>partnership</b> policy. In order to articulate a balanced assessment, we will proceed as follows: after a short introduction on the main puzzles raised by the object of analysis, we will present a survey <b>of</b> the main <b>partnerships.</b> Departing from this background, we will take South Caucasus and the MENA region as case studies. Finally, by the light of this experience, we will offer a general framework to develop policy guidelines aimed at improving the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> NATO <b>partnership</b> polic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. While {{supplier}} relationship {{management is}} considered essential among supply management professionals, deliberate internal relationship management is often overlooked. Yet the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> internal <b>partnerships</b> determines whether supply management operates at the tactical or the strategic level. This session {{is based on}} over 25 years of proprietary research into the process <b>of</b> internal <b>partnerships</b> and recent interviews with 15 exemplary CPOs from Fortune 200 companies who have demonstrated success building productive, strategic internal client partnerships. Participants will explore a model to build and sustain strategic internal partnerships and learn helpful “success practices ” {{that can be used}} when working with their respective internal clients. Introduction. Over the past several years, supply management has been transforming its focus from transactional and tactical activities to more strategic work. That said, at most companies supply management is still not represented at the most senior management level, even though 50 - 75 percent of company revenue is spent for purchased goods and services. The continuing opportunity for supply management to transform the function and consequentl...|$|R
40|$|The {{collaboration}} between universities and industries {{has become increasingly}} important {{for the development of}} Science and Technology. This is particularly more prominent in the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Literature suggest that the key element <b>of</b> University-Industry <b>Partnership</b> (UIP) is the exchange of knowledge that is mutually beneficial for both parties. One real example of the collaborations is Industry-Based Learning (IBL) in which university students are coming into industries to experience and learn how the skills and knowledge acquired in the classroom are implemented in work places. This paper investigate how the University-Industry Collaboration program is implemented though Industry-Based Learning (IBL) at Indonesian Universities. The research findings offer useful insights and create a new knowledge in the field of STEM education and collaborative learning. The research will contribute to existing knowledge by providing empirical understanding of this topic. The outcomes can be used to improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> University-Industry <b>Partnership</b> programs at Indonesian Universities and inform Indonesian higher education authorities and their industrial partners of an alternative approach to enhance their IBL programs...|$|R
40|$|The School of Nursing at the University of The Free State (UFS) in South Africa (SA) {{has been}} advocating service {{learning}} and engagement with communities {{since the late}} nineties. Today the UFS is truly an engaged African university where faculty members use cross-border higher education to build capacity. Service learning fosters generic and discipline specific skills in {{students as well as}} empowers local communities. Curriculum based engagement in communities is one of the fundamental aspects of the service learning pedagogy. One of the key challenges, in order to provide students with appropriate learning opportunities, was to build sustainable partnerships where there was reciprocal acceptance and mutual respect for each other. In a case study qualified nurses who enrolled for a nursing education qualification mentored first year nursing students in a local community whereby course outcomes for both groups were met within an effective <b>partnership</b> milieu. The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> these <b>partnerships</b> was safeguarded through the use of self-evaluation instruments published by the SA Council of Higher Education in June 2006. Collaboration (1) was the key <b>quality</b> indicator <b>of</b> these <b>partnerships.</b> Roles, benefits and expectations were clarified by means of written memoranda of understanding as well as through mutual trust. Maintenance (2) <b>of</b> the <b>partnerships</b> through informal communication built trust between the partners. More formal communication such as regular meetings with the service sector and community representatives took place on an on-going basis. Monitoring and evaluation (3) of the impact was done rigorously through analysis of reflection reports and course evaluation documents. The results were utilised to plan the expansion (4) <b>of</b> the <b>partnership</b> timeously for the next cycle. Celebration (5) took place through a formal appreciation and show-casing event. Various stakeholders such as academics within other disciplines, community members, as well as service sector representatives attended. The celebration events facilitated closure and provided an opportunity to network and celebrate achievements. The above mentioned quality indicators fostered an enriched service learning experience for students who could focus on the course outcomes within stable, flourishing partnerships embedded in a cross-border educational environment...|$|R
