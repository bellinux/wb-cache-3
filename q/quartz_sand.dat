40|$|AbstractQuartz sand {{occurs in}} varying degrees of purity in {{dependence}} on the iron mineral composition, but {{only a small percentage}} is suitable for the glass industry after washing and magnetic separation treatment. Bioleaching in combination with washing can increase the quality of <b>quartz</b> <b>sands.</b> The addition of glucose in the leaching medium was important for the continuing leaching activity of iron by heterotrophic bacteria. The amount of bacterial iron removal was not directly proportional to the initial iron content of untreated samples. It was dependent on the mineralogical composition of the quartz sandswith kaolinite, illite encapsulated and sealed by goethite (Q 1), <b>quartz</b> <b>sands</b> with phengite, kaolinite encapsulated and sealed by siderite (Q 2), <b>quartz</b> <b>sands</b> with glauconite encapsulated and sealed by clinoptilolite and Fe smectite (Q 3). Heterotrophic bacteria decomposed these sealed polymineral grains with the iron dissolution and caused the formation of a fine–grained fraction of mineral particles predominantly below 49 μm in size. Bioleaching resulted in a 50 % decrease in Fe content of Q 1, in a 47 % decrease in Fe content of Q 2 and in a 30 % decrease in Fe content of Q 3 after 83 days bacterial treatment. This bioleaching pretreatment may be used for the decomposition of iron minerals sealed by silicate minerals and the removal iron surface coatings from different <b>quartz</b> <b>sands.</b> The elutriation process can removed the fine–grained iron particles bioformed after bioleaching. The reductive dissolution of iron polyminerals and washing process may have biotechnological application in the quality improvement of <b>quartz</b> <b>sands...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{prediction}} of ground response against wave propagation {{is essential for}} construction materials and the safe design of civil engineering infrastructures, such as, embankments, retaining walls, or foundations subjected to machine vibrations. For ground response analysis studies, the shear modulus and material damping, which are expressed {{as a function of}} shear strain, are the important properties of soils. The volumetric threshold strain is also a key property in order to evaluate possible permanent deformations or substantial increase in pore water pressure in saturated soils during dynamic loading. The paper presents dynamic test data derived from resonant column experiments on volcanic granular soils which are characterized by low unit weight and weak grains of intraparticle voids. These materials can be used as potential lightweight backfill in retaining walls or other applications with a demand in reduction of vertical or horizontal stresses to the ground and structural facilities. Additional experiments on <b>quartz</b> <b>sands</b> were conducted for comparison. The volcanic soils had much lower small-strain shear modulus than that of <b>quartz</b> <b>sands</b> and higher linearity in the range of medium strains, by means of normalized stiffness and material damping curves.

40|$|Commercial {{production}} {{and use of}} carbon-based nanomaterials will inevitably lead {{to the release of}} nanoscale compounds into to the environment. While fullerene nanoparticles, such as nC 60 and multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs), exhibit toxicity to certain microbes and human cell lines, their transport and deposition in subsurface environments are largely unknown. In this study, nanoparticle transport experiments were conducted in one-dimensional columns packed with water-saturated glass beads, <b>quartz</b> <b>sands,</b> or natural soil. Results demonstrated that nC 60 transport was strongly influenced by electrolyte species and concentration, as well as mean grain size and flow rate. The attachment of nC 60 was largely irreversible, with introduction of pH 12 water required to detach substantial quantities of retained nC 60. Measured nC 60 breakthrough curves and retention profiles in <b>quartz</b> <b>sands</b> suggest that the retention of nC 60 was primarily due to attachment in a first energy minimum and that clean-bed filtration theory alone was not sufficient to describe the experimental data. In the presence of stabilizing agents, including surfactant, fulvic and humic acids, significant enhancement of nC 60 transport in <b>quartz</b> <b>sands</b> was observed. In two natural soils, Appling and Webster soil, complete retention of nC 60 was observed, even after introducing up to 65 pore volumes of nC 60 suspension. However, nC 60 readily transported through Appling soil in the presence of surfactant. For MWNTs with a manufacture-reported (MR) length of 50 Î¼m readily transported through sand columns and the retention of MWNTs at higher input concentrations increased with the MR length. The data also suggested MWNTs exhibited higher mobility in <b>quartz</b> <b>sands</b> than nC 60 or single-wall nanotubes under similar chemical conditions. These findings advance our current understanding of fundamental processes governing nanoparticle transport and retention in porous media and provide reliable experimental data for the development of nanoparticle transport models.
