50|$|Noise shaping is a {{filtering}} {{process that}} shapes the spectral energy of quantisation error, typically to either de-emphasise frequencies {{to which the}} ear is most sensitive or separate the signal and noise bands completely. If dither is used, its final spectrum depends on whether it is added inside or outside the feedback loop of the noise shaper: if inside, the dither is treated {{as part of the}} error signal and shaped along with actual quantisation error; if outside, the dither is treated as part of the original signal and linearises quantisation without being shaped itself. In this case, the final noise floor is the sum of the flat dither spectrum and the shaped <b>quantisation</b> <b>noise.</b> While real-world noise shaping usually includes in-loop dithering, it is also possible to use it without adding dither at all, in which case the usual harmonic-distortion effects still appear at low signal levels.|$|E

Three noise sources are present in such an electromechanical closed loop system: mechanical noise due to Brownian motion, electronic noise introduced by the interface circuit due to thermal noise sources in the electronic devices and <b>quantisation</b> <b>noise</b> due to the analog to digital conversion process. It {{is well known that}} the sigma-delta modulator system shapes the <b>quantisation</b> <b>noise</b> in an advantageous way by attenuating it in the signalband. It is shown here that it also shapes the electronic noise favorably. However, this property is less pronounced. The Brownian noise remains unaffected in the signal band. With the outlined simulation procedures it is possible to predict the dominant noise contributions for different sampling frequencies of the sigma-delta control system and hence design an optimized control system.

The specification of the Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC) resolution constitutes {{one of the}} most critical activities in the design of digital UWB receivers. Moreover, multi-bit ADCs must be associated with an Automatic Gain Control block which avoids the sub-optimal regimes of the ADC dominated by <b>quantisation</b> or saturation <b>noise.</b> This paper shows how to determine the ADC resolution requirements and the optimal Automatic Gain Control (AGC) settings for the general class of digital receivers.

40|$|The Tor anonymisation network allows services, such as web servers, to be {{operated}} under a pseudonym. In previous work Murdoch described a novel attack to reveal such hidden services by correlating clock skew changes with times of increased load, and hence temperature. Clock skew measurement suffers from two main sources of noise: network jitter and timestamp quantisation error. Depending on the target’s clock frequency the <b>quantisation</b> <b>noise</b> can be orders of magnitude larger than the noise caused by typical network jitter. <b>Quantisation</b> <b>noise</b> limits the previous attacks to situations where a high frequency clock is available. It has been hypothesised that by synchronising measurements to the clock ticks, <b>quantisation</b> <b>noise</b> can be reduced. We show how such synchronisation can be achieved and maintained, despite network jitter. Our experiments show that synchronised sampling significantly reduces the quantisation error and the remaining noise only depends on the network jitter (but not clock frequency). Our improved skew estimates are up to two magnitudes more accurate for lowresolution timestamps and up to one magnitude more accurate for high-resolution timestamps, when compared to previous random sampling techniques. The improved accuracy not only allows previous attacks to be executed faster and with less network traffic but also {{opens the door to}} previously infeasible attacks on low-resolution clocks, including measuring skew of a HTTP server over the anonymous channel. ...|$|E

40|$|Optical {{orthogonal}} {{frequency division}} multiplexing (O-OFDM) {{is a potential}} candidate for 100 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and beyond due to its high spectral efficiency and strong resilience towards chromatic and polarization mode dispersion. In this thesis, investigations have been performed into the feasibility of O-OFDM in high speed optical fibre communications. First, an overview of OFDM fundamentals and optical fibre communications is given. Numerical simulations which were performed to characterise and optimise real-time OFDM transceivers are then presented. The effects {{of a variety of}} design parameters on the performance of the system are studied. Amongst the key parameters included in the study are the <b>quantisation</b> and clipping <b>noise</b> in data converters, and the quantisation errors in the fast Fourier transform and its inverse (FFT/IFFT). Optimum parameters that give the best trade-off between performance and cost in terms of bit precision are determined. It was found that these parameters depend on the modulation format as well as the size of the FFT used in the system. The thesis then presents the design of a multi-gigabit real-time O-OFDM transmitter based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. The 21. 4 GS/s real-time transmitter was built and used to transmit 8. 36 Gb/s directly-detected single sideband QPSK-OFDM signals over 1600 km of uncompensated standard single mode fibre. This {{was one of the first}} demonstrations of real-time OFDM transmitters operating at such high line rates. It remains the longest transmission distance achieved with a real-time OFDM transmitter. The next step in confirming the feasibility of O-OFDM involves the design and assessment of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations. In the final part of the thesis, digital signal processing (DSP) circuits for 21. 8 Gb/s and 43. 7 Gb/s QPSK- and 16 -QAM-encoded O-OFDM transceivers with 50 data subcarriers were designed at the register-transfer-level, and synthesis and simulations were carried out to assess their performance, power consumption, and chip area. The aim of the study is to determine the suitability of OFDM technology for low-cost optical interconnects. Power calculations based on synthesis for a 65 nm standard-cell library show that the DSP components of the transceiver consume 18. 2 mW/Gb/s and 12. 8 mW/Gb/s in the case of QPSK and 16 -QAM respectively. The effects of modulation format and FFT size on the area and power consumption of the transceivers are also quantified. Finally, characterisation results showing the trade-offs between energy consumption and chip footprint are presented and analysed to help designers optimise the transceivers according the requirements and specifications...|$|R

A particularly {{efficient way to}} implement such a modulator uses double-sampling where the sampling frequency is twice the master-clock frequency.

The power of the tones on the negative frequencies {{with respect to the}} main tone f remains almost unaffected, as expected because they do not arise from the RF non-linearities, but from the DAC non-linearities. The third and fifth harmonics of the tones on the negative frequencies lie below the noise floor. We also observe that the noise floor has increased by 20 dB. This is caused by the effect of the limited dynamic range of the ADCs of the receiver, which means that <b>quantisation</b> <b>noise</b> dominates thermal noise.
