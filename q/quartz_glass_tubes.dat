40|$|Low {{pressure}} discharges with indium halides as radiator {{are discussed}} as substitutes for hazardous mercury in conventional fluorescent lamps. In this work, {{the applicability of}} InBr and InCl in a low pressure discharge light source is investigated. The aim is to identify and understand the physical processes which determine the discharge characteristics and {{the efficiency of the}} generated near-UV emission of the indium halide molecule and of the indium atom which is created due to dissociation processes in the plasma. As discharge vessels sealed cylindrical <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> <b>tubes</b> which contain a defined amount of indium halide and a rare gas are used. Preliminary investigations showed that for a controlled variation of the indium halide density a well-defined cold spot setup is mandatory. This was realized in the utilized experimental setup. The use of metal halides raises the issue, that power coupling by internal electrodes is not possible as the electrodes would quickly be eroded by the halides. The comparison of inductive and capacitive RF-coupling with external electrodes revealed that inductively coupled discharges provide higher light output and much better long term stability. Therefore, all investigations are carried out using inductive RF-coupling. The diagnostic methods optical emission and white light absorption spectroscopy are applied. As the effects of absorption-signal saturation and reabsorption of emitted radiation within the plasma volume could lead to an underestimation of the determined population densities by orders of magnitude, these effects are considered in the data evaluation. In order to determine the electron temperature and the electron density from spectroscopic measurements, an extended corona model as population model of the indium atom has been set up. A simulation of the molecular emission spectra has been implemented to investigate the rovibrational population processes of the indium halide molecules. The impact of the cold spot temperature, the RF-power and the background gas type on the discharge characteristics is investigated for rare gas plasmas containing InBr or InCl. Varying the cold spot temperature yields a maximum efficiency around 210 to 230 degrees centigrade. At low cold spot temperatures the efficiency drops due to a too low indium halide density whereas reabsorption of emitted indium halide and indium photons limits the efficiency at high cold spot temperatures. Reducing the RF-power increases the discharge efficiency as the effect of reabsorption of the generated radiation is reduced. The utilized background gas does not influence the maximum efficiency as the discharge characteristics is solely determined by indium in the relevant cold spot temperature range. As reabsorption effects of the indium radiation are smaller with InCl, the highest efficiency of 24 per cent was obtained at a cold spot temperature of 230 degrees centigrade (40 W power, discharge vessel filled with 1 mbar argon and 1. 5 mg InCl). The potential of a low pressure indium halide discharge light source has been demonstrated by simulating the application of phosphors which yields an efficacy of about 60 lm/W.

However, the second wire mesh and combustor wall has red luminousity at high velocity reactant, indicate that they have high temperature and emmited heat radiation. Meso-scale combustor with double wire mesh has broader flame stability area if compared to combustor with single wire mesh. Extention of this region occured toward lower equivalence ratio for lean fuel mixture, as well as toward higher equivalence ratio for rich fuel mixture. The most important extention region of flame stability area is toward higher reactant flow rate.

The submicron pore channel system penetrating the material can be minimized in volume by infiltration of liquid polysilazane solution or by post-HIPing so that relative densities of 96 % can be reached. The monoliths are oxidation resistant up to 1600 OC in air due to the formation of a highly pure silica oxidation layer and they exhibit a creep rate of 1 - 10 - 6 s- 1 at 1650 °C and 30 MPa load. Initially x-ray amorphous silicon carbonitride can be crystallized in nitrogen or in air to form Si 3 N 4 ISiC or Si 3 N 4 ISiClC nanocomposites. Fusible polyhydridomethylsilazane [CH?SiHNH],[(CHq) 2 SiNHl, with a molecular weight distribution of 900 - 1100 is thermally crosslinked at 400 OC for 2 h under argon atmosphere and for 1 h under vacuum (5. 10 - 3 mbar).

40|$|The {{vaporization}} {{of tungsten}} from the APT spallation target dominates the radiological source term for unmitigated target overheating accidents. Chemical reactions of tungsten with steam which persist to tungsten temperatures {{as low as}} 800 C result {{in the formation of}} a hydrated tungsten-oxide which has a high vapor pressure and is readily convected in a flowing atmosphere. This low-temperature vaporization reaction essentially removes the oxide film that forms on the tungsten-metal surface as soon as it forms, leaving behind a fresh metallic surface for continued oxidation and vaporization. Experiments were conducted to measure the oxidative vaporization rates of tungsten in steam as part of the effort to quantify the MT radiological source term for severe target accidents. Tests were conducted with tungsten rods (1 / 8 inch diameter, six inches long) heated to temperatures from approximately 700 C to 1350 C in flowing steam which was superheated to 140 C. A total of 19 experiments was conducted. Fifteen tests were conducted by RF induction heating of single tungsten rods held vertical in a <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> retort. Four tests were conducted in a vertically-mounted tube furnace for the low temperature range of the test series. The aerosol which was generated and transported downstream from the tungsten rods was collected by passing the discharged steam through a condenser. This procedure insured total collection of the steam along with the aerosol from the vaporization of the rods. The results of these experiments revealed a threshold temperature for tungsten vaporization in steam. For the two tests at the lowest temperatures which were tested, approximately 700 C, the tungsten rods were observed to oxidize without vaporization. The remainder of the tests was conducted over the temperature range of 800 C to 1350 C. In these tests, the rods were found to have lost weight due to vaporization of the tungsten and the missing weight was collected in the downstream condensate system. The aerosol formed a fine white smoke of tungsten-oxide which was visible to the eye as it condensed in the laminar boundary layer of steam which flowed along the surface of the rod.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of black liquor to white liquor {{is carried out}} in the chemical recovery system, which is made up of several units; in two of them, i. e. the recovery boiler and the rotary kiln, sintering plays an important role. To study what influences sintering of recovery boiler dust, several dusts of different compositions were heat treated and their sintering behaviour examined. Sintering was measured as the reduction of the specific surface area. It was shown that, besides temperature and sintering time, the first melting temperature of the dust strongly influences the degree of sintering. The lower the first melting temperature, the lower the specific surface area. The reduction of the specific surface area with time was found to agree with the German Munir equation. It is important, for several reasons, to know what influences sintering of reburned lime mud in the rotary kiln. Different kinds of experiments were run. First, a <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> <b>tube</b> reactor was used to reburn lime mud of different compositions in different sintering atmospheres. It was found that the degree of sintering depends on the compound the lime mud was doped with. Generally speaking, a higher concentration of the foreign compound resulted in a higher degree of sintering. The results suggest that the melting point of the doped solid influences the sintering process as well, with more sintering for low melting point solids. It was also shown that carbon dioxide in the sintering atmosphere strongly effects sintering. Even small amounts enhanced the sintering behaviour significantly and, at partial pressures of carbon dioxide corresponding to equilibrium, the reduction of the specific surface area was very rapid. The German Munir equation was used as a base to develop models that describe the reduction of the specific surface area as functions of time, temperature, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and concentration of the different doping compounds. Pellets formed either of lime mud or reburned lime mud were heat treated in a muffle furnace and their strength was measured. It was shown that not only the temperature and time but also the compact pressure markedly influence the strength of the pellets. Also, when forming pellets out of already calcined lime mud, the pellets became much stronger. Finally, lime mud was reburned in a pilot scale rotary kiln. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the sintering atmosphere was varied, and it could thereby be seen how the specific surface area depends on the residual carbonate. Two different lime muds were used, and they showed different behaviours. The first reached a minimum in specific surface area at about 10 weight-% of residual carbonate, whilst for the second, the specific surface area decreased with increasing residual carbonate over the whole range investigated. Rings and balls were formed, and the strength of the balls increased with increasing residual carbonate...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{investigation}} of application peculiarities of ellipsometry methods and UF spectrophotometry at mechanical and chemical processing of optical engineering surface elements made of <b>quartz</b> <b>glass.</b> Ellipsometer LEF– 3 M– 1, spectrophotometer SF– 26 and interferometer MII– 4 {{are used as}} experiment tools; they obtain widely known technical characteristics. Polarization characteristics of reflected light beam were measured by ellipsometry method; spectrophotometry method was used for measuring radiation transmission factor in UF spectrum area; by interference method surface layer thickness at <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> etching was measured. A method for HF–sectioning of inhomogeneous surface layer of polished <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> is developed based on ellipsometry equation for reflection system «inhomogeneous layer – inhomogeneous padding». The method {{makes it possible to}} carry out the measuring and analysis of optical characteristics for inhomogeneous layers system on inhomogeneous padding and to reconstruct optical profile of surface layers at <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> chemical processing. For definition of refractive index change along the layer depth, approximation of experimental values for polarization characteristics of homogeneous layers system is used. Inhomogeneous surface layer of polished <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> consists of an area (with thickness up to 20 nm) and layer refractive index less than refractive index for <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> and an area (with thickness up to 0, 1 μm) and layer refractive index larger than refractive index for <b>quartz</b> <b>glass.</b> Ellipsometry and photometry methods are used for definition of technological conditions and optical characteristics of inhomogeneous layers at <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> chemical processing for optical elements with minimum radiation losses in UF spectrum area...|$|R

Welded components made of <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> are applied in high-temperature engineering for laser and optics applications. <b>Quartz</b> <b>glass</b> was joined without interlayers {{in order to maintain}} optical characteristics of the joining partners. Based on the principles of joint formation of pure SiO 2 -glass in the solid state, a joining technology, using diffusion welding, is described and the joints are analysed. Diffusion welding, realized at near-transformation temperature, results in an increase of polymerization and formation of an optical thin joining layer.

In this paper, ultra-precision {{shaping and}} ultra-smooth {{polishing}} investigations {{have been done}} upon a high-purity <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> substrate with an aspheric surface in nanoparticle colloid jet machining, which is an ultra smooth surface processing technique utilizing surface chemical reaction between work surface atoms and nanoparticles to remove the uppermost surface atoms. The shaping and polishing characters of high-purity <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> in nanoparticle colloid jet machining has been researched. The surface profile of the high-purity <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> workpiece before and after shaping has been measured by surface profilometer. And the surface microscopic morphological characteristics of high-purity <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> surface polished by nanoparticle colloid jet machining have been observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

40|$|Two oxygens {{of which}} δ(18) O is + 28. 83 and - 79. 57 ‰, respectively, were {{converted}} into carbon dioxide {{by means of}} both an external heating method and a Daylight's method where a graphite rod was heated by concentration of light from a slide projecter lamp on the graphite rod, and the δ(18) O of carbon dioxides obtained in the two methods were compared to each other. Except for data affected by memory of the previous sample, the averages in the external heating method were + 28. 85 and - 79. 56 ‰, respectively, and quite consistent with the averages in the Daylight's method, that were + 28. 81 and - 79. 67 ‰, respectively. This concludes that no oxygen isotope exchange occurs between the sample gas and the <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> of reaction <b>tube</b> in the external heating method. There is {{no significant difference in}} the results in four externally heated carbon furnaces, whereas the memory of previous samples was apparently observed within each furnaces. This memory was larger in the furnaces containing a used graphite rod (Nos. 3 and 4) than those containing new one (Nos. 1 and 2), and also more significant for smaller samples (Run 4 in No. 3). However, if the reaction tube was baked out at a higher temperature (750 ℃) than the reaction temperature (700 ℃) before reaction, the memory was mostly eliminated (Run 8 in No. 3) ...|$|R
