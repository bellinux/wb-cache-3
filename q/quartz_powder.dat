When the excavated <b>quartz</b> <b>powder</b> was processed, an issue arose from the fact that such large pieces of quartz glass would require three years of gradual cooling to remove any internal stress. Xu Zhaocai (徐兆采), a senior technician of the 605th Factory, solved this problem by developing a technique of welding twenty square centimeter pieces into a larger two square meter plate. This was carried out by a senior technician named Shi Weicheng (石维成), who used a hydrogen-oxygen flame gun to reach the necessary temperatures of nearly [...] (even the metallic protective gear Shi wore proved vulnerable to the heat and he had other workers pour water onto him to keep him cool). To grind down the 100 mm crystal plates to the specified 45 mm, the 608th factory staff had to use a single West German 2 m precision grinding machine and eight planer-type milling machines in the Beijing First Machine Tool Factory.|$|E

In this paper a cyclic design method based on particle packing is presented and evaluated {{on the basis of}} experiments on cement pastes combined with <b>quartz</b> <b>powder.</b> The packing density of sixteen pastes is measured using the mixing energy test. Furthermore, the cement pastes were tested on compressive strength at 7 and 28 days. Adding <b>quartz</b> <b>powder</b> M 600 can increase the packing density by more than 10 %. This means that fine quartz powders can improve the packing density to such extent that the cement content can be decreased while simultaneously the water cement ratio is decreased. This occurs for pastes with a packing density higher than the completely saturated packing density of cement. Additional strength tests were performed on two mixtures with constant water cement ratio and showed a 15 % strength increase when 20 % of the cement was replaced by <b>quartz</b> <b>powder</b> M 600.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} an improved simple, sample-mounting method for random powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), namely the razor tamped surface (RTS) method, which prepares a powder mount by tamping the loose powder with the sharp {{edge of a}} razor blade.
