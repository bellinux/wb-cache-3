40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relation between reported financial performance and qualitative disclosure in {{the research and development}} (R&D) disclosure setting. While the influence of performance on firms’ disclosure decisions is a fundamental issue in the accounting literature, prior studies generally focus on how performance relates to the disclosure of quantitative financial information that directly summarizes financial performance. However, a significant quantity of firms’ disclosure is not directly captured in the financial statements and is more qualitative in nature (e. g., narratives or text). Using a sample firms make R&D investments, I investigate whether reported earnings performance influences firms’ incentives to disclose qualitative R&D-related information. I hypothesize that as current earnings performance decreases, R&D firms’ incentives to provide more R&D-related disclosure increase because lower earnings performance is associated with less useful financial statements and higher information asymmetry. Based on a detailed analysis of R&D-related disclosures, I find, consistent with my hypothesis, that current earnings performance is negatively related to qualitative disclosure. I also find that this relation is more pronounced for firms that place more importance on R&D and for firms with higher outside monitoring. In addition, I examine whether the qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>disclosures</b> of R&D firms relate differently to reported performance. While my main results suggest that reported earnings performance is negatively associated with R&D-related disclosure, I find that R&D firms’ decisions to provide earnings guidance, a more quantitative type of disclosure, are positively related to reported performance. These findings highlight the complexity of firms’ disclosure strategies and suggest that performance can influence different types of disclosures in different ways. Thus, these findings have important implications for future research that considers firms disclosure decisions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the merits of}} two approaches to social impact measurement that are currently the subject of debate within the third sector: social accounting and audit (SAA) and social return on investment (SROI). Although there are significant similarities between the methods, {{a number of important}} differences remain. In particular, while SAA involves a more ‘conventional’ mix of narrative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>disclosures,</b> SROI outcomes are more explicitly quantitative and reductive. This is most evident in the production of the ‘SROI ratio’, which calculates a monetised ‘return’ on a notional £ 1 of investment. In the UK, with available resources becoming increasingly scarce, the third sector is facing demands for increased accountability as well as being encouraged to ‘scale up’ in preparation for assuming greater responsibility for public service delivery. In this context, {{it is easy to see}} why the simplicity and clarity of SROI is attractive to policy-makers, fundraisers and investors, who are keen to quantify and express social value creation and thus make comparative assessments of social value. However, this apparent simplicity also risks reducing the measurement of social impact to a potentially meaningless or even misleading headline figure and should therefore be treated with caution. This is especially so where exact measures are unobtainable, and approximations, or so-called ‘financial proxies’, are used. The use of such proxies is highly subjective, especially when dealing with ‘softer’ outcomes. There is nothing to prevent SROI being used within an SAA framework: indeed, a greater emphasis on quantitative data could improve many social accounts. Nevertheless, we conclude that current efforts to promote SROI adoption, to the likely detriment of SAA, may ultimately promote a one-dimensional funder- and investor-driven approach to social impact measurement in the third sector...|$|E

Drawing on impression management studies, this study seeks to detect manipulations in this disclosure practice. A manual content analysis of reports available on the IIRC website and a multivariate statistical analysis reveal that firms offer biased IR disclosures. Firms not only provide limited forward-looking and <b>quantitative</b> <b>disclosure</b> of their actions to achieve sustainability outcomes but also avoid providing information about their sustainability performance when their social and environmental results are poor.

30|$|If the {{relationship}} between the hypothesized cost and quality of CSR reporting is true, as reflected in Parabola A, it would explain a great many things. First, that while there is a cost involved in transitioning from being a non-reporter into a CSR reporter (Perrini 2005; Daub 2007; Chen and Bouvain, 2008; Hahn and Kühnen 2013; Fernandez-Feijoo et al. 2014), that the benefits for some firms outweigh the costs for firms that are able to move beyond the vertex to {{the right side of the}} parabola. It further explains why the cost of CSR reporting may increase without an improvement, indeed with a decline, in the quality of CSR reporting. If the quality of CSR reporting is defined as the provision of measurable, consistently tracked, and regularly disseminated outcome-based performance data (Gray et al. 1987; Wood 1991 b; Wood and Jones 1995; Elkington 1998), then CSR reports which expand to include the greater use of narrative, including more anecdotal examples and colorful illustrations, would be associated with both a higher cost of production and a simultaneous decline in reporting quality. Further, it offers a rationale as to why firms have not adopted more quantitative, analytical assessments of their CSR practices and performance that has been raised previously (Gray et al., 1987; Elkington 1998): because the incremental benefit of enhanced <b>quantitative</b> <b>disclosure</b> (as represented by the right half of the parabola) is presently offset by the incremental cost that coincides with firms expanding upon their CSR narratives.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, the rapid {{economic}} growth of China has attracted increasing research on its corporate governance and disclosure practices. However, there is, in general, {{a lack of understanding}} from the outside world due to the specific knowledge needed of the unique situation of China. In addition, previous studies lack research on the relationship between corporate governance and environmental disclosure in developing countries. In this thesis, the roles of ownership structure and board composition on the extent of environmental disclosure in the annual reports are examined through evidence from the Chinese market. The sample of this research is collected from both the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and Shanghai Stock Exchange (SHSE). In this study, the quantity of environmental disclosure (measured by the mechanistic content analysis approach) and the quality of environmental disclosure (measured by the interpretative approach) are employed to estimate environmental disclosure variables. The results indicate that both qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> environmental <b>disclosures</b> increase with state ownership, greater blockholder ownership, and with a larger supervisory board. Environmental disclosures are not significantly associated with the proportion of independent directors on the board of directors. Furthermore, this study denotes that much less environmental information is disclosed in the annual reports of most Chinese listed companies compared to those of developed countries and so China is in a budding stage of development in disclosure practice. It suggests that firms should reveal more environmental information in the future for a win-win situation between themselves and their stakeholders under the stakeholder-agency framework. This thesis also examines how the market reacts to qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> environmental <b>disclosures</b> from annual reports during relatively long periods, compared with the event study. Using two sets of databases (CCER and CSMAR) and annual reports from two Stock Exchanges, financial data and environmental disclosure information are collected to test the regressions using Chinese observations between 2009 and 2011. Voluntary environmental disclosure in the annual report is expected to provide value relevant information in the Chinese market based on signalling theory and the concept of information asymmetry. The findings indicate that <b>quantitative</b> environmental <b>disclosure</b> is positively value relevant in the market, and it also influences the firm value in the subsequent year; in contrast, qualitative environmental disclosure merely relates to the firm value in the same year, but it does not affect the subsequent year. The uniqueness of China motivates the research on corporate governance in China, which would be a reference for countries processing similar mechanisms or attempting to advance their corporate governance. This research contributes to the existing literature on accounting about corporate governance, managerial structure, and disclosure practice in fast growing developing countries such as China. It enhances the understanding of influences from different corporate governance compositions on environmental disclosure. In addition, this research contributes to the knowledge about the association between market value and environmental information in fast developing countries such as China based on a large sample during consecutive years. Moreover, it is an up-to-date empirical research, which enhances the understanding in terms of qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> environmental <b>disclosures</b> and provides useful information for various stakeholders...|$|R

We test for this relationship across three samples of firms that provide the mandated market risk disclosures {{for the first time in}} the 10 -K reports.

We find limited evidence of a decline in trading volume associated with changes in energy commodity prices, and no evidence of a decline in trading volume associated with change in non-energy commodity prices. We explore several explanations for the weaker commodity price results, some relating to potential deficiencies in the reported commodity information and others to research design issues. In general, we interpret the results as providing evidence suggesting that the SEC's <b>quantitative</b> market risk <b>disclosures</b> reduce investor disagreements about firms' exposure to market risks. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether mandated {{market risk}} disclosures under the SEC Financial Reporting Release No. 48 (FRR 48) provide useful information to investors regarding firms' risk exposures. To provide evidence {{on this issue}} we investigate whether the SEC disclosures reduce investor uncertainty and diversity of opinion {{about the implications of}} market rate or price changes for firm value. We expect this reduced uncertainty and diversity of opinion to manifest itself in a decline in the amount of daily trading volume associated with market rate or price changes after the disclosures are made public. To test this hypothesis we introduce the trading volume risk response coefficient (TVRRC), which measures the association between daily movements in market rates or prices and the daily percentages of a firm's shares traded, after controlling for other factors that affect trading volume. We examine whether downward shifts in the TVRRC occurred after the 10 -K filing dates for a sample of firms that first made FRR 48 disclosures in their 1997 SEC reports. We find such downward shifts in the TVRRC for firms disclosing market risk information about interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and energy price exposures. We also test for differences in results across the three <b>quantitative</b> <b>disclosure</b> methods allowed by FRR 48 (tabular, sensitivity and value at risk). We find downward TVRRC shifts for firms reporting interest rate exposures using any of the three methods, but only for firms reporting sensitivity or value at risk for exposures to foreign currency exchange rates. To rule out alternative explanations for the results, we focus on two control samples: (1) the original disclosure sample in the year before the SEC rule was effective and (2) a non-disclosure sample consisting of firms subject to the SEC rule that did not make market risk disclosures in the first fiscal year the rule was effective. We do not find significant shifts in TVRRC around these 10 -K filing dates in either sample. We therefore interpret the downward shifts in TVRRC for the first-time disclosers as evidence supporting the hypothesis that the SEC-mandated disclosures reduce investor uncertainty and diversity of opinion about the implications of market rate or price changes for firm value. ...|$|R

Regarding accounting changes, the analysis shows that the reported impacts by companies confirmed expectations based on prior de jure studies on major impacts of changing from Portuguese GAAP to IFRS; these major impacts regard the recognition of intangibles, the accounting treatment of goodwill and financial instruments. Finally, Gray’s (1980) “conservatism” index was computed using the reconciliated profits to IFRS reported by companies. This analysis shows that Portuguese standards are more conservative than IFRS. This study is relevant to several parties: to the market regulators and policy makers in predicting the level of compliance with IFRS and calling attention for the importance of enforcement mechanisms; to the preparers, auditors and users in identifying the most problematic areas of implementation of IFRS.

40|$|Risk {{disclosure}} {{has received}} considerable interest and attention in recent times. The {{aim of this}} research is to examine risk information disclosure in annual reports with the aim of establishing trends. Further, this research empirically examines the influence of four firm factors on the level of risk disclosure in the annual reports. These factors are firm size, leverage, industry and US-dual listing. In addition, the research examines the association between risk disclosure and the company's cost of equity capital (and information asymmetry) after controlling for firm size and market beta. The annual reports of a sample comprising 52 UK non-financial companies, drawn from the FTSE- 100 index, for three different periods (1998, 2001, and 2004) were sought, collected, and analysed. Content analysis was applied and risk disclosure in the annual report was measured according to the number of sentences disclosed and trends were analysed over the six-year period. Risk disclosure sentences were classified according to four main quality dimensions: type of risk, the nature of the evidence, the type of news disclosed, and news time-frame. A four-stage dividend growth model was used to measure the company's cost of equity capital. Bid-ask spread and stock volatility were also used as proxies for information asymmetry. Only when investors perceive that the information is relevant, risk information disclosed in the annual report can lead to a reduction in the cost of equity capital. The study found, in aggregate, a trend of increasing amounts of risk disclosure in the annual report. Risk disclosure was found primarily qualitative; good and neutral; and non-time. There is minimal disclosure of quantified risk information and bad news information. These results suggest that accounting rules and regulations, in addition to recommendations from accounting institutions, have influenced the increase in the level of risk information disclosed, though without ensuring the quality of the disclosed risk information. US-dual listing and industry are found to be significantly related to risk disclosure, but firm size and leverage are found to have insignificant association with the level of risk disclosure. These findings suggest that the extent of annual report risk disclosure is driven more by regulation than by the market. The findings reveal that for the largest UK companies with high analyst following, no relation was found between risk disclosure level and cost of equity capital. However, the study found that both quantitative and bad news risk information are significantly and negatively related to stock volatility. Moreover, a significant and negative association was found between bad news risk disclosure and bid-ask spread. This suggests that firms with greater bad news and <b>quantitative</b> <b>disclosure</b> enjoy a reduction in information asymmetry as measured by proxies for information asymmetry. Overall, the analysis suggests that UK companies make substantial risk disclosure but the usefulness of this disclosure is limited. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Our paper {{focuses on}} {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) disclosures made by 98 listed companies, across industries. Content analysis methodology was used. The purpose of our study {{is to examine the}} incidence of CSR disclosures in annual reports. Studies on CSR disclosures in developing countries are limited {{and in the case of}} Malaysia, the most recent published studies on CSR were in the eighties. The present study fills this gap in the literature. The sample selectedcomprises a representative cross-section of the industrial sectors in the Main Board of the KLSE. Previous studies have used ad-hoc samples, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Findings from the study suggest that the disclosures have a public-relations bias, with a very general, ‘good news’ type of disclosures being the norm. Consistent with prior studies in other developing countries, <b>quantitative</b> or monetary <b>disclosures,</b> as well as ‘bad news’ disclosures are minimal.

40|$|Beginning in 2005, the SEC {{required}} {{firms to}} include qualitative disclosures {{of risk factors}} in item 1 A in their annual 10 -K forms. In this paper, we examine the textual content of this section and determine whether it reflects the firm’s performance. We first categorized each risk disclosure that a firm presented into one of 29 categories and then examined these categorizations. Our investigation yields three main results. First, we find that several risk factor categories, such as government and competitive risks, are common across our sample of firms. Second, we find that a firm’s industry classification (as given by its SIC code) is not a differentiating factor in the disclosures that a firm makes. Third, we find that risk factor disclosures are generally not predictive of a firm’s financial performance {{in the form of}} leverage, capital structure, cash, and acquisitions. Our analysis expands on previous work by considering the content of the disclosures in more detail rather than focusing on more <b>quantitative</b> characteristics of <b>disclosures...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompanies {{from the}} European Union {{listed on the}} stock {{exchange}} are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards since 2005. Thus, {{the aim of this}} research is to investigate the degree of compliance of financial statement of listed companies on the stock exchange with International Financial Reporting Standards. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the information disclosed by entities that are applying International Financial Reporting Standards, in this case information on the tangible, intangible assets and impairment of assets. The study provides an empirical research of reporting financial statements in accordance with IFRS. Therefore, the current research is a <b>quantitative</b> one, using <b>Disclosure</b> Index to measure the level of exposure of information regarding the assets. The results demonstrate both the applicability, but also the validity of the model Disclosure Index; thus there is a link between the variables analyzed and disclosures in accordance with IAS 16, IAS 36 and IAS 38...|$|R
40|$|A major {{objective}} of the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s financial instruments project, inclusive of SFAS 105, SFAS 107 and SFAS 119, is to provide information useful to investors in assessing the credit and market rish {{associated with the use}} of off-balance-sheet ifnancial instruments. We survey 1992 SFAS 105 and SFAS 107 disclosures on Foreign Exchange Derivatives (FXD) to: (1) benchmark current practice by summarizing <b>quantitative</b> and qualitative <b>disclosures</b> of FXD, and (2) examine the usefulness of current disclosures in assessing market and credit rish related to FXD. In achieving these objectives, we provide insight into how leading U. S. multinationals operationalize accounting standards related to off-balance-sheet financial instruments and identify disclosrue attributes of footnotes unarticulateld to the financial statements. We conclude from our survey that (1) some firms make extensive us of FXD, (2) there is substantial compliance with SFAS 105 and SFAS 107 requirements, (3) large dealers comply with the FASB 2 ̆ 7 s credit rish disclosure requirements, (4) book and air values of FXD are small relative to contract and notional amounts and (5) disclosures providing information on market rish are deficient due to lack of both specificity and quantification...|$|R
40|$|AIFIRM {{believes}} that the a Pillar 2 approach, where banks are allowed, subject to supervisory approval, to use internal measurement systems (IMS) for assessing their ability to cover potential losses from IRRBB, is the best suited option. In fact, the standardization associated with a Pillar 1 approach {{would lead to a}} lower precision of the risk exposure estimate and a poorer comprehension of the factors that determine it. By adopting a Pillar 1 approach, there is a higher probability that banks set aside an amount of internal capital that either underestimates or overestimates its appropriate amount, entailing a potential threat to the overall banking stability and an unnecessary reduction in lending capacity, respectively. AIFIRM welcomes the consideration of multiple scenarios because it is a step forward in the comprehension of risk determinants. The new mathematical framework allows to obtain a measure of risk exposure that is more consistent with the level of interest rates observed on the evaluation date and, therefore, represents an important improvement, if compared with the current one, which is based on unrealistic duration coefficients. The new framework can also be easily integrated within banks’ IMS for the implementation of more sophisticated methodologies. The Association {{believes that}} option n. 4 is the best-suited among those proposed by the Committee to calculate minimum capital requirements because it allows the net interest profit (NIP) to reduce minimum capital requirements associated with the change to economic value of equity (EVE) and earnings. This approach is based on the presence of many positions characterized by locked-in margins, which will generate a positive interest income even when EVE is at its highest. Following this method, minimum capital requirements are more consistent with banks’ actual riskiness and banks’ credit supply is calibrated in a more appropriate way. Within a Pillar 2 approach, minimum capital requirements may be based on both: i) stressed scenarios of changes in the key-rates that are consistent with the six proposed scenarios, in terms of both shock magnitude and structure, and ii) scenarios obtained through banks’ internal measurement systems. However, AIFIRM believes that further discussions and analyses on the NIP calibration are necessary. As concerns the treatment of the items characterized by behavioral options, AIFIRM recognizes the utility of introducing some constraints in modelling non-maturity deposits (NMDs), even in cases of banks’ own internal representations, since they could contribute to the reduction of the model risk. However, they seem to be too conservative giving rise, even in the discretionary approach, to a unique representation of NMDs. According to AIFIRM, based on the analysis of historical data of the Italian banking market: i) the allocation of the repricing component of NMDs may be led by the interest rate pass-through that follows a change in the reference market rate; ii) the core component of NMDs should include not only the fraction of non-maturity deposits that are stable, but also the portion that reprice, with a certain sluggishness, when the reference market rate changes. Finally, as regards positions other than NMDs, the Association agrees with the choice to model their optionalities using a two step approach. Within the supported solution of an enhanced Pillar 2 capital framework, AIFIRM believes that public disclosure on a regular basis of a bank’s IRRBB risk profile, key measurement assumptions, qualitative and quantitative assessment of IRRBB levels and <b>quantitative</b> <b>disclosure</b> of IRRBB metrics, is crucial. Banks should describe in detail the qualitative information required in BCBS (2015) for disclosure purposes since these are issues of particular relevance in estimating banks' risk exposure. As for the quantitative information, if appropriate public disclosure is important, disclosure of standardized calculation could be misleading. By using the standardized calculation, the proposed Pillar 2 approach is no different from the proposed Pillar 1. Supporting a “true” Pillar II approach, AIFIRM believes that banks' internal measurement and management of IRRBB are those which ought to be disclosed. This document is organized as follows: paragraph 1 comments on the choice between a Pillar 1 and a Pillar 2 solutions; in section 2, we discuss some of the main issues associated with the interest rate scenario design; section 3 deals with the specification of minimum capital requirements; in section 4 we analyze the treatment of the positions with behavioral options; section 5 provides some comments on the disclosure requirements...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{examines}} {{the association between}} a firm’s extent and precision of customer value disclosure and its implied cost of equity capital. In addition, we investigate whether industry competition intensity attenuates this association. Design/methodology/approach: We analyze the content of corporate websites from four continental European countries on the presence and precision of customer value information and empirically test whether content and precision {{are associated with the}} firm’s implied cost of equity capital measurement. Findings: The results show a negative association between cross-sectional differences in the extent of customer value disclosure and cross-sectional differences in a firm’s cost of equity capital. In addition, the precision of the customer value information disclosed affects this association. We observe a negative relationship between quantitative (or hard) customer value disclosure and a firm’s cost of equity capital, but not for qualitative (or soft) customer value disclosure. As expected, industry competition intensity attenuates the association between <b>quantitative</b> customer value <b>disclosures</b> and a firm’s cost of equity capital. Research limitations/implications: We consider web placement of customer value disclosure although a firm might disclose such information through other information channels as well. Practical implications: A firm tends to benefit economically from more precise customer value disclosure. Originality/value: We extend existing evidence by considering the capital market implications of disclosing customer value information. In addition, we examine whether industry competition affects the association between customer value disclosure and the firm’s cost of equity capital. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – There is {{conjecture}} {{that small}} and mid-cap companies in highly speculative industries use frequent and repetitive disclosure to promote price volatility and heighten market interest. Excessive disclosure could indicate instances of self-promotion or poor disclosure practices, and these habits could mislead investors. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to quantitatively investigate the impact of firm disclosure on price volatility in the Australian stock market. Design/methodology/approach – This paper considers the effect of information disclosure on the daily stock price volatility of 340 Metals & Mining industry entities listed on the Australian Securities Exchange over the period 2005 - 2007 using regression analysis. Findings – The results indicate the number of disclosures, the number of price and non-price sensitive disclosures and the number of disclosures by category has a significant influence on daily price volatility. Moreover, the volatility impact of disclosure is greater for small and mid-sized firms than large firms. Research limitations/implications – Price volatility is calculated using daily data; intra-day stock prices could provide measures that are more accurate. There is also no attempt to allow for asymmetry in disclosure; categorizing news as “good” or “bad” would allow better insights. Practical implications – There is support for the conjecture that disclosure could serve as a self-promotion tool through fabricated and repetitive announcements. Inadvertent poor disclosure practice could also result in excessive price volatility. Disclosure practice requires ongoing consideration by regulatory bodies. Originality/value – This analysis complements basic work by the Australian regulator to establish a <b>quantitative</b> link between <b>disclosure</b> practice and price volatility.
