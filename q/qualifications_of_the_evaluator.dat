40|$|Graduation date: 1993 <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to explore factors which {{influence}} Taiwanese vocational teachers' participation in program evaluations, use of evaluative results and, in turn, program improvement. Twelve Taiwanese public vocational high school teachers were interviewed during February and March 1992. To confirm <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teachers, 12 school administrators and ten external evaluators were also interviewed. The literature indicates that teachers' participation in evaluation may be influenced by their self-esteem, perceived <b>qualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>evaluators,</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaluation methods, and their subculture. These concepts are applicable but from a somewhat different perspective in Taiwan. Teachers do not seem to feel that they are active participants in evaluations and that evaluations may have little consequence to what they do. Current evaluation practices and purposes appear to be quite different than those described in official documents. These differences seem to be inevitable because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cultural determinants <b>of</b> "saving face," "reciprocal obligation," and maintaining "social harmony. " Evaluations appear ritualistic and ineffective as means to engage teachers in improving <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> vocational evaluation on a systematic and sustained basis. Based on the findings, it was proposed that alternative evaluation methodologies should be employed. For short-term improvement, the evaluations should begin with teachers. Teachers need materials, help from experienced and expert teachers, training, and time to fulfill their evaluation responsibilities. Teachers would collect and analyze information and then use it to improve their instruction. Selected information would then be passed up to administrators and ultimately to <b>the</b> Ministry <b>of</b> Education. For long-term improvement, the principles and techniques of Total Quality Management should be applied to assure <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> vocational education programs in Taiwan...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a new evaluator {{capable of handling}} noncircular or circular attribute grammars. <b>The</b> <b>evaluator</b> combines recursive evaluation of attribute instances and dynamic determination <b>of</b> paths in <b>the</b> compound dependency graph for a given input.

Instead, the production-labelled semantic tree <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input and <b>the</b> dependency graphs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> productions which implicitly represent the compound dependency graph are used. <b>The</b> incremental version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evaluator</b> is obtained by a simple modification. It avoids re-evaluation of those attribute instances whose values are not affected by <b>the</b> modifications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input. <b>The</b> <b>evaluator</b> has time complexity linear in <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> attributes needed to specify <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input string, and has space complexity linear in <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parse tree...|$|R

30|$|Conceptualizing {{corporate}} {{reputation as}} an attitudinal concept places a clear focus on <b>the</b> <b>evaluator</b> perspective (Sects. 4.1. 2, 4.1. 5).

With emphasizing <b>the</b> <b>evaluator</b> perspective, corporate reputation is linked to social judgement theory (Sect. 4.1. 5). The focus on attitudinal aspects puts an emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>evaluator</b> at <b>the</b> conceptual level. Reputation results from an evaluation. This evaluation is about <b>the</b> attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporation. <b>The</b> separation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attributes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corporation and <b>the</b> attitudes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>evaluator</b> should positively contribute to the coherence and differentiation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept.
