5|$|Croatia {{qualified}} for and competed in three consecutive World Cup finals between 1998 and 2006, {{but failed to}} qualify for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after finishing 3rd in Group 6 of their <b>Qualification</b> <b>Group</b> behind England, and Ukraine. Although they had joined both FIFA and UEFA by 1992, they were unable to enter the 1994 World Cup as qualification had started before the side was officially recognised. The nation's best performance came in their first World Cup where they finished third. In their following two World Cup campaigns they were eliminated after finishing third in their groups.|$|E
5|$|On 29 March 2015, Ødegaard {{became the}} {{youngest}} player to start a European Championship qualifier {{at the age of}} 16 years and 101 days in a 5–1 loss to Croatia. On 8 June, he was man of the match in Norway's 0–0 friendly draw with Scandinavian rivals Sweden in Oslo. After Norway came third in their <b>qualification</b> <b>group,</b> Ødegaard was named in their squad for a play-off against Hungary. Unused in the first leg, he was substituted at half time in the second on 15 November, as Norway lost 2–1 on the night and 3–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|As well as holding Sunderland games, {{the stadium}} has also hosted England matches. The stadium {{was one of}} several venues used as {{temporary}} home grounds for the England team while the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium took place. It hosted its first England game in 1999, when they played Belgium in a friendly match, which England won 2–1. It played host to its first competitive England match on 2 April 2003, when they played Turkey in a Euro 2004 qualifying match, which England won 2–0. The Stadium of Light also held an England under 20 match against Italy on 27 November 2002, Italy beat England 5–3. On 10 June 2003 it hosted England's under-21's 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship <b>qualification</b> <b>Group</b> 7 match against Slovakia's under-21's. The hosts beat the visitors 2–0 through Peter Doležaj's fortieth minute own goal and Phil Jagielka's eighty third-minute goal with 11,223 in attendance.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, ten <b>qualification</b> <b>groups</b> were used, {{with the}} group winners and six best runners-up going into the playoff. Germany was host that year.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} calculating the {{coefficients}} is to compile an official UEFA rank, {{to be used}} as seeding criteria for the European nations, when drawing up <b>qualification</b> <b>groups</b> and the final tournament groups of the European Championship. Previously, up until 2006, the UEFA national team coefficient was also used for the seeded draw of World Cup <b>qualification</b> <b>groups</b> in Europe, while the draw for final tournament groups of the World Cup was always seeded {{on the basis of the}} official FIFA World Rankings. UEFA stopped using UEFA national team coefficients for the seeding of World Cup <b>qualification</b> <b>groups</b> at the request of FIFA to only use the official FIFA ranking for all seeded draws related to the World Cup tournament.|$|R
5|$|Walter Smith, {{a former}} Rangers and Everton manager, {{was brought in}} to replace Vogts. Improved results meant that Scotland rose up the FIFA rankings and won the Kirin Cup, a {{friendly}} competition in Japan. Scotland failed to qualify for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, finishing third in their group behind Italy and Norway. Smith left the national side in January 2007 to return to Rangers, with Scotland leading their Euro 2008 <b>qualification</b> <b>group.</b> Alex McLeish was named as Smith's successor and Scotland's twentieth manager. McLeish guided Scotland to wins against Georgia, the Faroe Islands, Lithuania, France and Ukraine, but defeats by Georgia and Italy ended their chances of qualification for Euro 2008. These improved results, particularly the wins against France, lifted Scotland into the top 20 of the FIFA world rankings.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} under-20s' {{elimination}} from the Toulon Tournament, Howarth was called {{up for the}} under-21 team playing in the 2002 UEFA European Under-21 Championship after Bywater and Evans picked up injuries. He was an unused substitute for England's final two group matches against Italy and Portugal, and after losing both of these matches the team was eliminated. He was recalled by the under-21s for a match against Yugoslavia on 6 September 2002, although Liverpool's Chris Kirkland started. He {{was included in the}} squad for the under-21s' next match against Slovakia on 11 October 2002 in <b>qualification</b> <b>Group</b> 7 of the 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship and, despite Kirkland being injured, failed to play as Wolves' Matt Murray was selected. For the following qualifier against Macedonia on 15 October 2002, Howarth failed to make the substitutes' bench. Following his move to Tranmere his international call-ups continued, and he was selected for a get-together of the under-21s in November 2002, ahead of their 2004 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers against Portugal and Turkey in March and April 2003. However, he did not play in either match, with Bywater and Murray starting. He was given a late call-up to the squad for qualifiers against Macedonia and Portugal in September, but did not eventually meet up with the team as an agreement was reached that he would only be on standby.|$|E
5|$|For UEFA Euro 1976, England {{were drawn}} {{in a tough}} <b>qualification</b> <b>group</b> {{including}} Czechoslovakia, Portugal and Cyprus, with only the winner progressing to the finals. England began the campaign well with a 3–0 victory over Czechoslovakia at Wembley, Mick Channon and Colin Bell scoring the goals. However a 0–0 home draw with Portugal was a minor setback, despite Malcolm Macdonald scoring all the goals in a 5–0 win over Cyprus following a morale boosting 2–0 friendly win over 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany. Kevin Keegan scored the only goal of the game at the Tsirion Stadium to secure maximum points in Cyprus, and leave England in a strong position going into the two tough final group games in Czechoslovakia and Portugal. Though only drawing with Wales and Northern Ireland, a 5–1 victory over Scotland secured England the 1974–75 British Home Championship title and left England in confident mood for the crucial qualifying games. However, despite Channon opening the scoring they fell to a 2–1 defeat to the Czechoslovakians in Bratislava after playing with what was for Revie uncharacteristic attacking tactics. A 1–1 draw in Lisbon then allowed Czechoslovakia to clinch the group with a win over Cyprus. Czechoslovakia {{then went on to}} win the whole tournament. Revie was criticised for his constant changing of players during the qualifying group, particularly his decision to drop captains Emlyn Hughes and Alan Ball from his squad entirely, his mistrust of flair players like Charlie George and Alan Hudson, and his willingness to play players out of position also drew criticism.|$|E

25|$|Sanchez was {{appointed}} manager of Northern Ireland in January 2004. At {{that point the}} side was ranked 124th in the world, had a 1,298 minute-long goal drought, and had not won a game for nearly three years. Northern Ireland improved markedly under Sanchez. By the time he left, Northern Ireland were top of their Euro 2008 <b>qualification</b> <b>group</b> and reached an all-time high position of 27th in the world.|$|E
25|$|For the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, {{qualification}} {{was done}} through the CAF's qualification {{process for the}} 2006 FIFA World Cup. Whereas only the winner of each group qualified for the World Cup, the top 3 finishers {{in each of the}} five qualification groups gained entry into the Africa Cup of Nations. The exception was <b>qualification</b> <b>group</b> 3, which contained hosts Egypt. Since Egypt qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations automatically as the hosts, the final berth was instead awarded to the fourth-place finishers, Libya.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. bid to {{host the}} 1986 World Cup after Colombia withdrew from {{contention}} due to economic concerns, but FIFA selected Mexico {{to host the}} tournament. In the last game of CONCACAF qualifying for the 1986 World Cup, the U.S. needed only a tie against Costa Rica to reach the final <b>qualification</b> <b>group</b> against Honduras and Canada. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played in Torrance, California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community. Costa Rica won the match 1–0, and kept the U.S. from reaching its fourth World Cup finals.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} other matches in England's <b>qualification</b> <b>group</b> meant that England would qualify {{as the second}} place team by {{avoiding}} a loss in their final group match against Croatia, who had already clinched {{first place in the}} group. The match was played at Wembley on 21 November 2007 and England lost 3–2; coupled with Russia's victory over Andorra, this meant that England failed to qualify for Euro 2008. It {{was the first time in}} 14 years that England had not qualified for a major tournament, and the first time in 24 years that they had not qualified for the European Championships.|$|E
25|$|The Saar protectorate, {{otherwise}} known as Saarland, was split from Germany and put under French control between 1947 and 1956. Saarland {{did not want to}} join French organisations and was barred from participating in pan-German ones. Thus, they sent separate teams to the 1952 Summer Olympics and also to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers, when Saarland finished below West Germany but above Norway in their <b>qualification</b> <b>group,</b> having won in Oslo. Legendary coach Helmut Schön was the manager of the Saarland team from 1952 until 1957, when the territory acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany. He went on to coach the championship-winning team of the 1970s.|$|E
