40|$|Attention span of {{students}} in a classroom is very short. To overcome this, different active learning methodologies {{have been used in}} the past. Active learning keeps the students busy and engaged throughout <b>the</b> <b>lecture.</b> It breaks <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> into certain time intervals by intermixing breaks, demonstrations and questions after each interval. For using active learning, clickers and laptops are commonly used in higher education classroom. Most experiments in higher education classroom studying different characteristics {{of students}} like learning performance and attention, use clickers and laptop. But, most of these experiments are in a controlled setting, not scalable and compromise the privacy of students. We overcome these problems in an active learning setup in the higher education classroom where we use a web-mediated teaching tool called ASQ. ASQ is a web application that helps to give presentation in a classroom where the presenter has control over the flow of the presentation. ASQ also allows the presenter to interleave the presentation with questions, videos and other interactive JavaScript components. Anyone can anonymously join a presentation in ASQ using a web browser. ASQ tracks the activity of every student interaction by generating event logs each second. In the previous work using ASQ, {{it has been shown that}} these logs could be used to infer the attention level {{of students in}} the classroom. The goal of this thesis is to gather insights about the fine-grained study behaviour of students in a higher education classroom by analyzing these event logs. We investigate (i) <b>the</b> effect of <b>lecture</b> elements (like <b>the</b> difficulty, relative positioning and spacing of questions; and duration of discussion in the slides) on study behaviour (like attention level, performance and reaction time while answering questions) of students; (ii) the relationship that might exist between attention percentage of students and their participation in the in-class questions; (iii) if students are taking external help when answering <b>questions</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> and <b>the</b> relationship that might exist between their tendency to take external help with the difficulty of questions. We conduct our study in a classroom of around 300 students, for 15 <b>lectures</b> in <b>the</b> Web and Database Technology course at TU Delft taught by 2 instructors. We find significant effect of (i) spacing of questions on reaction time and instructor on performance; (ii) length of discussion time associated with a slide on the attention level of students which agrees with past studies; (iii) relative positioning of questions on the performance of students. However, we do not find significant effect of difficulty of questions on performance and reaction time of students while answering these questions. We also find significant effect that students with more attention percentage participate more in the in-class questions. Finally, we find that students take external help while answering questions but the tendency to take external help does not depend on the difficulty of questions...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{distance}} education course offerings {{is an indication}} of its importance to students; however, criticisms have centered on its lack of ability to provide interaction among participants. This case study utilized a mixed methods approach to examine the assumption that an increase in interaction increases student satisfaction among distance learners in an applied animal genetics course delivered by interactive compressed video (ICV) technology to five far-end sites from a major land-grant university in the Northeast. A standardized questionnaire, interviews, and observations were utilized to assess interaction and student satisfaction among students. Students at all sites were satisfied with the course, although not overwhelming so due to technical limitations and failures. Students were very satisfied with the number and variety of opportunities for interaction provided in the course. The most frequent and enjoyable type of interaction was face-to-face communications with site facilitators. Recommendations for improving the course included providing advanced organizers to students, more time for <b>questions</b> and answers <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>lecture,</b> and resolving technology limitations and failures. Future research should examine social accountability as a factor for increasing interaction in ICV courses as well as a rationale for providing synchronous courses...|$|R
40|$|As {{engineering}} {{becomes more}} and more specialized, both the faculty resources and number of interested students become limited. Consequently, very frequently highly specialized graduate courses are not offered, especially in disciplines like Materials with small faculty and enrollment. NSF 2 ̆ 7 s International Materials Institute for New Functionality in Glass (IMI-NFG) has successfully addressed this problem by successfully introducing the concept of multi-institution team teaching (MITT). It brings together via internet both the expert professors and students from many universities. By pooling the talent of various instructors, the courses become technically stronger and students learn advanced topics that would be available otherwise. As an example, a recent MITT course included instructors from 10 US institutions, and students from many more US and international universities. Software such as ‘Adobe Connect’ is used for the live delivery of lectures, wherein students can see the instructor and Power Point slides as in a normal classroom. The students may ask <b>questions</b> any time <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>lecture,</b> and <b>the</b> instructor would respond immediately. They register and pay tuition at their home institution, so that no exchange of funds is involved between universities.

40|$|Abstract Background Students regard {{biological}} {{science as}} one of the most difficult components of the nursing curriculum. However, a good understanding of this area is essential for effective nursing practice. The aim of this study was to explore nursing students’ perceptions of the usefulness of supplementary biology podcasts for their learning. Methods Biological science podcasts (n[*]=[*] 9) were made available to first-year nursing students (n[*]=[*] 189) as supplementary learning tools. On completion of their first year, students were asked to complete a survey which investigated the frequency of their podcast use, reasons for use and their perception of the usefulness of podcasts as a learning tool. 153 of these students participated in the survey study (80. 9 %). Two focus groups were conducted with students (n[*]=[*] 6) to gain a detailed understanding of student experiences of the usefulness of the podcasts for their learning. Results Survey data demonstrated that most students (71 %) accessed at least one podcast. The majority of students who reported accessing podcasts agreed that they were useful as learning tools (83 %), revision aids (83 %) and that they helped promote understanding of course materials (72 %). Focus group participants discussed how they found podcasts especially useful in terms of revision. Students valued being able to repeatedly access <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> materials, and appreciated having access to podcasts from a range of lecturers. Focus group members discussed the benefits of live recordings, in terms of valuing the information gleaned from <b>questions</b> asked <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> sessions, although there were concerns about the level of background noise in live recordings. Lack of awareness of the availability of podcasts was an issue raised by participants in both the survey component and the focus groups and this negatively impacted on podcast use. Conclusions Nursing students found the availability of biology podcasts helpful for their learning. Successful implementation of these tools to support learning requires teaching staff to understand and promote the importance of these tools. </p...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{farmers of}} salaks, the snake fruits of Sibetan Village have {{encountered}} <b>the</b> price tumble <b>during</b> <b>the</b> harvest time. <b>The</b> bumper crops <b>during</b> <b>the</b> harvest {{while at the}} same time there is a steady demand on it, as well as that there has not been an effort to process the abundant crops into a preserved foods are considered to be the main factors that cause its price drop. Training and short course have been conducted to introduce the way how to process the fruits into dodol salak, a sticky cake made of the salak fruit as the main material, by conducting <b>the</b> <b>lecturing</b> and practicing method. The participants were members of family welfare organization (PKK) and the local housewives from Telutug of Sibetan village with the total number of 32 participants, and most of them are the farmers of salaks. The process of making the dodol salak comprises the following steps : the collection and selection of the fruits, peeling and coring the fruit, steaming, mashing the fruits into a pulp, the mixing with coconut milk, palm sugar and sticky rice floor in the bowl, mixing and boiling the mixture within 120 minutes, cooling down and then it is molded and wrapped. The result of the training shows that the participants were really enthusiastic, it could be seen by the abundant of <b>questions</b> raised either <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>lecture,</b> discussion as well as <b>during</b> <b>the</b> practice of making the dodol salak itself. It is expected that by introducing the way how to process the fruits into dodol will improve the skill and knowledge of the local people in general and especially for those of PKK members and the housewives. The food processing into dodol salak may bring about many advantages such as the diversification of the fruit processed-product, giving the added value to the fruit, to lengthen the storage time and to improve the appearance and quality of the product. </div...|$|R

Little {{is known}} about the {{characteristics}} of internet distractions that students may engage in <b>during</b> <b>lecture.</b> <b>The</b> objective of this pilot study is to identify some of the internet-based distractions students engage in <b>during</b> in-person <b>lectures.</b> <b>The</b> findings will help identify what activities most commonly cause students to be distracted from <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> and if these activities impact student learning. Methods. This study is a quasi-experimental pilot study of 26 students from a single institution. In the current study, one class of third-year students were surveyed after a lecture on special needs dentistry. The survey identified self-reported utilization patterns of “smart” devices <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>lecture.</b> Additionally, twelve quiz-type questions were given to assess the students’ recall of important points in <b>the</b> <b>lecture</b> material that had just been covered. Results. The sample was comprised of 26 students. Of these, 17 were distracted in some form (either checking email, sending email, checking Facebook, or sending texts). The overall mean score on the test was 9. 85 (9. 53 for distracted students and 10. 44 for non-distracted students). There {{were no significant differences in}} test scores between distracted and non-distracted students (p = 0. 652).
