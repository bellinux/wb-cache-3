Despite its short history, BIM has had an increasing growth during the last decade. This is happening mainly due to its capabilities on construction projects.

40|$|Abstract Building Information Model/Modeling/Management (BIM) is a {{tool that}} allows for {{efficient}} working methods. BIM saves time and money while providing the potential for visualization. This method of working {{is based on a}} 3 D-model, and then a fourth and fifth dimension are connected. 5 D modeling means that a spreadsheet creates cost estimates based on the 3 D model. This provides opportunities to carry out calculations {{in the early stages of}} the projects.   Calculations are currently performed manually and do not contribute to the development that the construction industry requires. To examine the efficiency of 5 D BIM, a comparison should be made with the traditional calculation method. The purpose of this study is to propose a more reliable <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> and to study the advantages and disadvantages of each method.   The research questions to be studied in this thesis read as follows:  How reliable is <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> with the help of Vico Office in contrast to traditional <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff?</b> What is required of a BIM model to perform a <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> in Vico Office?   To create calculations manually, bills of quantities are performed with recipes for each building component and then price lists from recipe databases are used. With the 5 D BIM, a spreadsheet is connected to the BIM model that generates price lists and calculations for each building component. Spreadsheet entries are created for the component that contain the right amount of information, that is then connected to the correct building component. Vico Office is a program that provides opportunities to import 3 D models from CAD tools to then carry out timetables and calculations.   Vico Office offers many advantages in contrast to the manual spreadsheet work in, among other things, time and cost. It is easy to handle and contributes to the development of BIM. It also contributes to increased communication between participants that makes it easier to handle delays. At the same time, the program needs new knowledge. The manual spreadsheet work gives uncertain calculations and the risk of measurement errors exist.   To perform a complete <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> in Vico Office an architectural model and a construction model is required. It is also important to name the components in the model before it is imported to Vico Office. Vico Office gives more BIM, and it is easier to perform a <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> because all the tools are in one place. It is not possible to determine that it is actually more efficient with Vico Office because the building model was lacking in this study.     This thesis demonstrates the advantages of 5 D BIM, but at the same time it requires an initiative of the companies to implement the system.

For example architects use it to streamline the information transition throughout the design phases of a project, structural and MEP engineers use BIM as the database for their design projects, and project engineers use it to automatically and dynamically perform <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoffs.</b> Although BIM has respectively contributed to different sectors in the AEC industry, it still hasn’t been well exploited to offer an efficient information management solution for the construction phase of a project. This study develops an information integration sphere (IIS) based on the BIM technology {{to provide a more}} efficient and effective information integration model. IIS can clearly identify the data requirements of various stakeholders at different stages of the construction project. It also serves as a tool that can better generate, manipulate, and visualize the flow of information along different processes. In addition, IIS can establish the responsibilities of various stakeholders in terms of providing and receiving information within the construction project. With the help of IIS, BIM model can be better built for smoothly transiting and integrating information among different phases of the construction project.

40|$|SUMMARY: Building Information Modeling (BIM) {{continues}} to evolve and grow {{along with their}} respective application in practice. One of the key advantages of BIM is that is facilitates the development of detailed information and analysis much earlier in the building process to improve decision making and reduce downstream changes. The increases in cost of construction and combined complexity inherent in healthcare construction projects provides an opportunity to harness the strengths of BIM, and provide much more detailed information early {{in the development of}} a healthcare construction project. These case studies present evidence of benefits of BIM upstream in the project lifecycle – such as the programming stage. Two healthcare related projects which implemented BIM in the programming phase are presented in this paper. One project is a trauma hospital in a developing country in conflict, and the other is a medical research laboratory in the United States. Each had unique circumstances, but also similarities which help to identify the strengths and challenges of BIM implementation in healthcare projects regardless of the individual projects’ differences. The paper reviews the application of the BIM modeling process for each project. The benefits and challenges from the process used, and the results found are presented. Challenges included data transfer bottlenecks and apprehension due to a lack of knowledge of parametric tools in general. Benefits included visualization, time saved relative to concept updates, and <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoffs.</b> Some basic framing of the strategic implementation of BIM on a construction project are discussed.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. It is widely {{acknowledged}} that the construction industry has {{a major impact on}} the environment, both in terms of resource consumption and waste production. The construction industry is responsible for producing a whole variety of different onsite wastes; the amount and type of which depends on factors such as the stage of construction, type of construction work, direct or indirect stakeholders’ design change contribution, and practices throughout the project lifecycle. A number of construction waste minimisation (CWM) techniques and tools are currently available to assist contractors to divert waste away from landfill. However, literature reveals that there are insufficient techniques and tools for reducing construction waste during the design and procurement stages. The last few years saw the emergence of Building Information Modelling (BIM) techniques, which can be adopted to improve sustainable construction performance. BIM is a maturing modelling philosophy, which has been applied to several building-related functions such as visualising designs, automating <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoffs,</b> checking compliance with regulations, and scheduling construction processes. Furthermore, BIM, as a real-time interactive and collaborative communication system, has the potential to help project stakeholders to collaboratively attain waste minimisation for sustainable construction and building throughout design, construction and throughout the lifecycle by improving building construction performance. Hence, this paper, which is part of an ongoing doctoral study, explores the potential application of BIM to design out waste. An in-depth literature review was conducted to provide a foundation for the doctoral study that aims to investigate the use of BIM as a potential platform for building design waste minimisation. The paper explores construction waste origins and causes, current waste reduction practices; examines current industry BIM practices and investigates BIM tools for sustainable project construction and management; and identifies the knowledge gaps in existing literature that pave the way for the subsequent data collection stages...|$|R

30|$|<b>Quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> is {{the process}} of taking {{measurements}} about counts, lengths, areas, volumes, and conditions of a site project for the purpose of quantifying workloads required for completing a certain task. A typical example is quantifying painting areas of interior and exterior walls of a built structure in order to prepare a proposal for bidding. Traditionally, these can be done with a measurement tape, a total station, or a laser scanner depending on the scale and accessibility of the measuring area. However, painting or repainting a building is usually considered a small project. Cost for performing such measurement with an expensive tool such as the total station or laser scanner can hardly be justified. Also, considering that the large scale or inaccessible areas of the building sometimes exist, it is not always practical for the contractors to perform such a job using a traditional measurement tape.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Construction is a {{competitive}} industry and successful contractors {{must be able}} to win bids to obtain projects. Cash flow analysis not only determines actual profit {{at the end of the}} project, but also estimates required cash resources or cash ballances at the end of every month. Cash flow analysis is important in managing a construction project; however, it requires extensive information that is not immediately available to the general contractor. Before contractors can perform cash flow analysis, they must first complete a series of pre-requisites such as the quantity take off, scheduling, and cost estimating, followed by accurate assessments of project costs incurred and billable progress made. Consequently, cash flow analysis is currently a lengthy, uncertain process. This paper suggests improved cash flow analysis can be developed using data extraction in Building Information Modeling (BIM).

These error sources include camera internal parameters (i.e., type, principal point, principal distance, and camera lens distortion coefficients), imaging settings (i.e., shooting distances, baselines, percentage of photo overlaps, number of overlapping photos, camera intersection angles, and angles of incidence), and processing software programs. To augment {{the body of}} knowledge on photogrammetric modeling errors, this paper further conducts experiment, which concerns characterization {{of the behavior of}} different strategies in selecting reference lines for fixing absolute scale of photogrammetric models. In construction photogrammetric surveying, it is imperative to convert the relative scale of a 3 D model into absolute measurements so geometric measurements can be taken. Previous work suggests this can be done through the determination of a reference line in absolute units; however, the position and quantity of reference lines has not been investigated. This experiment attempts to tackle this issue. The result shows that one horizontal reference line {{in the middle of the}} object performed with consistent accuracy, but if a specific area on the object needs more accurate measurements, it is best to select a reference line in that area. The review and the experimental findings may help construction professionals better understand the performance of the photogrammetric surveying and apply it in their real-world projects.|$|E

For steel fabrication companies as suppliers of steel structures, submitting competitive project bids requires substantial knowledge of the company's practices on the shop floor and extensive experience to interpret that into credible cost estimations. Being able to make reliable estimates would contribute to the company's competitiveness in the long run. In this study, the total quantity of worker-hours or man-hours required for each major subdivision of a project is considered as the variable of interest in estimating a steel fabrication project, mainly because of the labor-intensive nature of steel fabrication. In collaboration with a partner company, three years of project data, were collected by matching the company's building information modeling (BIM) system with their labor costing system resulting in over 3, 000 records, each representing the <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> for 46 design features and the worker-hours expended in shop fabrication. Stepwise regression and error analysis are used to recognize the most crucial design features in estimating project worker-hours, allowing discovery of the minimized set of inputs for estimating worker-hours and characterization of the estimation uncertainties. This labor cost estimation benefits estimators and shop production planners in that they can configure labor resources to deploy, schedule shop floor production, and recognize estimates’ associated errors, based on the company's historical data. This study is an example of using BIM data and providing tools for structural engineers to consider steel fabrication and possibly achieve more sustainable designs...|$|E

Purpose: The goal {{of this paper is}} to present the case study of Kaiser Oakland hospital project, the largest known implementation of integrated 5 D systems combined with location-based planning. Research Design/Method: Parallel processes were implemented in the project. The results of integrated 5 D system were compared to the results of traditional constructability, estimating and scheduling processes. Findings: H 1 and H 3 were supported in the preconstruction of foundations. Over 200 additional constructability issues were identified using the construction model. Location-based scheduling enabled the planning of continuous work for subcontractors while compressing the duration of Foundation phase by six weeks. Contrary to the hypothesis H 2 there was no time saving benefits related to quantity take-off, although there were some qualitative benefits in terms of better communication.

This research examines the potential of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a tool to support the tasks of cost prediction, mapping costs to engineering decisions, and risk management during the early stages of a design's life-cycle. ANNs are a modeling tool based on the computational paradigm of the human brain and have proved to be a robust and reliable method for prediction, ranking, classification, and interpretation or processing of data.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{popularity of}} building information modeling (BIM) for application {{in the construction}} of eco-friendly green buildings has given rise to techniques for evaluating green buildings constructed using BIM features. Existing BIM-based green building evaluation techniques mostly rely on externally provided evaluation tools, which pose problems associated with interoperability, including a lack of data compatibility and the amount of time required for format conversion. To overcome these problems, this study sets out to develop a template (the “green template”) for evaluating the embodied environmental impact of using a BIM design tool as part of BIM-based building life-cycle assessment (LCA) technology development. Firstly, the BIM level of detail (LOD) was determined to evaluate the embodied environmental impact, and constructed a database of the impact factors of the embodied environmental impact of the major building materials, thereby adopting an LCA-based approach. The libraries of major building elements were developed by using the established databases and compiled evaluation table of the embodied environmental impact of the building materials. Finally, the green template was developed as an embodied environmental impact evaluation tool and a case study was performed to test its applicability. The results of the green template-based embodied environmental impact evaluation of a test building were validated against those of its actual <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> (2 D takeoff), and its reliability was confirmed by an effective error rate of ≤ 5 %. This study aims to develop a system for assessing the impact of the substances discharged from concrete production process on six environmental impact categories, i. e., global warming (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), abiotic depletion (ADP), ozone depletion (ODP), and photochemical oxidant creation (POCP), using the life a cycle assessment (LCA) method. To achieve this, we proposed an LCA method specifically applicable to concrete and tailored to the Korean concrete industry by adapting the ISO standards to suit the Korean situations...|$|E
40|$|Rising {{energy costs}} {{should be a}} concern to contractors, designers, and owners. It is {{difficult}} to make a <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> for energy usage because these costs are imbedded in the materials, equipment, or overhead costs. This research examines energy consumption during the construction process, sets forth methods for recording this energy consumption and establishes a program for the recording and analysis of this data. An energy study of electricity, gasoline, and diesel consumption was made {{for the construction of}} three buildings to determine what data was available. After available data was evaluated, and the Energy Data Analysis program developed, three other construction sites were visited to determine how readily energy data can be recorded using the program. Four construction energy phases were identified from this research. The four phases are: 1) site clearing and preparation, 2) building structure, 3) interior finishes, and 4) commissioning. The main type of energy consumption during Phase 1 is diesel fuel for earth moving equipment. The energy uses for Phases 2 and 3 varied considerably among the projects studied and were difficult to quantify. However, the energy use during these phases was low compared to other phases and for many projects may not be economical to evaluate. During Phase 4, electrical energy demand was high due to Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) commissioning requirements and power up of all electrical power uses including lighting. These few construction projects are not enough to make definitive conclusions about what percentage of the total project cost is spent on energy. This research found that construction energy costs vary during different phases of the building process and can be a significant part of that phase (as high as 5. 7 % of the cost). The Visual Basic program developed during this research will facilitate future energy studies on construction sites. When the program is applied to a project, it identifies and quantifies the energy use, and makes predictions as to which project tasks warrant further energy studies...|$|E
40|$|Building Information Modeling, {{abbreviated}} BIM, is {{a process}} of information sharing which enhances communication and which helps in visualizing complex problems in the building industry. BIM has not been used in a larger extent in the production phase of civil works. The purpose of the study is therefore to investigate driving forces behind the use of BIM and the resistors against it and to investigate in what ways BIM could be used in the production phase. The theoretical framework is based on one licentiate thesis, two degree projects, three research papers and three books. A qualitative method with semi-structured interviews was used. The interviews were made with a calculator, a supervisor and a CAD planner from Skanska, a constructor and project manager from ELU, a Project Information Officer from Tyréns and a VDC coordinator and VDC business developer from Veidekke who all have been working with BIM. This was to get a good representation from different actors and people with different professional roles. The study shows that the driving forces behind a use of BIM are that it enhances collaboration and communication between the actors, it makes it easier to visualize the project and the scope, and it provides a higher degree of accuracy of coordination’s. BIM also makes the work more effective and results in fewer errors. Above all, BIM give a possibility for a shorter production phase, shorter total project duration and a lower total cost. The study also shows that the resistors against the use of BIM are employee’s negative attitude against administrative work, {{that it is hard to}} measure profitability of using BIM, the uncertainty of who has the legal ownership of the data, and who has the responsibility of the accuracy of it. 3 That the implementation cost and the design phase are more expensive is also a resistor against a use of BIM. BIM could be used in visualization with 3 D models in collision controls and co-reviews in meetings, work preparations and at site. A workplace outline could also be printed from the 3 D model to be placed on the site for visualization. 4 D scheduling and 4 D animations could be used for visualization in meetings, work preparations and at site. The study showed that <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff</b> and cost estimation with 5 D is only reconciled in the meetings in the production phase and that the programs for it are not needed in this phase. RFID tags could be used at site for logistics and tracking materials, and field verifications could be used to verify that a work task is executed according to exact coordination’s in the 3 D model. Furthermore tablet computers could be used for bringing the technique of BIM to the site which enables a better understanding of complex work tasks for the workers. A BIM coordinator who understands the process of working with BIM and who could work as a bridge between the users and the technical development team is important in a successful implementation. The study also shows that the focus of BIM should lie on how to make use of the technique. The examples of how BIM could be used in the production phase of civil works have to be useful and meet the needs and demands of the users. The processes of using 3 D models, 4 D scheduling, 4 D animations, RFID tags, field verifications and tablet computers should therefore be studied thoroughly to find how the technique could be applicable at site, in meetings and work preparations and how it could enhance the daily activities and work tasks. If the demands are met it will be accepted by both the user and the organization. Further research should therefore lie on how 3 D models, 4 D scheduling, 4 D animations, RFID tags, field verifications and tablet computers could be useful in the production phase. These BIM techniques should then be tested on a real project to investigate how the processes could be useful at site, in meetings and in work preparations. Further research should also be made on how countries like Norway, Finland and USA have made use of BIM in the production of civil works...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{waste is}} {{a major source of}} urban waste and usually {{accounts}} for 10 - 30 % of the total waste disposed of at landfill sites in many cities around the world. As the construction industry {{is a major}} user of natural resources, the enormous amount of construction waste imposes great stress on the limited natural resources and places a burden on sustainable development of all the cities in both developed and developing countries and regions. A number of construction waste management policies have been established with the aim of reducing the volume of construction waste and improving its recycling rate. Comparison and analysis of typical waste management policy instruments shows that (1) the emphasis of instruments shifts from the end of construction waste management chain {{to the beginning of the}} chain; (2) the instruments tend to internalize the externalities; and (3) more and more economic instruments are introduced to effectively promote sustainable construction waste management. Under the increasing political and financial pressure, construction companies need to adopt more sustainable waste management strategies to reduce the associated costs of waste disposal, especially for those with multiple projects in hand. Efficient construction waste management necessitates a systematic approach with the collaboration of various stakeholders in the construction industry. This study focuses on one of such key issues, construction waste estimation. In order to make improvements on the existing methods, a quantitative construction waste estimation model for building projects is proposed to enhance the estimation accuracy of construction waste at the project level, to predict the quantities of various kinds of construction waste in each period of the whole construction process of a building project and to track the sources of construction waste. In the development of this model, a theoretical material flow analysis of the construction process and the construction waste generation process has been conducted. Specifically, this model integrates the mass balance principle, work breakdown structure, material <b>quantity</b> <b>takeoff,</b> conversion ratios between different waste measurement units and the wastage levels of various materials used in different work packages. Furthermore, a more sophisticated construction waste model is presented by considering the waste generation mechanism of different materials in various kinds of construction processes and waste generation time. The construction processes are categorized into three classes based on the input-output analysis: onsite processing process, material extracting process and element-construction process. These processes are corresponding to terminal work packages in the work breakdown structure of a building. On the basis of material flow analysis of these three kinds of processes, waste generation mechanism is discovered for deriving construction waste estimation from each terminal work package. Project schedules and waste generation distributions are also incorporated to quantify construction waste over the construction period. As a result, construction waste in a specific project is forecasted by type and in total over the construction period more accurately. A web-based construction waste management system was also developed based on the proposed estimation method. This system provides user-friendly interfaces to enter the necessary information and display construction waste estimation graphically. Based on the accurate waste estimation, the suitable waste management method for each construction waste stream can be determined for a specific construction companies, in particular those with multiple projects. Sustainable attributes (including economic, social and environmental attributes) are taken into account to choose the favorite waste management methods with respect to the major construction waste streams. In evaluating these attributes, some of them can be represented by numerical values while others expressed in linguistic variables due to the human being's inability to assess these complicated attributes. The proposed utility-based linguistic multi-attribute decision making model enables computing with words without loss of information, overcomes the gap between numerical values and linguistic descriptions, employs the utility functions to transform multiple scales of different attributes into a common one for easy comparison and finally chooses the appropriate methods for the major construction waste streams. With the accurate waste estimation and optimizing waste management method, construction companies can extract the maximum benefit or spend the minimum expense under the current local policy framework. At the same time, the government and public should be happy to see the twofold benefits brought by the greatly reduced construction waste: one is the saving of natural resources and the other is reducing the waste disposal...|$|E
