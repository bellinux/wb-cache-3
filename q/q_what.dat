How can teachers plan, deliver and evaluate learning from farm visits, {{in the context of}} Curriculum for Excellence? <b>Q</b> 2. <b>What</b> barriers do teachers perceive to undertaking educational farm visits? <b>Q</b> 3. To <b>what</b> extent can farm visits improve children’s understanding of land use and the food chain? <b>Q</b> 4. <b>What</b> approaches can farmers use to engage children on visits? <b>Q</b> 5. <b>What</b> do teachers, farmers and children identify as ‘best practice’ for educational farm visits...|$|R

40|$|The central {{paradigm}} of GCE-II is that variability in estuarine ecosystem processes is primarily {{mediated by the}} mixture of fresh and salt water flows across the coastal landscape. The project is focused on 5 main, inter-related questions: <b>Q</b> 1 : <b>What</b> are the long-term patterns of environmental forcing to the coastal zone? Q 2 : How do the spatial and temporal patterns of biogeochemical processes, primary production, community dynamics, decomposition, and disturbance vary across the estuarine landscape, {{and how do they}} relate to environmental gradients? <b>Q</b> 3 : <b>What</b> are the underlying mechanisms by which the freshwater-saltwater gradient drives ecosystem change along the longitudinal axis of an estuary? <b>Q</b> 4 : <b>What</b> are the underlying mechanisms by which proximity of marshes to upland habitat drives ecosystem change along lateral gradients in the intertidal zone? <b>Q</b> 5 : <b>What</b> is the relative importance of larval transport versus the conditions of the adult environment in determining community and genetic structure across both the longitudinal and lateral gradients of the estuarine landscape? <b>Q</b> 1 : <b>What</b> are the long-term patterns of environmental forcing to the coastal zone...|$|R
