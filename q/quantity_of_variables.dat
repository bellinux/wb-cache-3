Four pigeons were trained on an identity matching-to-sample task, with simultaneous presentation of comparison stimuli and successive presentation of comparison stimuli. An alternating treatments design was utilized. Results indicated that, although pigeons acquired the matching-to-sample task in both the simultaneous and the successive presentation methods, they acquired the task more quickly when the comparison stimuli were presented simultaneously. Implications for future research with regard to selecting the presentation method to increase acquisition speed, maintenance, and generalization are discussed...|$|E

Hebbian learning schemes can reduce the system dimensionality by mapping from a high dimensional input space to a low dimensional one, making viable {{an interpretation of the}} data. The data used were school grades for a group of students in different subjects. 1. Introduction The "curse" of dimensionality in social sciences has received different treatments {{since the beginning of the}} century. The high dimensionality of the systems studied in social sciences requires a preprocessing of the data prior to any feasible interpretation. Sociologists, psychologists, market and educational researchers have used different techniques to resolve this problem. The above mentioned preprocessing consists in essence in a low dimensional representation of the original data, this means finding a small <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> (factors) where data can be represente [...] ...|$|E

We could formulate it in the following terms: Are we advancing towards a model of homogenization of public opinion on a global and local level, or rather towards a disintegration of the same based precisely on the excessive nature of information which ends up turning into a chaotic range of topicalizations and subtopicalizations of the channel? Despite the uncertainty of the response, it seems obvious that this process affects —and will continue to affect— the political scenario, as well as the basic rules of representative democracy...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{distributed}} energy resources, {{based on}} natural intermittent power sources, like wind generation, in power systems imposes {{the development of}} new adequate operation management and control methodologies. A short-term Energy Resource Management (ERM) methodology performed in two phases is proposed in this paper. The first one addresses the day-ahead ERM scheduling and the second one deals with the five-minute ahead ERM scheduling. The ERM scheduling is a complex optimization problem due to the high <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> and constraints. In this paper the main goal is to minimize the operation costs {{from the point of view}} of a virtual power player that manages the network and the existing resources. The optimization problem is solved by a deterministic mixedinteger non-linear programming approach.

40|$|Analyzing data {{obtained}} from genome-wide gene expression experiments is challenging due to the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables,</b> the need for multivariate analyses, {{and the demands of}} managing large amounts of data. Here we present the R package pcaGoPromoter, which facilitates the interpretation of genome-wide expression data and overcomes the aforementioned problems. In the first step, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to survey any differences between experiments and possible groupings. The next step is the interpretation of the principal components with respect to both biological function and regulation by predicted transcription factor binding sites. The robustness of the results is evaluated using cross-validation, and illustrative plots of PCA scores and gene ontology terms are available. pcaGoPromoter works with any platform that uses gene symbols or Entrez IDs as probe identifiers. In addition, support for several popular Affymetrix GeneChip platforms is provided. To illustrate the features of the pcaGoPromoter package a serum stimulation experiment was performed and the genome-wide gene expression in the resulting samples was profiled using the Affymetrix Human Genome U 133 Plus 2. 0 chip. Array data were analyzed using pcaGoPromoter package tools, resulting in a clear separation of the experiments into three groups: controls, serum only and serum with inhibitor. Functional annotation of the axes in the PCA score plot showed the expected serum-promoted biological processes, e. g., cell cycle progression and the predicted involvement of expected transcription factors, including E 2 F.

40|$|Weapons {{procurement}} {{decisions are}} extremely complex, with an unmanageable <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>variables</b> {{to take into}} account. The human brain, unable to process such a complex problem in a strictly rational way, seeks mechanisms to bound the problem and therefore simplify it. One way this occurs is {{through the development of}} paradigms, or common viewpoints held by decision makers that incorporate the irrational, emotional, and qualitative experience and knowledge, as well as quantitative knowledge such as analysis and test results. A paradigm in use by decision makers in the U. S. Air Force is the propensity to buy weapons developed and produced in America. This study traces the origins of this paradigm, and how it evolved over time. Drawing on examples from recent history it identifies the sources of the paradigm which are: a need to maintain the nation’s technological base, the inadequacy of foreign weaponry to meet U. S. needs, the fact that the U. S. economy is able to support a strong defense industry, the ability to advance its policies by transfer of weapons to allies, the desire to share standardized equipment with allies, and the desire to gain the economic benefits from being an exporter of weapons. It concludes that existing paradigms influence what weapon systems the U. S. will procure, and that in turn affects the strategy the nation employs. Relating the paradigm of American-made weapons procurement to the cases of the F- 35 fighter and the recently cancelled Air Force tanker program, it asks questions about the future of weapons procurement choices in a global defense environment...|$|E
