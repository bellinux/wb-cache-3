5|$|Pliny {{correctly}} {{identifies the}} origin of amber as the fossilised resin of pine trees. Evidence cited includes {{the fact that some}} samples exhibit encapsulated insects, a feature readily explained by the presence of a viscous resin. Pliny refers {{to the way in which}} it exerts a charge when rubbed, a property well known to Theophrastus. He devotes considerable space to bees, which he admires for their industry, organisation, and honey, discussing the significance of the <b>queen</b> <b>bee</b> and the use of smoke by beekeepers at the hive to collect honeycomb. He praises the song of the nightingale.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a <b>Queen</b> <b>bee</b> on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut thumb. On 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstractThe lifespans of queen honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are much}} longer than those of worker bees. Mitochondrial energy {{utilization}} in the trophocytes and oenocytes of worker bees during aging has been determined, but it remains unknown in <b>queen</b> <b>bees.</b> In this study, mitochondrial energy utilization was assayed in the trophocytes and oenocytes of young and old <b>queen</b> <b>bees.</b> The mitochondrial density and mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm); nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced form (NADH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels; NAD+/NADH ratio; and relative expression of NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND 1) and ATP synthase normalized against mitochondrial density {{were not significantly different}} between young and old <b>queen</b> <b>bees.</b> These results indicate that mitochondrial energy utilization maintains a young status in the trophocytes and oenocytes of old <b>queen</b> <b>bees</b> and that trophocytes and oenocytes have longevity-promoting mechanisms that can be investigated to clarify the secret of longevity in <b>queen</b> <b>bees...</b>|$|R
25|$|Some taxa {{with high}} social {{organization}} are eusocial, meaning {{that a single}} female (e.g., the <b>queen</b> <b>bee)</b> or caste produces offspring while the other organisms (e.g., worker bees) cooperate in caring for the young. Examples of mammalian eusociality include Damaraland mole-rats and naked mole-rats, among whom polyandry is the norm and polygyny has never been observed.|$|E
25|$|Frisch's {{honey bee}} work {{included}} {{the study of}} the pheromones that are emitted by the <b>queen</b> <b>bee</b> and her daughters, which maintain the hive's very complex social order. Outside the hive, the pheromones cause the male bees, or drones, to become attracted to a queen and mate with it. Inside the hive, the drones are not affected by the odor.|$|E
25|$|A drone is {{characterized}} by eyes that are {{twice the size of}} those of worker bees and queens, and a body size greater than that of worker bees, though usually smaller than the <b>queen</b> <b>bee.</b> His abdomen is stouter than the abdomen of workers or queen. Although heavy bodied, the drone must be able to fly fast enough to accompany the queen in flight.|$|E

25|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>bee</b> is able {{to control}} the sex of the eggs she lays. The queen lays a fertilized (female) or unfertilized (male) egg {{according}} to the width of the cell. Drones are raised in cells that are significantly larger than the cells used for workers. The queen fertilizes the egg by selectively releasing sperm from her spermatheca as the egg passes through her oviduct.|$|E
25|$|A virgin queen is a <b>queen</b> <b>bee</b> {{that has}} not mated with a drone. Virgins are {{intermediate}} in size between workers and mated, laying queens, and are much more active than the latter. They are hard to spot while inspecting a frame, because they run across the comb, climbing over worker bees if necessary, and may even take flight if sufficiently disturbed. Virgin queens can often be found clinging to the walls or corners of a hive during inspections.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Sirtis guest-starred as a Swiss {{doctor in}} two episodes of ABC Family's Make It or Break It. In May 2010, Sirtis {{announced}} {{that she would be}} providing the voice for comic-book villainess <b>Queen</b> <b>Bee</b> in Young Justice animated series. She provided her voice for a number of episodes from 2011 until its cancellation in 2013. In March 2011, Sirtis guest-starred on an episode of Grey's Anatomy.

25|$|After {{having made}} six AVs, Kusanagi stopped {{performing}} in videos {{for a time}} to concentrate on modeling. Alice Japan issued a compilation video entitled Mizuho Kanou Forever in July 1997. Kusanagi apparently had dental work done soon after her break from AV performance, as her subsequent appearances in photobooks and magazines show that her teeth, previously slightly crooked, were now straight. Appearing under the stage name Narua Asami, the first of Kusanagi's five photobooks, <b>Queen</b> <b>Bee,</b> was released in August 1997, and several magazine appearances under this stage name followed.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the name}} might imply it, a <b>queen</b> <b>bee</b> does not {{directly}} control the hive. Her sole function is {{to serve as the}} reproducer. A well-mated and well-fed queen of quality stock can lay about 1,500 eggs per day during the spring build-up—more than her own body weight in eggs every day. She is continuously surrounded by worker bees who meet her every need, giving her food and disposing of her waste. The attendant workers also collect and then distribute queen mandibular pheromone, a pheromone that inhibits the workers from starting queen cells.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{the five}} regulars cast members {{mentioned}} above, three more characters {{appeared in the}} pilot episode. Jenny Humphrey (Taylor Momsen) is Dan's younger sister, who desperately tries {{to become the next}} <b>queen</b> <b>bee,</b> a goal that eventually makes her realize the true values of life; Lily van der Woodsen (Kelly Rutherford) Serena's mother; and Dan and Jenny's father Rufus Humphrey (Matthew Settle). They share a romantic past that follows them throughout the show and eventually leads to their marriage. The Humphrey family is centered upon as they explore life on the 'Upper East side', Dan trying to look after his little sister as she discovers the party scene.|$|E

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly {{in a cell}} in a wax honeycomb, {{produced}} and shaped by the worker bees. Using her spermatheca, the queen can choose to fertilize the egg she is laying, usually depending on into which cell she is laying. Drones develop from unfertilised eggs and are haploid, while females (queens and worker bees) develop from fertilised eggs and are diploid. Larvae are initially fed with royal jelly produced by worker bees, later switching to honey and pollen. The exception is a larva fed solely on royal jelly, which will develop into a <b>queen</b> <b>bee.</b> The larva undergoes several moultings before spinning a cocoon within the cell, and pupating.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 2017, Toyota {{announced}} that she would retire from professional wrestling on November 3 with her final match at a special thirty-anniversary show in Japan. Toyota's retirement event featured a series of one-minute time limit matches, which Toyota finished {{with a record of}} 12 wins, 29 draws and 10 losses. Toyota then had her retirement match with no time limit against her hand-picked successor, Tsukasa Fujimoto, which she won with the Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex. However, Toyota demanded a rematch and went on to defeat Fujimoto again with the Japanese Ocean <b>Queen</b> <b>Bee</b> Bomb. Toyota and Fujimoto then had a third match, where Fujimoto was victorious with Toyota's own Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex, bringing Toyota's thirty-year career to an end.|$|E

The crew {{discover}} {{the remains of}} the previous Planet Express crew and ship, but Leela insists that they press on. After gathering the honey, Leela decides to bring home a baby <b>queen</b> <b>bee.</b> On the way out, Bender inadvertently insults the hive's queen, causing the bees to attack. The crew escape, but in the ship, the baby queen awakens and attacks Leela. Fry throws himself in front of Leela to protect her, and is impaled by the bee's stinger while Leela is only pricked by the tip. Bender disposes of the bee and Leela awakens with a minor wound, but sees Fry lying dead on the floor.|$|E
