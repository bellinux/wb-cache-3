This is a qualitative study based on a case study. 21 self-management <b>circles</b> and 18 <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>circles</b> in the organization were found. The self management circles are responsible for achieving the organizational main goals and the <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>circles</b> to bring best practices and new ideas. The result shows that <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>circles</b> are {{more powerful than the}} self management circles as a space to develop people creativity and organizational innovation.

Most evaluations on the QCC presentation use the itemized rating method or the duplex-pole evaluation method. The former has the negative effects of canceling out the higher and lower while the latter cannot distinguish the ability type of a team. This study takes the average of the highest rating “A ” as an index for superiority. Based on these indices and the K-mean method, similar ability groups and evaluator groups are generated, respectively. According to a team’s improvement ability level which is determined by the similar group it belongs, a proper regenerated input can be applied to sustain continuous improvement activity. Also, knowing the characteristics of evaluators, proper solutions can be applied to improve the evaluation credibility. This paper also shows that some of the evaluation data can provide valuable information through further study and thus increase “evaluation use”. 1 Conference ICL 200...|$|E

In order to increase the hand hygiene compliance of HCWs, a <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>circle</b> (QCC) program was carried out in our hospital, and the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) method was applied for 12  months. Findings Hand hygiene compliance rates improved over time, with significant improvement between preintervention (60. 1 %) and postintervention (97. 2 %) periods (P[*]<[*] 0. 001). Nurses (88. 3 %) exhibited higher compliance than dentists (87. 3 %), and female (88. 4 %) HCWs were more likely to perform hand hygiene than males (85. 6 %), both P[*]<[*] 0. 001. Overall hand hygiene compliance and observance of the five indications exhibited significant linear increases over time (P[*]<[*] 0. 005).

A literature study was undertaken to determine the relation between personnel development and organizational effectiveness. An empirical investigation involving 14 technikons in the RSA was conducted to determine the ways in which personnel development is presently being carried out at technikons in the RSA. Some of the most important conclusions which were reached from the literature study and the empirical investigation are the following: - Personnel development can be {{regarded as one of the}} most important aspects within any organization to promote organizational effectiveness. - Organizational effectiveness can only be achieved if the career objectives of the individual match and complement those of the organization. - The implementation of programmes and methods such as a career development programme, assessment centres, mentoring, <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>circles,</b> induction programmes and metacognition can make a positive contribution to organizational effectiveness. - A healthy organizational climate including effective communication, plays an important role in promoting personnel development and improving organizational effectiveness. The following are a few of the most important recommendations arising from the investigation: - Personnel development programmes should be offered on a continuing basis at technikons. - Career development programmes aimed at the individual should be introduced at technikons. - The technikon leader corps should receive training in the different facets of personnel development. - Open communication channels within technikons as organizations should be promoted. - Technikon personnel should be prepared to adapt to changing objectives. - The introduction of career development programmes, assessment centres, induction programmes, mentoring, <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>circles,</b> and metacognition must be seriously considered as methods of personnel development to promote organizational effectiveness at technikons in the RSA.

Structural equation modelling was used to investigate the relationships between QCCs, Teians and performance outcomes. It was found that QCCs can generate more visible and tangible improvement outcomes.

The main objective is to investigate the differences that may exist between them in implementing quality management. Towards that end, a questionnaire was developed, validated and sent out to 370 companies in the electrical and electronics sector and the survey gave a response rate of 21. 9 per cent. The results show that Japanese companies have higher levels of quality activities when compared to non-Japanese companies. The top five quality activities with big gap against non-Japanese companies are; <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>circle,</b> supplier improvement, application of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), conducting Value Engineering (VE) and implementing quality costing. ISO 9001 was found to be the most useful practice in all the companies surveyed.

A recent large multicentric European study reported a percentage of underweight children ranging across countries from 4. 0 % to 9. 3 %.

It allows timely implementation of adequate nutritional support and prevents further nutritional deterioration of hospitalized children. In this article, a hands-on practical guideline {{for the implementation of}} a nutritional care program in hospitalized children is provided. The difference between nutritional status (anthropometry with or without additional technical investigations) at admission and nutritional risk (the risk of the need for a nutritional intervention or the risk for nutritional deterioration during hospital stay) is the focus of this article.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20 th century, organizations in a globalized and highly competitive environment face two options—either they stagnate by keeping their traditional old fashioned procedures, or they make the decision to look forward and change their current procedure, as they attempt to survive competition and become new competitive organizations that can play {{a more active role in}} the future market. Organizational changes are naturally linked to risks, and risks mean opportunities, as well as losses. However, as companies try to modify their procedures and adapt their staff and routine to some novelty, they have a good chance to change risks into opportunities. For most companies, adaptation means the use of modern quality management techniques, such as QCC (<b>Quality</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Circle)</b> or other similar techniques and procedures aimed at improvements such as developing their functions, doing their job, and acting as an organization.

The model included the four tools with paths to the QCCs and Teians constructs. The results showed that only three of the four direct paths to Teians were significant (5 S, waste removal, and visual management). The explanation is that these three tools increased employees’ skills and experience which helped them to identify small-scaled problems and develop solutions within their work area. Only standard operations had a significant direct path to QCCs.
