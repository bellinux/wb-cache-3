Unit commissioners are adult Scouters that have significant tenure within the Scouting program (ten years' experience is recommended), and are dedicated to seeing individual units succeed. In general, the unit commissioner uses several different tools to measure {{the success of his}} or her units. Unit commissioners encourage all of their units to earn the <b>Quality</b> <b>Unit</b> award on a yearly basis and usually visit each of their units {{at least once a month}} to make sure the unit is functioning within the aims and goals of the Boy Scouts of America. The unit commissioner is aware of district, council, and local civic and Scouting functions that can help supplement the unit's program. They also promote the monthly district roundtable within their assigned units and make sure that the unit leadership is current on training courses required by the National Council.|$|E
5000|$|Working {{out of two}} nearby {{locations}} in the early 1970s - one housing Koss TV-Rental, which also did electronics and musical instrument repairs - and their main facility two blocks to the east - Koss pioneered the high-end [...] "electro-static" [...] "ES series" [...] headphone market. These headphones {{set the standard for}} wide-range frequency response. Being very durable, they required service for wear and tear on cords and ear pads - and K&M Electronics (Klenworth & Midwest based in Minneapolis), working out of the TV Rental location, supported the repair efforts, mainly of headphones that came in by the case from those customer locations. Koss headphones were easy and cost-effective to repair. At this site, in a separate garage setup, the musical instrument and electronics repair was done. The TV-rental and repair site was managed by John's brother Pete Koss. Eventually Koss dominated the headphone market, competing mainly with Telex. Koss however was considered a higher <b>quality</b> <b>unit</b> at the time, offering a wide line of models. Growth in the late 1970s caused them to move to their present location {{on the north side of}} Milwaukee.|$|E

5000|$|CPIL {{advocacy}} {{resulted in}} some legislation demarking medical regulation from most other trades and professions. Instead of a generic group of “consumer investigators” within the Department of Consumer Affairs, the Medical Board has specialized investigators. Similarly, the Office of Attorney General {{now has a}} dedicated medical <b>quality</b> <b>unit</b> that prosecutes these cases. And the Office of Administrative Hearings, providing the Administrative Law Judges (ALJs) that try the cases, also now has a distinct group that conducts the trials, allowing a smaller group of judges to experience many cases in this subject area, rather than spreading the cases across ALJs that handle alcohol, financial, real estate and many other areas of regulation. CPIL sponsored legislation creating those changes (SB 2375 (Presley) in 1990 and SB 916 (Presley) in 1993). The Medical Board cases may now be brought within three steps instead of four to five. Traditionally and as to most agencies, after the ALJ hearing, the proposed decision is still reviewed ‘’de novo’’ by the Medical Board (which has no judicial expertise and did not view the testimony - a step CPIL opposes) and then moves to independent judgment review by a superior court, {{automatic right of appeal}} to the court of appeal, and discretionary Supreme Court review. In the case of the Medical Board, CPIL won a change that makes the appellate court review by petition (and therefor discretionary). CPIL argued that the difference here is that a third level of appeal “of right” means even spurious appeals can delay final decision for years. So the Medical Board system has somewhat fewer proceedings and with some enhanced expertise by the officials involved.In addition to general process, CPIL has directed substantial advocacy to the problem of alcohol and drug abuse among professionals, including doctors, nurses and other health professionals, and attorneys. As Medical Board Enforcement Monitor, Professor D'Angelo Fellmeth audited the [...] "diversion" [...] program of the Medical Board—allowing those accused of incompetence or other dangerous practice to delay or mitigate their discipline through substance abuse programs. She also found a great deal of [...] "gaming" [...] of the system. [...] Her conclusions repeated similar findings of two prior audits by the Office of the State Auditor. Another audit after her report again repeated the same critique. Accordingly, the diversion program of the Medical Board was terminated by unanimous vote of the Board effective in 2011. CPIL's stated position is not to oppose drug/alcohol rehabilitation, but to avoid using rigged treatment that is not policed nor achieves compliance, as a means to continue practice without adequate disciplinary protection and with resulting patient jeopardy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Most {{enterprises}} have controlled claim data {{related to}} marketing, production, trade and delivery. They can extract the engineering {{information needed to}} the reliability of unit from the claim data, and also detect critical and latent reliability problems. Existing method which could detect abnormal <b>quality</b> <b>unit</b> lists in early stage from claim database has three problems: the exclusion of fallacy probability in claim, the false occurrence of claim fallacy alarm caused by not reflecting inventory information and too many excessive considerations of claim change factors. In this paper, we propose a process and methods extracting abnormal <b>quality</b> <b>unit</b> lists to solve three problems of existing method. Proposed one includes data extraction process for reliability measurement, the calculation method of claim fallacy alarm probability, the method for reflecting inventory time in calculating claim reliability and the method for identification of abnormal <b>quality</b> <b>unit</b> lists. This paper also shows that proposed mechanism could be effectively used after analyzing improved effects taken from automotive company's claim data adaptation for two years...|$|E
