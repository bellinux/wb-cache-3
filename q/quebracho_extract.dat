50|$|The tanning {{properties}} of <b>quebracho</b> <b>extracts</b> {{were discovered in}} 1867 by a French tanner, Emilio Poisier, who lived in Argentina. By 1895, the <b>quebracho</b> <b>extracts</b> were exported to Europe and became the principal vegetal tannin source in the world. Amongst other activities Ernesto Tornquist (1842-1908) organised the exploitation of quebracho in Santiago del Estero, in the Chaco region. Originally a dry forest area, the abundance of quebracho attracted timber industries of British capital during the 19th century, leading to extensive deforestation. This devastated the ecosystem {{in a relatively short}} time. The private owners of the Chaco then turned to cotton production, employing the local Toba people as a cheap seasonal workforce; the conditions did not change substantially for decades.|$|R

40|$|Agriculture in {{semi-arid}} and arid regions {{is constantly}} gaining {{importance for the}} security of the nutrition of humankind because of the rapid population growth. At the same time, especially these regions are more and more endangered by soil degradation, limited resources and extreme climatic conditions. One way to retain soil fertility under these conditions in the long run is to increase the soil organic matter. Thus, a two-year field experiment was conducted to test the efficiency of activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> as stabilizers of soil organic matter on a sandy soil low in nutrients in Northern Oman. Both activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> were either fed to goats and after defecation applied to the soil or directly applied to the soil in combination with dried goat manure. Regardless of the application method, both additives reduced decomposition of soil-applied organic matter and thus stabilized and increased soil organic carbon. The nutrient release from goat manure was altered by the application of activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> as well, however, nutrient release was not always slowed down. While activated charcoal fed to goats, was more effective in stabilising soil organic matter and in reducing nutrient release than mixing it, for <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> the opposite was the case. Moreover, the efficiency of the additives was influenced by the cultivated crop (sweet corn and radish), leading to unexplained interactions. The reduced nutrient release caused by the stabilization of the organic matter might be the reason for the reduced yields for sweet corn caused by the application of manure amended with activated charcoal and <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract.</b> Radish, on the other hand, was only inhibited by the presence of <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> but not by activated charcoal. This might be caused by a possible allelopathic effect of tannins on crops. To understand the mechanisms behind the changes in manure, in the soil, in the mineralisation and the plant development and to resolve detrimental effects, further research as recommended in this dissertation is necessary. Particularly in developing countries poor in resources and capital, feeding charcoal or tannins to animals and using their faeces as manure may be promising to increase soil fertility, sequester carbon and reduce nutrient losses, when yield reductions can be resolved.

50|$|Quebracho {{produces}} tannins {{that can}} be extracted in quebracho sawmills from the heartwood of both red (Schinopsis lorentzii) and white quebracho (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco). Logs are inserted into planers to produce chips {{that are used to}} produce the <b>quebracho</b> <b>extract</b> by boiling them in vats. It is used for fine leather tanning and imparts a red-brown color. Ordinary or warm soluble quebracho (also known as insoluble Quebracho) is the natural extract obtained directly from the quebracho wood. This type of extract is rich in condensed tannins of natural high molecular weight (phlobaphenes), which are not easily soluble. Its use is therefore limited to addition of small amounts during the process of tanning leather intended for shoe soles in hot liquids (temperature above 35 °C) to improve the yield and the water-proofness of the leather. The cold soluble extracts are obtained by subjecting the ordinary extract to a sulphiting process which transforms the phlobaphenes into completely soluble tannins. The cold soluble quebracho extracts are the most universally known and used types. The chemical structure of these extracts can be described as polymers of epicatechin. The main properties of these extracts are: a very rapid penetration, a high tannin content and a relatively low percentage of non-tannins. The rather low acid and medium salt content characterise them as mild tanning extracts (low astringency). Quebracho tannins give an important added value to the quality of leathers, such as vacchetta, belts and garments, making them more compact and tear resistant with a pleasant touch. The sulphited <b>quebracho</b> <b>extract</b> may be carcinogenous in mice. Other recent studies show that quebracho tannins present a strong anti-mutagenic activity. The heartwood contains from 20 to 30 percent tannin and 3 or 4 percent water-soluble nontannin. It is said to not ferment.|$|E

40|$|Gastrointestinal {{nematodes}} (GIN) {{represent a}} major health problem worldwide in grazing {{sheep and goat}} production systems. The control of these parasites has been complicated {{by the emergence of}} nematodes which are resistant to the commercially available anthelmintics (AHs). The use of tannin rich plants (TRP), as non-conventional Ahs, represents an alternative for the control of these parasites. However, the mechanism of action of such plants against adult populations of GIN has not been determined. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine the direct and indirect effect of TRP against adult populations of GIN in small ruminants. A direct effect is considered to be any action against the biology, structure and/or ultrastructure of the nematodes which is similar to a chemical AH. The indirect effect is a modification of the immune response of the host at the level of the gastrointestinal mucosa which affects the biology of the GIN. This study is divided into two stages: First stage) Two in vivo experiments conducted in Mexico and France respectively, determined the direct and indirect effects on the biology of GIN due to the consumption of the TRP forage of tzalam (Lysiloma latisiliquum), sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) as well as a tannin-rich <b>quebracho</b> <b>extract</b> (Schinopsis spp). Lambs were artificially infected with Haemonchus contortus (Mexico) or H. contortus and Trichostrongylus colubriformis (France). The consumption of tzalam affected the length and fertility of H. contortus females. Meanwhile, the <b>quebracho</b> <b>extract</b> reduced the population of H. contortus and T. colubriformis also affecting the fecundity of T. colubriformis. The sainfoin affected the fecundity of H. contortus without affecting T. colubriformis. The indirect effect was not evident. Second stage) An in vitro assay and two in vivo experiments with goats infected with H. contortus allowed to identify the effect of the consumption of TRP (tzalam or sainfoin) on the structure and ultrastructure of H. contortus. Alterations in cuticle and cephalic region were found. The aggregates in the vulva were only found in vitro. The ultrastructure of H. contortus showed a vacuolization process in the intestinal and muscular tissues of these nematodes.

Mean plasma N- 15 -enrichment at d 8 - 10 was higher (P = 0. 0009) after i. v. than after oral administration [0. 0356 vs. 0. 0379 atom% excess (APE) ]. Plasma 15 N-enrichment for i. v. infused pigs was 0. 01117 APE higher (P < 0. 0001) and for orally dosed pigs 0. 0081 APE lower (P < 0. 0001) at 11 h postprandial compared with 1 h postprandial. Apparent ileal N digestibility was higher (P < 0. 0001) for the control (85. 5 %) than for the quebracho diet (69. 5 %). ENR was calculated from the ratio of N- 15 -enrichment of plasma and digesta. The ENR for the quebracho diet was similar to 300 % higher than for the control diet (6. 03 vs. 1. 94 g/kg dry matter intake, P < 0. 001). The real N digestibility (92. 2 +/- 0. 4 %) was equal for both diets (P = 0. 1030) and both tracer methods (P = 0. 9730). We concluded that oral administration of [N- 15]leucine provides reasonable estimates of ENR in pigs fed semipurified diets with high or low content of tannins; however, one must be careful in extrapolating this conclusion to studies with other protein sources or feeding frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the response of rumen microbial ecosystem to diets integrated with chestnut or quebracho tannins in dairy ewes. The experiment was conducted as 3 X 3 Latin square design and the trial was repeated 2 times. Three fistulated ewes fed 3 diets based on chopped grass hay ad libitum administered and on 800 g / head and day of 3 experimental concentrates containing 84. 5 g of soybean oil / kg of DM and 52. 8 g / kg DM of bentonite (CON) or chestnut tannin <b>extract</b> (CHT) or <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> (QUE). At the end of each experimental period rumen liquor was analysed for fatty acid and microbial profiles. On the basis of the molar stoichiometric relations between rumen volatile fatty acid and CH 4 production (CH 4 = 0. 45 x acetate- 0. 275 x propionate + 0. 4 x butyrate), the CH 4 emission was also predicted for each diet. A canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was performed in order to find potential connection between microbial community, fatty acid composition of rumen liquor and potential CH 4 emission, and how these connections are influenced by the different diets. DGGE bands were used as "species" data, while fatty acids and potential CH 4 emission as "environmental" variables. The microbial profile was affected by the presence of tannins. The bacterial community of QUE and CHT samples of rumen liquor was positively correlated to vaccenic acid, conjugated linoleic acid and C 18 : 2 trans- 11 cis- 15. Moreover, the bacterial communities as affected by CHT resulted mainly positively correlated to butyric acid, acetic acid and with potential CH 4 emission. In contrast, the bacterial communities as affected by CON resulted mainly correlated positively to C 18 : 2 cis- 9 cis- 12 and C 18 : 0 production...|$|R
40|$|Tannins are {{phenolic}} compounds able {{to interfere with}} the biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The aim of this trial was to study in vitro the effects of <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> (QT) on the rumen biohydrogenation (BH) of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) contained in soybean and linseed oils. Two control diets were prepared using grass hay (770 g/kg on dry matter, DM), soybean meal (55 g/kg DM), barley meal (135 g/kg DM), supplemented with 35 g/kg DM of soybean (SOC diet) or linseed oil (LOC diet). Other two diets (SOCT and LOCT) were obtained by the integration of SOC and LOC with QT (49 g/ kg DM). Feeds (2 g DM) were incubated in triplicate with 200 ml of rumen liquor in a thermostatic chamber (39 °C) equipped with thirty-six 300 ml glass fermentation vessels. Incubation times were 6, 12 and 18 h. At each fermentation time, rumen liquor was fractionated in order to obtain liquid and solid associated bacteria (SAB). Only SAB were considered for the fatty acid analysis. QT induced a decrease of the BH of PUFA, favouring the accumulation of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid. After 18 h of fermentation the content of linoleic acid was reduced by 76 % and 42 % in SOC and SOCT feed, respectively, whereas the content of linolenic acid was reduced by 85 % and 73 % in LOC and LOCT feed, respectively. Conversely, the accumulation in rumen liquor of vaccenic acid, total CLA and the other intermediates of BH process was lower when QT was added to both SOC and LOC feeds. The content of 18 : 0 was significantly lower in both SOCT (- 33 %) and LOCT (- 17 %) feeds, if compared with the same feeds without QT. In conclusion, QT was effective in the reduction of the BH of PUFA in rumen liquor, {{especially in the case of}} linoleic acid...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the effects of different feed additives (cinnamaldehyde, monensin, and <b>quebracho</b> condensed tannin <b>extract)</b> on fermentation, trans fatty acids (FA) formation and selected strains of rumen bacteria. Four continuous culture systems were used in 4 × 4 Latin square designs with 4 periods of 10 days each. Treatment diets were: control diet (44 : 56 forage to concentrate; CON), control plus cinnamaldehyde (CIN) at 400 mg/L, control plus monensin (MON) at 12 mg/L, and control with <b>quebracho</b> condensed tannin <b>extract</b> (QTAN) at 100 g/kg of diet (DM basis). Fermenters were fed treatment diets three times daily at 120 g/day and overflow (effluent) samples were collected from each fermenter on days 8, 9 and 10 of each period to estimate nutrients digestibility and FA composition. On day 10 of each period, three samples were collected from each fermenter at 3 and 6 h post morning feeding for volatile fatty acids (VFA), ammonia-N and bacterial analyses. Compared with the CON diet, feed additives had no effects (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) on apparent dry matter (DM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and organic matter (OM) digestibility but apparent protein digestibility decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with the QTAN and CIN diets. Compared with the CON diet, the concentration of acetate decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with the MON and CIN diets. The concentration of propionate increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with the MON and QTAN diets and was greatest with the MON diet. Ammonia-N concentration decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with all feed additives and was least with the QTAN diet. The concentration of C 18 : 0 decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with the three feed additives and was least with the MON diet. Concentration of trans C 18 : 1 and vaccenic acid (VA) increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with the MON and CIN diets and was greatest with the MON diet. Compared with the CON diet, the concentration of c 9 t 11 CLA increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) only with the QTAN diet. The DNA abundance of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticum decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with the MON and CIN diets while the DNA abundance for Butyrivibrio VA increased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with all feed additives compared with the CON diet. Feed additives had no effects (P 3 ̆e 0. 05) on the DNA abundance of Anaerovibrio lipolytica and Butyrivibrio SA. In conclusion, results demonstrate that the feed additives {{used in this study}} affected the fermentation and biohydrogenation process. Addition of feed additives reduced the formation of C 18 : 0 but only MON and CIN increased VA formation. MON and CIN effects on VA formation may in part be explained by their effects on B. proteoclasticum...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to study a method based on gas {{production}} technique to measure the biological effects of tannins on rumen fermentation. Six feeds were used as fermentation substrates in a semi-automated gas method: feed A - aroeira (Astronium urundeuva); feed B - jurema preta (Mimosa hostilis), feed C - sorghum grains (Sorghum bicolor); feed D - Tifton- 85 (Cynodon sp.); and two others prepared mixing 450 g sorghum leaves, 450 g concentrate (maize and soybean meal) and 100 g either of acacia (Acacia mearnsii) tannin extract (feed E) or quebracho (Schinopsis lorentzii) tannin extract (feed F) per kg (w:w). Three assays were carried out to standardize the bioassay for tannins. The first assay compared two binding agents (polyethylene glycol - PEG - and polyvinyl polypirrolidone - PVPP) to attenuate the tannin effects. The complex formed by PEG and tannins showed to be more stable than PVPP and tannins. Then, in the second assay, PEG was used as binding agent, and this assay was done to evaluate levels of PEG (0, 500, 750, 1000 and 1250 mg/g DM) to minimize the tannin effect. All the tested levels of PEG produced a response to evaluate tannin effects but the best response was for dose of 1000 mg/g DM. Using this dose of PEG, the final assay was carried out to test three compounds (tannic acid, <b>quebracho</b> <b>extract</b> and acacia extract) to establish a curve of biological equivalent effect of tannins. For this, five levels of each compound were added to I g of a standard feed (Lucerne hay). The equivalent effect showed not to be directly related to the chemical analysis for tannins. It was shown that different sources of tannins had different activities or reactivities. The curves of biological equivalence can provide information about tannin reactivity and its use seems to be important as an additional factor for chemical analysis. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{determined}} {{whether an}} extract from {{the bark of}} the tree Aspidosperma quebracho blanco, which {{is used as a}} prescription drug to treat erectile dysfunction in some countries, can bind to human penile alpha 1 and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, and cloned human alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Competition binding studies were performed with alpha 1 and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors with the extract and 4 subfractions prepared from it using [3 H]prazosin (New England Nuclear, Dreieich, Germany) and [3 H]RX 821002 (2 -methoxy-idazoxam) (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) as the radioligands, respectively. RESULTS: In a concentration dependent manner the extract inhibited 2 -methoxy-idazoxam binding to human penile alpha 2 -adrenoceptors. Somewhat less potently it inhibited [3 H] prazosin binding to penile alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. The extract also inhibited binding to cloned alpha 2 -adrenoceptors more potently than to alpha 1 -adrenoceptors but did not discriminate among subtypes. Subfraction B was more potent than the others for all cloned alpha 1 -adrenoceptor subtypes and much more potent at all penile and all cloned alpha 2 -adrenoceptor subtypes. This fraction largely contained yohimbine, whereas the other fractions were devoid of yohimbine. Based on yohimbine competition binding experiments with penile and cloned alpha 1 and alpha 2 -adrenoceptors, it appears that the inhibitory effects of the abstract and its subfractions can largely be explained by its yohimbine content. CONCLUSIONS: An alpha-adrenoceptor mediated component of the pro-erectile effects of Aspidosperma <b>quebracho</b> blanco bark <b>extract</b> may predominantly be caused by its yohimbine content. The alpha-adrenoceptor independent, pro-erectile effects of the extract could not be determined from this stud...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} milk fatty acid (FA) profile, animal performance, and rumen microbial population in response to diets containing soybean oil supplemented or not with chestnut and quebracho tan- nins in dairy ewes. Eighteen Comisana ewes at 122 ± 6 d in milking were allotted into 3 experimental groups. Diets were characterized by chopped grass hay admin- istered ad libitum and by 800 g/head and day of 3 experimental concentrates containing 84. 5 g of soybean oil/kg of dry matter (DM) and 52. 8 g/kg of DM of bentonite (control diet), chestnut tannin extract (CHT diet), or <b>quebracho</b> tannin <b>extract</b> (QUE diet). The trial lasted 4 wk. Milk yield was recorded daily, and milk composition and blood parameters were analyzed weekly. At the end of the experiment, samples of rumen fluid were collected to analyze pH, volatile fatty acid profile, and the relative proportions of Butyrivibrio fi- brisolvens and Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus in the rumen microbial population. Hepatic functionality, milk yield, and gross composition were not affected by tannin ex- tracts, whereas milk FA composition was characterized by significant changes in the concentration of linoleic acid (CHT + 2. 77 % and QUE + 9. 23 %), vaccenic acid (CHT + 7. 07 % and QUE + 13. 88 %), rumenic acid (CHT − 1. 88 % and QUE + 24. 24 %), stearic acid (CHT + 8. 71 % and QUE − 11. 45 %), and saturated fatty acids (CHT − 0. 47 % and QUE − 3. 38 %). These differences were probably due to the ability of condensed versus hydrolyzable tannins to interfere with rumen microbial metabolism, as indirectly confirmed by changes in the relative proportions of B. fibrisolvens and B. proteo- clasticus populations and by changes in the molar proportions of volatile fatty acids. The effect of the CHT diet on the milk FA profile and microbial species considered in this trial was intermediate between that of QUE and the control diet, suggesting a differential effect of condensed and hydrolyzable tannins on rumen microbes. Compared with control animals, the pres- ence of B. fibrisolvens increased about 3 times in ewes fed CHT and about 5 times in animals fed QUE. In contrast, the abundance of B. proteoclasticus decreased about 5 - and 15 -fold in rumen liquor of ewes fed CHT and QUE diets, respectively. The use of soybean oil and a practical dose of QUE or CHT extract in the diet of dairy ewes can be an efficient strategy to improve the nutritional quality of milk...|$|R
40|$|Overall {{hypothesis}} in {{a series}} of lactation studies reported in this dissertation was that supplementing different rumen modifiers would have consistent responses on ruminal fermentation and lactational performance under optimal ruminal fermentative conditions. First experiment investigated the influence magnesium exchanged zeolite on ruminal fermentation and lactational performance. Intake of dry matter (DM), milk yield, milk fat concentration, and feed efficiency were not affected. Milk protein concentration tended (P = 0. 15) to be higher for the zeolite total mixed ration (TMR). Ruminal pH tended to increase (P = 0. 11) by feeding the sodium bicarbonate or the zeolite. A second lactation experiment determined the influence of <b>quebracho</b> condensed tannin <b>extract</b> (CTE) on ruminal fermentation and lactational performance. Supplementing CTE decreased intakes of DM and nutrients regardless of forage level thereby increasing feed efficiency. Milk yield and components were not affected. Milk urea N (MUN) and total VFA concentration decreased by supplementing CTE. Cows fed CTE had decreased ruminal ammonia-N and MUN concentrations, indicating that less ruminal N was lost as ammonia. A third lactation trial assessed whole safflower seeds (SS) on ruminal fermentation, lactational performance, and milk fatty acids. Feeding the Nutrasaff SS TMR (NSST) decreased intake of neutral detergent fiber. Digestibilities of nutrients, milk yield and components, ruminal pH, ruminal VFA, and ammonia-N were similar. Ruminal C 16 : 0 fatty acid (FA) concentration increased with the cottonseed TMR (CST), while C 18 : 1 cis- 9 and C 18 : 2 n- 6 tended (P = 0. 10 and P = 0. 09, respectively) to increase with SS supplementation. Supplementing SS decreased milk C 16 : 0 concentration, whereas it increased C 18 : 1 cis- 9 and C 18 : 1 trans- 9. Milk C 18 : 1 trans- 11 FA and cis- 9, trans- 11 conjugated linoleic acid increased and tended (P = 0. 07) to increase with feeding the NSST. Feeding zeolite would cost-effectively replace sodium bicarbonate as a ruminal buffer, whereas CTE may change the route of N excretion, having less excretion into urine, but more into feces. Whole SS can be an effective fat supplement to lactating dairy cows without negative impacts on lactational performance and milk FA. These studies demonstrate that the three rumen modifiers can positively manipulate ruminal fermentation...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} binding of low molecular mass analogues of polyphenolic vegetable tannins to collagen have prompted {{the development of a}} new method to investigate protein-ligand interactions. This method, the continuous-flow dynamic dialysis method (CFDD), differs from conventional dialysis procedures used for protein-ligand binding studies. In this method, the ligand concentration in the diffusate is monitored automatically at successive closely spaced time intervals while being continuously eluted from the dialysis cell. The primary data obtained by this method consists of a series of spectrophotometric absorbance measurements representing the ligand concentration in the sink compartment of a dialysis cell. This primary data is recorded by means of a data logging device onto a punched paper tape for subsequent computer processing. Two original methods are presented for analysing the primary data to extract the protein-ligand binding isotherm. The first of these is a direct analysis which relies on Fick's first law of diffusion. In this method it is necessary to establish, by means of a control experiment, a value for the ligand permeation constant. This is used in a subsequent analysis to establish a relationship between the measured rate of diffusion of the ligand from a protein-ligand mixture and the concentration of unbound ligand which is in equilibrium with the protein-ligand complex. The protein-ligand binding isotherm is obtained from parametric equations which give the quantity of ligand bound to the protein and the concentration of unbound ligand in the sample compartment as functions of time. The second method, which is more general, utilizes the same primary data but is based on establishing a system transfer function to characterise the dialysis and eluting processes. This analysis depends on the linearity of the system and utilizes numerical laplace transforms of the primary data sets obtained from control and protein-ligand dialyses. Laplace transforms are used to effect a deconvolution of the transfer function from the primary data and yield the concentration of ligand in equilibrium with the protein-ligand complex. This procedure yields, simultaneously, both the total ligand concentration and the concentration of unbound ligand in the protein compartment of the dialysis cell. These quantities are used to establish the binding isotherm for the protein ligand system. Numerical inversion of the laplace transforms in this analysis is effected by their reduction to Fourier series. The experimental reliability of the continuous-flow dynamic dialysis method, and validity of the two analytical methods used to derive a binding isotherm from dialysis data are evaluated from studies of the binding of phenol red to bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 15 ⁰, 20 ⁰ and 25 ⁰ C, as well as from simulated binding curves generated by the numerical solution of the differential equations used to describe the dialysis and elution process in terms of a two-site Scatchard binding model. The method is used to investigate the binding to collagen of a series of low molecular mass phenolic compounds which can be isolated from Wattle and <b>Quebracho</b> vegetable tannin <b>extracts.</b> These compounds can be considered as monomeric precursor analogues of the polymeric vegetable tannins. The binding of these ligands to collagen is shown to be characterised by high capacity, low affinity binding in which the uptake of ligand by the protein increases linearly with increasing ligand concentration. Collagen exhibits no indication of site saturation for these ligands over the experimentally accessible concentration ranges investigated...|$|R
