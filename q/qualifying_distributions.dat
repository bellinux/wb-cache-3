This act applied further regulations and penalties that took away many of the privileges that supporting organizations had over private foundations. The act applies the self-dealing regulations of private foundations on supporting organizations. The act requires a payout—but leaves the exact demands of the payout, including rate and from which assets for the Treasury to determine later. The Act applied the private foundation rules of excess business holdings and the excess benefit prohibitions from the private foundation law. The act also tightened the tests for Type III supporting organizations to demonstrate that Type III supporting organizations has dependent supported organizations and that has {{no more than five}} supported organizations. The act also made collateral attacks on supporting organizations by forbidding donor-advised funds and private foundations from making <b>qualifying</b> <b>distributions</b> to Type III supporting organizations, and should they do so the distributions would become taxable subject to their respective excise taxes. Further restrictions, including explication of the payout rate contours will result from the Congress mandated survey that the IRS promulgated.|$|E

40|$|In the {{interest}} of encouraging workers to save for retirement, Congress has authorized several kinds of retirement savings plans that qualify for reduced or deferred income taxes. These plans provide a financial incentive for people to save, either by allowing workers and employers to deduct from income the amount they contribute to the plan or to take tax-free distributions from the plan after they retire. This CRS Report summarizes the provisions of law that govern the taxes applicable to pre-retirement distributions from retirement accounts, and the situations in which distributions must be taken from a plan {{in order to avoid}} a tax penalty. Because tax-deductible contributions to retirement plans and deferral of taxes on investment earnings reduce federal income tax collections, Congress has placed limits on the amount that can be contributed to these plans each year. To assure that the tax preferences granted to retirement accounts are used to promote retirement income security rather than to subsidize transfers of wealth {{from one generation to the}} next, federal law requires owners of retirement accounts that are funded with taxdeductible contributions to begin taking required minimum distributions from the accounts after they reach age 70 ½. Failure to take a required minimum distribution will result in a tax penalty equal to 50 % of the amount that should have been distributed. Retirement plans that are funded with after-tax income — like the “Roth IRA” — do not have required minimum distributions during the account owner’s lifetime. To discourage individuals from taking pre-retirement withdrawals from retirement savings accounts, the Internal Revenue Code (I. R. C.) imposes a 10 % penalty on withdrawals taken before age 59 ½, which is levied in addition to any other applicable income tax. Recognizing that some significant events might require people to withdraw money from their retirement accounts earlier than expected, Congress has provided in law for waiving the 10 % early withdrawal penalty in some situations. As with required distributions after age 70 ½, Roth IRAs have a special rule with respect to early withdrawals. Because contributions to a Roth IRA must consist entirely of income on which income tax has already been paid, <b>qualified</b> <b>distributions</b> from a Roth IRA are not subject to income taxes or penalties...|$|R

We present here the results of a murine comparative bioavailability study of Casperome™, a soy lecithin formulation of standardized B. serrata gum resin extract (BE), and its corresponding non-formulated extract. The concentration of the six major BAs [11 -keto-β-boswellic acid (KBA), acetyl- 11 -keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA), β-boswellic acid (βBA), acetyl-β-boswellic acid (AβBA), α-boswellic acid (αBA), and acetyl-α-boswellic acid (AαBA) ] was evaluated in the plasma and in a series of tissues (brain, muscle, eye, liver and kidney), providing the first data on tissue distribution of BAs. Weight equivalent and equimolar oral administration of Casperome™ provided significantly higher plasma levels (up to 7 -fold for KBA, and 3 -fold for βBA quantified as area under the plasma concentration time curve, AUClast) compared to the non-formulated extract. This was accompanied by remarkably higher tissue levels. Of particular relevance was the marked increase in brain concentration of KBA and AKBA (35 -fold) as well as βBA (3 -fold) following Casperome™ administration.

A further {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate <b>qualified</b> mathematics teachers? <b>distribution</b> in relation to student SES among Turkish middle schools. Finally, relationships between mathematics teacher quality indicators and students? mathematics achievement within Turkish middle-school classrooms were explored. In this dissertation, Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2007 data were used. Sample countries were Turkey, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, and Slovenia. Achievement gaps by gender and SES were examined using Cohen?s d effect sizes and 95 percent confidence intervals. Relationships between mathematics teacher quality and students? mathematics achievement were investigated using hierarchical linear modeling. Results showed none or only negligible gender differences but substantial SES-related gaps in Turkish students? achievement in mathematics, overall, or in various content and cognitive domains. Correlations between students? SES levels and their achievement were the largest in Turkey compared to the sample EU countries. Among the sample EU countries, only Hungary had as large or even somewhat larger disparities as Turkey between low- and high-SES students? mathematics achievement. The current study also identified SES-related inequities in access to qualified mathematics teachers in Turkey. Low-SES students were more likely to be taught by mathematics teachers who had less than 3 years of experience or who did not hold a degree in mathematics or mathematics education. On the other hand, years of experience and a degree in mathematics or mathematics education were found to be substantially related to Turkish eighth-grade students? mathematics achievement. Low-SES students? mathematics teachers were also more likely to report lack of confidence in their preparation to teach various mathematics contents. To narrow achievement gaps, Turkish policy-makers can explore and benefit from policies of the countries identified in the present study as more equitable in terms of student achievement than Turkey. The current study also shows Turkish policy-makers importance of the equitable <b>distribution</b> of <b>qualified</b> mathematics teachers in closing the mathematics achievement gap in middle schools...|$|R
