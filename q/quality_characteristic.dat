While the origins of this style are disputed, it is either an offshoot of provincial Roman art, Frank, or Jute art. One style flourished from the late 5th century, and continued throughout the 6th, and is on many square-headed brooches, {{it is characterised by}} chip-carved patterns based on animals and masks. A different style, which gradually superseded it is dominated by serpentine beasts with interlacing bodies.|$|E

This paper presents multi-objective optimisation of the CO 2 laser cutting process considering three cut <b>quality</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as surface roughness, heat affected zone (HAZ) and kerf width. It combines an experimental design by using Taguchi’s method, modelling {{the relationships between the}} laser cutting factors (laser power, cutting speed, assist gas pressure and focus position) and cut <b>quality</b> <b>characteristics</b> by artificial neural networks (ANNs), formulation of the multiobjective optimisation problem using weighting sum method, and solving it by the novel meta-heuristic cuckoo search algorithm (CSA). The objective is to obtain optimal cutting conditions dependent on the importance order of the cut <b>quality</b> <b>characteristics</b> for each of four different case studies presented in this paper. The case studies considered in this study are: minimisation of cut <b>quality</b> <b>characteristics</b> with equal priority, minimisation of cut <b>quality</b> <b>characteristics</b> with priority given to surface roughness, minimisation of cut <b>quality</b> <b>characteristics</b> with priority given to HAZ, and minimisation of cut <b>quality</b> <b>characteristics</b> with priority given to kerf width. The results indicate that the applied CSA for solving the multi-objective optimisation problem is effective, and that the proposed approach can be used for selecting the optimal laser cutting factors for specific production requirements...|$|R

The quality of the product depends on the combined effect of these characteristics, rather than on their individual values.

50|$|In {{systems with}} {{parameter}} determination the required {{level of control}} quality is achieved by automatically searching for an optimum (in some sense) set of parameter values. Control quality is described by a generalised characteristic which is usually a complex and not completely known or stable function of the primary parameters. This characteristic is either measured directly or computed based on the primary parameter values. The parameters are then tentatively varied. An analysis of the control <b>quality</b> <b>characteristic</b> oscillations caused by the varying of the parameters {{makes it possible to}} figure out if the parameters have optimum values, i.e.. if those values deliver extreme (minimum or maximum) values of the control <b>quality</b> <b>characteristic.</b> If the characteristic values deviate from an extremum, the parameters need to be varied until optimum values are found.
