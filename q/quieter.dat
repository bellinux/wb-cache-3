40|$|<b>Quiet</b> tunnel {{technology}} at NASA Langley is reviewed focusing on historical background, basic <b>quiet</b> tunnel concepts, design methodology, and significant results. Each of the NASA Langley <b>quiet</b> tunnels and recent flow quality results for a refurbished Mach 6 <b>quiet</b> nozzle are presented. It is concluded that high-speed <b>quiet</b> tunels {{should be viewed}} as a required adjunct to computational and experimental tools being developed to explore issues of instability and transition physics. The <b>quiet</b> tunnel technology can produce and maintain an adequately smooth nozzle finish, control settling chamber disturbances, and keep the facility clean and is capable of adequately measuring flow disturbances...|$|R

5|$|The {{loudness}} of {{the song}} is correlated {{with the size of}} the male {{and the quality of the}} habitat, both indicators of male attractiveness. The loudest males may attract 20 females in one evening, when a <b>quieter</b> male may attract none. This behaviour enables acoustic trapping: females can be trapped in large numbers by broadcasting a male's song very loudly.|$|E

5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular place there have been suggestions for moving it to a <b>quieter</b> area.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many of the pilots were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from <b>quieter</b> areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is {{the eighth}} studio album by American {{experimental}} rock band Sonic Youth, released on May 10, 1994 by DGC Records. It {{was produced by}} Butch Vig and recorded at Sear Sound studio in New York City, the same studio where the band's 1987 album Sister was recorded. Unlike its predecessor Dirty, Experimental Jet Set features a more low-key approach and references the band's earlier work on the independent record label SST Records. The album contains <b>quieter</b> and more relaxed songs that deal with personal and political topics.|$|E

5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally <b>quieter,</b> and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Airbus {{introduced}} a new enhanced comfort cabin for the A320. Airbus says it offers better luggage storage and a <b>quieter</b> cabin, packaged with a more modern look and feel. Additionally, improved cabin efficiency from a new galley concept, reduced weight, improved ergonomics and food hygiene, and recycling requirements. LED ambiance lighting is optionally available. Anytime LEDs are used for the Passenger Service Unit (PSU) and passengers can get information with touchscreen displays. Older A320 series aircraft can be updated.|$|E
5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with <b>quieter</b> calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into the bark of a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This {{field study}} tested the {{effectiveness}} of <b>quiet</b> hours (an hour free of any phone calls, visitors or incoming emails). Objective: Based on interruptions research and on a behavioral decision-making approach to time management, we argue that establishing <b>quiet</b> hours is a precommitment strategy against predominantly harmful interruptions. Furthermore, conscientiousness {{and the use of}} other time management techniques should moderate the effects of the <b>quiet</b> hour. Method: We tested this by using a two-week experimental diary study with managers as participants. Results: Multi-level analyses showed that a <b>quiet</b> hour improved the performance on a task worked on during the <b>quiet</b> hour in comparison to a similar task on a day without a <b>quiet</b> hour. Furthermore, overall performance was higher on days with a <b>quiet</b> hour than on days without one. Conscientiousness acted as a moderator, unlike the use of other time management techniques. Conclusion: These results imply that more people should consider implementing a <b>quiet</b> hour, especially if they are non-conscientious...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} initial public {{offering}} <b>quiet</b> period following the implementation of NYSE and NASD rules extending the <b>quiet</b> period from 25 to 40 days for lead underwriters. While early studies found positive excess returns at the expiration of the <b>quiet</b> period, more recent studies suggest that these returns have disappeared. Controlling for simultaneity bias and changes in analyst behaviour, we investigate whether positive significant returns indeed no longer occur around the expiration of the <b>quiet</b> period. Overall, {{we find that the}} <b>quiet</b> period is making noise again. ...|$|R

He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a <b>quieter</b> section of the front.|$|E
5|$|The Bedouin {{way of life}} {{depended}} on camels and horses: Arabians were bred to be war horses with speed, endurance, soundness, and intelligence. Because many raids required stealth, mares were preferred over stallions as they were <b>quieter,</b> and therefore would not give away {{the position of the}} fighters. A good disposition was also critical; prized war mares were often brought inside family tents to prevent theft and for protection from weather and predators. Though appearance was not necessarily a survival factor, the Bedouin bred for refinement and beauty in their horses as well as for more practical features.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort to}} develop a lighter, <b>quieter</b> camera with a reflex {{viewfinder}} led {{to the introduction of}} the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967.

Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon {{became one of the most}} popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{provides}} new evidence of deficient auditory cortical processing of speech in noise in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Speech-evoked responses (* 100 – 300 ms) in <b>quiet</b> and background noise were evaluated in typically-developing (TD) children and chil-dren with ASD. ASD responses showed delayed timing (both conditions) and reduced amplitudes (<b>quiet)</b> compared to TD responses. As expected, TD responses in noise were delayed and reduced compared to <b>quiet</b> responses. How-ever, minimal quiet-to-noise response {{differences were found}} in children with ASD, presumably because <b>quiet</b> responses were already severely degraded. Moreover, ASD <b>quiet</b> responses resembled TD noise responses, implying that children with ASD process speech in <b>quiet</b> only as well as TD children do in background noise...|$|R
