25|$|Major bushfires have {{occurred}} in March 1894, January 1910, January 1917, March 1939, February 1949, and a very significant fire which consumed around two-thirds of the island in 1955. Some of these bushfires were caused by European hunting parties and on one occasion almost wiped out the <b>quokka</b> population.|$|E
5000|$|Like most macropods, <b>quokkas</b> eat {{many types}} of vegetation, {{including}} grasses and leaves. A study found that Guichenotia ledifolia, a small shrub species of the family Malvaceae, {{is one of the}} <b>quokka's</b> favoured foods. Rottnest Island visitors are urged to never feed <b>quokkas,</b> in part because eating [...] "human food" [...] can be very detrimental to the <b>quokka's</b> health, causing them to be dehydrated and malnourished. Despite the relative lack of fresh water on Rottnest Island, <b>quokkas</b> do have high water requirements, which they satisfy mostly through eating vegetation. On the mainland <b>quokkas</b> only live in the areas that have 600 mm or more of rain per year.|$|R
40|$|Blood was {{collected}} from <b>quokkas</b> (Setonix brachyurus), from a mainland and an island population, and analysed {{as part of}} an assessment of animal health. Mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration was the only analyte that was significantly different between the mainland and island populations. <b>Quokkas</b> from both the wild populations had lesser erythrocytic values than the captive animals. The wild <b>quokkas</b> also possessed three types of haemoparasites that were not recognised in the captive animals. This study illustrates the differences in the haematological characteristics between wild and captive animals...|$|R
50|$|In 2015 an {{extensive}} bushfire near Northcliffe nearly eradicated {{one of the}} local mainland populations, with an estimated 90% of the 500 <b>quokkas</b> dying.|$|R
25|$|The Warren region {{supports}} a rich diversity of fauna, {{much of which}} is apparently Gondwanan in origin. Mammal species include the western ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus occidentalis), chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii) (particularly found in Jarrah forest), the squirrel-like brush-tailed phascogale (Phascogale tapoatafa), <b>quokka</b> (Setonix brachyurus), yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes leucogaster), southern brown bandicoot (Isoodon obesulus), and woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi). The first four of these are endangered species and numbers {{of many of the}} indigenous marsupials have declined as their habitats are removed and altered.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with several}} other islands, Rottnest was {{separated}} from the mainland around 7,000 years ago, when sea levels rose. Human artefacts have been found on the island dating back at least 30,000 years, and the island is called Wadjemup by the Noongar people. Dutch sailors landed there on several occasions during the 17th century, by which time it was uninhabited. The island was named by Willem de Vlamingh in 1696, who called it Rotte nest ("rat's nest") after the <b>quokka</b> population. Since {{the establishment of the}} Swan River Colony by British settlers in 1829, the island has variously hosted a penal colony, military installations, and internment camps for enemy aliens. Many of the island's buildings date from the colonial period, often made from locally quarried limestone, and are now used as accommodation for holidays.|$|E

40|$|A {{total of}} 41 ticks were {{collected}} from 15 <b>quokkas</b> on Bald Island and 2 ticks from a Gilbert 2 ̆ 7 s potoroo from Two Peoples Bay. Three species of Ixodid ticks Ixodes australiensis, Ixodes hirsti and Ixodes myrmecobii were identified on the <b>quokkas</b> known {{to have a high}} prevalence of Trypanosoma copemani. Tick faeces from ticks isolated from 8 individual <b>quokkas</b> and a Gilbert 2 ̆ 7 s potoroo were examined with one identified as positive for trypanosomes. Faecal examination revealed trypanosomes similar to in vitro life-cycle stages of T. copemani. In total 12 ticks were dissected and trypanosomes found in sections of their midgut and haemolymph, 49 and 117 days after collection. Tick faeces, salivary glands and midguts from I. australiensis were screened using an 18 S rRNA PCR with amplification seen only from the midguts. Sequencing showed 100...|$|R

50|$|This merger {{proved to}} be an ill-fated arrangement. The burst of the dot-com bubble led the two {{companies}} to split after less than two years. Thorn led a management buyout of the publishing division during the summer of 2000. The Raleigh-based web business was purchased by the San Francisco-based internet company <b>Quokka</b> Sports. Both Thorn's new venture and <b>Quokka</b> Sports would declare bankruptcy by 2002.|$|E
50|$|The <b>quokka</b> {{population}} on Rottnest Island is 8,000-12,000 (est. 2007). Snakes are the quokka's only predator on the island. The {{population on}} smaller Bald Island, where the <b>quokka</b> has no predators, is 600-1,000. There {{are an estimated}} 4,000 quokkas on the mainland, with nearly all mainland populations in groups of less than 50, although there is one declining group of over 700 in the southern forest between Nannup and Denmark.|$|E
50|$|The dorcopsises are the {{marsupials}} {{of the genera}} Dorcopsis and Dorcopsulus. They {{are found}} in the tropical forests of New Guinea and Southeast Indonesia.

50|$|In 2016 {{the island}} was chosen as a new habitat site for the {{critically}} endangered Gilbert's Potoroo.

50|$|The current {{estimated}} population is a sparse seventy individuals. It {{was thought to}} be extinct until its rediscovery in 1994.
