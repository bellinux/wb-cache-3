The primary purpose of the route was at the time to provide access to the home of the Dionne <b>Quintuplets,</b> the first set of <b>quintuplets</b> to survive past infancy, who caused a massive increase to tourism in the area. The only change to the route occurred when the Callander Bypass of Highway11 opened in 1987, extending Highway94 south from Lansdowne Street along the former alignment to a junction with Highway654. The route has remained unchanged since then.|$|E

In conjunction with the 2 HDM fields, on top of which our model is built, these hypercharge zero fields and additional scalar <b>quintuplet</b> lead to an accidental DM-protecting Z 2 symmetry and establish the RνMDM model at the three-loop level. We assess the potential for discovery of <b>quintuplet</b> fermions on present and future pp colliders...|$|R

25|$|The Quinlan Quints: four <b>quintuplets</b> (the fifth {{one went}} missing {{and has never}} been found) who live in Buchans, Newfoundland and Labrador – {{inspired}} by the fame of the Dionne quintuplets; portrayed by Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh (Colin Mochrie plays Mercer's quint role for seasons 9 and 10). Usually interviewed by Mercer's character J.B. Dickson, the Quints would boast about something outlandish that Dickson has a hard time believing until one of the quints (usually Jones) spills the beans and reveals that what they were promoting was really a scam. Discontinued when Mochrie left the show.|$|E
25|$|In {{dealing with}} the {{emotional}} fallout from {{the murder of her}} sister, Frost travels to the mutant haven island of Genosha, where she teaches at a mutant school until a genocidal Sentinel attack kills most of the island's inhabitants; Frost survives due to the sudden manifestation of her secondary mutation: the power to transform herself into a flexible, near-invulnerable, diamond-like substance. After being rescued Frost joins the X-Men and takes on a teaching position at Xavier Institute. She mentors a group of telepathic <b>quintuplets,</b> the Stepford Cuckoos, who quickly become her prized pupils. Frost and the Cuckoos prove themselves when they help fight and defeat Charles Xavier's evil twin sister Cassandra Nova. As a member of the X-Men, Frost begins counselling Cyclops over his marriage with Jean however, this soon turns into a psychic, non-physical, sexual relationship.|$|E
500|$|Both {{sections}} of the piece {{are based on a}} theme from a motet, Ecce sacerdos magnus ("Behold a great priest"), by the Spanish composer Tomás Luis de Victoria (or [...] "Vittoria", 1548–1611). The theme, which comes from a plainchant melody used in Vittoria's day on the feast day of a saint and bishop, is nine notes long and does not range widely. The Prelude, which is in [...] time (four minims to a bar), opens with a statement of the theme played on the pedals in <b>quintuplets</b> (five quavers played in the time of four), marked ff, (fortissimo, [...] "very loud"). The theme is repeated frequently in the pedals during the prelude, which is marked [...] "largamente" [...] ("broadly"). The prelude, which takes about one and a half minutes in performance, is thirteen bars long.|$|E

We present the production cross sections and the main kinematic distributions of the various observables. Our numerical results show that the values of cross sections can reach a few hundreds of fb. We also study the possible final state signals of <b>quintuplet</b> heavy leptons and relevant SM backgrounds.

40|$|We {{confront the}} perturbativity {{problem in the}} real scalar <b>quintuplet</b> minimal dark matter model. In the {{original}} model, the <b>quintuplet</b> quartic self-coupling inevitably hits a Landau pole at a scale about 10 ^{ 14 } GeV, far below the Planck scale. In order to push up this Landau pole scale, we extend the model with a fermionic <b>quintuplet</b> and three fermionic singlets which couple to the scalar <b>quintuplet</b> via Yukawa interactions. Involving such Yukawa interactions at a scale about 10 ^{ 10 } GeV not only can keep all couplings perturbative up to the Planck scale, but also can explain the smallness of neutrino masses via the type-I seesaw mechanism. Furthermore, we identify the parameter regions favored by the condition that perturbativity and vacuum stability are both maintained up to the Planck scale. Comment: 22 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
500|$|The most {{gripping}} {{news story}} of the pre-Code era was the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby {{on the evening of}} 1 March 1932. As the child was already enormously famous before the kidnapping, the event created a media circus, with news coverage more intense than anything since World War I. Newsreels featuring family photos of the child (the first time private pictures had been [...] "conscripted for public service") asked spectators to report any sight of him. On May 12, 1932, the child's body was found less than five miles from the Lindbergh home. Although newsreels covered the most important topics of the day, they also presented human-interest stories (such as the immensely popular coverage of the Dionne <b>quintuplets)</b> and entertainment news, at times in greater detail than more pressing political and social matters.|$|E

2500|$|Multiples {{are also}} {{known to have}} a higher {{mortality}} rate. [...] It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high. [...] A literary review on multiple pregnancies shows a study done on one set each of septuplets and octuplets, two sets of sextuplets, 8 sets of <b>quintuplets,</b> 17 sets of quadruplets, and 228 sets of triplets. [...] By doing this study, Hammond found that the mean gestational age (how many weeks when birthed) at birth was 33.4 weeks for triplets and 31 weeks for quadruplets. This shows that stillbirth happens usually 3–5 weeks before the woman reaches full term and also that for sextuplets or higher it almost always ends in death of the fetuses.|$|E
