40|$|It {{has been}} more than a decade since the first reports of [Gd(Tren-Me- 3, 2 -HOPO) (H{sub 2 }O) {sub 2 }] as a {{potential}} new class of magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent (MRI-CA). The defining feature of these 1 -methyl- 3 -hydroxypyridin- 2 -one (Me- 3, 2 -HOPO) based compounds has been the use of a hexadentate ligand design, and hence {{an increase in the number}} of metal bound water molecules, without sacrificing complex stability compared to the typically octadentate contrast agents used commercially. Since that time, significant advances in the properties of these chelates have been steadily reported, including improvements in relaxivity, incorporation into macromolecular architectures and, recently, the first direct verification of solution structure using the discovery of Eu(III) centered luminescence with the isomeric 1 -hydroxypyridin- 2 -one (1, 2 -HOPO) chelate as a sensitizing chromophore. Nonetheless, it has remained frustrating that direct measurements of the inner sphere hydration state, q, using luminescence techniques with the parent Me- 3, 2 -HOPO compounds have remained elusive, even when direct laser excitation of weakly absorbing f-f transitions were employed (eg. for Eu(III) complexes). This failing can likely be traced to the presence of a low lying LMCT state which efficiently quenches metal based emission. Instead, estimates of the q and hence solution structure have relied on the fitting of relaxivity data to the Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan equations or, where sufficiently soluble in aqueous solution, studies on the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic contribution to the water {sup 17 }O NMR transverse relaxation rate. Recently, Beeby et al reported on a <b>qualitative</b> <b>equation</b> to determine inner sphere hydration based on the change in lifetimes for Yb(III) in going from H{sub 2 }O to D{sub 2 }O solution, and we reasoned that the lower energy accepting state of Yb(III) may lie below the LMCT state which quenches Eu(III) emission, and hence may facilitate sensitized emission from Yb(III). This hypothesis was borne out experimentally, and herein we describe for the first time sensitized luminescence in the Near Infra-Red (NIR) region from a [Yb(Tren-Me- 3, 2 -HOPO) (H{sub 2 }O) {sub 2 }] complex, and hence the direct measurement of q for the archetypical member of this family of compounds...|$|E

40|$|Qualitative {{simulation}} {{predicts the}} set of possible behaviors consistent with a <b>qualitative</b> differential <b>equation</b> model of the world. Its value comes from the ability to express natural types of incomplete knowledge of the world, {{and the ability to}} derive a provably complete set of possible behaviors in spite of the incompleteness of the model. A <b>qualitative</b> differential <b>equation</b> model (QDE) is an abstraction of an ordinary differential equation, consisting of a set of real-valued variables and functional, algebraic and differential constraints among them. A QDE model is qualitative in two senses. First, the values of variables are described in terms of their ordinal relations with a finite set of symbolic landmark values, rather than in terms of real numbers. Second, functional relations may be described as monotonic functions (increasing or decreasing over particular ranges) rather than by specifying a functional form. These purely qualitative descriptions can be augmented with semi-quantitative knowledge in the form of real bounding intervals around unknown real values and real-valued bounding envelope functions around unknown real-valued functions. Qualitative and semi-quantitative models can be derived by composing model fragments and collecting the associated modeling assumptions. Qualitative simulation starts with a QDE and a qualitative description of an initial state. Given a qualitativ...|$|R

The regulation of gene expression is achieved through genetic regulatory systems structured by networks of interactions between DNA, RNA, proteins, and small molecules. As most genetic regulatory networks of interest involve many components connected through interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, an intuitive understanding of their dynamics is hard to obtain. As a consequence, formal methods and computer tools for the modeling and simulation of genetic regulatory networks will be indispensable.
