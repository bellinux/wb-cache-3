40|$|Five {{localized}} {{punching shear}} failures occurred on important precast deck panel bridges in southwest Florida. This {{was attributed to}} the use of compressible fiberboard for supporting the precast panels. This paper describes the in-depth investigation undertaken to understand the cause of failure and the subsequent development of a deterioration model for identifying at-risk deck panel bridges. This was based on a comprehensive review of historical inspection records, bridge plans, special reports, on-site forensic investigation of bridges being replaced and interviews with inspectors. The <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> model identified 13 stages leading to failure and was successfully used to prioritize the planned replacement of 85 precast deck panel bridges over ten years. The validity of the model was proven by subsequent punching shear failures of two more precast panel deck bridges, both included in the top ten at-risk bridge list. ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This randomized, split-mouth {{clinical}} study evaluated the survival rate of direct laminate veneers made of two resin-composite materials. Methods: A total of 23 patients (mean age: 52. 4 years old) received 96 direct composite laminate veneers using two micro-hybrid composites {{in combination with}} two adhesive resins (Ena-Bond-Enamel HFO: n = 48, Clearfil SE Bond-Miris 2 : n = 48). Enamel was selectively etched with 38 % H 3 PO 4 for 30 s, rinsed 30 s and the corresponding adhesive resin was applied accordingly. Existing resin composite restorations in good conditions (small or big) were not removed but conditioned using silica coating (CoJet) and silanized (ESPE-Sil). Restorations were evaluated at baseline and thereafter every 6 months. Additional qualitative analysis was performed using modified USPHS criteria. Results: Mean observation period was 41. 3 months. Altogether, 12 absolute failures were observed [survival rate: 87. 5 %] (Kaplan-Meier). The survival rates with the two resin composites did not show significant differences [Enamel HFO: 81. 2 %, Miris 2 : 93. 8 %] (p > 0. 05). The presence of existing composite restorations on the prepared teeth {{did not affect the}} survival rate significantly (intact teeth: 100 %, small restorations: 90. 6 %, big restorations: 82. 7 %) (p > 0. 05). Surface roughness and marginal discolouration were the main <b>qualitative</b> <b>deteriorations</b> observed until the final recall. Secondary caries and endodontic complications did not occur in any of the teeth. Conclusion: Early findings of this {{clinical study}} with the two micro-hybrid composite laminate veneers showed similar survival rate and their clinical performance was not significantly influenced when bonded onto intact teeth or onto teeth with existing restorations with the protocol applied.

40|$|UVB-induced {{cutaneous}} photodamage/photoaging {{is characterized}} by <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative <b>deterioration</b> in dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagen and elastic fibers. Disappearance of microfibrillar-associated protein 4 (MFAP- 4), a possible limiting factor for cutaneous elasticity, was documented in photoaged dermis, but its function is poorly understood. To characterize its possible contribution to photoprotection, MFAP- 4 expression was either augmented or inhibited in a human skin xenograft photodamage murine model and human fibroblasts. Xenografted skin with enhanced MFAP- 4 expression was protected from UVB-induced photodamage/photoaging accompanied by the prevention of ECM degradation and aggravated elasticity. Additionally, remarkably increased or decreased fibrillin- 1 -based microfibril development was observed when fibroblasts were treated with recombinant MFAP- 4 or with MFAP- 4 -specific siRNA, respectively. Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed direct interaction between MFAP- 4 and fibrillin- 1.

However, a growing awareness of the adverse impacts of inorganic fertilizers on crop production as well as increasing environmental and ecological concerns has stimulated greater interest in the utilization of organic amendments for crop production. Organic manures act {{not only as a}} source of nutrients and organic matter, but also increase microbial diversity and activity in soil, which influence soil structure and nutrients turnover, in addition to improvement in other physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil (Albiach et al. 2000; Edmeades 2003). Thus organic amendments/manures are environmentally benign and help in maintaining soil fertility as well as agricultural productivity. Among various organic products, vermicompost has been recognized as potential soil amendment.|$|E

40|$|The {{guidelines}} for the osteoporosis management were first drafted by a working group and then critically evaluated {{by the board of}} SIOMMMS. The most relevant points are: Definition: Osteoporosis is defined as a quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of bone tissue leading to increased risk of fracture. Postmenopausal and senile osteoporosis are defined as primitive. Diagnosis: The cornerstone for the diagnosis of osteoporosis is the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA (dual-energy X-ray absortiometry) at the femoral neck with T-score values - 2. 5 is usually not justified. Pharmacological intervention: The use of drugs registered for the treatment of osteoporosis are recommended when the benefits overcome the risk. This is the case only when the risk of fracture is rather high. FRAX™ is recognized as a useful tool for easily estimate the long-term fracture risk. SIOMMMS with these guidelines is committed to validate and further develop this diagnostic tool...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To assess if {{the bonding}} {{interlayer}} between the implant and bone in aseptic loosening of total hip replacement (THR) is qualitatively deteriorated by excessive accumulation of anti-adhesive glycoprotein, tenascin-C.  METHODS—Alkaline phosphatase-anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method {{was used for}} immunohistochemical staining of tenascin-C in interface tissue and control synovial tissue.  RESULTS—Tenascin-C {{was found to be}} a major component of the extracellular matrix at a hitherto unrecognised site, namely the synovial membrane-like interface tissue between implant and bone in aseptic loosening of THR. The overall tenascin-C staining (median score 4. 0) was greatly increased in aseptic loosening compared with synovial membrane (median score 2. 0; p< 0. 001) and fibrous capsule (median score 2. 0; p< 0. 001) from primary THR operations. Topological analysis disclosed that tenascin-C was also found at the critical implant-interface and interface-bone surfaces.  CONCLUSION—Local tenascin-C expression is increased {{as a result of a}} chronic foreign body type reaction associated with excessive cytokine production and tissue injury mediated by microtrauma and neutral endoproteinases.

This prospective study assesses whether reproduc-tive aging is accompanied by differential gene expression in luteinized GCs from in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients. Women with nonovarian infertility etiologies were categorized as younger (30, n 3) or older (40, n 3). During oocyte retrieval, mural GCs were isolated; messenger RNA (mRNA) was extracted and transcribed for complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray analysis. Differential gene expression was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis revealed 120 genes were differentially expressed. Three genes were upregulated and 117 were downre-gulated (including interleukin [IL]- 1 b, IL- 1 R 2, and IL- 6 R) in GCs of older versus younger patients. Our data provide evidence of downregulation in IL- 1 and IL- 6 gene families in luteinized GCs with advancing age. Given previously recognized roles for the IL gene family in folliculogenesis and ovulation, our findings may partly explain ovulatory and luteal dysfunctions associated with reproductive aging.

40|$|UVB {{exposure}} {{is well known}} to induce skin photodamage and photoaging that correlates with <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative <b>deterioration</b> of the dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) because of the upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Although inhibitory effects of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) on most MMPs have been reported, the protective role of TIMP- 1 against photodamage is poorly understood. To address this, TIMP- 1 function was augmented or abolished in a human skin xenograft photodamage model after the confirmation of significantly diminished TIMP- 1 expression both in photoaged and intrinsically aged skins. During a chronic UVB exposure regimen, pre-treatment with a lentiviral vector overexpressing TIMP- 1 or concomitant administration of an anti-TIMP- 1 -neutralizing antibody (NAB) led to photoprotection or more severe photodamage, respectively. Overexpression of TIMP- 1 resulted in significant inhibition of UVB-induced ECM degradation, as well as suppression of decreased skin elasticity and roughness, whereas the NAB-mediated inhibition of TIMP- 1 had opposite effects. Furthermore, UVB-induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor α, was inhibited by TIMP- 1 treatment of human keratinocytes. Taken together, these data {{shed light on the}} important role of TIMP- 1 in protection and recovery from cutaneous photodamage because of its suppression of ECM degradation and inflammation...|$|R
30|$|The {{intensive}} Scandinavian {{model of}} forest management, based on growing fully stocked even-aged stands with short rotation cycles (compared with natural stand dynamics; Fig. 1 b), {{has been successful}} in increasing timber volume and growth (which are continuously increasing). However, this management approach has caused profound ecological changes in forest ecosystem structure and functioning, the most significant ones being the suppression of natural disturbances (especially low and medium intensity fires), the decline and fragmentation of old forest with natural legacies, an increase in homogeneous young forest following clearcutting, and an decline in quantity and diversity of dead wood (Fig. 1; Kouki et al. 2001; Siitonen 2001; Kuuluvainen 2009). The overall result has been a decline in the diversity and ecological variability of forest habitats, and their associated species (Berg et al. 1994; Rassi et al. 2010; Nordén et al. 2013). For example in Finland 35 % of threatened forest species use old forest as their main habitat (Rassi et al. 2010), and 70 % of forest habitats was classified as threatened, often due to <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> such as reduced amounts of dead wood and simplified stand structure (Raunio et al. 2008).|$|E
40|$|Agriculture {{is highly}} {{affected}} by climate change. Climate change impacts may influence almost all fields of agricultural activities; production efficiency, quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of crop yields produced for alimentary purposes, and determine post-harvest manifestation of agricultural products inducing hazard {{in the field}} of food safety, transport, storage and distribution. Soil-climatic conditions, amount and distribution of precipitation, anomalies and extremities of temperature as well as various manifestation of air movement from stand still to storms are some of the main factors that may influence agriculture. Pollution has been considered solely as the presence of unfavourable alien matter in the environment, but in reality pollution is far more than that. Agri-environmental pollution is largely independent of mankind, since many pollution or degradation processes may begin with no direct relationship to human activities. Soil degradation, or irreversible damage to natural ecosystems by climatic factors (drought, flood, water logging, salinity) are the most frequent consequences. Biological pollution, like weed infestation, epidemics and gradations, pollen allergy, the poisonous effect of mycotoxins on farm animals and humans, new pests and diseases, the emission of greenhouse gases, and biological factors which cause quality deterioration represent an increasing pressure on agri-environment. This paper is intended to give an overview of some research activities and their results in relation with climatic aspects of agri-environmental pollution in Hungary...|$|E
40|$|The <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the {{groundwater}} resources {{is a complex}} phenomenon {{that depends on the}} natural (i. e. hydrogeological conditions) and/or human factors. The present research allowed us to emphasise the behaviour of the alluvial aquifer systems characterised by important lithological heterogeneities caused by the palaeogeographic evolution of the last millennia and the strong human activities. In particular, in order to define the conceptual local hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical model, we analysed stratigraphical, hydrogeological and geochemical data, relative to one ‘pilot’ unconfined alluvial aquifer system, located in the Ferrara plain. As a second step, we analysed the geochemical composition of {{the groundwater}} resources, integrated on the diffractometric analysis of the total dissolved solids contained in the collected water samples for distinguishing the principal hydrogeochemical and crystalline phases occurring in the water resources. The distinct geochemical facies and the abundance of each crystalline phase mainly depends on the a) lithological composition of the aquifer system and especially the ionic exchange processes occurring at the microscale between the solid matrix of the aquifer and the fluid; b) mixing phenomena between the water of different alimentation zones; c) occurrence of superficial polluting sources associated with human activities. In the final step, the integrated analysis of all data allowed to estimate the pollution risk of the aquifer system due to the intense human activities...|$|E
40|$|This PhD-research regards a hydrogeological study {{carried out}} on {{important}} aquifer systems located in the Versilia area, in which high water demand is present and consequently a detailed knowledge of the same systems is necessary to optimize the groundwater resources management. In this scenario a multidisciplinary approach, geological, hydrogeological and hydro-chemical-isotopic has allowed to achieve significant results as regards the fractured/karst aquifer systems in the "Fiume Versilia" catchment and the aquifer systems of the adjacent coastal plain. Fractured/karst aquifer of the mountain area. The two main aims of the research regarding these aquifers were: i) to describe and to model the water-rock interaction processes to define a geochemical conceptual model; ii) to individuate the feeding areas of the most important springs by means of the analyses of the main geological structures and hydrogeological/geochemical-isotopic considerations. The geochemical conceptual model allowed to draw the following considerations: - The air particulate matter collected reflects the outcropping lithologies {{in different parts of the}} study area, but there seems to be no obvious phenomena of interaction between the particles and rainwater, whose chemical composition derives mainly from sea spray; - Stable water isotopes confirm that groundwaters have a meteoric origin and that the wide range of values found depends essentially on the different average altitude of feeding zone; - Based on the major dissolved elements of the sampled springs, 3 main chemical facies were identified: Ca-HCO 3, Ca-SO 4 and Na-Cl. The first two highlight the interaction of water with limestone and carbonate-evaporite rocks, respectively, for a time sufficient to acquire these chemical compositions and to achieve saturation/supersaturation in calcite and dolomite. The Na-Cl groundwaters show a composition not very different from that of rainwater indicating a circulation in rocks containing minerals not very reactive and/or short interaction time with carbonate rocks. These two main types of water-rock interaction are confirmed by the isotopic ratio 13 C/ 12 C. In fact, for the first two types (Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-SO 4 water),  13 C values require a significant contribution of carbon derived from dissolution of calcite, while for Na-Cl water, 13 C/ 12 C values are consistent with the addition of biogenic CO 2 in rainwater; - As regards the reaction path modeling, the two theoretical trends, which describe the dissolution of a local average rock into a local average rainwater, can explain the chemical characteristics of most springs. Finally, with respect to trace metals the theoretical approaches do not show substantial changes from the initial concentrations in the aqueous solution, suggesting that there is a low input of these chemical components in the aqueous phase during the progressive dissolution of carbonate rock. In conclusion, comparing the geological and hydrogeological features with the results of the geochemical processing, it is reasonable to assume that: i) the Na-Cl springs are representative of the shallow circuits, with small feeding zones and very low residence times in the aquifer; ii) the Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-SO 4 springs are representative of relatively deep circuits developed in extensive aquifers with high permeability, like Marmi, dolomitic marbles and Grezzoni. The firsts type of springs were used to obtain the relationship between the 18 O/ 16 O ratio and the altitude of rainwater infiltration. In fact taking into account that they drain a small basin and considering the regulator effect of the aquifers, the isotopic compositions of these springs are very similar to the annual average isotopic values of the local meteoric waters. This relationship was than used to evaluate the average altitude of the feeding area of the second type of springs. Feeding areas were individuated through a multidisciplinary approach using geological, hydrogeological and geochemical-isotopic tools. In particular 17 hydrogeological sections were elaborated in order to define the geometry of the main hydrostructures and to individuate possible groundwater divides. Moreover, in the hydrogeological domain under examination were considered: the injection and recovering points of the tracer tests performed before this research; the zone included between the altitude + 50 m and – 50 m with respect to the average infiltration altitude evaluated by means of isotopic ratios; the possible groundwater divides individuated by means of hydrostructural considerations. All these elements, together with the indications obtained from geochemical processing on the types of rocks mainly involved in water-rock interaction, allowed us to delimit the hydrogeological basins probably drained by the most important springs under study. In addition for each hydrogeological system, a simplified water balance using meteorological data and the effective infiltration coefficients reported in the literature was performed, verifying that the delimited feeding areas are entirely consistent with the flow rate data of the springs. Aquifer system of the coastal plain As regards the coastal plain aquifer system, the main object of the study was to define a reliable conceptual model based on a multidisciplinary approach that highlight the main feeding components and the main processes occurring in the system, based on geological, hydrogeological, and geochemical considerations. A secondary purpose was the implementation of a hydrogeological numerical model and a preliminary calibration under steady-state condition. The first step was the realization of 9 hydrostratigraphic sections to delineate the geometry and thickness of the various hydrogeological complexes constituting the aquifer system. Once delineated the hydrostructural model, all stratigraphic information was re-processed with the “Groundwater Modeling Software” for 3 D reconstruction and calculation of the volume and grainsize for each horizon. The hydrostratigraphic elaboration highlights the multilayer type of the aquifer system due to the alternation of sandy and gravelly permeable layers with low and very-low permeability layers consisting of silty and clayey deposits. However the limited thickness and the lack of continuity of the impervious layers allows locally a direct connection between different permeable horizons giving to the system a monolayer character. As evidenced by both water level data and hydrogeochemical data processing, the hydraulic connection between the aquifer horizons is likely present throughout aquifer system, also probably due to the presence of many multiscreening wells. Taking into account the literature data and the results of pumping test performed during this study, the hydraulic conductivity of the permeable horizons is variable from 10 - 3 m/s to 10 - 4 m/s. Water level contours, elaborated both in wet and dry season, highlight that an important feeding component toward the coastal plain is the groundwater flow from the upper zone of the Versilia River fan. On the base of the piezometric surface morphology and the transmissivity value of 1, 4 E- 02 m 2 /sec, deriving from a pumping test performed on May 2010, the flow rate of this component was evaluated to be closed to 0, 38 m 3 /s and 0, 18 m 3 /s, for high level and low level conditions respectively. Analysing groundwater flow paths, minor inputs toward the coastal plain are individuated on the fans of the secondary rivers and where the limestone complexes of the mountain zone are directly in contact with the permeable horizons of the coastal plain aquifer system. Two principal piezometric minima, with hydraulic head below sea level, are located in the middle part of the plain and near the shoreline, respectively. The first one is caused by drinking water well pumping, whereas the second one is linkable to artificial drainage of the humid area located in the south-western part of the study zone. Geochemical data confirm that Ca-HCO 3 waters have meteoric origin and shallow circulation. It is likely that their chemical composition is the result of dissolution of calcite, in a limited or relatively limited time, due to the high kinetic of dissolution of this carbonate mineral. The recharge from the mountain provided by low salinity Ca-HCO 3 waters is particularly evident from the foothills to the central strip. Samples collected in the coastal strip have Ca-HCO 3 composition only at shallow depths (maximum 10 m). Among Ca-HCO 3 waters some samples have a high sulphate content due to partial interaction with carbonate-evaporite rocks and/or other reasons. The Na-Cl-HCO 3, mix-Cl-HCO 3, mix-HCO 3 and Na-HCO 3 water are located in the coastal strip and especially near of Forte dei Marmi. It should be emphasized that the presence of these waters must be understood as a positive signal, that is an improvement of water quality previously deteriorated by sea water intrusion. Finally, Na-Cl waters (usually found in relatively deep wells, > 30 m) are located near the coastline and are likely related to sea water intrusion. The wells that have these characteristics are generally 30 m deep or more. The 18 O/ 16 O isotopic ratio allowed to identify the different components involved in the aquifer system of the coastal plain. In particular: i) A component characterized by the low isotopic ratios is recognizable starting from the upper part of the Versilia River fan up to the middle strip of the coastal plain. The relatively large extension of territory in which this component found highlights the importance of this input, in agreement with the indication deriving from piezometric surfaces. The low isotopic ratio is not compatible with a local origin of water but requires an input from the mountain area. Considering the hydrostructural features, a groundwater flow from rock reliefs to the porous aquifer of the plain is unlikely in this zone; consequently the input of water from the mountains is through the Versilia River, as confirmed by water levels; ii) a further component, even if less important than the last one, is represented by contributions from permeable carbonate rocks, where these are close to the coastal plane, and from other minor alluvial fans, as T. Baccatoio in the southern part and T. Montignoso in the northern part; iii) a further and significant component is the local rainwater characterized by a specific isotopic ratio. This input is well recognizable in the part of the plain close to the coastline, although its influence on the other input is evident also in the inner part. Finally, the study of isotopes has contributed to investigate in more detail the sea water intrusion phenomenon occurring both directly and through inflow along stream courses, as well as the relationship between groundwaters and main rivers. Direct marine ingression is evident in wells with depths higher than 25 - 30 m and located in a strip of about 1 km from the coastal line. The ingression inside the water courses, instead, is particularly evident in the Versilia river where the sea water reaches the intermediate strip (travelling for more than 2 km along the course of the river, with about 15 % of mixing). The ingression inside the water course occurs also in the T. Baccatoio/F. Motrone with a maximum distance of about 1 km from the coastline. Finally, for the Fiumetto ditch the ingression is stopped by the Vinciane Port at 500 m from the coastline. In agreement with stream water level/groundwater head level relationship, geochemical and isotopic features of water show that rivers/streams/ditches are in hydraulic connection with the aquifer almost throughout the coastal plain. Since the Versilia River has an important role in aquifer feeding, a detailed geochemical survey was carried out to better investigate the stream water-groundwater relationship. Obtained results indicate that the river feeds the aquifer from the upper part of the plain up to the middle one (ex-Lago di Porta zone) and in the final stretch of the river course. In the ex-Lago di Porta zone the river is likely not connected with the aquifer. In conclusion, based on hydrostructural, hydrogeological, and geochemical-isotopic considerations the main input to the aquifer system are: - an important component from the Versilia River alluvial fan, which is essentially recharged by the river itself; - a component, less important than the previous one, developed in minor alluvial fans and some carbonate rocks in the foothill strip; - an important local rainwater infiltration; - stream water infiltration; - a sea water component, even if of minor importance, developed both directly from the shoreline to the aquifer and indirectly through of the stream courses. Based on the above described hydrogeological conceptual model, a numerical flow model was implemented and calibrated under steady state condition. The results of the calibration generally confirm the conceptual model, although in some zones differences between observed and model values are significant and suggest that model refinement is necessary. This is essentially due to the insufficient and not homogeneous distribution of some type of data, as hydraulic parameters and stratigraphic information. Following these possible improvements, a transient flow model and transport model could be implemented also thanks to the amount and quality of data produced during this research. Lastly, the results of this PhD-research not only are scientifically interesting but can also have practical implications for the protection and the correct management of the groundwater resource. For example, the multidisciplinary approach used for delimiting the hydrogeological basin of some important springs in the mountain area responds to the need to define the protection zones of water resources, as recommended by the European Community normative and the national normative. On the other hand, the conceptual/numerical model obtained for the coastal plain aquifer system represents an important tool for a correct planning and regulation of groundwater exploitation, to preclude a <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative <b>deterioration</b> of this indispensable resource...|$|R

Advantages of this technique are, to our point of view, a higher resistance to cranial hooks dislodgment, when compared with screw fixation instrumentation, especially in pathological conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis that leads to a <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the bone stock and to the reduction of the occipital wall thickness.

Moreover, patient stabilized with an occipitoaxial angle included in the physiological range showed better results either for the survival of the instrumentation or the onset of junctional pathology. Patients have been followed up afterwards and evaluated by the visual analogue scale for the assessment of pain and by the Nurick scale for the cases associated with myelopathy. We believe that cranial anchorage with a hook claw allows for an instrumentation provided with high stability, particularly useful in revision surgery and major instabilities.

This phenomenon is favoured by the same nutritional characteristics that make buffalo meat more suitable for some categories of consumers. The higher concentrations of Fe and unsaturated fatty acids in buffalo meat compared to bovine, are the main causes of the earlier <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration,</b> due to the oxidation following air exposition.

40|$|Purpose: We {{analyzed}} {{the best performance}} times of master cycling athletes in the 200 – 3000 m track competitions to estimate the decay of maximal aerobic power (MAP) and anaerobic capacity (AnS) with aging. Methods: In various decades of age (30 – 80 years), MAP and AnS were estimated using an iterative procedure as the values that minimize the difference between: (1) the metabolic power (E ˙ (t) E˙(t)) necessary to cover a given distance (d) in the time t and; (2) the maximal metabolic power (E ˙ max (t) E˙max(t)) maintained at a constant level throughout the competition. Results: MAP started decreasing at 45 years of age. Thereafter, it showed an average percent rate of decrease of about 16 % for decade, as previously shown in other classes of master athletes. In addition, AnS seemed to decay by about 11 % every 10 years from {{the second part of}} the fifth decade. Conclusions: The decay of MAP occurred in spite of the active lifestyle of the subjects and it may be attributed to the progressive impairment of maximal O 2 delivery and/or of peripheral O 2 utilization. The loss of AnS might derive from the progressive loss of muscle mass occurring after the fifth decade of life, to the progressive <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the anaerobic energy yielding pathways or to the lower capacity of MN recruitment during maximal efforts.

Particularly, reasons of fish farming commodity production decreasing were such as: business environment changes; inadequate privatization; deterioration of fish farming technology; deterioration of Ukrainian market situation for national fish producer. In addition, fishery resources depletion reaching critical point also affected negatively the fish catching volume from inland water bodies. Reasons of catastrophic situation in national oceanic fishing are following: modifications of juridical and international legal terms in fishery; fishery monitoring by international fishery regional agencies; steady growth of world oil and oil products prices; quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of ocean fleet bases. It is stated that resolution of the problems related to both the stagnation of national fishery and putting industrial enterprises out of crisis is basically outside the specific business entity competence and requires an immediate governmental interference. The set of measures of governmental support for revival and development of Ukrainian fisheries as a strategically important branch of national economy which was worked out with regard to identified factors of Ukrainian fisheries deterioration is to become one of key elements of fish industry enterprises mechanism of managemen...|$|E
40|$|A multidimensional {{laboratory}} {{trial was}} carried out to identify how key overall quality traits of different common wheat varieties change during storage, to understand their interactions {{in the process of}} deterioration, and finally to reveal underlying trends of critical storage conditions that may endanger grain quality. A large set of qualitative criteria were followed on grain batches of three wheat varieties with various qualities for food processing, which were stored for 160 d at 22 - 23 °C, under two different relative humidities (r. h.), and with or without infestation by the rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae. All variables involved in quality components assessment were recorded at 42 -d periods. From the Pearson’s product moment correlation matrix, it was observed that the quality traits that correlated significantly to biotic variables (insect and fungal species dynamics) were: moisture content, hL mass, seed viability, and fat acidity of extracted flour. The interactions between biotic deteriorative factors and qualitative trait changes revealed through principal component analysis (PCA) were significant between four factors explaining the major part of qualitative criteria variance: storage duration; moisture content; hidden infestation density; fungal contamination level. The rate of increase of insect population was significantly different among varieties. PCA revealed that the significant difference in <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> pattern among the three varieties was not related to their hardness, but to a different r. h. affinity. The germination rate was the qualitative criteria the more early declining during storage. The technological properties of extracted flour from each variety were significantly affected only when insect density exceeded 1000 insects per kg, a situation only observed in hot-spots. This work highlighted the trends of variation in quality traits of wheat varieties when stored under critical conditions. It can be used in IPM approaches to predict the susceptibility of a wheat variety to insect and fungi damage during storage...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} shell {{characteristics and}} differential dissolution susceptibility of planktic foraminiferal species derived from upper Paleocene and lower Eocene deep-sea sequences, Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 865 (Allison Guyot) and Sites 1209 B, 1210 B and 1212 A (Shatsky Rise) in the North Pacific Ocean. The {{purposes of this}} study are: 1) assessing the effects of differential dissolution on upper Paleocene–lower Eocene planktic foraminiferal assemblages, at species level and within different biozones, to quantify dissolution susceptibility of genera and species; 2) investigating the differences in shell characteristics; 3) revealing the relationship between shell parameters and dissolution robustness of taxa, and 4) identifying the key shell parameter(s) influencing the dissolution susceptibility of foraminiferal taxa. Two independent experiments were carried out, one focusing on gradual <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of taxa by dissolution and the other documenting the weight loss of taxa. Shell parameters such as wall thickness, porosity and pore size were determined through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and image analysis (JMicroVision). We found that the large muricate Acarinina and Morozovella are most resistant, followed by the cancellate Subbotina and the small muricate Igorina, confirming results of previous work. At species level, the thick-walled Acarinina soldadoensis, Acarinina subsphaerica and the large Morozovella subbotinae are the most resistant species. Most of the large Morozovella species such as Morozovella aequa, Morozovella formosa-gracilis, Morozovella velascoensis and Morozovella pasionensis, together with Acarinina nitida show intermediate dissolution resistance, whereas the small muricate Igorina species, the cancellate Subbotina velascoensis and the thin-walled Morozovella acuta and Morozovella occlusa are the most vulnerable species. We propose a formula for calculating the dissolution resistance of taxa based on their wall thickness and size — two key parameters in dissolution resistance of a species. Application of this formula reveals good agreement between the calculated and measured dissolution resistance, indicating its robustness. Furthermore, the agreement between our experimental results, in-situ experimental results on live foraminifera and natural quantitative/qualitative records suggests that our experiments accurately mimic natural dissolution processes. Consequently, these experimental results strongly bear on interpretations of foraminiferal dissolution in natural environments, especially in studies on early Paleogene climatic events that are often associated with dissolution phenomena. More generally, a proper assessment of taphonomic alteration by dissolution should be part of every paleoenvironmental reconstruction based on quantitative foraminiferal records. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Some {{experimental}} studies on skin homograft were performed between A and C 57 BL or Db strain of mice, {{to investigate the}} influence of qualitative and quantitative difference of graft antigen upon homograft rejection reaction. In this study, difference in amount of graft antigen in homograft rejection was tested in the experiment with two kinds of different size of normal skin (1. 0 cm. × 2. 0 cm. and 2. 0 cm× 4. 5 cm.). The normal skin was kept frozen either simply or in 15 % glycerin in saline for 3 to 24 hours to have physical denaturation of the graft, {{and to have a}} biologically deteriorated graft, atrophied skin was harvested from mice, which were administered with 1 mg. of prednisolone intraperitoneally daily for 3 to 9 weeks. The results obtained were as follows, 1) The larger piece of skin survived longer than the smaller piece, although no significant difference in time before onset of rejection was observed. The rejection of the second set graft was accerelated, regardlessly {{of the size of the}} first graft. This suggested that the longer survival of the larger graft was due merely to requirement of excess time to complete the rejection process after its onset. 2) There was no significant difference in the survival time of the first graft between the frozen and normal skin, and the same was also observed between the grafts which were simply frozen and were frozen in 15 % glycerine in saline. No second set phenomenon was observed when the skin simply frozen for 3 to 24 hours was used as the first graft. However, the accerelation rejection of the second set graft was clearly observed in mice who received the first graft which was kept frozen in 15 % glycerine saline for 3 to 6 hours. This indicated that freezing storage of skin in 15 % glycerine saline for up to 6 hours could saved enough antigen of the skin to sensitize the mice for the second set phenomenon with its first graft. 3) The atrophied skin obtained from prednisolone-treated mice survived longer than the healthy skin from untreated mice in its first graft. When the second set graft was made on mice who received and rejected the skin from prednisolone-treated mice, the rejection was accerelated as equally as in mice who received and rejected the normal skin as first graft, indicating that in skin showing simple atrophy, though it was macroscopically and histologically demonstrable, no <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of transplantation antigen might occur, in contrast to the occurrence of quantitative reduction of the antigen according to the grade of atrophy. 4) The results were also obtained from the study in the analysis of the serum γ-globulin and tissue amino acid in the skin, to support the above statements...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (l. 64 - 68). Lebanon is {{a country}} on the Mediterranean Sea with a mild Mediterranean climate, and abundance of fresh water falling on its mountains. Several problems face the water sector in Lebanon, with natural and human causes leading to the quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>deterioration</b> of the water reserves. The lack of sewage systems {{and the lack of}} control on water quality has led to more and more people to use bottled waters as a source for drinking water. Bottled water companies in Lebanon use mainly springs located in the highest mountains of Lebanon. In this study the hygienic quality of bottled water was studied over a period of one year using tests for indicators of contamination such as coliforms, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterococcus spp. and total hetrotrophic bacterial counts. This study was carried out on the major brand names of Lebanese bottled water which are widely consumed in the market. These brands are Brand a, Brand F, Brand D, Brand C, Brand B and Brand E. In this study 30. 7 % of recovered pseudomanads from tested samples where confirmed as P. aeruginosa, of the 15 isolated colonies on the Aeromonas medium only 4 were confirmed to be Aeromonas sp. (26. 7 %), faecal coliforms were not detected in any of the tested bottled drinking water samples and no enterococci were isolated fi-om any brand. Brand A, Brand B and Brand F all had a mean HPC (in all four batches) less than 500 cfu/ml, while the number was 677 cfulml in Brand E bottled water. However, Brand C and Brand D had mean HPC counts of 4022 cfu/ml and 4923 cfulml. The identification of organisms using the Biolog and API systems in this study revealed that with 46 % of the samples different results were obtained, while 44 % were not identified using the Biolog system and only 10 % gave a matching ID when compared to the ID obtained by using 16 S rDNA sequencing. The 16 S rDNA identification resolved the ambiguity observed with the Biolog identification system. The overall microbial quality of Brand A and Brand F were the most acceptable and within all standards. The microbial quality of Brand B and Brand E were also acceptable although Pseudomonas aeruginosa was detected in both brands, while Aeromonas sp. CDC 715 - 84 was isolated from 75 % of the tested Brand C bottles. The HPC count was very high and did not adhere to international or Lebanese standards in 50 % of the tested batches of Brand C and in 100 % of tested batches in Brand D. The identified microorganisms gave a fingerprint that showed that all tested brands had a fixed source throughout this study except Brand B which had a constantly changing source. Seasonal variation did not have any significant effect on water quality. Moreover, this study showed that results obtained using the Biolog system for the identification of environmental samples should be carefully interpreted. The quality of bottled drinking water in Lebanon should be properly monitored. 1 bound copy: 69 leaves; ill. (some col.); 31 cm. Available at RNL...|$|E
