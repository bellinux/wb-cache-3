40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the implementation of}} a pan-European network to support co-operative research amongst European researchers: TEN- 155. Predecessors to TEN- 155 were TEN- 34 and EuropaNet. TEN- 155 supersedes these two networks {{not only in terms of}} capacity offered but also in terms of the Managed Bandwidth Service (MBS) offered. Besides providing a high speed IP service, the purpose of TEN- 155 is also to support research in networking by providing an international test bed for advanced networking technologies (the <b>Quantum</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Programme)</b> and by providing VPNs, with dedicated and guaranteed bandwidth, for specific research projects in countries connected to TEN- 155. This paper will illustrate the use of ATM technology to support the MBS and the <b>Quantum</b> <b>Test</b> <b>Programme</b> in co-existence with the standard best efforts IP service and experiences gained from offering a pan-European Managed Bandwidth Service KEYWORDS: TEN- 155, ATM, Managed Bandwidth, VPN 1.

40|$|Considerable {{effort is}} put into the safety risk {{assessment}} of any flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> - and rightly so, since failures to apply best practice in this area may cause significant expense, and in extremis loss of life. However, {{it must also be}} remembered that the flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> itself is an essential component {{in the development of the}} aircraft or system, and that even if safety is never compromised, the failure of a <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> to deliver the required results on time and budget can cause failure of the entire aircraft programme. This paper considers the areas in which planning and conduct of a flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> should be protected. In particular it considers the conduct of flight test personnel in ways which go beyond only safety training, the important of documenting all flight test planning and conduct and the continuous justification of flight test conclusions, planning project manning to ensure that the loss (for whatever reason) of key personnel or equipment does not cause complete failure of the flight <b>test</b> <b>programme,</b> how to recover from significant programme disruptions, and most importantly whilst protecting or recovering the flight <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> – how to ensure that safety is not compromised in the process...|$|R

40|$|TNO, in {{co-operation}} with Micromega-Dynamics, SRON, Dutch Space and CSL, {{has designed}} a compact breadboard cryogenic delay line (figure 1) {{for use in}} future space interferometry missions. The breadboard (BB) delay line is representative of a flight mechanism. The delay line has a single stage voice coil actuator for Optical Path Difference (OPD) control, driving a two-mirror cat's eye. Magnetic bearings provide frictionless and wear free operation with zerohysteresis. The development <b>test</b> <b>programme,</b> including operation at 100 K has been completed. The verification <b>test</b> <b>programme</b> is currently being carried out by Alcatel Alenia Space (in co-operation with Sageis-CSO) and will include functional testing at 40 K.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two experimental <b>test</b> <b>programmes,</b> {{conducted in}} a water flow channel and a tow tank respectively, and devised to investigate the wake behind a simulated horizontal axis tidal current turbine, Both sets of experimental results have identified the wake as having a Gaussian-like shape and the wake deficit recovering gradually with distance downstream. Also, {{although it is not}} directly representative of real operating conditions, the appropriateness of a towing lank for the model tidal current turbine testing has been supported, by having obtained compatible force and wake profiles in the two <b>test</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R
50|$|The US National Institute on Aging {{currently}} funds {{an intervention}} <b>testing</b> <b>programme,</b> whereby investigators nominate compounds (based on specific molecular ageing theories) to have evaluated {{with respect to}} their effects on lifespan and age-related biomarkers in outbred mice. Previous age-related testing in mammals has proved largely irreproducible, because of small numbers of animals and lax mouse husbandry conditions. The intervention <b>testing</b> <b>programme</b> aims to address this by conducting parallel experiments at three internationally recognised mouse ageing-centres, the Barshop Institute at UTHSCSA, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the Jackson Laboratory.|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) Directive 97 / 12 /EC {{allows the}} trade of cattle within the EU of animals {{originating}} from an 'officially brucellosis-free herd'. To qualify for this status, {{a number of different}} programmes must be implemented. Each EU Member Country is free to decide which procedure to use to qualify herds. The authors conducted a study to compare the merits and costs of <b>testing</b> <b>programmes</b> given in the Directive and of some alternative testing strategies. The effectiveness of <b>testing</b> <b>programmes</b> was evaluated by a Monte Carlo simulation model. Programmes listed in the Directive do not appear to have identical sensitivity and specificity. Simulations of the programmes showed that milk testing may be more effective and efficient than blood testing to identify infected herds. Results indicated that it could be advisable that legislation, rather than defining very detailed procedures both for laboratory <b>tests</b> and <b>testing</b> <b>programmes,</b> should establish minimal requirements in terms of efficacy of testing procedures (i. e. the probability of detecting an infected herd) ...|$|R
