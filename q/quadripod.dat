50|$|Also {{near to the}} lake, in 1873 a Roman tripod (later restored, {{upon which}} it was {{discovered}} that it is a <b>quadripod)</b> was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Sevso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands as the treasure. It is housed in the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.|$|E
30|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, this is the first report {{evaluating}} the short- and long-term effects of an FES device on the quadriceps, compared to GRAFO, aimed to decrease the severity of crouch gait in a CP subject and assist in achieving lower limb extension. It is the first step to use rapidly developing technology to improve gait and functional ability in CP children by FES. Our patient’s gait was a typical crouch gait with excessive hip and knee flexion and dorsiflexion throughout the stance phase. He has been wearing GRAFOs for 9  years (for most of the day), together with two <b>quadripods.</b> However, with GRAFOs, he still complained of muscle fatigue when standing for prolonged periods of time and walking.|$|R
30|$|We {{present an}} 18 -year-old boy {{diagnosed}} with CP diplegia (Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level II] [20], without cognitive impairment. He was considered independent {{according to the}} activities of daily living. When walking outdoors, he wore GRAFOs bilaterally for 9  years with two <b>quadripods.</b> Indoors, {{he was able to}} ambulate without any orthotics. For long distances, he used a wheelchair or electric scooter. His main complaints were weakness, difficulty in prolonged walking and standing, ascending and descending stairs, and dependency on the orthotics. Clinical examination exhibited bilateral hip flexion contracture (Thomas test 25 °), bilateral limited knee extension of 5 °, bilateral extension lag of 30 °, and severe hyperpronated midfoot break, leading to excessive external foot progression. Manual muscle testing revealed severe weakness: bilateral weak hip extensors (2 / 5), knee extensors (4 / 5), gastrocsoleus (2 / 5). No evidence of patella alta was found.|$|R
40|$|For {{thousands}} of years breakwaters have been built {{at or near the}} coast to protect harbors or coastlines from wave attack. One of the earliest known harbor protection schemes was devised in about 2000 B. C. for the Port of Pharos on the open coast of Egypt; it had a rubble-mound breakwater approximately 8500 ft long composed of large blocks of stone with smaller stone filling the spaces between blocks (Savile 1940). Until the development of experimental laboratory techniques to investigate the effect of waves on breakwaters, these structures were designed primarily from experience gained from other similar structures. It is the purpose of this review to discuss various aspects of the hydrodynamics of wave attack on such structures and the relation of certain analytic considerations and experimental results to the design of a rubble-mound. A breakwater built as a rubble-mound is constructed by placing material of various sizes layer by layer (or unit by unit) until the desired cross-section shape is achieved. Generally, the units are not structurally connected, so that the integrity of the rubble-mound depends on features such as the weight of the material, the interlocking nature of the material, and the cross section of the structure. Usually the structure is built with material graded from smaller sizes in the core to larger material armoring the face against wave attack. The armor layer may be composed of quarry-stone, if it is available in the required sizes and is economically feasible to use. When these conditions are not met, specially designed concrete units for armoring the face of the rubble-mound have been developed that tend to interlock better than rock when properly placed; hence, {{it may be possible to}} use armor units lighter than the required quarry-stone. Over the years numerous geometric shapes have been developed for such armor units, with each shape generally introduced in an attempt to improve on the interlocking characteristics of its predecessors. To mention only a few, various names used for different units are: tribars, tetrapods, <b>quadripods,</b> and dolosse. A brief description of two of these is presented; for a more detailed discussion of shape along with drawings of the units the interested reader is directed to CERC (1966) and Hudson(1974). Tribars, which consist basically of three circular cylinders connected by a yoke of three cylinders, are usually placed in a uniform geometric pattern on the face of the rubble-mound. Dolosse are shaped like the letter "H" with the vertical legs rotated 90 ° to each other, and are generally placed randomly on a rubble-mound face. It is the effective interlocking of dolosse that leads to the use of random placement techniques. Obviously an important aspect in the design of a rubble-mound is its stability under wave attack. This subject is discussed in detail, along with descriptions of the basis for certain design approaches currently used. The support of these design criteria as well as their limitations are discussed with reference to available experimental data. Three other aspects of the effect of waves on rubble-mounds are treated in this review: wave run-up, transmission, and overtopping. Run-up is defined as the vertical height above still water level to which waves incident upon a structure can be expected to travel up the face of the structure. Wave run-up is important in defining both the amount of wave energy transmitted over and through permeable rubble-mounds and also the quantity of water that may be expected to overtop the structure. In each of the following sections the discussion is directed toward understanding the fluid-mechanic aspects of the various problems and the features and the shortcomings of analytical and experimental models used in connection with the design of breakwaters constructed as rubble-mounds...|$|R

She undertook some modification in from May 1964 until February 1966, with the bridge being doubled, a 50 meters high <b>quadripod</b> mast mounted on the aft roof and half the armament removed. The ship was also made gas-tight and fitted with washdown facilities. The equipment was modernised and the crew was downsized to 560 men, to make accommodation available for 160 engineers and technicians.|$|E

The new <b>quadripod</b> design, which particularly emphasizes reduced radio frequency blockage, is achieved by means of a narrow cross sectional profile of the legs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of a stick and a <b>quadripod</b> on force distribution, temporal asymmetry and gait speed in sub-acute stroke patients. Thirty subjects (mean age is 64 ± 13 yr.) with first stroke who were able to walk unaided under supervision took part in this study. They walked randomly for at least fourteen meters for three walking conditions (walked unaided, with stick and with <b>quadripod).</b> The gait parameters, ground reaction force (GRF), temporal symmetry values and gait speed for each walking condition were measured with the Infotronic Ultraflex Gait Analysis System. The Mann-Whitney Tests, repeated measures ANOVA, Friedman test, and post-hoc test, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test were adopted. The results showed 74 % of the subjects walked with asymmetry gait pattern which presented with prolonged swing phase and shorted stance phase in the paretic limb. Then there was no significant difference in the mean GRF in mid-stance phase between the paretic and non-paretic limbs in walking unaided (p= 0. 79) and walking with stick (p= 0. 15). However, use of <b>quadripod</b> significantly decreased the weight bearing on the paretic limb (670. 17 ± 156. 80 vs 688. 80 ± 186. 63 Newton, p= 0. 004) compared with unaided walking. Furthermore, walking speed was significant slower if stick (0. 40 ± 0. 16 m/s) or <b>quadripod</b> (0. 39 ± 0. 14 m/s) were used when compared with unaided walking (0. 43 ± 0. 18 m/s, p= 0. 019). Finally, walking aids was found to have no effect on all temporal symmetry values when compared with no aid (p> 0. 05). In conclusion, to achieve a symmetrical gait pattern in mild to moderate severe sub-acute stroke survivors under rehabilitation, walking aids, especially <b>quadripod,</b> was not encouraged...|$|E

The subreflector can be translated in the three orthogonal axes by jackscrews at the ends of each rod. The arrangement of the six rods is described and analysis of the position errors introduced by coupled translation is presented. The results indicate that negligible RF gain losses caused by axis-coupled translations (less than 0. 05 dB) are possible at X-band (8. 45 GHz) operation...|$|E
40|$|A walking {{distance}} estimation algorithm for cane users is proposed using an inertial sensor unit attached to various {{positions on the}} cane. A standard inertial navigation algorithm using an indirect Kalman filter was applied to update the velocity and position of the cane during movement. For <b>quadripod</b> canes, a standard zero-velocity measurement-updating method is proposed. For standard canes, a velocity-updating method based on an inverted pendulum model is proposed. The proposed algorithms were verified by three walking experiments with {{two different types of}} canes and different positions of the sensor module...|$|E
40|$|When {{spacecraft}} are tracked {{near the}} line-of-sight of the sun, the ground antenna sidelobes see the solar noise. The solar noise increases the ground system operating noise temperature and degrades the downlink RF reception performance. At specific antenna azimuthal angles {{relative to the}} sun, noise peaks and nulls occur periodically throughout a day's tracking pass due to the <b>quadripod</b> support leg-generated sidelobes. This article documents this effect while tracking Helios 1, illustrates {{the time of the}} peaks, and compares the predicted time of the noise temperature peaks with the measured data...|$|E

The frequency stability effects of stepwise lateral and axial subreflector motions are also described. Comparisons with recently measured antenna efficiency and subreflector motion tests are presented. A modification to the existing 70 m antenna pointing squint correction constant is proposed...|$|E

Aperture efficiency and surface efficiency are calculated as the components determining the gain of the antenna. Noise temperature contributions arise from the ground, atmosphere, and <b>quadripod</b> scattering. These components are calculated {{as a function of}} frequency elevation angle to determine a G/T (gain/system noise temperature) figure-of-merit for a nominal 34 -meter antenna configuration.

40|$|A {{malfunction}} of the Deep Space Network (DSN) 64 -meter antenna in Australia {{forced the}} antenna {{to operate with}} a mispositioned subreflector during the Voyager Uranus encounter period (January 24, 1986). Because of changing main reflector shape and <b>quadripod</b> position {{as a function of}} elevation angle, the antenna gain and pointing were not as expected, and the 8. 45 GHz received signal level changed during the pass. The study described here used the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) analysis to determine actual antenna gain and pointing during that period in an attempt to reconstruct the radio science data. It is found that the 1. 4 dB of signal variation can be accounted for by antenna geometry changes and pointing error. Suggested modifications to the values measured during the pass are presented. Additionally, an extremely useful tool for the analysis of gravity deformed reflectors was developed for use in future antenna design and analysis projects...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the past}} several years, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory has {{designed}} and built major ground antenna structures in Spain, Australia, and California. One of the antennas at each location is a 70 meter-diameter structure that is a retrofit of the existing 64 meter antenna. The 64 meter existing antennas were first stripped back to a 34 meter interior and then completely new construction with deeper trusses was added to extend the interior to 70 meters. The 70 meter project included the rare opportunity to collect field data to compare with predictions of the finite-element analytical models. The new <b>quadripod</b> design was tested for its lower mode natural frequencies and the main reflector was measured by theodolite to determine deflections of subsets of the backup-structure deformations under load.

40|$|Abstract—A new {{low profile}} ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna for {{wearable}} applications is presented. Its structure {{is derived from}} the <b>quadripod</b> kettle antenna (QKA) [1], and is called tripod kettle antenna (TKA). The proposed antenna is very well suited for wearable applications due to its miniature size and low profile. Moreover, the antenna is completely encapsulated in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate enabling a certain level of flexibility and a good robustness against different external influences (e. g. different weather conditions). The TKA is a broadband antenna with 70 % coverage of the fractional UWB bandwidth (Federal Communications Commission, FCC). The antenna has a polarization perpendicular to the body surface with a quasi-omnidirectional radiation pattern in the plane orthogonal to the polarization. An antenna prototype has been built and characterized, and measured results are in a good compliance with the simulations. Index Terms—Low profile and ultra-wideband, tripodquadripod kettle antenna, PDMS, wearable antenna, polarization perpendicular to the body surface I...|$|E
40|$|The {{eventual}} {{outcome of}} a stroke patient's rehabilitation may depend as much upon his experiences following the stroke as upon the actual brain damage. Positive factors influencing rehabilitation include the early stimulation of the body orienting mechanism in upright positions; the prevention {{of the development of}} spasticity; the therapist's understanding of the factors involved in learning a motor skill; the ability to analyse an everyday activity and find its missing or abnormal components an understanding of the current hypotheses about the effect of stimution upon the recovering brain. Negative factors include a tendency to be obsessed with techniques of treatment rather than with a detailed analysis of the patient's problems; the perpetuation of certain ‘myths’ such as proximal to distal recovery of function, and practising movement in a neuro-developmental sequence despite the maturity of the adult patient's brain; a failure to understand the different physiological and behavioural mechanisms underlying apparently similar problems which leads to lack of cortical drive being confused with muscle weakness; the expectations of the therapist who expects a stroke patient will become spastic, will not recover functional use of his upper limb, and will need a <b>quadripod</b> stick in order not to fall over...|$|E
