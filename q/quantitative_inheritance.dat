All but six markers showed no significant (P < 0. 05) segregation distortion. At a minimum LOD score of 6. 0 and a maximum recombination frequency of 0. 30, 20 linkage groups were resolved, resulting in a map length of approximately 1500 cM.

Second, meiotic configurations in polyploids undergo a complex biological process including either bivalent or multivalent formation, or both. For bivalent polyploids, different degrees of preferential chromosome pairings may occur during meiosis. In this article, we develop a maximum-likelihood-based model for mapping QTL in tetraploids by considering the <b>quantitative</b> <b>inheritance</b> and meiotic mechanism of bivalent polyploids. This bivalent polyploid model is implemented with the EM algorithm to simultaneously estimate QTL position, QTL effects, and QTL-marker linkage phases by incorporating {{the impact of a}} cytological parameter determining bivalent chromosome pairings (the preferential pairing factor). Simulation studies are performed to investigate the performance and robustness of our statistical method for parameter estimation. The implication and extension of the bivalent polyploid model are discussed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe complex {{genetics}} of osteoarthritis (OA) {{are still}} poorly defined. To circumvent {{the problems of}} genetic and environmental diversity hampering the analysis in humans, we investigated quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with murine OA in the STR/ort strain which spontaneously develops osteoarthritic changes of the knee joints, overweight and elevated serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) levels. MethodsTwo hundred and seventy six male F 2 intercross (STR/ort×C 57 BL/ 6) animals were genotyped using 96 microsatellite markers and phenotyped by analyzing weight, serum COMP levels and osteoarthritic changes of the knee joints. Quantitative trait analyses were performed using the R/qtl software. ResultsElevated weight, serum COMP levels and osteoarthritic changes of the knee joints in the F 2 generation compared to C 57 BL/ 6 parental animals confirm Mendelian <b>inheritance.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> trait analyses revealed three weight-, one serum COMP- and one OA-locus. ConclusionsThe weight-QTL coincide with previously described genes and QTL involved in fatty acid metabolism and offer a plausible explanation for the observed phenotype in STR/ort mice. The exact match of the COMP-QTL and the COMP gene itself suggests a regulatory polymorphism to account for elevated serum levels in STR/ort mice and questions the robustness of serum COMP as a prognostic marker in human knee OA. The newly identified QTL associated with degenerative changes of the knee joints support the concept of OA resulting from a defective chondrocyte metabolism and/or altered apoptosis rate. However, we also discuss the unlikelihood of one QTL being responsible for OA in STR/ort mice and the inherent limitations of microsatellite analyses for complex genetic diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{common bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the world's most {{important}} legume for human consumption. Anthracnose (ANT; Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) and angular leaf spot (ALS; Pseudocercospora griseola) are complex diseases that cause major yield losses in common bean. Depending on the cultivar and environmental conditions, anthracnose and angular leaf spot infections can reduce crop yield drastically. This study aimed to estimate linkage disequilibrium levels and identify quantitative resistance loci (QRL) controlling resistance to both ANT and ALS diseases of 180 accessions of common bean using genome-wide association analysis. A randomized complete block design with four replicates was performed for the ANT and ALS experiments, with four plants per genotype in each replicate. Association mapping {{analyses were performed}} for ANT and ALS using a mixed linear model approach implemented in TASSEL. A total of 17 and 11 significant statistically associations involving SSRs were detected for ANT and ALS resistance loci, respectively. Using SNPs, 21 and 17 significant statistically associations were obtained for ANT and angular ALS, respectively, providing more associations with this marker. The SSR-IAC 167 and PvM 95 markers, both located on chromosome Pv 03, and the SNP scaffold 00021 _ 89379, were associated with both diseases. The other markers were distributed across the entire common bean genome, with chromosomes Pv 03 and Pv 08 showing {{the greatest number of}} loci associated with ANT resistance. The chromosome Pv 04 was the most saturated one, with six markers associated with ALS resistance. The telomeric region of this chromosome showed four markers located between approximately 2. 5 Mb and 4. 4 Mb. Our results demonstrate the great potential of genome-wide association studies to identify QRLs related to ANT and ALS in common bean. The results indicate a <b>quantitative</b> and complex <b>inheritance</b> pattern for both diseases in common bean. Our findings will contribute to more effective screening of elite germplasm to find resistance alleles for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at: [URL] 37 Pag., 6 Tabl., 3 Fig. Chilling injury (CI) is the collective term for various disorders that occur during prolonged cold storage and/or after subsequent ripening of stone fruit. Major symptoms of CI include mealiness, graininess, flesh browning, loss of flavor (off flavor), and red pigmentation (bleeding). These symptoms were evaluated over 2 years in an intra-specific progeny population {{derived from the}} cross of cultivars ‘Venus’ (freestone, melting and yellow-flesh nectarine) and ‘BigTop’ (clingstone, melting and yellow-flesh nectarine) after storage of fruit at 5 °C (CI inducing conditions) for 2 and 4 weeks. All the evaluated traits in the progeny showed continuous variation which is typical of <b>quantitative</b> or polygenic <b>inheritance.</b> Longer cold storage periods increased the incidence and severity of CI symptoms, except for bleeding and leatheriness, which were not affected by time of storage. CI symptoms showed high and significant heritability or genotype effect in the studied population, with no significant effect of harvesting year. Browning, mealiness and graininess were significantly correlated and were the main CI symptoms observed in this population. Mealiness and graininess were negatively correlated with stone adhesion which reflects the higher susceptibility to CI disorders of freestone fruit. A genetic linkage map of linkage group 4 (LG 4) was constructed with SSR and candidate genes (CGs). Significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for mealiness, graininess, leatheriness and bleeding were found in this linkage group, validating QTLs for CI symptoms previously reported in this linkage group from an unrelated progeny population. In addition, QTLs controlling other agronomic and fruit quality traits were also localized in this linkage group.
