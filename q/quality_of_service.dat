Assoc. Prof. Department of Social medicine. Faculty of Public Health, Kaunas University of Medicine. – Kaunas, 2005. – P. 77 Aim of {{the study}} is to assess the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> at the Intensive Care Unit. Objectives: 1. 	To conduct a survey on the opinion <b>of</b> <b>service</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the medical {{personnel}} at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in Kaunas University Hospital. 2. 	To determine the principal measures enabling to ensure the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> at the ICU. 3. 	To determine the prevailing problems influencing the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> rendered at the ICU. 4. 	To identify factors affecting the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> at the ICU. Methods. The survey was conducted in the Departments of Cardiosurgery, Cardiology, Neurosurgery and Central ICU at Kaunas University Hospital. The number of the respondents chosen was 170, of them, 64 were medical doctors and 106 nurses. The survey was carried out from 15 November 2004 to 14 December 2004. Of the 170 questionnaires handed out only 153 (90 %) were returned back. Of these, 139 (91 %) questionnaires were filled in correctly, 47 (33, 8 % were completed by the doctors and 92 (66, 2 %) were completed by the nurses. The data of the survey was processed and analyzed applying the SPSS 9 version of statistical data accumulation and analysis programming package. Two statistical procedures were employed, i. e. (x 2) criterion and Spearman’s correlation coefficient. The difference of indices were statistically meaningful at p< 0, 05. Results. The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> rendered at the ICU was considered crucial (4, 85), meanwhile the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for patients was average (3, 88). The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> rendered at the ICU only partly meets patients’ expectations and needs (3, 79). Mistakes due to health care (complications, open or unintended harm) are very rare (2, 33). The most important measures ensuring the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> are as follows: provision of the means of work (4, 76), good labor organization (4, 56), regular upgrading of the skills and knowledge of the staff (4, 40). The most prevailing problems concerning the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> at the ICU are unplanned admissions (3, 35), problems relating medical equipment (3, 11), improper behavior of visitors (2, 99). After completion of the Spearman’s correlation (level of correlation significance 0, 01), a very reliable interrelation between the following factors: the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> ICU <b>services,</b> empathy and care of medical staff towards the patients (0, 494), encouragement of medical staff to work efficiently (0, 377), frequency of mistakes of health care (- 0, 376). Conclusions: 1. The <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>services</b> is crucial to the staff, however, the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> for patients was evaluated as average. In the opinion of the personnel, the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> only partly meets the expectations and the needs of the patients. The occurring mistakes of heath care (complications, open or unintended harm) are rare. 2. The most important measures ensuring the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> rendered are as follows: supply of the means of work, good labor organization and regular upgrading of the skills and knowledge of the staff. 3. The most frequently occurring problems affecting the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> include: unplanned admissions, problems in relation to medical equipment and improper behavior of visitors. 4.

40|$|Abstract Background Information about <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> malaria {{treatment}} <b>services</b> <b>of</b> different {{healthcare providers}} {{is needed to}} know how to improve the treatment of malaria since inappropriate service provision leads to increased burden of malaria. Hence, the study determined the technical and perceived <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> malaria treatment <b>services</b> <b>of</b> different types of providers in three urban and three rural areas in southeast Nigeria. Methods Questionnaire was used to interview randomly selected healthcare providers about the technical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> their malaria treatment services. Exit polls were used to obtain information about perceived quality from consumers. A socio-economic status (SES) index and comparison of data between urban and rural areas was used to examine socio-economic status and geographic differences in <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Results The lowest technical <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> was found from patent medicine dealers. Conversely, public and private hospitals as well as primary healthcare centres had the highest <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Householders were least satisfied with <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> <b>of</b> patent medicine dealers and pharmacy shops and were mostly satisfied with services rendered by public and private hospitals. The urbanites were more satisfied with the overall <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> than the rural dwellers. Conclusion These findings provide areas for interventions to equitably improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> malaria treatment <b>services,</b> especially for patent medicine dealers and pharmacy shops, that are two of the most common providers of malaria treatment especially with the current change of first line drugs from the relatively inexpensive drugs to the expensive artemisinin-based combination therapy, so as to decrease inappropriate drug prescribing, use, costs and resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapy. </p...|$|R

Methods : In this descriptive study, 362 students in medical sciences participated. Data was collected using a questionnaire based on SERVQUAL. By filling in the questionnaires, students defined realities and their expectations in five aspects <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> including physical, trust, reliability, responsiveness, and sympathy. The gap in services was calculated by subtracting students’ scores in realities from their expectations. Results: Results showed that there were gaps in all five aspects <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> The highest gap mean was in sympathy aspect (- 1. 67) and then in aspects of responsiveness (- 1. 62), reliability (- 1. 54) and physical aspect (- 1. 52). The least gap mean was in trust aspect (- 1. 46). There was a significant difference between realities and expectations in all aspects (P= 0. 0001). Students of higher levels mentioned higher gaps in a significant way (P< 0. 01). Conclusion : Generally, the gap between expectations and realities was seen in all aspects which is due to not meeting students’ expectations <b>of</b> provided <b>services.</b> To improve <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>services,</b> it is recommended that together with planning educational workshops about service providing and increasing staff’s communicative skills, authorities put those aspects with the highest gap in priority while allocating budget.
