40|$|In {{the past}} few years permit trading has become a popular policy {{instrument}} to achieve emissions reductions or other environmental goals at minimal cost. There are already a number of existing regimes on firm as well as on national level in which permits for SO 2, NOX and CO 2 emissions but also fishing <b>quotas</b> <b>or</b> water <b>rights</b> are traded. In addition European CO 2 emissions trading is expected to start in 2005 and international emissions trading is also planned for the Annex B countries of the Kyoto Protocol. Experience has shown though that permit trading can only be an efficient instrument if emissions and permit trades are monitored and accounted appropriately and if compliance is enforced by those running the programs. Or, as Tietenberg (2001) puts it: ?regardless of how well any tradable permit system is designed, non-compliance can prevent attainment of its economic, social and environmental objectives?...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} small open-economy trade model where either a tariff, <b>or</b> a <b>quota,</b> <b>or</b> a {{voluntary}} export restraint (VER) exists, and where one exported, one imported, one non-traded, and one public good are produced.

Among other things, it is demonstrated that when the direct social profitability effect of the public good is positive and the public good is a net complement to the non-traded good, fiscal expansion causes an appreciation of the RER under free trade, and under a tariff when the public good is also a net complement to the imported good. The paper identifies additional conditions required to ensure the appreciation of the RER, due to fiscal expansion, under an import <b>quota</b> <b>or</b> a VER. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} trade liberalization of tariff-rate quotas under import "state trading enterprises" (STEs) in agriculture. An analytical framework is provided to determine the importance of which instrument is binding under competition (the in-quota or out-of-quota tariff <b>or</b> the <b>quota)</b> and under the initial STE equilibrium. It also depends {{on whether or not}} the STE controls both the domestic market prices and owns/controls the import quota (and whether it is obligated to fill the <b>quota</b> <b>or</b> not). An empirical example of the rice STE in South Korea has simulations showing that an increase in imports can be achieved through a moderate expansion of the <b>quota</b> <b>or</b> a decrease in the out-of-quota tariff to the level where it becomes binding. However, a significant level of quota expansion induces the STE to switch to the autarky solution and social welfare declines.

It establishes that the number of women in the pool of potential judges does not appear to dictate how many women become international judges. It shows, too, that when selection procedures are closed and opaque, and there is no <b>quota</b> <b>or</b> aspirational target for a sex-balanced bench, women obtain international judgeships in disproportionately low numbers. On the other hand, when a <b>quota</b> <b>or</b> aspirational target exists, benches are more balanced. Finally, the Article suggests and evaluates concrete reforms to selection procedures on international courts to remedy this problem, including greater transparency and openness in selection procedures, aspirational targets for the participation of women on the bench and quotas. It is the first article to explore the relationship between selection procedures and sex representativeness outcomes on international courts...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses {{analytically}} tractable and numerically solved general equilibrium {{models to}} examine the significance of pre-existing distortions in factor markets for revenue-neutral environmental tax reforms and for various policies involving pollution quotas and permits. Results indicate that pre-existing factor taxes generally raise the costs of these environmental policies. This reflects a tax-interaction effect: the lowering of real factor returns resulting from the higher output prices occasioned by environmental taxes and other regulations. The revenue-recycling effect - stemming {{from the use of}} environmental tax revenues to finance cuts in pre-existing factor taxes - helps reduce policy costs, but under plausible assumptions does not eliminate the costs of such policies: the double dividend does not materialize. Even if it does not produce a double dividend, the revenue-recycling effect is important for reducing policy costs. Policies that fail to exploit the revenue-recycling effect suffer significant disadvantages in terms of efficiency. Like environmental taxes, freely allocated (<b>or</b> grandfathered) pollution <b>quotas</b> <b>or</b> permits, for example, produce a costly tax-interaction effect, yet such <b>quotas</b> <b>or</b> permits do not enjoy the offsetting revenue-recycling effect. Auctioning the permits <b>or</b> <b>quotas</b> makes possible the revenue-recycling effect and allows given pollution-abatement targets to be achieved at lower cost. The failure to exploit the revenue-recycling effect can alter the sign of overall efficiency impact. Indeed, if marginal environmental benefits from pollution reductions are below a certain threshold value, then any level of pollution abatement through freely allocated <b>quotas</b> <b>or</b> permits is efficiency-reducing. The tax-interaction effect is relevant to government regulation outside the environmental area. To the extent that regulations on international trade or agricultural production raise output prices and thereby reduce real factor returns, these regulations exacerbate the factor-market distortions from pre-existing taxes and thus involve higher social costs than would be indicated by partial equilibrium analyses. ...|$|R
