5|$|A {{replacement}} for Melbourne was under consideration {{as early as}} 1956, and the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> revisited on several occasions until the 1980s. In every situation, a new aircraft carrier was turned down due to the increases in manpower and operating costs required to operate the ship when compared to Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|France outlawed {{the most}} radical {{political}} party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a long guerrilla war and {{the assassination of the}} party's leader, Ruben Um Nyobé. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.|$|E
50|$|First, eight <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> posed {{simultaneously}} to all contestants who response with a touchscreen {{and a computer}} keyboard.

50|$|The multiple-choice {{questions}} {{within each}} {{section of the}} CPA Exam are administered in three blocks, called testlets. Each testlet contains operational and pretest <b>questions.</b> Operational <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> scored, while pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> not scored. Instead, a candidate’s response to a pretest <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{used to evaluate the}} question’s statistical performance. A majority of the <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> operational questions; however, pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> mixed into the exam and are not identified as pretest questions. From the candidate’s perspective, pretest <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> indistinguishable from operational questions. Pretest questions that meet certain statistical criteria are used as operational questions on future exams. This strategy for pretesting <b>questions</b> <b>is</b> common practice in high-stakes testing.|$|R

5|$|In 1982, the ACLU became {{involved}} in a case involving the distribution of child pornography (New York v. Ferber). In an amicus brief, the ACLU argued that child pornography that violates the three prong obscenity test should be outlawed, but that the law in <b>question</b> <b>was</b> overly restrictive because it outlawed artistic displays and otherwise non-obscene material. The court did not adopt the ACLU's position.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Buffalo Grove and Lincolnshire {{reached a}} {{boundary}} agreement {{with respect to}} the allocation of properties surrounding and concerning the unincorporated Prairie View area, which lay in between the two Lake County villages.

5|$|In 2010 Bamber's lawyers {{highlighted}} {{two police}} logs {{in support of}} Bamber's application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal. The <b>question</b> <b>was</b> whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Bamber alone; or the defence position {{that there were two}} calls to police, one from Nevill followed by a second from Bamber.|$|E

5|$|There {{was some}} dispute on the {{question}} over who was Subh-i-Azal's appointed successor. MacEoin states that Subh-i-Azal appointed Yahya Dawlatábádí as his successor in turn {{after the death of}} his (Yahya's) father, Mirza Hadi Dawlatábádí. However, this was disputed by Subh-i-Azal's grandson, Jalal Azal, indicating that this <b>question</b> <b>was</b> not entirely resolved.|$|E

30|$|Will the new NQS really measure FDC {{quality or}} does it measure how the scheme ‘monitors’ quality in each {{residence}} by assuming all residences are the same? These two <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> quite different — the first <b>question</b> <b>is</b> a validity issue related to measuring quality and the second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> an evaluation of how the NQS is operating in FDC schemes. Indeed, the second <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not really about a measuring quality.|$|R
5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in <b>question</b> <b>was</b> indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E
5|$|A statewide {{referendum}} on the ballot that day continued the work begun by the new city charter in asking voters to consolidate {{the city and county}} governments in Philadelphia. In 1854, all of the municipalities in Philadelphia County had been consolidated into one city, but many county offices still existed, duplicating the efforts of city officials. The merger would also bring county offices under the civil service protections of the new city charter. Merging the city and county governments had been defeated in a 1937 referendum, but in 1951 the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> overwhelmingly approved. Two other ballot proposals authorized the city to borrow $17 million for municipal improvements and $14 million for the gas works; both passed by a five-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 112 fictional films {{are known to}} have been {{produced}} in the Dutch East Indies (modern day Indonesia) between 1926 and the colony's dissolution in 1949. The earliest motion pictures, imported from abroad, were shown in late 1900, and by the early 1920s imported serials and fictional films were being shown, often with localised names. Dutch companies were also producing documentary films about the Indies to be shown in the Netherlands. The first reports of fictional film production in the Indies date from 1923, although the work in <b>question</b> <b>was</b> not completed. The first locally produced film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng, was directed by L. Heuveldorp and released on 31 December 1926.|$|E

50|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>are</b> {{of three}} types—Starred, Unstarred and Short Notice. A Starred <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> one {{to which a}} member desires an oral answer in the House and which is {{distinguished}} by an asterisk mark. An unstarred <b>Question</b> <b>is</b> one which is not called for oral answer {{in the house and}} on which no supplementary <b>questions</b> can consequently <b>be</b> asked. An answer to such a <b>question</b> <b>is</b> given in writing. Minimum period of notice for starred/ unstarred <b>question</b> <b>is</b> 10 clear days.

5|$|After {{the start}} of the Second World War in September, {{construction}} continued desultorily until October when it was suspended by the Admiralty for one year to release labour and material for escorts needed to protect merchant convoys. Construction of the 16-inch guns and their turrets was to continue, however. The <b>question</b> <b>was</b> raised again on 12 November 1940 and the decision to suspend construction was reaffirmed. All three ships ordered were cancelled in 1942, but Lions keel was not scrapped until {{after the end of the}} war. Only four 16-inch guns, and no turrets, were ever completed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{purpose for}} issuing the edict, as {{described}} within the papyrus upon {{which part of}} the edict was inscribed, was to appease the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy. The conspiracy in <b>question</b> <b>was</b> in response to Caracalla's murder of Geta and the subsequent slaughter of his followers; fratricide would only have been condoned if his brother had been a tyrant. The damnatio memoriae against Geta and the large payments Caracalla had made to his own supporters were designed to protect himself from possible repercussions. After this had succeeded, Caracalla {{felt the need to}} repay the gods of Rome by returning the favour to the people of Rome through a similarly grand gesture. This was done through the granting of citizenship.|$|E
5|$|As {{the leader}} of the NCP, the largest party in parliament, Jyrki Katainen was tasked with forming a new {{coalition}} government. He said that the result of the election supported a coalition consisting of the three largest parties, i.e. the National Coalition, the Social Democratic Party and the True Finns. The most problematic <b>question</b> <b>was</b> believed to be the EU bailout policy, where the True Finns most differ from the other parties. Formal negotiations on government formation started after 24 April and the Kiviniemi government submitted its resignation on 29 April, starting to serve as a caretaker government until a new one was formed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} June 2013, Labor's {{standing}} in the polls had worsened, and the Coalition had been leading in most opinion polls for two years; one poll in early June showed that Labor would be reduced to as few as 40 seats after the next election. With a general election due later that year, even some staunch Gillard supporters began to believe that Labor faced almost certain defeat if Gillard continued as leader. According to the ABC's Barrie Cassidy, the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> not whether Gillard would be ousted as Labor leader, but when the ousting would take place.|$|E
5|$|Chana's first {{teacher was}} D.C. Sears, an Oregon, Illinois resident. The late 19th century saw {{at least ten}} {{individuals}} teach at Chana School at different times.

The <b>question</b> <b>was</b> brought to a vote but failed and Chana students continued to go to Oregon schools after eighth grade.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{thought of}} having his diary {{published}} mixed in with FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood urged that it be published separately. On 30 December the <b>question</b> <b>was</b> settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of William Broderip that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the Narrative. Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming his diary, and incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his Journal and Remarks (now commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle) in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839.|$|E

50|$|Yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{formed in}} various ways in various languages. In English, a special word order (verb-subject-object) is used to form yes-no questions.

In Latin, yes-no <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> {{indicated}} {{by the addition of}} a special grammatical particle or an enclitic. In some languages, such as in Modern Greek, Portuguese, and the Jakaltek language, the only way to distinguish a yes-no question from a simple declarative statement <b>is</b> the rising <b>question</b> intonation used when saying the <b>question.</b> (Such <b>questions</b> <b>are</b> labelled declarative <b>questions</b> and <b>are</b> also available as an option in those languages that have other ways of asking yes-no questions.)
