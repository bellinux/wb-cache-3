40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design of a {{multi-stage}} reverse logistics network for product recovery. Different recovery options such as product remanufacturing, component repairing and material recycling are simultaneously considered. Initially, we propose a mixed integer linear programming model – with a profit maximization objective – for the network design problem. The structure of the product, by way of bill of materials (BOM), is also incorporated into the proposed model in order to analyze the flow at component and material levels. Sensitivity analysis is carried out to study the effects of variations in the values of the input parameters such as product return <b>quantity,</b> <b>unit</b> transportation cost per unit distance, and unit processing cost. The analysis shows that the design decisions of different facilities considerably change even for 5 – 20 %% variations in input parameter values. This {{led to the development of}} a refined mathematical model which incorporates variations in the different input parameter values over time. The new model provides a unified design for the entire planning horizon and has been validated with the design of a used refrigerator recovery network...|$|E
40|$|Inventory {{is one of}} {{the crucial}} {{component}} in hospital operations. The value o inventory may range up until 25 % of the total cost of the hospital operation. Inventory optimalisation may save up to 10 % in the minimum. There are a lot of drugs circulation in hospital. There is always a chance for a mistake. A tight control of inventory is necessary for hospital managers to minimize any potential waste. A saving directive for 20 % drugs which consume 70 % of the total cost will boost the hospital efficiency. A lot of factors influences hospital inventory and how managers strategize for the inventory. Some identified factors are order frequency, order <b>quantity,</b> <b>unit</b> price and other hidden costs. The purpose of this research is to prove the correlation of each factor and how they influence the total inventory cost. To follow up the result, henceforth a model of simulation by calculating Economic Order Quantity and Reorder Point, the research may help hospital managers in modifying the strategy of managing hospital inventory for the next year period. This study aims to identify the factors which influence total inventory cost in managing group A drugs at private type B hospital, Jakarta.

40|$|It {{is shown}} here that five base {{quantities}} (and the corresponding five base units) of nature are sufficient to define all derived quantities (and their units) and to describe all natural phenomena. The base quantities (and their base units) are: length (m), mass (kg), time (s), temperature (K) and electric charge (C). The {{amount of substance}} (mole) is not taken as a base quantity {{of nature and the}} Avogadro constant is not considered as a fundamental constant of nature, as they are both based on an arbitrary definition (due to the arbitrary value of 0. 012 kg for the mass of 1 mole of C- 12 isotope). Therefore, the amount of substance (mole) is moved from the list of base quantities to the category of the supplementary units (to be re-created after its abrogation in 1995). Based on its definition, the luminous intensity (cd) is not a base <b>quantity</b> (<b>unit),</b> therefore it is moved to the list of derived quantities (units). The ampere and coulomb are exchanged by places in the list of base and derived units, as ampere is a speed of coulombs (but SI defines meter, not its speed as a base unit). The five base quantities are re-defined in this paper by connecting them to five fundamental constants of nature (the most accurately known frequency of the hydrogen atom, the speed of light, the Planck constant, the Boltzmann constant and the elementary charge) with their numerical values fixed in accordance with their CODATA 2006 values (to be improved by further experiments) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractField {{experiments}} and laboratory analysis {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of controlled drainage (CTD) and conventional drainage (CVD) technologies on drainage volume, concentrations of NH 4 +-N, NO 3 −-N, and total phosphorus (TP), nitrogen and phosphorus losses, rice yield, and water utilization efficiency. Results show that CTD technology can effectively reduce drainage times and volume; NH 4 +-N, NO 3 −-N, and TP concentrations, from the first to the fourth day after four rainstorms decreased by 28. 7 %– 46. 7 %, 37. 5 %– 47. 5 %, and 22. 7 – 31. 2 %, respectively, with CTD. These are significantly higher rates of decrease than those observed with CVD. CTD can significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus losses in field drainage, compared with CVD; the reduction rates observed in this study were, respectively, 66. 72 %, 55. 56 %, and 42. 81 % for NH 4 +-N, NO 3 −-N, and TP. Furthermore, in the CTD mode, the rice yield was cut slightly. In the CVD mode, the water production efficiencies in unit irrigation water <b>quantity,</b> <b>unit</b> field water consumption, and unit evapotranspiration were, respectively, 0. 85, 0. 48, and 1. 22  kg/m 3, while in the CTD mode they were 2. 91, 0. 84, and 1. 61  kg/m 3 —in other words, 3. 42, 1. 75, and 1. 32 times those of CVD. Furthermore, the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) show that the indicators in both the CVD and CTD modes, including the concentrations of NH 4 +-N, NO 3 −-N, and TP, the losses of NH 4 +-N, NO 3 −-N, and TP, irrigation water quantity, and water consumption, showed extremely significant differences between the modes, but the rice yield showed no significant difference...|$|E
