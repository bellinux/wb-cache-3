50|$|Although {{there are}} many {{different}} variations of manti in terms of shape and way of serving, the most praised type of Turkish manti is known as Kayseri mantisi, originally from Kayseri, an Anatolian city. Kayseri mantisi is tiny and served with yoghurt, melted butter (flavored with Aleppo pepper) and seasoning including dry mint and Aleppo pepper flakes. It can also be served with the water or chicken broth it was boiled in, and often in Kayseri it is consumed as a soup prior to the main dish. In Kayseri, when a couple is engaged to be married, the mother of the groom visits the bride's house and during this visit the bride should prepare manti for her prospective mother-in-law. The smaller the manti dumplings are, the more skillful the bride is considered to be in the kitchen. Traditionally the dumplings prepared for the prospective mother-in law are supposed to be so small that 40 of them can be fit into one spoon. Manti may be made from shredded meat of <b>quail,</b> <b>chicken</b> or goose in some regions of Turkey, while boş mantı (‘empty dumpling’) lack filling entirely.|$|E

When <b>quail</b> and <b>chickens</b> were vaccinated with quail pox virus and given pigeon and fowl pox challenge viruses, no protection was present. Thus, quail pox virus had no immunologic relationship to pigeon and fowl pox viruses. Psittacine pox virus applied as a vaccine in <b>quail</b> and <b>chickens</b> {{also failed to}} protect against quail pox virus challenge. However, <b>quail,</b> <b>chickens,</b> and turkeys vaccinated with quail pox virus were protected against quail pox virus challenge. An isolate of psittacine pox virus, applied as a vaccine, protected chickens against challenge with the same virus isolate and also against challenge with two other psittacine pox virus isolates, confirming a close or identical antigenic relationship with each other. When combined in a multivalent vaccine, quail, psittacine, and fowl pox viruses induced excellent protection in chickens against challenge with the three respective viruses. The {{presence or absence of}} "takes " or reactions following vaccination by the wing web route did not necessarily correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} immunity noted from challenge by feather follicle virus application.

(LSI) -specific {{pathogen-free}} Japanese quail and LSI-specific pathogen-free chicken embryo cell cultures. Nine viruses produced similar titers in the <b>quail</b> and <b>chicken</b> cell systems, whereas four viruses showed {{significantly higher}} titers in <b>chickens.</b> Young Japanese <b>quail</b> and <b>chickens</b> were inoculated with five selected avain viruses and maintained in stainless-steel isolators. Comparable responses were noted in <b>quail</b> and <b>chickens</b> injected with Newcastle disease virus and avain leukosis virus, but quail {{were significantly more}} resistant than chickens to fowl pox virus, laryngotracheitis virus, and Marek's disease herpesvirus. Although no overt symptoms of disease were observed in Japanese quail inoculated with most avain viruses, neutralizing antibody or virus was detected, indicating presence of an inapparent infection. In one experiment, neutralizing antibody was detected in a comparable number of <b>quail</b> and <b>chickens</b> after inoculation with avian leukosis virus. Avian leukosis virus viremia was observed at 12 and 70 days postinoculation, with the COFAL (complement fixation for avian leukosis) titers similar for <b>quail</b> and <b>chickens.</b> Most <b>quail</b> infected with Marek's disease herpesvirus produced neutralizing antibody within 70 days but showed no classical symptoms of Marek's disease even when held for 5 months.

40|$|International audienceIn {{line with}} the Gifu University's {{initiative}} to map the Japanese quail genome, a total of 100 Japanese quail microsatellite markers isolated in our laboratory were evaluated in a population of 20 unrelated quails randomly sampled from a colony of wild quail origin. Ninety-eight markers were polymorphic {{with an average of}} 3. 7 alleles per locus and a mean heterozygosity of 0. 423. To determine the utility of these markers for comparative genome mapping in Phasianidae, cross-species amplification of all the markers was tested with chicken and guinea fowl DNA. Amplification products similar in size to the orthologous loci in quail were observed in 42 loci in chicken and 20 loci in guinea fowl. Of the cross-reactive markers, 57. 1 % in chicken and 55. 0 % in guinea fowl were polymorphic when tested in 20 birds from their respective populations. Five of 15  markers that could cross-amplify Japanese <b>quail,</b> <b>chicken,</b> and guinea fowl DNA were polymorphic in all three species. Amplification of orthologous loci was confirmed by sequencing 10 loci each from chicken and guinea fowl and comparing with them the corresponding quail sequence.

In this study, the partial complementary DNA (cDNA) of SCF was cloned from {{the eye of}} duck by homology cloning and Rapid Amplification of Cdna Ends (RACE) approaches. Comparing with zebra finch, <b>quail,</b> <b>chicken</b> and mammalian SCF cDNA sequence, the phylogenetic tree displayed that duck SCF is highly conserved, it shares 63. 8 - 94. 3 % similarity with the above species cDNA sequence. The rooted phylogenetic neighbor-Joining tree with bootstrap was done using SCF CDS sequences from duck and other species by DNAMAN software. The results showed that duck has close relationship with chicken, quail and zebro finch. The semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that SCF was a universally expressed gene, it was detected in heart, liver, spleen, kidney, brain, back skin, muscle, eye, glandular stomach, belly skin. Q-PCR was employed to analyze the SCF gene expression in six type duck hair bulbs. The results showed that its expression had significant difference between W-W which is white hair bulb taken from white plumage with yellow beak and other types (BL-Bl which is black feather hair bulb taken from black plumage with black beak, W-L which is white feather hair bulb taken from white plumage with black beak ducks, W-WB which is white feather taken from white-black plumage with black beak, B-WB which is black feather taken from white-black plumage with black beak), p< 0. 001). The expression of SCF in BR (brown feather hair bulb taken from brown plumages with black beak ducks) has significant difference comparing with the above 5 hair bulb types (p< 0. 05). There is {{no significant difference between}} any of the following types which including BL-BL, W-L, W-WB and B-WB.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the expression dynamics of genes during myogenesis in <b>quail</b> and <b>chicken.</b> Real-time PCR was used to detect mRNA expressions of MyoD, MyoG, MLP and MSTN in breast muscle of <b>quail</b> and <b>chicken</b> embryos during the period of embryonic days E 7 - 17. Results showed that expression profiles of each gene displayed similar trend in the experiment period between <b>quail</b> and <b>chicken,</b> however, the expression concentration between the two species differed at the same time detected. MyoD mRNA expression in quail was significantly lower in the early phase of the experiment period (E 7 - 9) (P< 0. 01 on E 7; P< 0. 05 on both E 8 and E 9). For MyoG and MLP, the mRNA expressions were both lower in quail than that in chicken during the experiment period. Additionally, the embryonic day when quail reached its peak expression was earlier than that in <b>chicken</b> (MyoG: <b>quail</b> E 12 vs. chicken E 13; MLP: quail E 14 vs. chicken E 15), and the peak expression for both in quail was significantly lower than that in chicken (P< 0. 01 for both).
