40|$|Similarity search, or <b>query</b> <b>by</b> <b>content,</b> is an {{important}} operation for time series databases. While the research community has been quite active in this area, we are yet to see full support for these operations and data from commercial Database Management Systems (DBMS). In this work we explore how efficiently can similarity search algorithms be implemented inside a DBMS with User Defined Functions (UDFs). We concentrate our work on querying Electrocardiograms (ECG), a biosignal and {{a particular type of}} time series data. Given the lack of support for time series as an standard data type, we identify two alternatives for managing a database of ECG signals using a DBMS, namely using either references to flat files on the operating system, or using Binary Large Object (BLOB) attributes. Our experiments show a significant overhead in the total elapsed time while doing similarity search on signals stored as BLOB. On the other hand, querying signals stored as files using UDFs is as competitive as using an ad-hoc implementation of the <b>query</b> <b>by</b> <b>content</b> algorithm running as a stand-alone application on the operating system...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Clipping is {{the process}} of {{transforming}} a real valued series into a sequence of bits representing whether each data is above or below the average. In this paper, we argue that clipping is a useful and flexible transformation for the exploratory analysis of large time dependent data sets. We demonstrate how time series stored as bits can be very efficiently compressed and manipulated and that, under some assumptions, the discriminatory power with clipped series is asymptotically equivalent to that achieved with the raw data. Unlike other transformations, clipped series can be compared directly to the raw data series. We show that this means we can form a tight lower bounding metric for Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping distance and hence efficiently <b>query</b> <b>by</b> <b>content.</b> Clipped data can be used in conjunction with a host of algorithms and statistical tests that naturally follow from the binary nature of the data. A series of experiments illustrate how clipped series can be used in increasingly complex ways to achieve better results than other popular representations. The usefulness of the proposed representation is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} results with clipped data are consistently better than those achieved with a Wavelet or Discrete Fourier Transformation at the same compression ratio for both clustering and <b>query</b> <b>by</b> <b>content.</b> The flexibility of the representation is shown by the fact that we can take advantage of a variable Run Length Encoding of clipped series to defin...|$|E

We present a method for similarity search that is robust to scaling in the time axis, in addition to noise, offset translation, and amplitude scaling. The method has been tested on medical, financial, space telemetry and artificial data. Furthermore the method is exceptionally fast, with the predicted 2 to 4 orders of magnitude speedup actually observed. The method uses a piecewise linear representation of the original data.

DiVI empowers the user to understand how the measures of similarity and diversity affect their queries, as well as increases the relevance of CBIR results according to the user judgment. An overview of the image distribution in the database is shown to the user through multidimensional projection. The user interacts with the visual representation changing the projected space or the query parameters, according to his/her needs and previous knowledge.

Text-based retrieval is no longer appropriate for indexing such media, for several reasons.

Secondly, these annotations are drawn from a predefined set of keywords which cannot cover all possible concepts images may represent.

40|$|Data {{visualization}} {{techniques are}} very important for data analysis, since the human eye has been frequently advocated as the ultimate data-mining tool. However, there has been surprisingly little work on visualizing massive time series data sets. To this end, we developed VizTree, a time series pattern discovery and visualization system based on augmenting suffix trees. VizTree visually summarizes both the global and local structures of time series data at the same time. In addition, it provides novel interactive solutions to many pattern discovery problems, including the discovery of frequently occurring patterns (motif discovery), surprising patterns (anomaly detection), and <b>query</b> <b>by</b> <b>content.</b> VizTree works by transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and encoding the data in a modified suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties. We demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state-of-the-art batch algorithms on several real and synthetic data sets. Based on the tree structure, we further device a coefficient which measures the dissimilarity between any two time series.

40|$|The {{problem of}} finding a {{specified}} pattern in a time series database (i. e. <b>query</b> <b>by</b> <b>content)</b> has received much attention {{and is now a}} relatively mature field. In contrast, the important problem of enumerating all surprising or interesting patterns has received far less attention. This problem requires a meaningful definition of "surprise", and an efficient search technique. All previous attempts at finding surprising patterns in time series use a very limited notion of surprise, and/or do not scale to massive datasets. To overcome these lim- itations we introduce a novel technique that defines a pattern surprising if the frequency of its occurrence differs substantially from that expected by chance, given some previously seen data. This notion has the advantage of not requiring an explicit definition of surprise, which may be impossible to elicit from a domain expert. Instead the user simply gives the algorithm a collection of previously observed normal data.

A better approach is to provide automatic content-based retrieval through image, text, and sound interpretation.

This implies the definition of some distance measure between the query and the stored multimedia objects which captures what humans perceive as similarity between the objects. The contents of the multimedia objects may be queried from different aspects, {{depending on the type of}} the multimedia objects.
