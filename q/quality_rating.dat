5|$|Days {{after the}} first filling of the reservoir, around 80 {{hairline}} cracks were observed in the dam's structure. The submerged spillway gates of the dam might pose a risk of cavitation, similar to that which severely damaged the poorly designed and cavitating spillways of the Glen Canyon Dam in the US state of Arizona, which was unable to properly withstand the Colorado river floods of 1983. However 163,000 concrete units of the Three Gorges dam all passed quality testing and the deformation was within design limits. An experts group gave the project overall a good <b>quality</b> <b>rating.</b>|$|E
5|$|Glacier is {{considered}} to have excellent air and water quality. No major areas of dense human population exist anywhere near the region and industrial effects are minimized due to a scarcity of factories and other potential contributors of pollutants. However, the sterile and cold lakes found throughout the park are easily contaminated by airborne pollutants that fall whenever it rains or snows, and some evidence of these pollutants {{has been found in}} park waters. Wildfires could also impact the quality of water. However, the pollution level is currently viewed as negligible, and the park lakes and waterways have a water <b>quality</b> <b>rating</b> of A-1, the highest rating given by the state of Montana.|$|E

A roll of over the SC is a failure, (100 always fails), under the SC but over approximately half the SC is a Quality 4, Acceptable success, between approximately a fourth and half the SC is a Quality 3, Good success, and lower rolls still can get Quality 2, Very Good, or even Quality 1, Excellent ratings.

The results show that the OEE for production line 2 is much better than production line 1. However, the average OEE for both production lines are 67. 62 % and 72. 79 % respectively. These low values of OEE are a result mainly of the reduction in the <b>quality</b> <b>rate.</b> The average <b>quality</b> <b>rate</b> for both production lines 1 and 2 are 95. 47 % and 92. 94 % respectively...|$|R

[...] As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. [...] The courier’s job was to sample beer at inns along the way. [...] If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn’s sign or door with a single X. [...] If the inn’s beer was deemed good, the sign or door would receive two Xs. [...] A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.|$|E

2500|$|The {{diamonds}} {{produced at}} the Argyle diamond mine are {{of an average}} low quality. Only 5% of mined diamonds are of gem quality, compared to a worldwide average of 20% (Author Janine Roberts contends that the [...] "near-gem" [...] <b>quality</b> <b>rating</b> is subjective and misleading because these diamonds can be cut into gems if desired.); of the remaining 95%, they are about evenly split between classifications of [...] "near gem quality" [...] and industrial grade; 80% of Argyle diamonds are brown, followed by 16% yellow, 2% white, 2% grey, and less than 1% pink and green. Despite the low production volume of pink and red diamonds, the Argyle mine is the only reliable source in the world, producing 90 to 95% of all pink and red diamonds. Most Argyle diamonds are classified as type 1a (see material properties of diamond), and have low levels of nitrogen impurities, their colour resulting instead from structural defects of the crystal lattice. Argyle diamonds tend to fluoresce blue or dull green under ultraviolet light, and blue-white under X-ray radiation. The most common inclusion is unconverted graphite, followed by crystalline inclusions of orange garnet, pyroxene, and olivine.|$|E
