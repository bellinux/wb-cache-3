25|$|<b>Quasi-contract.</b> In contrast, <b>quasi-contract</b> {{refers to}} {{situations}} in which a defendant is bound {{as if there were}} a contract. When the plaintiff sued on such a 'contract' by bringing an action of indebitatus assumpsit she was not enforcing some consensually assumed obligation, but rather an obligation imposed by law.|$|E
25|$|Quasi-contractual {{actions were}} {{generally}} (but not exclusively) used to remedy what {{would now be}} called unjust enrichment. In most common law jurisdictions the law of <b>quasi-contract</b> has been superseded by the law of unjust enrichment.|$|E
25|$|The form {{of action}} known as indebitatus assumpsit came to include various sub-forms {{known as the}} common money counts. The most {{important}} of these for the later development of the law of <b>quasi-contract</b> included: (i) actions for money had and received to the plaintiff's use; (ii) actions for money paid to the defendant's use; (iii) quantum meruit; and (iv) quantum valebat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quasi-contracts</b> include undue enrichment, {{sections}} 406 to 419 (Book II, Title IV), {{and management}} of affairs without mandate, sections 395 to 405 (Book II, Title III).|$|R
5000|$|The {{remedy for}} <b>quasi-contracts</b> (contracts implied in law) is quantum meruit, the {{reasonable}} or [...] "fair market" [...] value of {{goods or services}} rendered. The remedy for promissory estoppel is reliance damages.|$|R
5000|$|Justinian first defines an {{obligation}} (obligatio) in his Institutiones, Book 3, section 13 as [...] "a legal bond, {{with which we}} are bound by necessity of performing some act according {{to the laws of}} our State." [...] He further separates the law of obligations into contracts, delicts, <b>quasi-contracts,</b> and quasi-delicts.|$|R
25|$|In certain circumstances, {{an implied}} {{contract}} may be created. A contract is implied in fact if the circumstances imply that parties have {{reached an agreement}} {{even though they have}} not done so expressly. For example, John Smith, a former lawyer may implicitly enter a contract by visiting a doctor and being examined; if the patient refuses to pay after being examined, the patient has breached a contract implied in fact. A contract which is implied in law is also called a <b>quasi-contract,</b> because it is not in fact a contract; rather, it is a means for the courts to remedy situations in which one party would be unjustly enriched were he or she not required to compensate the other. Quantum meruit claims are an example.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>quasi-{{contract}}</b> (or implied-in-law contract or constructive contract) {{refers to}} a fictional contract recognised by a court. The notion of <b>quasi-contract</b> {{can be traced to}} Roman law and is still a concept used in some modern legal systems.|$|E

2500|$|An unwritten, unspoken {{contract}}, {{also known}} as [...] "a contract implied by the acts of the parties", which can be either an implied-in-fact contract or implied-in-law contract, may also be legally binding.

2500|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, {{the law of}} <b>quasi-contract</b> {{can be traced to}} the medieval form of action known as indebitatus assumpsit. In essence, the {{plaintiff}} would recover a money sum from the defendant as if the defendant had promised to pay it: that is, as if there were a contract subsisting between the parties. The defendant's promise—their agreement to be bound by the [...] "contract"—was implied by law. The law of <b>quasi-contract</b> was generally used to enforce restitutionary obligations.|$|E
50|$|The terms <b>quasi-{{contract}}</b> {{and contract}} implied in law are synonymous. There {{are two types}} of <b>quasi-contract.</b> One is an action in restitution. The other is unjust enrichment. Note, therefore, that it is improper to say that <b>quasi-contract,</b> implied in law contract, and unjust enrichment are all synonymous, because unjust enrichment is only one type of the broader category of quasi-contracts (contracts implied in law).|$|E
40|$|This {{is a small}} casebook {{containing}} 79 English {{cases on}} the law of Contracts, Agency, and <b>Quasi-Contracts.</b> It is intended to accompany Anson 2 ̆ 7 s treatise; and its purpose, indicated in its title, is to illustrate the application of the rules constructed by Anson. For such a limited purpose it will no doubt be very serviceable. At least a third of the cases are contained in several American casebooks on the subject. With only eight cases in Offer and Acceptance, three on Statute of Frauds, seven on Consideration, three on <b>Quasi-Contracts,</b> and next to none on Conditions, it is certain that much is left without illustration and that the student is not afforded material sufficient for original and critical comparative study. It seems certain that, just as in this country, the later English casebooks will treat the law not as settled once for all by the masters and the judges but as growing and changing with new life conditions, and will give to the student an opportunity to do far more than to read Anson and then prove he is right by means of a single case...|$|R
50|$|Civil law is {{a branch}} of the law. In common law {{countries}} such as England, Wales, and the United States, the term refers to non-criminal law. The law relating to civil wrongs and <b>quasi-contracts</b> is part of the civil law. The law of property is embraced by civil law. Civil law can, like criminal law, be divided into substantive law and procedural law. The rights and duties of individuals amongst themselves is the primary concern of civil law. It is often suggested that civil proceedings are taken for the purpose of obtaining compensation for injury, and may thus be distinguished from criminal proceedings, whose purpose is to inflict punishment. However, exemplary or punitive damages may be awarded in civil proceedings. It was also formerly possible for common informers to sue for a penalty in civil proceedings.|$|R

40|$|Derived {{from the}} renowned multi-volume International Encyclopaedia of Laws, this {{practical}} {{analysis of the}} law of contracts in Sweden covers every aspect of the subject – definition and classification of contracts, contractual liability, relation to the law of property, good faith, burden of proof, defects, penalty clauses, arbitration clauses, remedies in case of non-performance, damages, power of attorney, and much more. Lawyers who handle transnational contracts will appreciate the explanation of fundamental differences in terminology, application, and procedure from one legal system to another, as well as the international aspects of contract law. Throughout the book, the treatment emphasizes drafting considerations. An introduction in which contracts are defined and contrasted to torts, <b>quasi-contracts,</b> and property is followed by a discussion of the concepts of ‘consideration’ or ‘cause’ and other underlying principles of the formation of contract. Subsequent chapters cover the doctrines of ‘relative effect’, termination of contract, and remedies for non-performance. The second part of the book, recognizing the need to categorize an agreement as a specific contract {{in order to determine the}} rules which apply to it, describes the nature of agency, sale, lease, building contracts, and other types of contract. Facts are presented in such a way that readers who are unfamiliar with specific terms and concepts in varying contexts will fully grasp their meaning and significance. Its succinct yet scholarly nature, as well as the practical quality of the information it provides, make this book a valuable time-saving tool for business and legal professionals alike. Lawyers representing parties with interests in Sweden will welcome this very useful guide, and academics and researchers will appreciate its value in the study of comparative contract law...|$|R
40|$|In the 18 th century Roman law {{suffered}} in Spain from two factors: first its rejection by the Absolute Monarchy and second: {{the influence of}} the Enlightenment on contemporary thinking. Whereas the Absolute Monarchists rejected Roman law because it did not stem from the sovereign himself, the followers of the Enlightenment considered the archaic laws neither compatible with current rationalist thinking: ‘Jusnaturalistic’ – nor practical for use in court. The predisposition against Roman legal tradition and in general the ‘ius commune’ provoked successive reforms to the law syllabus and diluted its influence greatly. We would thus imagine that the Spanish codification movement of the 19 th century would have involved a radical break with Roman law – but this was not to be the case: conversely the legislators benefited from, and exploited it to the utmost, the result being that the most significant activities of codification were to become the overhauling and updating of justinian sources, ultimately leading to the founding of the Spanish legal system alongside those of many other European countries – on this very same, original Justinian Roman Law. This work, after analysing the peculiarities and vicissitudes of Spanish codification – clarifies didactically the great influence of Roman law in the Spanish Civil Code, the influence of which can be perceived both in its formal structure and content. The formal structure and lay-out of the Civil Code were inspired by the Institutes of Gaius- its contents are especially indebted to original Roman law in areas of: guardianship, curatorship; property classification, possession, methods of ownership acquisition, servitudes, usufruct and other personal servitudes, hypothec, concepts of inheritance and will testaments, legacies and forms of legacy, intestacy; concept and source of obligation, fault liability, theory of contract, contract types, <b>quasi-contracts</b> and extra-contractual liability...|$|R
5000|$|Athanassios Nicholas [...] "Thanassi" [...] Yiannopoulos (March 13, 1928, in Thessaloniki, Greece - February 1, 2017, in New Orleans, Louisiana) [...] was a {{professor}} at Tulane University Law School, expert on civil law and comparative law, {{and founder of the}} Civil Law Commentaries. He acquired his law degree at the Law School of the Aristotle University and continued his graduate studies at the University of Chicago, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Cologne. Yiannopoulos was an internationally renowned scholar of civil law, comparative law, and maritime law. From 1958 to 1979, Yiannopoulos served on the faculty of Louisiana State University's Paul M. Hebert Law Center. He joined the faculty of Tulane University Law School in 1979. Yiannopoulos {{was in charge of the}} revision of the Louisiana Civil Code as reporter for the Louisiana State Law Institute and was the editor of West’s Pamphlet Edition of the Louisiana Civil Code since 1980. He also authored three volumes of the Louisiana Civil Law Treatise series, now in the fourth edition. Yiannopoulos published widely in the fields of civil law, comparative law, conflict of laws, and admiralty. He directed the Tulane University Law School's summer programs in Greece since 1980. At the time of his death, he was revising portions of the civil code, collecting materials for an admiralty textbook, and working on the next edition of his property treatise. His revision of the Civil Code provisions on <b>quasi-contracts</b> became law in 1996, on representation and mandate in 1998, on deposit and sequestration in 2003, and on loan in 2004. Yiannopoulos was a member of the International Academy of Comparative Law (The Hague) and of the American Law Institute. He retired from the full-time faculty at the end of the 2007-2008 academic year but continued to teach one course each year in his area of expertise. He published widely in the fields of admiralty, property, and conflict of laws.|$|R

50|$|Another {{exception}} to this rule, in certain jurisdictions, is {{the existence of a}} <b>quasi-contract.</b> In general, in order for a contract to exist, there must be mutual consent among all parties. In the case of an officious intermeddler, this element of a contract is missing: consideration (goods or services) was provided by one party, but without the mutual consent of the receiving party. Therefore, no contract was made, and the intermeddler has no legal recourse to claim compensation. However, certain legal jurisdictions provide for an implied-by-law contract, called a <b>quasi-contract,</b> that exists solely for the purposes of remedying this unjust enrichment by giving a court legal means to enforce compensation. The distinction between an officious intermeddler, and a party operating under a <b>quasi-contract,</b> is that the recipient of the goods or services has knowingly accepted the goods or services, with the intention of benefiting from them without providing compensation.|$|E
50|$|However, {{even if a}} court decides {{there is}} no contract, {{there might be a}} {{possible}} recovery under the doctrines of quantum meruit (sometimes referred to as a <b>quasi-contract)</b> or promissory estoppel.|$|E

5000|$|If the {{contract}} was partially performed, and the performance was held to be insufficient to bring the doctrine of estoppel into play, a suit for <b>quasi-contract</b> for recovery of benefits conferred was available.|$|E

5000|$|The {{origins of}} the phrase comes from the Latin {{language}} word, quasi, meaning somewhat, sort-of, alike or akin, to criminal law, as in <b>Quasi-contract.</b> [...] Quasi is used [...] "to indicate that one subject resembles another, with which it is compared, in certain characteristics, but there are intrinsic and material differences between them".|$|E
