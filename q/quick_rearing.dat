Starnes entered the ring to the children's song [...] "Do you know the Muffin Man", a song picked by Starnes' daughter. The fight did not last long, Starnes dominated Hicks in the first round with a <b>quick</b> submission (<b>rear</b> naked choke) victory.|$|R
50|$|Sprint cars use <b>quick</b> change <b>rear</b> ends. This {{allows the}} teams to quickly change the gear ratio for {{different}} size tracks. Most cars use a torsion bar suspension system. Different size bars either soften or stiffen the suspension. Torsion bars, and specialty shock absorbers {{are the key}} ingredients in the handling of sprint cars. That coupled with the wings, tire stagger, light weight, and enormous horsepower make these cars {{one of the fastest}} race cars in the world using a horsepower-to-weight ratio. The monstrous power-to-weight ratios of Sprint Cars can exceed that of Formula 1 cars.|$|R
60|$|But {{quickly as}} he came, the long, thin, sinuous thing beneath came <b>quicker.</b> It <b>reared</b> itself on its hind legs, it {{stretched}} up a great paw--I can see the gleaming claws in it now--and struck or hooked at poor Joshua. The paw caught him in the small of the back, and seemed to pin him against the ladder. Then it was drawn slowly downward, and heaven! how Joshua howled. Up came the other paw to repeat the operation, when, stretching myself outward and downward, with an Abati holding me by the ankles, I managed to shoot the beast through the head so that it fell all of a heap, taking with it {{a large portion of}} Joshua's nether garments.|$|R
5000|$|Development rate is not {{affected}} by humidity but is affected by heat source.C. brunneus reared with a radiant heat source take six to seven weeks less to reach their adult instar than those that are not. Development is also <b>quicker</b> in nymphs <b>reared</b> in low-density populations.Males and females weigh the same until the third instar where females outweigh the males. Females take a longer time to develop as they have longer instars than males. However, males develop more uniformly and live longer than females.In England, northern populations of C. brunneus [...] have faster development and shorter growth periods compared to southern populations.|$|R
5000|$|Sprint {{cars have}} very high power-to-weight ratios, with weights of {{approximately}} 1400 lb (including the driver) for 410 sprint cars, power outputs of over [...] are commonplace for these machines, which are around 140-340 more horsepower than [...] Formula One engines. Typically they are {{powered by a}} naturally aspirated, mechanically fuel injected (methanol) American V8 with an engine displacement of 410 cubic inches (6.7L) capable of engine speeds of 9000 rpm. Depending on the mechanical setup (engine, gearing, shocks, etc.) and the track layout these cars achieve speeds in excess of 160 mph. A lower budget and very popular class of sprint cars uses 360 cubic inch (5.9L) engines that produce approximately [...] Sprint cars do not utilize a transmission, they have an in or out gear box and <b>quick</b> change <b>rear</b> differentials for occasional gearing changes. As a result, {{they do not have}} electric starters (or even electrical systems other than magneto / ignition) and require a push to start them. The safety record of sprint car racing {{in recent years has been}} greatly improved by the use of roll cages, and especially on dirt tracks, wings, to protect the drivers.|$|R

The villains {{certainly}} {{made no attempt}} to escape, and in half a second the enraged household of the forest farmer would have seized on Essper George; but just at this crisis he uttered loud sounds in the respective language of every bird and beast about him, and suddenly they all turned round and counter-marched. Away rushed the terrified Adolph, the herdsman, while one of his own cows was on his back. Still quicker scampered off the scared Wilhelm, the ploughman, while one of his own steeds kicked him in his <b>rear.</b> <b>Quicker</b> than all these, shouting, screaming, shrieking, dashed back the unhappy mistress of the hen-roost, with all her subjects crowding about her; some on her elbow, some on her head, her lace cap destroyed, her whole dress disordered. The movements of the crowd were so quick that they were soon out of sight.|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{and colleagues}} (2003) used {{ultrasound}} imaging {{to show that}} the rear articulation of the alveolar clicks (...) in Nama is substantially different from that of palatal and dental clicks. Specifically, the shape of the body of the tongue in palatal clicks is very {{similar to that of the}} vowel , and involves the same tongue muscles, so that sequences such as [...] involved a simple and <b>quick</b> transition. The <b>rear</b> articulation of the alveolar clicks, however, is several centimetres further back, and involves a different set of muscles in the uvular region. The part of the tongue required to approach the palate for the vowel [...] is deeply retracted in , as it lies at the bottom of the air pocket used to create the vacuum required for click airstream. This makes the transition required for [...] much more complex and the timing more difficult than the shallower and more forward tongue position of the palatal clicks. Consequently, [...] takes 50 ms longer to pronounce than , the same amount of time required to pronounce [...]|$|R
30|$|Jaw {{malformation}} is a {{major concern}} in fish culture because it affects fish morphology and quality at the growout stage (Von Westernhagen 1988). In the present study, the proportion of fish larvae exhibiting jaw deformities increased with the increase of water temperature, and peaked at 33  °C. Similar results have also been found in other fish species such as Atlantic halibut Hippoglossus hippoglossus (Lein et al. 1997) and Pacific herring Clupea pallasi (Alderdice and Velsen 1971). Such a temperature-dependent developmental pattern is generally attributed to high oxygen (Rombough 1997) and high nutritional requirements at high temperatures, which may not be fulfilled unless the feed with high energy or protein contents is provided (Cahu et al. 2003 a, b; Ma 2014). Furthemore, temperature fluctuation might also interfere with the harmonic development of functional organs such as the digestive tract and skeleton, leading to skeletal deformities at high temperature. In the present study, fertilized fish eggs hatched at 26  °C, and yolk sac larvae were acclimatized at each desired temperature for 5  h on 2 DPH. The <b>quick</b> increase of <b>rearing</b> temperature from 26 to 29 or 33  °C may affect skeletogenesis and induce jaw deformity.|$|R
5000|$|Male {{swimmers}} wore full-body suits {{until the}} 1940s, which caused more drag {{in the water}} than their modern swimwear counterparts did. Competition suits now include engineered fabric and designs to reduce swimmers' drag {{in the water and}} prevent athlete fatigue. In addition, over the years, pool designs have lessened the drag. Some design considerations allow for the reduction of swimming resistance, making the pool faster. Namely, proper pool depth, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic, and illumination designs. There have been major changes in starting blocks over the past years. Starting blocks used to be small, narrow and straight [...] but throughout time they have become bigger and wider and nowadays the surface of the block is angled towards the swimming pool. [...] In addition, starting blocks now have a [...] "wedge" [...] which is a raised, slanting platform situated {{at the rear of the}} main block. This enables the swimmer to adopt a crouched position at a 90 degrees angle and push off <b>quicker</b> with the <b>rear</b> leg to increase their launch power.|$|R
40|$|A mildly jingoistic satire voicing American {{suspicions of}} foreign designs on California after the {{discovery}} of gold there in 1848. The bay and coastline of San Francisco are shown, menaced by foreign invaders who appear offshore. Closest is Queen Victoria of England, who rides a bull and carries a spade. She sings (to the tune of "Oh, Suzannah!& 1), "Oh, "Dear Albert" [i. e., Prince Albert, her husband] dont' you cry for me, / I'm 'off' for California with my shovel on my knee. " Next follows Czar Nicholas I of Russia, as a bear, who recites, "As something is "Bruin" I'll put in my "paw /" While the Nations around me are making a "Jaw. "" Overhead flies a cock {{with the head of}} Louis-Napoleon, president of France. He calls: "As "you "have "Gold" for all Creation / 'Den please give some to "La Grand Nation" / I've just become "de President" / And back I "shall" not like to "went. " Louis Napoleon was elected in December 1848. Farther up the coast, Spain's Queen Isabella II wades neck-deep in water toward shore. A squadron of American cutters sails into the harbor behind her, evidently bent on its defense. On land is an encampment of American troops with two rows of tents. A sentry, watching over casks and crates of gold, warns, "Keep out of "these Dig& 1 gins. " The precious stores surround a flagpole with a large American flag. To the left of the encampment is a row of cannon over which Gen. Zachary Taylor, as an eagle, watches. Taylor threatens, "Retreat you poor D [...] -ls! nor a squabble engender. For our Gold unto you we will "never surrender. Right about face!" Double <b>quick</b> to the <b>rear!</b> And back to your keepers all hands of you steer. " On a rocky outcropping or jetty at lower left is President James K. Polk, as a snake. He also warns (somewhat more meekly than Taylor) : "I pray thee tread not on our corns, /But slope "Dear Vic;" haul in your "horns" / And tell the Powers that lag behind, / Seek other lands "thier Gold to find"; / Or by the "Lord" we'll make a rattle, / To take good care of all such "Cattle. Polk's role of authority here suggests that the print dates from his administration, which ended with the inauguration of Zachary Taylor on March 5, 1849. It could not have appeared earlier, however, than December 1848, when French President Louis Napoleon (a prominent figure here) was elected. The California Gold Rush began in the summer of 1848.
