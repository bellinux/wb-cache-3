The article draws on empirical evidence from quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>analyse</b> of texts and pays attention to some of the actual cases in spatial planning that show hidden contents, explicit and implicit ideological constructions, particularisms of interest groups and strategies of instrumental marketing campaigns...|$|R

50|$|Numerous {{attempts}} have been made to divide the Oecophorinae into tribes, such as Carcinini, Crossotocerini, Denisiini, Herrichini, Oecophorini, Peleopodini and Pleurotini. Also placed here under this scheme are the Cacochroini and Orophiini, which otherwise were included in the Depressariinae (but usually only when these were elevated to full family rank). Most of the proposed tribes were based on phenetic or <b>qualitative</b> <b>analyses,</b> if not merely on the whim of the entomologists that established them, and no robust evolutionary scenario has been established for the different lineages of Oecophorinae. The groups around the genus Peleopoda (the former Peleopodinae) and of course the type genus Oecophora are generally recognized to be well distinguished from each other, but no satisfying arrangement has been found for the bulk of the (presumed) oecophorine genera. Hence, no subdivision into tribes is attempted here.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Novice {{researchers}} experience {{difficulties in}} <b>analysing</b> <b>qualitative</b> data. To develop {{the skills necessary}} for qualitative data analysis, theoretical manuals are often insufficient. Supervisors supporting students in <b>analysing</b> <b>qualitative</b> data stress the need for practical guidance, including exercises and feedback. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present and discuss QualiBuddy, an interactive online support tool in answer to this need. Design / methodology / approach: An online support tool was developed in answer to existing problems regarding <b>analysing</b> <b>qualitative</b> data. The tool provides a learning trajectory of eleven stages of analysis, which all contain examples, exercises, feedback, verification questions and questions for reflection. This tool is developed from a multidisciplinary perspective and is constructed around various steps. During the development process, internal feedback from the members of the project team, as well as external feedback from an international steering group with experts in qualitative research were taken into account. Findings: The tool QualiBuddy is based on an empirically and theoretically grounded approach to <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analyses.</b> Pilot tests with experienced qualitative researchers suggest that the tool potentially allows novice researchers from various domains to develop and improve their skills in conceptualising interview data, specifically within a Grounded Theory approach. Originality / value: QualiBuddy is a newly developed interactive online education tool based on and complementary to existing guides for qualitative data analysis. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Arthur J. Ray {{permanently}} {{changed the}} direction of economic studies of the fur trade with two influential works that presented a modified formalist position in between the extremes of Innis and Rotstein. “This trading system,” Ray explained, “is impossible to label neatly as ‘gift trade', or ‘administered trade', or ‘market trade', since it embodies elements of all these forms.” Indians engaged in trade {{for a variety of}} reasons. Reducing them to simple economic or cultural dichotomies, as the formalists and substantivists had done, was a fruitless simplification that obscured more than it revealed. Moreover, Ray used trade accounts and account books in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s archives for masterful <b>qualitative</b> <b>analyses</b> and pushed the boundaries of the field’s methodology. Following Ray’s position, Bruce M. White also helped to create a more nuanced picture of the complex ways in which native populations fit new economic relationships into existing cultural patterns.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the {{increasing}} ubiquity of computers aided in <b>qualitative</b> <b>analyses,</b> several journals with a qualitative focus emerged, and postpositivism gained {{recognition in the}} academy. In the late 1980s, questions of identity emerged, including issues of race, class, gender, and discourse communities, leading to research and writing becoming more reflexive. Throughout the 1990s, {{the concept of a}} passive observer/researcher was rejected, and qualitative research became more participatory and activist-oriented with support from the federal branches, such as the National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation (NIDRR) of the US Department of Education (e.g., Rehabilitation Research and Training Centers for Family and Community Living, 1990). Also, during this time, researchers began to use mixed-method approaches, indicating a shift in thinking of qualitative and quantitative methods as intrinsically incompatible. However, this history is not apolitical, as this has ushered in a politics of [...] "evidence" [...] (e.g., evidence-based practices in health and human services) and what can count as [...] "scientific" [...] research in scholarship, a current, ongoing debate in the academy.|$|E
5000|$|After {{subjects}} were identified, both quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>analyses</b> {{of the three}} samples were conducted, and graphic representations of the data were constructed and marked for relevant traits.

The second question was seen as especially appropriate for and [...] "ascending" [...] sampling strategy because it cannot be assumed that each snowball is drawn from the same population when only an [...] "imperfect sampling frame" [...] composed of a [...] "special list" [...] compiled by nominees, is available. Because it has been seen as especially appropriate for small samples (as little as three cases) for which population parameters are unknown and cannot be confidently assumed, the nonparametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test was used.
