50|$|Quenching: A paste {{is applied}} to the blade using water, charcoal, clay, ground natural {{sharpening}} stone, and other ingredients in a proprietary way and composition. This thicker paste goes on the blade spine on both sides and traditionally mimics the wavy hamon of nihonto. A thinner slip goes on the hard edge to help heat transfer there. It then must dry in air or over heat. The <b>quench</b> <b>water</b> or oil is prepared and brought to the right temperature. The forge is heated. Lights are turned off and the room shut from the outside. Once ready, the blade is buried and shuffled around in the charcoal and when it reaches the correct temperature it is thrust into water and moved forward and back (so as to prevent lateral distortion) and then after a couple seconds side to side. The knife could also be brought up slightly above temperature and then held in the room to the correct temperature before quench. The quench could be interrupted toward the end for more rough grinding or to correct distortion. The blade is tempered either immediately over fire, or in oil, or in an oven. The water quench regularly destroys many blades by cracking them or warping them too badly to reasonably sell.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} aims {{to study}} the effect of <b>quenching</b> media (<b>water,</b> oil, Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC) on mechanical properties of 1030 steel. The applications of this steel include machinery parts where strength and hardness are requisites. The steel is heated to about 950  and soaked for 1 hr in electrical furnace and then quenched in different quenching medium such as water, oil and poly vinyl chloride. After heat treatment by quenching, the specimens are tempered at 250  for 1 hr and then cooling in air. The mechanical properties of the specimens are determined by using universal tensile testing machine for tensile test, Vickers hardness apparatus for hardness testing, measuring the grain size of the phases and examine the microstructure of the specimens before and after heat-treatment. The results of this work showed that improving the mechanical properties of medium carbon 1030 steel, which is <b>quenching</b> by <b>water</b> gives the preferred results as the following: <b>Quenching</b> by <b>water</b> leads to increase σy, σu. t. s, K and hardness, {{but at the same}} time <b>quenching</b> by <b>water</b> leads to decrease E and n.

We also showed that the structure quenched from 370 K evolves to the ice faster than 300 K case.

40|$|With water {{critical}} to many industrial operations, the use, reuse {{and treatment of}} the water and wastewater streams throughout a plant can be a large piece of the ongoing operations and maintenance budget.

By systematically evaluating where water is used, how it gets there, how it is collected, and what water quality is necessary at each process, a working understanding of how best to manage water throughout the plant is produced. A thorough water balance across each process can identify inefficiencies in water use or distribution and in wastewater collection and treatment.

30|$|Two common {{methods can}} be used to {{mitigate}} red-oil from formation and accumulation: (1) carbonyl traps to reduce the rate of aldol formation [2]; and (2) aromatic solvent washes [1, 4]. Carbonyl traps are often effective in reducing the rate of aldol condensation and in removing aldols through the caustic purges, but they do not suppress the Diels–Alder type oligomerization mechanism. Additional use of dispersants on top of the carbonyl trapping agent (and even a radical scavenger) are thus often proposed by chemical vendors to cover all possible mechanisms, leading to costly treatments [9]. Within our company, the “aromatic solvent washes” option proved to be a very efficient and cheap alternative and was achieved by rerouting a plant stream containing high amounts of aromatic compounds with low unsaturated hydrocarbons content (e.g., a Toluene–Xylene cut: “TX-cut”). This aromatic wash acts as a solvent, which efficiently displaces the oligomeric red-oils from the water phase into the aromatic phase avoiding their further oligomerization and precipitation. Since aromatic solvents are often of commercial value in the industry, a cheaper gasoline stream, i.e. pyrolysis gasoline (PyGas) from the <b>quench</b> <b>water</b> tower (QWT) of the plant, was used instead. This stream contains a high amount of reactive compounds (about of 7  % of indene, styrene, cyclopentadiene,…), which might have the potential of enhancing the mass of red-oil type of fouling through pathways A or C shown in Fig.  1.|$|E
30|$|In most {{ethylene}} plants, the caustic sections {{suffer from}} red-oils formation which {{results from the}} polyaldol condensation of some oxygenate species in basic media. These red-oils lead to solid material deposition which is generically referred to as fouling and which can cause severe energy losses or operational issues. This specific red-oil fouling can be successfully mitigated by regularly washing the caustic scrubber with a hydrocarbon washing stream which acts as a solvent. However, such washing streams can be further rerouted to the <b>quench</b> <b>water</b> system, increasing the risk of emulsion formation due to its amphiphilic components, i.e., red-oils, compromising the safe operation of the whole plant. The complexity of red-oil structures renders its analysis and characterization challenging. Consequently, {{there has been no}} study showing the effect of the type of hydrocarbon wash on the red-oils structure and its potential emulsifying properties. This study describes an in-house developed analytical technique based on UPLC-High resolution QTOF which allows characterizing hydrocarbon streams with complex mixtures of oxygenated species. This method has been successfully applied to monitor red-oil structures during a plant trial where Pyrolysis Gasoline and Toluene-Xylene hydrocarbon washes were successively applied. The data revealed that reactive compounds from the Pyrolysis Gasoline react with the polyaldol species, likely through a Diels–Alder mechanism, thus increasing the diene adduct concentration in the red-oil. It was further found that toluene-xylene washes hindered the emulsifying properties of the red-oils more effectively than Pyrolysis Gasoline washes, in that they could best inhibit the formation of polyaldols adducts.|$|E

Volatile organics were not detectable by gas chromatography and further analysis by mass spectrometer was not performed.
