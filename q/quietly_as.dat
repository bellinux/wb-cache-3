5|$|The Doctor {{discovers that}} the volcano {{is being used}} by the Pyroviles to convert the human race and conquer Earth. The Doctor realises the volcano will not erupt if the energy {{converter}} is running, and tells Donna that the volcanic eruption is a fixed point in time and must always happen. The Doctor and Donna get into an escape pod and together press a lever which overloads the converter and triggers the eruption, killing the Pyroviles and launching the pod clear of the blast. The Doctor and Donna run for the TARDIS and the Doctor coldly leaves Caecilius and his family cowering in their home using the TARDIS in order to not interfere too deeply with history. However, Donna tearfully begs him to go back and at least save one person, regardless of who it is. The Doctor finally relents and goes back for Caecilius and his family. He leaves them on a hill overlooking the destruction, and together with Donna slips out <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> the family mourns Pompeii. The Doctor comments to Donna that she was right - he does need someone to stop him.|$|E

Gandalf said he would attempt to return for Frodo's 50th birthday party, in order to accompany him on the road thereafter; and that meanwhile Frodo should arrange to leave <b>quietly,</b> <b>as</b> the servants of Sauron would be searching for him.|$|E

25|$|The {{importance}} of the New Madrid Bend rose dramatically when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862. Columbus was cut off from rest of the Confederate Army, and faced capture by Union troops advancing overland from the Tennessee River to the Mississippi. To avoid losing the garrison and its equipment, General Beauregard ordered that the position be abandoned as <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> possible. The process began on February 24, when the first members of the Columbus garrison arrived at Island No. 10. Two days later, its new commander, Brig. Gen. John P.

25|$|The {{terms of}} the {{settlement}} stripped Wichaichan of all of his powers, {{he was able to}} keep only 200 guards of small weaponry, he was also forced to abdicate his title of Vice King. Despite this he was able to remain Front Palace and keep his residence. Chulalongkorn also promised to take responsibility for his finances and safety. He lived {{the rest of his life}} <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> an educated gentleman, being consigned to his palace. The role and influence of the Front Palace and the nobility was greatly diminished and Chulalongkorn was able to continue his reforms in peace without opposition. In 1881 Wichaichan met King Kalākaua of the Hawaiian Islands, who made a stop in Siam on his world tour. The King noted that Wichaichan was well educated and spoke English fluently.|$|E
25|$|He was {{ten years}} old when his {{grandfather}} died and his mother ascended to the throne. His childhood and youth were lived <b>quietly,</b> <b>as</b> he was a mere infante in the shadow of his elder brother José, Prince of Brazil and 14th Duke of Braganza, the heir-apparent to the throne. Folklore has John as a rather uncultured youth, but according to Jorge Pedreira e Costa, he received as rigorous an education as José did. Still, a French ambassador of the time painted him in unfavorable colors, seeing him as hesitant and dim. The record of this period of his life is too vague for historians to form any definitive picture. Little is known of the substance of his education. He surely received instruction in religion, law, French, and etiquette, and would presumably have learned history through reading the works of Duarte Nunes de Leão and João de Barros.|$|E

25|$|Dismuke's battery {{probably}} {{first became}} associated with heavy artillery at Columbus, Kentucky {{in the winter}} of 1862. While initially serving as the first major Confederate bastion on the Mississippi River, Columbus became untendable when Fort Henry and then Fort Donelson fell to Union forces in early February 1862.

By the middle of March, five batteries containing 24 guns had been built on the shore above the island; 19 guns were in five batteries on the island itself; and the floating battery New Orleans, with nine guns, was moored at the west end of the island. McCown was eventually replaced in command at the island by Brig. Gen. William W. Mackall.|$|E

Clement Hawes, {{following}} Michel Foucault's interpretation of the 18th century that there was an animality' of madness", believed that Smart emotionally connected with animals because of the [...] "medical stigmatization" [...] he felt at the hands of his fellow man. Chris Mounsey, agreeing with Hawes's interpretation, believed that Smart's treatment was [...] "a bestializing process and had taught him to hold his tongue and sit out his time as <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> possible." [...] Contrary to the bestialisation, Allan Ingram argued that Jubilate Agno was [...] "a poetic phenomenon that would have demolished contemporary poetic orthodoxies had it been publishable. The mad individual presented a gross distortion of the human form that nevertheless insisted on remaining human, but mad language could be even more disturbing." ...|$|E

The best thing about [...] isn’t any {{individual}} story. It’s how deftly the show juggles so many stories without losing track of any." [...] He felt the character of Maria was [...] "cartoonishly one note ... it’s heartbreaking to watch Yo-Yo stand <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> her friends unknowingly denounce her", and compared the use of Yo-Yo's powers to [...] "a small-screen version of that great Quicksilver scene from ... it’s still pretty cool". Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B+', feeling the action-heavy episode was a strong follow up to the more dialogue-focused [...] "Meet the New Boss", and praising Martens direction and the episode's fight choreography. He particularly highlighted the fight sequence where an EMP creates a strobe effect. Evan Valentine at Collider.com rated the episode a [...] "good" [...] 3 stars out of 5, calling it a solid episode and highlighting the chemistry between the series' cast and the episode's fight sequences and visual effects, which he felt were [...] "a nice and breezy combination of the show’s strengths".|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{is known}} for his {{economical}} film shoots; his regular camera operator, Steve Campanelli, indicated the rapid pace at which Eastwood films—and his intimate, near-wordless direction—also featured during Changelings shoot. Eastwood limited rehearsals and takes to garner more authentic performances. Jolie said, [...] "You've got to get your stuff together and get ready because he doesn't linger... He expects people to come prepared and get on with their work." [...] Campanelli sometimes had to tell Jolie what Eastwood wanted from a scene, as Eastwood talked too softly. To provide verisimilitude to certain scenes, Eastwood sometimes asked Jolie to play them <b>quietly,</b> <b>as</b> if just for him. At the same time he would ask his camera operator to start filming discreetly, without Jolie's seeing it. Malkovich noted Eastwood's direction as [...] "redefining economical", saying Eastwood was quiet and did not use the phrases [...] "action" [...] and [...] "cut". He said, [...] "Some —like Clint Eastwood or Woody Allen—don't really like to be tortured by a million questions. They hire you, and they figure you know what to do, and you should do it... And that's fine by me." [...] Ryan also noted the calmness of the set, observing that her experiences working with director Sidney Lumet on 100Centre Street and Before the Devil Knows You're Dead were useful due to his sharing Eastwood's preference for filming a small number of takes. Donovan said Eastwood seldom gave him direction other than to [...] "go ahead", and that Eastwood did not even comment on his decision to play Jones with a slight Irish accent: [...] "Actors are insecure and they want praise, but he's not there to praise you or make you feel better... All he's there to do is tell the story, and he hired actors to tell their story." [...] Gaffer Ross Dunkerley said he often had to work on a scene without having seen a rehearsal: [...] "Chances are we'll talk about it for a minute or two, and then we're executing it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{poliomyelitis}} (polio) infections extends into prehistory. Although major polio epidemics were unknown before the 20th century, {{the disease has}} caused paralysis and death for much of human history. [...] Over millennia, polio survived <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> an endemic pathogen until the 1900s when major epidemics began to occur in Europe; soon after, widespread epidemics appeared in the United States. By 1910, frequent epidemics became regular events throughout the developed world, primarily in cities during the summer months. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio would paralyze or kill over {{half a million people}} worldwide every year.|$|E
2500|$|In Monty Python, Palin played various roles, which {{ranged from}} manic enthusiasm (such as the {{lumberjack}} of the Lumberjack Song, or Herbert Anchovy, {{host of the}} game show [...] "Blackmail") to unflappable calmness (such as the Dead parrot vendor, Cheese Shop proprietor, or Postal Clerk). As a straight man he was often a foil to the rising ire of characters portrayed by John Cleese. He also played timid, socially inept characters such as Arthur Putey, the man who sits <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> a marriage counsellor (Eric Idle) makes love to his wife (Carol Cleveland), and Mr. Anchovy, a chartered accountant who {{wants to become a}} lion tamer. He also appeared as the [...] "It's" [...] man at the beginning of most episodes.|$|E
2500|$|On June 9, 1953, Hunt's 24-year-old son Lester Jr., {{known as}} [...] "Buddy", {{who was a}} student and {{president}} of the student body at the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was arrested in Washington, D.C., for soliciting prostitution from a male undercover police officer in Lafayette Square, just north of and adjacent to the White House property. It was his first offense, which police normally handled <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> a matter for the offender's family to address, but the arrest became known to Senate Republicans. [...] According to Drew Pearson's Washington Merry-Go-Round column published after Hunt's death, Senators Styles Bridges and Herman Welker threatened that if Hunt did not immediately retire from the Senate and agree not to seek his seat in the 1954 election, they would see that his son was prosecuted and would widely publicize his son's arrest.|$|E

2500|$|The Teen Kings went to Sun Studio in Memphis, where Phillips {{wanted to}} record [...] "Ooby Dooby" [...] again, in his {{superior}} studio. Orbison had grown {{weary of the}} song and rankled <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> Phillips dictated what the band would play {{and how he was}} to sing it. With Phillips's production, however, the record broke into the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 59 and selling 200,000 copies. The Teen Kings toured with Sonny James, Johnny Horton, Carl Perkins, and Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing [...] "everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record". The Teen Kings also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including [...] "Go! Go! Go!" [...] and [...] "Rockhouse". The band ultimately split over disputed writing credits and royalties, but Orbison stayed in Memphis and asked his 16-year-old girlfriend, Claudette Frady, to join him there. They stayed in Phillips's home, sleeping in separate rooms. In the studio, Orbison concentrated on the mechanics of recording. Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison's mastery of the guitar than with his voice. A ballad Orbison wrote—"The Clown"—met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer Jack Clement told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer.|$|E
2500|$|Macmillan {{intended}} {{to carry out}} the reshuffle in autumn 1962 after parliament returned from its summer recess. Events overtook him when, on 11 July, Butler lunched with Lord Rothermere, proprietor of several newspapers, including the Daily Mail. Butler let slip the details of the impending reshuffle, and the following day the Daily Mail broke the plans to the public with the headline [...] "Mac's Master Plan". A horrified Macmillan, suspecting that the plans were deliberately leaked by Butler to further his political career, felt compelled to act. He summoned Lloyd to a meeting that evening and informed him that he was to be replaced as Chancellor. He attempted to mollify Lloyd by suggesting that he consider a career in the city as chairman of Martins Bank, and hinted at the possibility of a peerage. Lloyd refused both. The remaining six officeholders were informed the following day, 13 July. [...] Mills, Maclay and Watkinson were reported to have gone <b>quietly,</b> <b>as</b> did Hill, though he expressed his disapproval on the way the reshuffle was handled. Eccles and Kilmuir were the most disappointed, Eccles having hoped to succeed as Chancellor, and Kilmuir later writing that Macmillan appeared to have lost his 'nerve and judgement'. The reshuffle was completed three days later with the removal of nine junior ministers.|$|E
2500|$|The Vietnam War {{provided}} the next significant {{test for the}} Air National Guard. However, for largely domestic political reasons, President Lyndon B. Johnson chose not to mobilize most of the nation's reserve forces before 1968. [...] His reasons for not mobilizing reserve forces were many. Primarily, {{he did not believe}} that the war in Vietnam justified the dramatic act of mobilizing Reserve and National Guard forces. [...] He accepted the need to fight the war, but he wanted to prosecute it as <b>quietly</b> <b>as</b> possible, not attracting too much attention at home and risk jeopardizing his domestic programs. He also wanted to avoid drawing the Communist Chinese into the war or the attention of the Soviet Union, the latter which might view the mobilization of Reserve and National Guard units as [...] "escalatory" [...] within a larger Cold War context. [...] Moreover, recalling Reservists' complaints of inactivity following the Berlin mobilization of 1961, he was also reluctant to recall Reservists and National Guardsmen without the assurance that their employment would significantly affect the course of the war, an assurance no official in his administration could provide. [...] As a result, even though still populated by many World War II and Korean War combat veterans, the Reserves and the National Guard acquired ill-deserved reputations during this period as havens for relatively affluent, young white men with no prior active duty military service to serve as officers or enlisted personnel as a means to avoid the draft into the active duty U.S. Army in an enlisted status.|$|E
