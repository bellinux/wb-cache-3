The original <b>quadratic</b> <b>program</b> is proposed by Nair and Chandrasekaran in 1971. Besides, they proposed a geometric approach for problem solving. Then, they concluded that the geometric approach is more efficient than the <b>quadratic</b> <b>program.</b> This conclusion is true only when all decision variables are treated as nonnegative variables. To improve the <b>quadratic</b> <b>program,</b> one of those variables should be an unrestricted variable as it is presented here.

25|$|In {{industrial}} statistics, simplices {{arise in}} problem formulation and in algorithmic solution. In {{the design of}} bread, the producer must combine yeast, flour, water, sugar, etc. In such mixtures, only the relative proportions of ingredients matters: For an optimal bread mixture, if the flour is doubled then the yeast should be doubled. Such mixture problem are often formulated with normalized constraints, so that the nonnegative components sum to one, {{in which case the}} feasible region forms a simplex. The quality of the bread mixtures can be estimated using response surface methodology, and then a local maximum can be computed using a nonlinear programming method, such as sequential <b>quadratic</b> <b>programming.</b>|$|E
25|$|To conclude, the non-smooth {{approach}} {{changes the}} underlying mathematical structure if required {{and leads to}} a proper description of mechanical systems with unilateral contacts and friction. As {{a consequence of the}} changing mathematical structure, impacts can occur, and the time evolutions of the positions and the velocities can not be assumed to be smooth anymore. As a consequence, additional impact equations and impact laws have to be defined. In order to handle the changing mathematical structure, the set-valued force laws are commonly written as inequality or inclusion problems. The evaluation of these inequalities/inclusions is commonly done by solving linear (or nonlinear) complementarity problems, by <b>quadratic</b> <b>programming</b> or by transforming the inequality/inclusion problems into projective equations which can be solved iteratively by Jacobi or Gauss–Seidel techniques.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} exact {{solution}} of general integer <b>quadratic</b> <b>programs</b> with linear constraints. These programs constitute {{a particular case}} of mixed-integer <b>quadratic</b> <b>programs</b> for which we introduce in [3] a general solution method based on quadratic convex reformulation, that we called MIQCR. This reformulation consists in designing an equivalent <b>quadratic</b> <b>program</b> with a convex objective function. The problem reformulated by MIQCR has a relatively important size that penalizes its solution time. In this paper, we propose a convex reformulation less general than MIQCR because it {{is limited to the}} general integer case, but that has a significantly smaller size. We call this approach Compact Quadratic Convex Reformulation (CQCR). We evaluate CQCR from the computational point of view. We perform our experiments on instances of general integer <b>quadratic</b> <b>programs</b> with one equality constraint. We show that CQCR is much faster than MIQCR and than the general non-linear solver BARON [25] to solve these instances.

30|$|Nonconvex <b>quadratic</b> <b>program</b> with <b>quadratic</b> {{constraints}} {{is worthy}} of study.

On the other hand, it is since a large number of nonlinear programming problems can be converted into this mathematical modeling, and the solutions of many nonlinear optimization problems can be approximated or obtained by solving a sequence of nonconvex <b>quadratic</b> <b>programs</b> with <b>quadratic</b> constraints. Moreover, from research point of view, since the nonconvex <b>quadratic</b> <b>programs</b> with <b>quadratic</b> constraints possess multiple local minimum points which are not globally minimum point, they exist significant computational and theoretical challenges. Therefore, it is necessary to put forward a new global optimization approach for solving the nonconvex <b>quadratic</b> <b>program</b> with <b>quadratic</b> constraints.|$|R
