40|$|The {{qualification}} of NDE techniques {{is currently}} an expensive and time-consuming process which severely hinders their introduction into service [1]. This is {{primarily due to}} the nature of current <b>qualification</b> <b>methodologies</b> which rely upon trials using manufactured or in- service sample defects to demonstrate a sufficient probability of detection (POD) [2]. This process could be significantly improved through the use of experimentally-validated numerical models of inspections which would be able to achieve the same result at a fraction of the cost and time whilst being able to simulate realistic defects. In this work we demonstrate how it is possible to greatly reduce the number of simulations required through sampling and interpolating over the parameter space of possible variations. The result of this process, when combined with the associated probabilities of variations occurring, allows the reliability of an inspection to be quantified. This process yields a wealth of information beyond just a POD curve, allowing inspection methodologies to be optimized during this process as well as demonstrating reliability through a range of metrics including probability of false alarm and the generation of receiver- operator characteristic curves.

40|$|Since the mid 1990 s, Model-Driven Design (MDD) methodologies have {{aimed at}} raising {{the level of}} {{abstraction}} through an extensive use of generic models in all the phases {{of the development of}} embedded systems. MDD describes the system under development in terms of abstract characterization, attempting to be generic not only in the choice of implementation platforms, but even in the choice of execution and interaction semantics. Thus, MDD has emerged as the most suitable solution to develop complex systems and has been supported by academic and industrial tools. The gain offered by the adoption of an MDD approach is the capability of generating the source code implementing the target design in a systematic way, i. e., it avoids the need of manual writing. However, even if MDD simplifies the design implementation it does not prevent the designers from wrongly defining the design behavior. Therefore, MDD gives full benefits if it also integrates functional verification. In this context, Assertion Based Verification (ABV) has {{emerged as one of the}} most powerful solutions for capturing a designer's intent and checking their compliance with the design implementation. In ABV, specifications are expressed by means of formal properties. These overcome the ambiguity of natural languages and are verified by means of either static (e. g., model checking) or, more frequently, dynamic (e. g., simulation) techniques. Therefore ABV provides a proof of correctness for the outcome of the MDD flow. Consequently, the MDD and ABV approaches have been combined to create efficient and effective design and verification frameworks that accompany designers and verification engineers throughout the system-level design flow of complex embedded systems, both for the Hardware (HW) and the Software (SW) parts. It is, indeed, worth noting that to achieve a high degree of confidence, such frameworks require to be supported by functional <b>qualification</b> <b>methodologies,</b> which evaluate the quality of both the properties and the testbenches which are adopted during the overall flow. In this context, the goal of the chapter consists of providing, first, a general introduction to MDD and ABV concepts and related formalisms, and then a more detailed view on the main challenges concerning the realization of an effective semiformal ABV environment through functional qualificatio...|$|R
