2500|$|The Husqvarna Model 40 or m/40 was {{manufactured}} 1940 to 1946 {{and was a}} Swedish copy of the Finnish Lahti pistol. The Swedish army {{realized there}} would be a shortage of pistols in the event of large scale military mobilization in Europe. Originally adopting the Walther P38 in 1939, Germany's entry into World War II stopped the export of P38s to Sweden. To compensate, Sweden adopted the Lahti pistol but was unable to import L-35-type guns because of Finland's conflicts with the USSR. Production was licensed to Svenska Automatvapen AB but the immediate collapse of the company passed the contract to Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. The first m/40s were delivered to the Swedish military by 1942 with slight differences from the Finnish L-35 Lahtis. The grips of the m/40 have the Husqvarna [...] "crown H" [...] motif engraved and the front sight was slightly larger. The barrel is also slightly longer on the m/40 than the Finnish Lahti with the m/40's trigger guard being heavier, and the pistol does not have the loaded chamber indicator and lock-retaining spring of the Finnish Lahti. Other modifications included a change in the gun steel <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> that were not successful in the m/40s and led to cracks in the frame. Cracking in the frame became more aggravated as the m/39B-ammunition developed for use in the Carl Gustav m/45 submachine gun were used in the pistols. The m/40 would eventually be taken out of service in the 1980s because of the frame cracks, being completely replaced by the Glock 17 by the early 1990s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an approach}} to minimize the number of process tooling adjustments and deliver an acceptable fraction of non-conforming products based on given product <b>quality</b> <b>specification</b> limits in assembly processes. A linear model is developed to describe the relationships between product quality and process tooling locating positions. Based on the model, the process mean shifts of tooling locating positions are estimated for both deterministic and stochastic cases by using the least-square estimation or linear mixed model estimation, respectively. A simultaneous confidence interval is obtained to construct the estimation region of a process mean shift under the given false alarm rate. Furthermore, a tooling adjustment strategy is proposed to determine when the process adjustment is essentially {{needed in order to}} ensure an acceptable fraction of non-conforming units based on the given product <b>quality</b> <b>specification</b> limits. Finally, a case study is conducted to illustrate the developed methodology by using a real-world autobody assembly process. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

This research proposes a novel two-stage optimization system for photolithography process integrating the Taguchi method, back-propagation neural networks, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and related technologies to effectively generate optimal process parameter settings. The first stage is to reduce the process variance. The second stage is to find the final optimal process parameter settings for the best <b>quality</b> <b>specification.</b> Experimental results show that the proposed system can create the best process parameters which not only meet the <b>quality</b> <b>specification</b> for the micro-dots on the photoresist, but also effectively enhance the overall process stability. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag London...|$|R
