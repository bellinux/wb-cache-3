40|$|This study {{sought to}} examine whether the {{administration}} of <b>quinfamide</b> at 3 - or 6 -month intervals diminished the frequency of Entamoeba histolytica cysts in stool samples compared to controls. The prospective, longitudinal, randomized, single-blind study examined children from six primary schools in Celaya and Neutla, Guanajuato. Of the 1, 524 students in these schools, we selected participants for the study as follows: Children {{were included in the}} study if their parents agreed in writing to the study and if the children demonstrated evidence of E. histolytica cysts after a parasitoscopic analysis by concentration (PSC) in three samples over consecutive days using Faust’s method. Those included in the study received a single 4. 3 -g/kg dose of <b>quinfamide,</b> and we performed PSC on days 5, 6, and 7 following dose administration to examine whether <b>quinfamide</b> had affected the presence of the cysts. The study participants who tested negative for cysts were divided into three groups: Group 1 had 102 patients who underwent <b>quinfamide</b> treatment and three CPS analyses after the 12 months of the study; Group 2 had 98 subjects who underwent the <b>quinfamide</b> treatment and three CPS analyses at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 after their entrance into the study; and Group 3 had 102 patients, who underwent the <b>quinfamide</b> treatment and series of three CPS analyses at months 6 and 12 of the study. All participants received the dose of <b>quinfamide</b> after providing stool samples and after a clinical gastrointestinal history was obtained. Further clinical gastrointestinal data were collected 5 days after the quintamide dose was administered. We used EpiInfo 6. 0 for statistical analysis, calculating X 2 and p values for the clinical data and the CPS data after the 12 months concluded. Of the initial samples of 1, 524 subjects, 308 (20. 2 %) had Entamoebic cysts. Of these, six were further eliminated because they did not meet the inclusion requirements. At the conclusion of the study, Group 1 presented with 37. 6 % of subjects still testing positive for cysts; of Group 2, 12. 5 % tested positive; and in Group 3, 23. 5 % of participants tested positive for cysts (X 2 = 16. 8; df = 2; p = 0. 0002). For comparisons of groups 1 and 2 and 1 and 3, p > 0. 05. We conclude that antiamoebic chemoprophylaxis can be a choice for control of amoebic infection where personal hygiene and food consumption habits are not improving...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} was carried out to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of nitazoxanide compared with that of <b>quinfamide,</b> mebendazole, or both in the treatment of intestinal protozoa and helminthic infections. A total of 677 stool specimens from children aged 2 – 12 years living in 3 communities of Colima, México, were analyzed in order to detect the presence of cysts, trophozoites, eggs, or larvae of intestinal protozoa or helminths. A total of 275 infected children were enlisted in a double-blind controlled study and randomly assigned to one of 2 treatment groups: Group A, nitazoxanide (200 mg for 3 days) and Group B, <b>quinfamide</b> (100 mg for 1 day), mebendazole (200 mg for 3 days), or both. A posttreatment fecal examination was conducted on Day 14 from treatment initiation. In Group A (n 143), the parasitosis eradication rate was superior to that of Group B (n 132). However, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P> 0. 05) ...|$|E
