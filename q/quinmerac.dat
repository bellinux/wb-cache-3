Realizaram-se três experimentos. No primeiro ensaio, utilizaram-se soluções aquosas de ácido giberélico (AG 3) 0; 15; 30; 45; 60; 75 e 90 mg. l- 1, aplicadas no florescimento e repetidas aos 14 dias após (E 1 E 2) e, no outro tratamento, o mesmo composto e doses aplicados uma única vez aos 14 dias após o florescimento (E 2); no segundo experimento, thidiazuron (TDZ) 0; 5; 10; 15; 20; 25 e 30 mg. l- 1, aplicados quatro dias antes da antese e repetidos aos seis dias após o florescimento (E 1 E 2); e no outro tratamento, o mesmo composto e doses aplicados uma única vez aos seis dias após o florescimento (E 2); e, no terceiro, <b>quinmerac</b> 0; 10; 20; 30; 40; 50 e 60 mg. l- 1, aplicados no florescimento e repetidos aos 14 dias após (E 1 E 2), e, no outro tratamento, o mesmo composto e doses aplicados uma única vez, 14 dias após o florescimento (E 2). As variáveis avaliadas foram: número e dimensões das células das bagas. Pelos resultados obtidos, verificou-se que duas aplicações de ácido giberélico, thidiazuron e <b>quinmerac</b> promoveram a divisão celular, enquanto a expansão celular foi observada com uma única aplicação de thidiazuron e <b>quinmerac.</b> The {{objective of}} this investigation was to evaluate the effect of the gibberellic acid, thidiazuron and <b>quinmerac</b> on grape berries anatomy of grapevine 'Niagara Rosada', in a vineyard located in Dourados - MS. Three trials were carried out. In the first trial, it was used gibberellic acid (AG 3) 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 mg. l- 1, applied in the bloom and repeated 14 days later (E 1 E 2) and in the other treatment, the same compound and doses applied only once, 14 days after the bloom (E 2); in the second experiment, thidiazuron (TDZ) 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mg. l- 1, applied four days before antesis and repeated six days after the bloom (E 1 E 2); and in the other treatment, the same compound and doses applied only once six days after the bloom (E 2); and in the third, <b>quinmerac</b> 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mg. l- 1, applied in the bloom and repeated 14 days after (E 1 E 2) and in the other treatment, the same compound and doses applied only once 14 days later the bloom (E 2). The plant regulators were applied through cluster dipping with surfactant Agral®, 1 % added to solutions. The variables evaluated were: berries cells number and dimensions. From the obtained results, it was observed that two applications of gibberellic acid, thidiazuron and <b>quinmerac</b> promoted the cellular division, while the cellular expansion was observed with only one application of thidiazuron and <b>quinmerac...</b>|$|E
40|$|La finalidad de este trabajo fue evaluar el efecto del <b>Quinmerac,</b> comparativamente con 2, 4 -D y nitrato de potasio, en la productividad de mandarino 'Clemenules' (Citrus reticulata Blanco), a través del incremento del porcentaje de frutos con mayor tamaño (destino a mercado fresco), y a la vez determinar posibles efectos indeseables sobre la calidad de los frutos y presencia de fitotoxicidad por dos años sucesivos de aplicaciones sobre las mismas plantas. Durante las campañas 1998 / 99 y 1999 / 00, se trabajó en dos lotes de mandarino 'Clemenules' de siete años de implantados, injertados sobre trifolio (Poncirus trifoliata Raf.) uno y sobre citrange 'Troyer' (P. trifoliata x Citrus sinensis Osbeck) el otro, en Mburucuyá, Corrientes, en un suelo Psammacuent típico. Los tratamientos utilizados fueron: testigo sin aplicación; <b>Quinmerac</b> (10 %), 10 mg. L- 1; <b>Quinmerac</b> (10 %), 15 mg. L- 1; 2, 4 -D (31 %), 20 mg. L- 1 (1998 / 99) y nitrato de potasio (14 %N, 39 % K), 2, 5 g. L- 1 (1999 / 2000). Los productos se asperjaron foliarmente, con volumen de solución de 2, 5 L. planta- 1. Quincenalmente se observaban las plantas en ensayo para detectar síntomas de fitotoxicidad. En la cosecha, se determinó la producción de frutos, clasificada en dos categorías por tamaño; la calidad externa por el aspecto de la corteza e interna mediante porcentaje de jugo, grados Brix, acidez y ratio. Los tratamientos con <b>Quinmerac</b> y nitrato de potasio incrementaron entre un 10 y un 15 % la proporción de frutos con tamaño adecuado para mercado fresco. No se detectaron efectos en la producción total, disminución de la calidad de los frutos, ni fitotoxicidad. The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>Quinmerac,</b> comparatively with 2, 4 -D and potassium nitrate, in the productivity of 'Clemenules' tangerines (Citrus reticulata Blanco), through the increase {{of the percentage of}} fruits with larger size for the fresh market, and also to determine possible undesirable effects on the fruits quality and presence of fitotoxicity by two successive years of applications on the same trees. During 1998 / 99 and 1999 / 00, the experiments were carried out in two plots of 'Clemenules' tangerines of seven years old of implanted, budded on trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata Raf.) one, and on the second one citrange 'Troyer' (P. trifoliata x Citrus sinensis Osbeck), in Mburucuyá, Corrientes, in a typical Psammacuent soil. The treatments used were: control without application; <b>Quinmerac</b> (10 %), 10 mg. L- 1; <b>Quinmerac</b> (10 %), 15 mg. L- 1; 2, 4 -D (31 %), 20 mg. L- 1 (1998 / 99) and potassium nitrate (14 %N, 39 % K), 2. 5 g. L- 1 (1999 / 2000). The products were sprayed on the trees, with a volume of 2. 5 L. tree- 1. Biweekly the plants were observed to detect fitotoxicity symptoms. At the harvest time, the yield was determined, and the fruits classified by size in two categories; the external rind quality by its aspect and the internal quality by the juice percentage, Brix degrees, acidity and ratio. The treatments with <b>Quinmerac</b> and potassium nitrate increased between 10 and 15 % the proportion of fruits with size adequate for fresh market. There were no effects on the total production, fruits quality, or fitotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Different cruciferous weeds were {{drilled in}} autumn 2011 and 2012 {{in a field}} near Münster. Beside common species like hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale Scop.), shepherd`s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), pennycress (Thlaspiarvense), tall hedge mustard (Sisymbrium loeselii) and {{flixweed}} (Descurainia sophia), we tried to establish weeds that are not common on arable land in Germany until now. These were: Yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris), hoary cress (Lepidium draba) and Turkish rocket (Bunias orientalis). In autumn 2011 emergence of the sown weeds was poor. In {{the second year of}} experiment we got good emergence of the named weeds excluding hoary cress (Lepidium draba). In autumn 2011 and 2012 different herbicidecombinations were applied across the stripes. The best results were achieved with Colzor Trio (clomazone + dimethachlor + napropamid) which was applied in pre-emergence state, a spray sequence Butisan Gold (metazachlor + <b>quinmerac</b> + dimethenamid-P) applied in pre-emergence followed by Salsa (ethametsulfuronmethyl) + Trend (adjuvant) in post-emergence and Clearfield-Vantiga (metazachlor + <b>quinmerac</b> + imazamox) + Dash (adjuvant), also applied in post-emergence state of the weeds...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{investigating the}} side-effects of pesticides on soil microbial biomass and microbial activity, with particular reference to two recently developed pesticides, a fungicide, epoxiconazole, and a herbicide, <b>quinmerac.</b> In a dose-responsee xperiment,a pplication of thesep esticidest o a sandy loam soil, {{at up to}} 10 and 20 times field rate, had no significant effect on soil microbial biomass C or ninhydrin-reactive N, over 84 days incubation. There was also no effect on soil respiration, except for the higher rate quinmerac-treated soil, which evolved 13 % lessC 02 -Cthan the control. The rate of mineralisation of epoxiconazole and <b>quinmerac,</b> and their long-term effect on soil respiration, were measured in three contrasting soils: a sandy loam, a silty clay loam, and a clay soil, using 14 C -labelled active ingredients. The kinetics of the pesticides' mineralisation were quite different, epoxiconazole being hyperbolic, while <b>quinmerac</b> was sigmoidal. The maximum amount of mineralisation of both pesticides occurred in the silty clay loam soil, which had the lowest microbial biomass content. The mineralisation of the pesticides was increased {{by the addition of}} ryegrass, with the greatest effect in the silty clay loam soil, probably because of the large ryegrass C: biomass C ratio. The mineralisation of epoxiconazole was affected by the ryegrass amendment much more than <b>quinmerac.</b> Further additions of the pesticides had no significant effect on soil respiration or pesticide mineralisation. The mineralisation of epoxiconazole and quimnerac was further investigated in the silty clay loam soil, using samples with different crop management histories, and the effects of ryegrass and glucose amendment. Pesticide mineralisation was shown {{to be related to the}} amount of soil microbial biomass, indicating that the difference in mineralisation rate between the three soil types above was not due to differences in their crop management, but innate differences in soil chemistry and microbiology. Ryegrass addition stimulated the mineralisation of epoxiconazole more than <b>quinmerac,</b> while the reverse was true for glucose, indicating that the pesticides were being degraded by two distinct fractions of the microbial biomass. The effects of long-term cumulative field application of the pesticides benomyl, chlorfenvinphos, aldicarb, triadimefon and glyphosate, on soil microbial biomass and mineralisation of soil organic matter were investigated. The addition of aldicarb consistently increased the microbial biomass, due to its beneficial effect on crop growth, but this effect was not reflected in the rate of organic matter mineralisation. However, in general, the continued application of these pesticides for up to 19 years, at slightly higher than the recommended rates, had very little effect on the soil microbial population. The effects of epoxiconazole and triadimefon on soil ergosterol content and microbial biomass C were compared in a sandy loam soil. Both pesticides temporarily reduced soil ergosterol by about 30 %, while biomass C remained largely unaffected. However, when straw was added to the soils, the inhibition of ergosterol was still evident, as was an inhibitory effect on biomass C. The measurement of soil ergosterol was more sensitive to the pesticide effects than biomass C, and could be a useful test in determining changes in fungal populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{herbicide}} GOLTIX® TITAN® is {{the unique}} {{combination of two}} active ingredients, Metamitrone (525 g/L) and <b>Quinmerac</b> (40 g/L). GOLTIX® TITAN® {{is used for the}} control of annual dicotyledonous weeds in sugar and fodder beets. Registration was granted for the post emergence splitting application with 3 x 2, 0 L/ha (3 applications). This corresponds to the amount of 3150 g Metamitrone and 240 g <b>Quinmerac</b> per hectare at maximum application rate. The registration application for pre-emergence application has been submitted. Several field trials were carried out between 2009 and 2013. These trials revealed the optimized efficacy on important weeds in sugar beet production including Fool´s parsley (Aethusa cynapium), Cleavers (Gallium aparine) and Fat-hen (Chenopodium album). Selectivity was examined in all of these trials and showed good results with all relevant mixtures at all application times. The two active ingredients have different modes of action; hence, the product {{plays an important role in}} resistance management. They can be applied flexibly and do not have any known negative influence on the environment. The successful formulation of this highly sophisticated sugar beet herbicide was confirmed by the available trial results.

40|$|Currently, the Clearfield® Production System {{in winter}} oilseed rape in Germany {{is based on}} the {{herbicide}} Clearfield®-Vantiga®, a combination product consisting of the active ingredients metazachlor, <b>quinmerac</b> and imazamox, sold as Clearfield-Vantiga D together with the adjuvant Dash® E. C [...] Clearfield-Vantiga D was introduced in autumn 2012 and has since proved superior performance on more than 10 000 ha of heavily weedy fields due to the very broad spectrum of activity, reliable foliar and soil activity and excellent crop safety in Clearfield oilseed rape hybrids. Although the authorized application period is very long (BBCH 10 - 18), it is mostly used relatively early, as soon as the majority of the important weeds is emerged. Metazachlor which is active mainly by cotyledon, hypocotyl and root uptake, is favoured by early applications. Clearfield-Clentiga is a suspension concentrate (SC), consisting of 250 g/l <b>quinmerac</b> and 12. 5 g/l imazamox. The application rate is 1. 0 l/ha + 1. 0 l/ha of the adjuvant Dash E. C [...] Approval is sought for use in winter oilseed rape in autumn (BBCH 10 - 18) and spring (BBCH 30 - 50) and in spring oilseed rape (BBCH 10 - 18). Results are presented for the autumn application in winter oilseed rape. A prerequisite for the application of both Clearfield-Clentiga and Clearfield-Vantiga D is the use of imazamox tolerant oilseed rape (Clearfield varieties). The amounts of active ingredient per hectare of <b>quinmerac</b> and imazamox are identical in Clearfield-Clentiga and Clearfield-Vantiga D, as well as the amount of adjuvant Dash E. C [...] Clearfield-Clentiga, {{as a consequence of the}} absence of metazachlor, compared to Clearfield-Vantiga D has a slightly more limited spectrum of activity and a less pronounced soil activity, but provides greater flexibility in the choice of the application dates and of combinations with soil and foliar herbicides. Very effective, even at high weed pressure and in difficult soil conditions, are sequential applications of Butisan Kombi (metazachlor + dimethenamide-P) in pre- or early post-emergence followed by Clearfield-Clentiga.

40|$|Three {{populations of}} {{silky bent grass}} (Apera spica-venti L.) were tested – one that is {{susceptible}} and two that are resistant to sulfonylureas. This study assessed the efficacy of control by different herbicides in a pot experiment and estimated the molecular status of resistance to sulfonylureas in analysed populations {{and its effect on}} the efficacy of different chemical treatments. The three most effective herbicide rotation schemes were: 1) chlorsulfuron + isoproturon, ethametsulfuron + metazachlor + <b>quinmerac,</b> chlorsulfuron + isoproturon; 2) prosulfocarb + diflufenican, ethametsulfuron + quizalofop-p-ethyl, prosulfocarb + diflufenican; 3) diflufenican + flufenacet, quizalofop-p-ethyl, diflufenican + flufenacet.

40|$|Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crtz.) is a cruciferous plant. As an oilseed crop {{camelina}} {{is mainly}} grown for oil production. After the 1960 s, however, the cultivation {{has become less}} important. Only in recent years, interest in this culture was awakened {{in the search for}} new sources of omega 3 fatty acids, natural antioxidants and a potential crop for the production of biofuels. The use of camelina oil for different purposes {{within the framework of the}} material use of renewable raw materials is of particular interest due to the high levels of linoleic and linolenic acid. For the establishment of camelina as a crop in agricultural crop rotation systems weed control should not be disregarded despite the rather good competitive ability against weeds. Based on greenhouse experiments a field trial in 2015 with different herbicide strategies was carried out. Besides Butisan Top (metazachlor + <b>quinmerac),</b> Devrinol FL (napropamide) and Stomp Aqua (pendimethalin) and also Betasana SC (phenmedipham) has been tested in various amounts and combinations. Using assessments to weed density and herbicide tolerance different herbicide strategies were compared with each other. Though, it is difficult to find a compromise between satisfactory herbicidal effect and a slight injury to the crop plant. The herbicide selection, the application rate and the combination of different herbicides have an effect on the crop. To confirm the data obtained further tests are necessary...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{a higher}} {{proportion}} of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in sugar beet rotations, volunteer oilseed rape can occur in increased numbers in subsequent crops. The sulfonylurea triflusulfuron is widely used for broad-leaved weed control in sugar beet, but may no longer be effective to control imidazolinone-tolerant volunteers when imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape is grown, which is due to a cross-tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate six different herbicide strategies for the control of tolerant volunteer oilseed rape. As a result, imidazolinone-tolerant oilseed rape showed a distinctive cross-resistance to triflusulfuron in the field. Mean herbicide efficacy was 14 % and was only slightly increased by combination with metamitron. Imidazolinone-susceptible and -tolerant oilseed rape varieties showed different response to the herbicide treatments. A significantly higher reduction of plant fresh mass (shoot) > 90 % was caused by herbicide treatments that included the active ingredients desmedipham, phenmedipham, ethofumesate, chloridazon and <b>quinmerac.</b> The results showed that triflusulfuron is no longer suitable to control volunteers if they are derived from imidazolinone-tolerance expressing varieties. However, alternative herbicides are available. Generally, increased attention has to be paid to volunteer management within the whole crop rotation if imidazolinonetolerant oilseed rape is grown. Appropriate tillage strategies after oilseed rape harvest have to be followed by effective herbicide treatments in the subsequent sugar beet, for example a mixture of metamitron, phenmedipham, desmedipham, ethofumesat and lenaciel...|$|E
40|$|Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb {{and wild}} buckwheat, chamomile, mercury, foolsparsleey and {{volunteer}} rapes are {{only some of}} the most important weeds in fooder and sugar beets. For the control of classical weed societies farmers can fall back on a limited number of active ingredients. Generally, Phenmedipham (PMP), Desmedipham (DMP) and Ethofumesate are the basis of a spray sequence. They are complemented with other active ingredients depending on the specific weed situation. The newly formulated BELVEDERE® Extra combines the three mentioned active ingredients in an optimal ratio. Hence, the herbicide covers a very broad weed spectrum with an excellent efficacy on Common lambsquarters, cleavers, ladysthumb and wild buckwheat. BELVEDERE® EXTRA is a liquid, selective, and systemic herbicide. It is formulated as suspoemulsion so that a high efficacy is achieved while preserving a very good selectivity. The product allows for flexible control of leaf activity as an additive (e. g. OLEO FC) is appended. Ethofumesate, which is mainly effective via the roots of the plant, belongs to a different HRAC group than Phenmedipham and Desmedipham. The high concentration of 200 g/L Ethofumesate leads to an effective resistance management especially regarding Fathen and other important weeds. Since 23 rd of September 2013 BELVEDERE® extra is registered for post emergence splitting application (3 applications) against annual dicotyledonous weeds. The maximum application rate per treatment is 1, 3 L/ha. In combination with GOLTIX® TITAN® (Metamitron + <b>Quinmerac)</b> or Goltix® Gold (Metamitron) the weed spectrum is broadened. Basically, a timely application whose application rates are adapted to the location is essential for a good efficacy of beet herbicides...|$|E
40|$|A two-factorial field {{experiment}} should reveal {{the performance of}} Clearfield® oilseed rape under different cropping intensities. The experiment was conducted at the experimental station Ihinger Hof in 2014, with cropping intensity as factor 1 and herbicide strategy as factor 2, all treatments sown with variety PT 228 CL. Treatments of cropping intensities were “normal sowing” (NS; soil inversion tillage tillage, 50 seeds m- 2, 12 cm row spacing), “reduced sowing density” (DS; soil inversion tillage, 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing) and striptill (ST; 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing). The two herbicide strategies were pre-emergence strategy (VAS; application of Colzor® Trio (30 g L- 1 Clomazone, 187. 5 g L- 1 Dimethachlor, 187. 5 g L- 1 Napropamide) one day after sowing and of Agil® S (100 g/L Propaquizafop) 3. 5 weeks after sowing) and Clearfield® strategy (CLS; application of Clearfield®-Vantiga® (375 g L- 1 Metazachlor, 125 g L- 1 <b>Quinmerac,</b> 6. 25 g L- 1 Imazamox) and Dash® E.

40|$|The growth-inhibiting {{effects of}} indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) at high {{concentration}} and the synthetic auxins 7 -chloro- 3 -methyl- 8 -quinolinecarboxylic acid (<b>quinmerac),</b> 2 -methoxy- 3, 6 -dichlorobenzoic acid (dicamba), 4 -amino- 3, 6, 6 -trichloropicolinic acid (picloram), and naphthalene acetic acid, were investigated in cleavers (Galium aparine). When plants were root treated with 0. 5 mm IAA, shoot epinasty and inhibition of root and shoot growth developed during 24 h. Concomitantly, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) synthase activity, and ACC and ethylene production were transiently stimulated in the shoot tissue within 2 h, followed by increases in immunoreactive (+) -abscisic acid (ABA) and its precursor xanthoxal (xanthoxin) after 5 h. After 24 h of treatment, levels of xanthoxal and ABA were elevated up to 2 - and 24 -fold, relative to control, respectively. In plants treated with IAA, 7 -chloro- 3 -methyl- 8 -quinolinecarboxylic acid, naphthalene acetic acid, 2 -methoxy- 3, 6 -dichlorobenzoic acid, and 4 -amino- 3, 6, 6 -trichloropicolinic acid, levels of ethylene, ACC, and ABA increased in close correlation with inhibition of shoot growth. Aminoethoxyvinyl-glycine and cobalt ions, which inhibit ethylene synthesis, decreased ABA accumulation and growth inhibition, whereas the ethylene-releasing ethephon promoted ABA levels and growth inhibition. In accordance, tomato mutants defective in ethylene perception (never ripe) {{did not produce}} the xanthoxal and ABA increases and growth inhibition induced by auxins in wild-type plants. This suggests that auxin-stimulated ethylene triggers ABA accumulation and the consequent growth inhibition. Reduced catabolism most probably did not contribute to ABA increase, as indicated by immunoanalyses of ABA degradation and conjugation products in shoot tissue and by pulse experiments with [3 H]-ABA in cell suspensions of G. aparine. In contrast, studies using inhibitors of ABA biosynthesis (fluridone, naproxen, and tungstate), ABA-deficient tomato mutants (notabilis, flacca, and sitiens), and quantification of xanthophylls indicate that ABA biosynthesis is influenced, probably through stimulated cleavage of xanthophylls to xanthoxal in shoot tissue...|$|E
40|$|The term ‘emerging contaminants’ is {{generally}} {{used to refer}} to compounds previously not considered or known to be significant to groundwater (in terms of distribution and/or concentration) which are now being more widely detected. As analytical techniques improve, previously undetected organic micropollutants are being observed in the aqueous environment. Many emerging contaminants remain unregulated, but the number of regulated contaminants will continue to grow slowly over the next several decades. There is a wide variety of sources and pathways for these compounds to enter the environment and these include agriculture and urban areas. Some of these contaminants can have human or ecological health effects and {{there is a need for}} better understanding of their fate in environmental systems. This report provides a short review of the types of organic micropollutants which can be found in the aqueous environment. These include nanomaterials, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, industrial additives and by-products, personal care products and fragrances, water treatment by-products, flame/fire retardants and surfactants, as well as caffeine and nicotine metabolites and hormones. Many of the compounds are relatively small polar molecules which are not effectively removed by conventional drinking water treatment using activated carbon. Pesticides and some industrial compounds are presently covered by the Water Framework Directive, the Groundwater Regulations and the Drinking Water Directive. Additional parameters, such as bisphenol A and nonyl-phenol are anticipated to be covered by revisions to the Drinking Water Directive. Others are currently unregulated. In order to assess the hazards presented by such compounds, information on usage, persistence, leachability and a robust sensitive analytical method is required. The UK metaldehyde problem was not originally discovered due to lack of an analytical method and was exacerbated by recalcitrance in water treatment. For many pesticides these requirements are fulfilled and an assessment of risk of leaching to groundwater can be made. However, for pesticide metabolites this information can be sparse and for compounds such as pharmaceuticals it can be lacking. A simple hazard assessment for currently approved pesticides was made from information on UK usage, persistence, sorption to soil carbon and published leaching indices. The following compounds were assessed as having the greatest potential for leaching to water: 2, 4 -D, amidosulfuron, bentazone, clopyralid, dicamba, florasulam, fosthiazate, imazaquin, iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium, maleic hydrazide, MCPA, MCPP-P, metribuzin, metsulfuronmethyl, <b>quinmerac,</b> oxamyl, and triclopyr with a further 46 also having potential. Of these, 19 had an octanol/water partition coefficient (Kow) less than that of metaldehyde and therefore are likely to be incompletely removed by water treatment. A simple assessment for pesticide metabolites, based only on organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) and persistence data, in this study gave results which agreed in principle with other studies. The different approaches indicate that the metabolites of chlorothalonil, cyanazine, diflufenican, flufenacet, iodosulfuron-methyl, metaldehyde, metazachlor and metsulfuron-methyl are likely to pose the greatest risk to drinking water. In many cases these metabolites are derived from parents which have a lesser risk. Other organic micropollutants, such as pharmaceuticals, cannot as yet be assessed in the same way due to a lack of persistence data since the majority of persistence studies have been directed at water treatment. A range of organic micropollutants from urban settings have been detected in ground and surface water. Commonly detected compounds include: bisphenol A, carbamazepine, galaxolide, ibuprofen, iopamidol, phthalates, phenyl ethoxylates, and sulfamethoxazole. Case studies show that a small number of contaminants may be used to characterise the contaminant loading and also be used to assess the migration pathways in urban areas. Data interpreted by BGS from the Environment Agency’s monitoring programme for organic pollutants indicates that the 30 most frequently detected compounds comprise both established and emerging compounds and include a number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, petroleum compounds, triazine herbicides, chlorinated solvents, degradation products and THMs, caffeine, DEET and industrial compounds such as bisphenol A and tributyl phosphate. Specific determinands include a range of currently licensed and phased out pesticides with a few metabolites, pharmaceuticals including carbamazepine and triclosan, caffeine, nicotine and food additives and alkyl phosphates. These data exhibit hot spots which may indicate possible research areas. Future research should focus on a compound identified in the literature and detected by Environment Agency monitoring. Possible topics could be a study of migration through the unsaturated zone. In many cases the mechanism for migration of emerging contaminants from the surface to groundwater is very unclear...|$|E
