5000|$|Abner Eliezer Shimony (March 10, 1928 [...] - [...] August 8, 2015) was an American {{physicist}} and philosopher. He specialized in quantum theory and philosophy of science. As a physicist {{he concentrated on}} the interaction between relativity theory and quantum mechanics. He has authored many works and research on complementarity in quantum entanglement as well as multiparticle <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry,</b> both relating to quantum coherence. He has authored research articles and books on the foundations of quantum mechanics. He received the 1966 Lakatos Prize {{for his work in}} Philosophy of Science.|$|E
5000|$|Ekert's {{research}} extends {{over most}} aspects of information processing in quantum-mechanical systems, {{with a focus}} on quantum cryptography and quantum computation. Building on the idea of quantum non-locality and Bell's inequalities he introduced entanglement-based quantum key distribution in his 1991 paper which generated a spate of new research that established a vigorously active new area of physics and cryptography. It {{is one of the most}} cited papers in the field and was chosen by the editors of the Physical Review Letters as one of their [...] "milestone letters", i.e. papers that made important contributions to physics, announced significant discoveries, or started new areas of research. His subsequent work with John Rarity and Paul Tapster, from the Defence Research Agency (DRA) in Malvern, resulted in the proof-of-principle experimental quantum key distribution, introducing parametric down-conversion, phase encoding and <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry</b> into the repertoire of cryptography.He and collaborators were the first to develop the concept of a security proof based on entanglement purification.|$|E
5000|$|After {{receiving}} {{his second}} Ph.D., Shimony interacted {{with both the}} philosophical academic world and the physics academic world. His most famous professional correspondence is with Rudolf Carnap. He taught philosophy of science at MIT from 1959 until 1968 in the school’s Department of Humanities. In 1968 he transferred to Boston University, beginning a 26-year appointment in both the physics and philosophy departments, and was Professor Emeritus there {{until his death in}} 2015. Shimony {{is best known for his}} work in developing the CHSH inequality, an empirically testable form of the Bell inequality, also known as Bell's theorem. Since 1992, he proposed a geometric measure of quantum entanglement and, along with Gregg Jaeger and Michael Horne, discovered two novel complementarity relations involving interferometric visibility in multiparticle <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry.</b> He is also known for his inquiry into the question of the [...] "peaceful coexistence" [...] of quantum mechanics and special relativity. He wrote several books and numerous research articles on the foundations of quantum mechanics and related topics. Shimony is credited with the phrase [...] "passion at a distance" [...] to characterize the various phenomena described by quantum correlations.|$|E

40|$|In <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry,</b> it {{is vital}} to control and utilize {{nonlinear}} interactions for achieving high-precision measurements. Attribute to their long coherent time and high controllability, ultracold atoms including Bose condensed atoms have been widely used for implementing <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry.</b> Here, we review the recent progresses in theoretical studies of <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry</b> with Bose condensed atoms. In particular, we focus on the nonlinear phenomena induced by the atom-atom interaction and how to control and utilize these nonlinear phenomena. Under the mean-field description, due to the atom-atom interaction, matter-wave solitons appear in the interference patterns, and macroscopic quantum self-trapping exists in the Bose-Josephson junctions. Under the many-body description, the atom-atom interaction can generate non-classical entanglement, which may be utilized to achieve high-precision measurements beyond the standard quantum limit.

40|$|The archetypal <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry</b> {{experiment}} yields an {{interference pattern}} {{that results from}} the indistinguishability of two spatiotemporal paths available to a photon or {{to a pair of}} entangled photons. A fundamental challenge in <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry</b> is to perform such experiments with a higher number of paths, and over large distances. In particular, the distribution of such highly entangled states in long-haul optical fibers is one of the core concepts behind quantum information networks. We demonstrate that using indistinguishable frequency paths instead of spatiotemporal ones allows for robust, high-dimensional <b>quantum</b> <b>interferometry</b> in optical fibers. In our system, twin-photons from an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair are offered up to 9 frequency paths after propagation in long-haul optical fibers, and we show that the multi-path quantum interference patterns can be faithfully restored after the photons travel a total distance of up to 60 km...|$|E

40|$|Classical and quantum {{interference}} {{of light}} propagating in arrays of coupled waveguides and undergoing multiband optical Bloch oscillations (BOs) with negligible Zener tunneling is theoretically investigated. In particular, it is shown that Mach-Zehnder-like interference effects spontaneously arise in multiband BOs owing to beam splitting and subsequent beam recombination occurring in one BO cycle. As a noteworthy example of quantum interference, {{we discuss the}} doubling of interference fringes in photon counting rates for a correlated photon pair undergoing two-band BOs, a phenomenon analogous to the manifestation of the de Broglie wavelength of an entangled biphoton state observed in <b>quantum</b> Mach-Zehnder <b>interferometry.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
5000|$|A {{quantum limit}} in physics {{is a limit}} on {{measurement}} accuracy at quantum scales. [...] Depending on the context, the limit may be absolute (such as the Heisenberg limit), or it may only apply when the experiment is conducted with naturally occurring quantum states (e.g. the standard <b>quantum</b> limit in <b>interferometry)</b> and can be circumvented with advanced state preparation and measurement schemes.|$|R

Squeezed {{states in a}} broad Fourier frequency band down to 1 Hz has been observed for the first time. Nonclassical properties of light in such a low frequency band is required for high efficiency quantum information storage in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) media. The states observed also cover the frequency band of ultra-high precision laser interferometers for gravitational wave detection {{and can be used}} to reach the regime of <b>quantum</b> non-demolition <b>interferometry.</b> And furthermore, they cover the frequencies of motions of heavily macroscopic objects and might therefore support the attempts to observe entanglement in our macroscopic world.

40|$|The {{validity}} of quantum-mechanical predictions {{has been confirmed}} {{with a high degree}} of accuracy in a wide range of experiments. Although the statistics of the outcomes of a measuring apparatus have been studied intensively, little has been explored and is known regarding the accessibility of quantum dynamics. For these sorts of fundamental studies of <b>quantum</b> mechanics, <b>interferometry</b> using neutron matter-waves in particular, provides almost ideal experimental circumstances. In this device quantum interference between spatially separated beams occurs on a macroscopic scale. Recently, the full determination of weak-values of neutrons 1 2 			 - spin adds a new aspect to the study of quantum dynamics. Moreover, a new counter-intuitive phenomenon, called quantum Cheshire Cat, is observed in an interference experiment. In this article, we present an overview of these experiments...|$|R
40|$|Break-throughs in {{the study}} of {{superfluid}} He- 3 weak links and recent demonstration of Josephson effect in He- 4 are a result of significant advances in ultra-sensitive transducer and nanofabrication technology. However, further progress in the performance of superfluid weak links and <b>quantum</b> rotation <b>interferometry</b> devices depends, in part, on reducing the mechanical noise and increasing the effective duty cycle of such devices. In existing devices, the DC Josephson effect is driven by chemical potential difference produced by a pressure applied across the weak link. We propose a novel drive technique, where the chemical potential is due to a controlled temperature difference. This technique promises to eliminate mechanical shock associated with the switch of the direction of applied pressure and to achieve 100 % duty cycle. The thermally driven Josephson effect may also answer outstanding questions about dissipation in superfluid weak links...|$|R

40|$|The {{transition}} from classical to quantum mechanics has intrigued {{scientists in the}} past and {{remains one of the most}} fundamental conceptual challenges in state-of-the-art physics. Beyond the quantum mechanical correspondence principle, quantum-classical analogies have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we present classical two-mode interference for a nanomechanical two-mode system, realizing classical Stückelberg interferometry. In the past, Stückelberg interferometry has been investigated exclusively in quantum mechanical two-level systems. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a classical analog of Stückelberg interferometry taking advantage of coherent energy exchange between two-strongly coupled, high quality factor nanomechanical resonator modes. Furthermore, we provide an exact theoretical solution for the double passage Stückelberg problem which reveals the analogy of the return probabilities in the quantum mechanical and the classical version of the problem.

40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} in <b>quantum</b> optical <b>interferometry</b> for applications to metrology, sub-wavelength imaging, and remote sensing, such as in quantum laser radar (LADAR). For quantum LADAR, atmospheric absorption rapidly degrades any quantum state of light, so that for high-photon loss the optimal strategy is to transmit coherent states of light, which suffer no worse loss than the Beer law for classical optical attenuation, and which provides sensitivity at the shot-noise limit. This approach leaves open the question [...] what is the optimal detection scheme for such states {{in order to provide}} the best possible resolution? We show that coherent light coupled with photon number resolving detectors can provide a super-resolution much below the Rayleigh diffraction limit, with sensitivity no worse than shot-noise in terms of the detected photon power.

40|$|White-light {{interferometry}} {{is one of}} today's most precise {{tools for}} determining optical material properties. Achievable precision and accuracy are typically limited by systematic errors due to {{a high number of}} interdependent data fitting parameters. Here, we introduce spectrally-resolved <b>quantum</b> white-light <b>interferometry</b> as a novel tool for optical property measurements, notably chromatic dispersion in optical fibres. By exploiting both spectral and photon-number correlations of energy-time entangled photon pairs, the number of fitting parameters is significantly reduced which eliminates systematic errors and leads to an absolute determination of the material parameter. By comparing the quantum method to state-of-the-art approaches, we demonstrate the quantum advantage through 2. 4 times better measurement precision, despite involving 62 times less photons. The improved results are due to conceptual advantages enabled by quantum optics which are likely to define new standards in experimental methods for characterising optical materials.
