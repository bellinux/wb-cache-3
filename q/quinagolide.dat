Recent uncontrolled reports have suggested that <b>quinagolide</b> may be successfully used for the clinical management of hyperprolactinemia with fewer adverse reactions than bromocriptine. This study {{is the first to}} compare <b>quinagolide</b> in a double-blind manner with bromocriptine, given only once-daily instead of the usual multidose regimen. In the first phase we compared, in 7 hyperprolactinemic patients, the effects over 24 h of a single oral dose of 0. 05 mg <b>quinagolide</b> with 2. 5 mg bromocriptine. Compared with placebo, both bromocriptine and <b>quinagolide</b> showed potent PRL-inhibiting and GH-releasing effects, with comparable effects at 24 h; no significant changes were observed in TSH, LH, FSH or cortisol. Twelve hyperprolactinemic patients were then randomized to receive either once-daily bromocriptine or <b>quinagolide</b> in incremental doses for a period of six months. Both drugs were found to be equally effective, and no differences were seen either in adverse reactions or PRL levels during repeated diurnal sampling. We therefore conclude that <b>quinagolide</b> and bromocriptine are therapeutically equivalent in long-term use, and both are equally effective when given once a day.

40|$|Hyperprolactinaemia is characterised by gonadal dysfunction, {{including}} infertility {{and reduced}} libido and, if left untreated, {{is associated with}} an increased risk of long-term complications, such as osteo-porosis. The first-line therapy for patients with hyperprolactinaemia is pharmacological intervention with a dopamine agonist. Currently, there are three dopamine agonists available for hyperprolactinae-mia therapy: bromocriptine, <b>quinagolide</b> and cabergoline. Bromocriptine {{has a long history of}} use; however, a range of 5 – 18 % of patients are reported to show bromocriptine resistance, with only par-tial lowering of plasma prolactin levels and an absence of tumour shrinkage. The newer dopamine agonists, <b>quinagolide</b> and cabergoline, offer improved efficacy over bromocriptine, with a lower inci-dence of adverse events. <b>Quinagolide</b> and cabergoline have also demonstrated efficacy in many patients intolerant or resistant to bromocriptine. Thus, the selection of dopamine agonists available provides more than one option for pharmacological intervention of hyperprolactinaemia. This review discusses the clinical use of <b>quinagolide</b> in comparison to other dopamine agonists for hyper-prolactinaemia therapy. <b>Quinagolide</b> may improve patient compliance to treatment owing to its reduced side effect profile, simple and rapid titration over just 7 days, once-daily dosing regimen and easy to use starter pack (available in some countries). <b>Quinagolide</b> offers an additional benefit for patients wishing to become pregnant, as it can be used until the point of confirmation of preg-nancy. Therefore, as a well tolerated and effective therapy, with a simple dosing regimen, <b>quinagolide</b> should be considered as a first-line therapy in the treatment of hyperprolactinaemia.

40|$|In most mammals, {{prolactin}} (PRL) {{is essential}} for maintaining lactation and its suppression strongly inhibits lactation. However, the involvement of PRL in the control of ruminant lactation is less clear because inconsistent effects on milk yield have been observed with short-term suppression of PRL by bromocriptine. By contrast, in vitro studies have provided evidence that PRL helps to maintain the differentiation state and act as a survival factor for mammary epithelial cells. Therefore, a series of experiments were conducted to assess the galactopoietic role of PRL. In a first experiment, daily injections of the PRL inhibitor <b>quinagolide</b> reduced milking-induced PRL release and induced a faster decline in milk production. Milk production was correlated with PRL released at milking. <b>Quinagolide</b> reduced mammary cell activity, survival, and proliferation. During {{the last week of}} treatments, differential milking (1 × vs 2 ×) was applied. The inhibition of milk production by <b>quinagolide</b> was maintained in the udder half that was milked 2 × but not in the udder half milked 1 ×, suggesting that the response to PRL is modulated at the gland level. In a second experiment, cows were injected with <b>quinagolide,</b> <b>quinagolide</b> + injection of bovine PRL at milking time, or water. As in the first experiment, <b>quinagolide</b> reduced milk, protein, and lactose yields. Although PRL injections at milking time were not sufficient to restore milk yield, they tended to increase milk protein and lactose yields and increased the viability of milk-purified mammary epithelial cells. Recently, we investigated the use of <b>quinagolide</b> at drying off. Treating late-lactation cows with <b>quinagolide</b> decreased milk production within the first day of treatment and induced faster increases in somatic cells and bovine serum albumin content in mammary secretions after drying off, which indicates an acceleration of mammary gland involution. In conclusion, these data, combined with data from other studies, provide a good body of evidence indicating that PRL is galactopoietic in dairy cows. However, the response to PRL appears to be modulated at the mammary gland level...|$|E
40|$|In ruminants, milking induces {{the release}} of {{prolactin}} (PRL). Milkinginduced PRL release decreases as lactation advances and PRL is a survival factor for mammary epithelial cells (MEC) of cows, suggesting a galactopoietic role of this hormone. Nevertheless, suppression of PRL by bromocriptine has produced ambiguous effects on milk yield in cows. To assess the effect of inhibition of PRL release in lactating dairy cows, nine Holstein cows were assigned randomly to treatments during 3 5 -d periods: 1) daily i. m. injection of 2 mg of <b>Quinagolide</b> (a PRL release inhibitor), 2) daily i. m. injection of 2 mg of <b>Quinagolide</b> and twice a day (milking time) i. v injection of PRL (2 µg/kg of body weight), 3) daily injection of vehicle as control. Blood and milk samples were harvested at milking. MEC were purified from milk. Daily injections of <b>Quinagolide</b> reduced milking-induced PRL release (P< 0. 05). The amount (area under curve) of PRL during milking after the PRL injections {{was similar to that}} of endogenous PRL discharges in control treatment. <b>Quinagolide</b> decreased milk production (P< 0. 05), milk protein content (P< 0. 05) and milk lactose content (P< 0. 05), without modification of milk fat composition or fat globule size. PRL injections had no effect on milk yield and milk fat composition but tended to increased milk protein content (P< 0. 10). Injections of <b>Quinagolide</b> increased the number of MEC harvested from milk (P< 0. 05) but PRL injections tended to decrease it (P= 0. 10). PRL injections also increased viability of MEC harvested from milk (P< 0. 05). Injections of <b>Quinagolide</b> decreased kappa-casein (P< 0. 05) and alpha-lactalbumin (P< 0. 05) mRNAs in milk MEC. Exogenous PRL have no affected the level of these mRNA. In conclusion, chronic administration of <b>Quinagolide</b> reduces milk production in dairy cows by affecting MEC activity.

Therefore, several experiments have been conducted to assess the galactopoietic role of PRL. In an initial experiment, cows in early lactation received daily injections of the dopamine agonist <b>quinagolide</b> for 9 wk. <b>Quinagolide</b> reduced milking-induced PRL release and caused a faster decline in milk production. <b>Quinagolide</b> also reduced mammary epithelial cell activity, survival, and proliferation. In goats, cabergoline, another dopamine agonist, caused a 28 % decrease in milk yield the day after injection. In another experiment, cows were injected for 5 d with <b>quinagolide,</b> with <b>quinagolide</b> plus bovine PRL injected at milking time, or with vehicles only. Again, <b>quinagolide</b> reduced milk, protein, and lactose yields. Although PRL injections were not sufficient to restore milk yield, they tended to increase milk protein and lactose yields and increased the viability of mammary epithelial cells purified from milk. Recently, our team stimulated PRL secretion with daily injections of the dopamine antagonist domperidone for 5 wk. Milk production increased gradually and was greater in domperidone-treated cows during the last 4 wk of the treatment period. In most experiments where PRL secretion was manipulated, feed intake paralleled the changes of PRL concentration, supporting the idea that PRL increases feed intake to provide the nutrients necessary to support lactation in dairy ruminants. In late-lactation cows, <b>quinagolide</b> and cabergoline decreased milk production within {{the first day of}} treatment and induced more rapid changes in several markers of mammary gland involution after drying-off. In addition, <b>quinagolide</b> improved the resistance to intramammaryinfection, suggesting that PRL inhibition could be an alternative strategy for facilitating dryingoff. Prolactin appears to directly affect mammary gland functions, but mammary gland responsiveness to PRL appears to be modulated by local and systemic factors. Therefore, the modulation of the number and isoforms of the PRL receptors as well as the expression of intracellular modulators of cell signaling in the mammary gland require further investigation. In conclusion, these data, combined with those from other studies, provide a good body of evidence that PRL is galactopoietic in dairy ruminants...|$|E
40|$|In most mammals, {{prolactin}} (PRL) {{is essential}} for maintaining lactation, and yet the short-term suppression of PRL during established lactation by bromocriptine has produced inconsistent effects on milk yield in cows and goats. To assess {{the effect of the}} long-term inhibition of PRL release in lactating dairy cows, 5 Holstein cows in early lactation received daily intramuscular injections of 1 mg of the PRL-release inhibitor <b>quinagolide</b> for 9 wk. Four control cows received the vehicle (water) only. During the last week of the treatments, one udder half was milked once a day (1 ×) and the other twice a day (2 ×). Blood samples were harvested at milking in wk - 1, 1, 4, and 8. The daily injections of <b>quinagolide</b> reduced milking-induced PRL release but not the basal PRL concentration. <b>Quinagolide</b> induced a faster decline in milk production, which was about 5. 3 kg/d lower in the quinagolide-treated cows during the last 4 wk of treatment. During wk 9, the inhibition of milk production by <b>quinagolide</b> was maintained in the udder half that was milked 2 × but not in the half milked 1 ×. Milk production was significantly correlated with the quantity of PRL released at milking. <b>Quinagolide</b> did not affect the release of oxytocin at milking. Serum concentration of insulin-like growth factor- 1 was not affected by treatment or correlated with milk production. Serum concentrations of leptin and the calciotropic hormone stanniocalcin were not affected by the treatment. In conclusion, the chronic administration of the PRL-release inhibitor <b>quinagolide</b> decreases milk production in dairy cows. The effect is likely the result of the reduced release of milking-induced PRL and is modulated {{at the level of the}} gland by milking frequency...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of dopaminergic {{agents in the}} medical treatment of pituitary adenomas is well known. <b>Quinagolide</b> is a nonergot derivative dopamine agonist, which binds dopamine D 2 receptors with high affinity. The treatment with this drug is reported to suppress hormone levels and to cause tumor shrinkage in prolactinomas {{and in a few}} GH-secreting pituitary adenomas. In clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA), the {{efficacy of}} <b>quinagolide</b> treatment is controversial. The scintigraphy of the pituitary region using 123 I-methoxybenzamide (123 I-IBZM) allows us to visualize in vivo the expression of dopamine D 2 receptors on pituitary tumors. In this study, the pituitary scintigraphy with 123 I-IBZM was performed in 14 patients with macroadenoma before starting a long-term treatment with quinagolide: 6 NFPA with high circulating alpha-subunit levels, 4 PRL-secreting, and 4 GH-secreting adenomas. A 3 -point score was used to grade the ligand accumulation within the pituitary adenomas: 0 = negative, 1 = moderate uptake (equal to that recorded in the cerebral cortex), and 2 = intense uptake (equal to that recorded in the basal nuclei). The treatment with <b>quinagolide</b> was carried out at the dose of 0. 3 - 0. 6 mg/day for 6 - 12 months. Clinical, biochemical and hormonal assessment was repeated monthly during the first 3 months, then quarterly. Sellar magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after 6 and 12 months of <b>quinagolide</b> treatment, to evaluate tumor shrinkage (> 25 % of baseline size). In all 14 patients, a significant positive correlation was found between the degree of 123 I-IBZM uptake and the clinical response to <b>quinagolide</b> treatment (r = 0. 90; P < 0. 001). In particular, the normalization of serum alpha-subunit and PRL levels, respectively, was achieved in 3 patients with NFPA and in 2 patients with prolactinoma, who showed intense 123 I-IBZM uptake in the pituitary region. In 4 of these 5 patients with positive scan, a significant tumor shrinkage occurred between 6 and 12 months after the beginning of <b>quinagolide</b> treatment. In all patients with GH-secreting adenoma, no significant uptake of 123 I-IBZM was found and no significant decrease of circulating GH and/or insulin-like growth factor-I levels, and tumor shrinkage was obtained during long-term treatment with <b>quinagolide.</b> In conclusion, the pituitary scintigraphy with 123 I-IBZM can be considered a useful tool to indicate adenomas with significant expression of functioning D 2 receptors. This innovative technique may predict the response to long-term treatment with <b>quinagolide</b> in patients with NFPA, where the lack of pituitary hormone hypersecretion makes difficult the monitoring of medical treatment efficacy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{effectiveness}} and tolerability of <b>quinagolide</b> (CV 205 - 502) and cabergoline (CAB) treatments in 39 patients with prolactinoma. STUDY DESIGN: All 39 patients were treated first with <b>quinagolide</b> for 12 {{months and then}} with cabergoline for 12 months. A wash-out period was performed in all patients after 12 months of both treatments in order to evaluate recurrence of hyperprolactinaemia. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients with microprolactinoma (basal serum PRL levels 1620 - 18750 mU/l) and 16 patients with macroprolactinoma (basal serum PRL levels 4110 - 111000 mU/l), previously shown to be intolerant of bromocriptine. All patients had gonadal failure and 11 patients with macroprolactinoma had visual field defects. Five patients with macro- and one with microprolactinoma had previously undergone surgery. STUDY PROTOCOL: The starting doses of <b>quinagolide</b> and CAB were 0. 075 mg/day and 0. 5 mg/week, respectively, subsequently increased up to 0. 6 mg once daily and 1. 5 mg twice weekly, respectively. Serum PRL levels were measured monthly for the first 3 months and then quarterly for 12 months. PRL levels were assayed weekly for the first month and then monthly during the wash-out period. Tumour shrinkage was evaluated by serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the hypothalamus-pituitary region at study entry and after 6 and 12 months of both treatments in micro- and macroprolactinomas. RESULTS: After 12 months of <b>quinagolide</b> treatment, serum PRL levels normalized in all 23 patients with microprolactinoma (100 %) and in 14 out of 16 with macroprolactinoma (87. 5 %). A tumour volume reduction of greater than 80 % was documented by MRI studies in five of 23 (21. 7 %) patients with microprolactinoma and in four of 16 (25 %) with macroprolactinoma. All patients had recurrence of hyperprolactinaemia after 15 - 60 days withdrawal of <b>quinagolide</b> treatment. However, before starting CAB treatment basal PRL levels were significantly lower than before <b>quinagolide</b> treatment both in microprolactinomas (4667. 4 +/- 714. 7 vs. 2636. 1 +/- 262. 3 mU/l, P = 0. 006) and in macroprolactinomas (24853. 1 +/- 7566. 7 vs. 3576. 6 +/- 413. 0 mU/l, P = 0. 013). After 12 months of CAB treatment, serum PRL levels normalized in 22 out of 23 patients with microprolactinoma (95. 6 %) and in 14 out of 16 with macroprolactinoma (87. 5 %). No difference in PRL nadir was found after <b>quinagolide</b> and CAB treatments both in micro 174. 6 +/- 30. 6 vs. 169. 8 +/- 37. 9 mU/l, P = 0. 5) and in macroprolactinomas (277. 5 +/- 68. 4 vs. 341. 8 +/- 95. 2 mU/l, P = 0. 6). A tumour volume reduction of greater than 80 % was documented by MRI studies in seven other patients with microprolactinoma (30. 4 %) and in five other patients with macroprolactinoma (31. 2 %). After CAB treatment, further tumour shrinkage ranging 4 - 40 % and 2 - 70 % was observed in 12 micro- and seven macroprolactinomas, respectively. The percentage of tumour shrinkage after CAB {{was significantly higher than}} that observed after <b>quinagolide</b> in microprolactinomas (48. 6 +/- 9. 5 vs. 26. 7 +/- 4. 5 %, P = 0. 046) but not in macroprolactinomas (47. 0 +/- 10. 6 vs. 26. 8 +/- 8. 4 %, P = 0. 2). The withdrawal from CAB treatment, induced an increase in serum PRL levels in all macroprolactinomas between 15 and 30 days, in 15 out of 23 microprolactinoma after 30 days, and in four patients after 2 - 4 months. In the remaining four patients serum PRL levels remained normal after 12 months of CAB withdrawal. Both compounds were tolerated satisfactorily by all patients. In the first week of <b>quinagolide</b> treatment, 12 patients reported nausea and postural hypotension, which spontaneously disappeared during the second-third week of treatment. None of the 39 patients reported side-effects during CAB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Both <b>quinagolide</b> and CAB treatments, induced the normalization of serum PRL levels in the great majority of patients with prolactinoma. Tumour shrinkage was recorded in 22 - 25 % of patients after <b>quinagolide</b> and in 30 - 31 % after CAB treatment...|$|E
40|$|Inhibiting milking-induced {{prolactin}} (PRL) {{release and}} reducing milking frequency reduce {{the quantity of}} milk produced by dairy cows. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these two parameters modulate milk yield are not clear. To assess the regulation of the cell activity, by PRL and milking frequencies, five Holstein cows in early lactation received daily i. m. injection of 1 mg of <b>Quinagolide,</b> a suppressor of PRL release, for 9 weeks. Four control cows received the vehicle (water). During {{the last week of}} treatment, one half-gland was milked once and the other twice daily. Mammary biopsies were taken after 4 and 8 weeks of <b>quinagolide</b> treatment and epithelial cells were isolated from milk of both halvesudders in both groups of animals during the differential milking. Epithelial cells were prepared after milk centrifugation and by purification using an anticytoketatin antibody bound to magnetic beads. RNA was extracted from mammary biopsies and milk purified epithelial cells. Milk protein mRNA expression were analysed by quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR. <b>Quinagolide</b> treatment induced a faster decline in milk production (- 5. 3 kg/d compared to control during the last 4 weeks of treatments, P 0. 15). Levels of kappa casein (P< 0. 05) and alpha lactalbumin (P= 0. 06) mRNA were lower in mammary biopsies of Quinagolide-treated cows at week 4. Accordingly, the mRNA levels of kappa casein (P< 0. 05) and alpha lactalbumin (P= 0. 06) were also lower in milk purified epithelial cells from <b>Quinagolide</b> treated cows during the differential milking. Milking frequency also induced variations in milk protein mRNA levels in milk purified epithelial cells. Levels of kappa casein (P< 0. 05) and alpha lactalbumin (P< 0. 01) mRNA were downregulated in once daily milked udders compared to twice daily ones. In conclusion, chronic administration of the prolactin-release inhibitor <b>Quinagolide</b> and once daily milking reduced milk production in dairy cows by affecting mammary cell activity at a transcriptionnal level. Moreover milk purified epithelial cells seem to be a valuable source of cells to study transcriptional regulations in mammary cells...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{study was}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of prolonged treatment with the dopamine agonist <b>quinagolide</b> on serum gonadotropin and alpha-subunit concentrations and tumor volume in patients with clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas (CNPA). DESIGN: Ten patients with CNPA were treated with <b>quinagolide</b> (0. 3 mg daily). The median duration of treatment was 57 months (range 36 - 93 months). Blood samples for measurement of serum gonadotropin and alpha-subunit concentrations were drawn before treatment, after 5 days, and at each outpatient visit. Computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary region and Goldmann perimetry were done before and at regular intervals during treatment. RESULTS: A significant decrease of serum FSH, LH or alpha-subunit concentrations was found in nine patients. The levels remained low during the entire treatment period. In {{two out of three}} patients with pre-existing visual field defects a slight improvement was shown during the first months of treatment, but eventually deterioration occurred in all three patients. A fourth patient developed unilateral ophthalmoplegia during treatment. During the first year tumor volume decreased in three patients, but in two of them regrowth occurred after a few months. In six patients progressive tumor growth occurred despite sustained suppression of gonadotropin or alpha-subunit levels. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term treatment of patients with CNPA with high doses of the dopamine agonist <b>quinagolide</b> could not prevent progressive increase in tumor size in most patients. It remains unproven whether <b>quinagolide</b> retards CNPA growth. Additional studies are needed to investigate whether subgroups of patients, e. g. those with positive dopamine receptor scintigraphy or those with marked hypersecretion of intact gonadotropins or subunits, will respond more favorably to treatment with dopamine agonists...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a man with an {{invasive}} macroprolactinoma who developed resistance to bromocriptine to which he had previously responded satisfactorily for 5 years. Subsequently, hyperprolactinemia was controlled equally well with 600 microg <b>quinagolide</b> daily and later with 4. 5 mg cabergoline weekly. This observation suggests that a loss of dopamine receptors at the tumoral cell surface might be the mechanism underlying acquired resistance to bromocriptine. In addition, no tumor growth was observed over a 10 -year follow-up, which virtually excludes a malignant transformation of the prolactinoma. This case emphasizes the need for close supervision of patients with macroprolactinoma, even after the serum prolactin concentration has been normalized by bromocriptine. It furthermore illustrates the usefulness of <b>quinagolide</b> and cabergoline when resistance to bromocriptine develops after a prolonged period of adequate response to this drug...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{regulation}} of mammary cell activity, survival, and proliferation by prolactin (PRL), 5 Holstein cows in early lactation received daily i. m. injections of 1 mg of <b>quinagolide,</b> a suppressor of PRL release, for 9 wk, whereas 4 control cows received the vehicle (water) only. During {{the last week of}} treatment, one udder half was milked once a day (1 ×) and the other twice a day (2 ×). Mammary biopsies were harvested 1 wk before and 4 and 8 wk after the start of <b>quinagolide</b> treatment. The <b>quinagolide</b> injections reduced milk yield and resulted in lower levels of ?-casein and ?-lactalbumin mRNA in the mammary biopsies at wk 4 compared with the control cows. In the mammary tissue of the quinagolide-treated cows at wk 8 of treatment, cell proliferation (as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen labeling) was lower and apoptosis (as determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay) was higher than in the mammary tissue of the control cows. During differential milking, mammary epithelial cells (MEC) were extracted from the milk by centrifugation and purified by immunocytochemical binding to allow variations in the levels of mammary transcripts to be observed. After 9 wk of treatment, levels of ?-lactalbumin and ?-casein mRNA were lower in the MEC isolated from milk of the quinagolide-treated cows. This effect was associated with lower PRL receptor mRNA levels and a tendency toward lower viability in the milk-isolated MEC from the 2 ×-milked glands. The decrease from 2 × milking to 1 × milking also downregulated ?-lactalbumin and ?-casein transcripts in the milk-isolated MEC. Viability was higher for the MEC collected from the 1 ×-milked udder halves compared with the 2 ×-milked halves. In conclusion, the reduction in milk yield after chronic administration of the PRL-release inhibitor <b>quinagolide</b> is associated with a reduction in mammary cell activity, survival, and proliferation in lactating dairy cows. Reduced milking frequency was also associated with a decrease in MEC activity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dopamine {{agonists}} {{are indicated}} as primary therapy for PRL-secreting pituitary adenomas, while controversial {{results have been}} reported in nonfunctioning adenomas (NFA). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the in vivo visualization of dopamine D 2 receptor expression detected by pituitary scintigraphy using 123 I-methoxybenzamide (123 I-IBZM) was correlated with the response to chronic treatment with <b>quinagolide</b> or cabergoline. PATIENTS: 10 patients affected with NFA (5 men and 5 women, age ranging between 25 and 50 years), and 10 with PRL-secreting naive macroadenomas (3 men and 7 women, age ranging between 22 and 59 years), serving as control. STUDY DESIGN: All patients underwent an acute test with quinagolide: at 3 -day intervals and in random order all patients received the drug (0. 075 mg at 0800 h), or placebo. Blood samples were taken 15 and 5 minutes before and every 30 minutes for 6 h after drug or placebo administration. The test was considered positive when PRL and/or alpha-subunit levels decreased >/= 50 % as compared to baseline levels. After 6 months of treatment, 10 patients were randomised to continue the treatment with <b>quinagolide</b> and the remaining 10 received cabergoline for the remaining 6 months. The doses of <b>quinagolide</b> and cabergoline ranged from 0. 075 to 0. 6 mg/day and from 0. 5 to 3 mg/week, respectively. At study entry, a magnetic resonance imaging (MR) study of the pituitary region and 123 I-IBZM pituitary scintigraphy were performed. MR was repeated after 12 months of treatment to evaluate tumour shrinkage: reduction of tumour volume = 80 % in prolactinomas and = 50 % in NFA was considered significant. Basal PRL levels were 9495. 0 +/- 1131. 6 mU/l in prolactinomas and 602. 4 +/- 50. 5 mU/l in NFA. RESULTS: The scintigraphy was negative in 6 out of 10 patients with NFA. Moderate uptake was observed in 3 patients with prolactinoma and 2 patients with NFA whereas intense uptake was observed in the remaining 7 patients with prolactinoma and 2 patients with NFA. Among the 8 patients with NFA and high circulating alpha-subunit levels, the acute test was negative in 5 while it was positive in the remaining 3 patients. The acute test was positive in all 10 patients with prolactinoma. After 12 months of treatment with <b>quinagolide</b> and cabergoline, circulating PRL levels were decreased in all 10 patients with prolactinoma (571. 8 +/- 255. 9 mU/l), being normalized in 7 patients. Suppression of PRL levels was found in all 10 patients with NFA (89. 5 +/- 2. 3 mU/l). A significant reduction of alpha-subunit levels was obtained in 9 out of 10 patients with NFA: in 4 out of 8 patients alpha-subunit levels were normalized. Significant adenoma shrinkage was recorded in 4 patients with prolactinoma among the 7 with intense pituitary uptake of 123 I-IBZM. Significant adenoma shrinkage was recorded only in the 2 out of 10 patients with NFA with intense pituitary uptake of 123 I-IBZM. A significant positive correlation was found between the degree of uptake (considered as score) and the response to <b>quinagolide</b> or cabergoline treatment (considered as percent hormone suppression) either in patients affected with PRL-secreting adenoma (r = 0. 856, P < 0. 005) or in those affected with NFA (r = 0. 787, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: An intense 123 I-IBZM uptake in patients with non-functioning adenomas was predictive of a good response to a chronic treatment with <b>quinagolide</b> and cabergoline. This result suggests that a pituitary 123 I-IBZM scintigraphy could be considered in selected patients with non-functioning adenomas before starting medical treatment with dopamine agonists.

40|$|Sensory nerves {{regulate}} {{central and}} local reflexes such as airway plasma leakage, and cough and their function may be enhanced during inflammation. Evidence suggests that dopamine receptor agonists may inhibit sensory nerve-mediated responses. In this study dopamine inhibited vagal sensory nerve induced microvascular leakage in the rat. In order {{to characterize the}} receptor involved rat vagus preparations were utilized. <b>Quinagolide</b> (D 2 / 3 agonist), ropinirole (D 2 / 3 / 4 agonist), SKF 38393 (D 1 / 5 agonist), AR-C 68397 AA (Viozan™) (dual D 2 /B 2 agonist) and dopamine inhibited hypertonic saline induced depolarization by approximately 50 %. Data suggests that AR-C 68397 AA and <b>quinagolide</b> also inhibited depolarization of the human vagus. The <b>quinagolide</b> response was blocked by sulpiride (D 2 / 3 antagonist) but not SCH 23390 (D 1 / 5 antagonist); ropinirole was partially blocked by sulpiride, totally blocked by spiperone (at a concentration that blocks all dopamine receptors) but not by SCH 23390. The response to SKF 38393 was not blocked by sulpiride but was by SCH 23390. The inhibition evoked by AR-C 68397 AA was only partially blocked by SCH 23390 but not by sulpiride or spiperone whereas dopamine was blocked by spiperone. The effect of dopamine was not stimulus-specific as it inhibited capsaicin-induced depolarization of the rat vagus in a spiperone sensitive manner. In conclusion, dopamine receptor ligands inhibit depolarization of the rat and human vagus. These data suggest that dopamine receptor agonists may be of therapeutic benefit {{in the treatment of}} symptoms such as cough and mucus secretion which are evident in respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease...|$|E
40|$|Objective and Patients: Twenty-four {{pituitary}} adenomas from acromegalic patients (13 females, 11 males; {{age range}} 19 - 65 yr) were characterized for somatostatin receptor subtype 2 A (sst 2 A), dopamine D 2 receptor (D 2 R), GH, and prolactin (PRL) expression by immunohistochemistry, and results {{correlated with the}} in vitro and in vivo hormone responses to octreotide and <b>quinagolide.</b> In nine cases, GH and PRL content was further studied by immunoelectron microscopy. Results: Immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively scored as 2 (> 50 % stained cells), 1 (10 - 50 % stained cells), and 0 (< 10 % stained cells). Sst 2 Awas scored as 2 in 13 cases, 1 in 10, and 0 in one; D 2 R was scored as 2 in 13 cases, 1 in nine, and 0 in 2; GH was 2 in 15 cases and 1 in nine; PRL was 2 in six cases, 1 in 13, and 0 in 5. Sst 2 A{{was positively correlated with}} in vitro (P = 0. 003) and in vivo (P = 0. 006) percent GH suppression by octreotide and with the chronic suppression of IGF-I by somatostatin analogs (P = 0. 008). D 2 R was positively correlated with in vitro percent GH (P = 0. 000) and PRL (P = 0. 005) suppression by <b>quinagolide.</b> Electron microscopy revealed two pure somatotroph adenomas, five somatomammotrophs with a variable coexpression of GH and PRL in the same cells, and two tumors consisting of mixed cell types, which were less sensitive to <b>quinagolide</b> and octreotide. Conclusion: Sst 2 Aand D 2 R are frequently coexpressed in adenomas from acromegalic patients, and immunohistochemistry may be helpful in characterizing receptor expression in pituitary adenomas to select patients responsive to different treatments.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine and femoral neck levels and biochemical parameters of bone turnover in 20 consecutive hyperprolactinemic males before and after an 18 -month treatment with different dopamine agonists. Six patients received bromocriptine at a dose of 2. 5 - 10 mg/day; 7 patients received <b>quinagolide</b> at a dose of 0. 075 - 0. 3 mg/day; 7 patients received cabergoline at a dose of 0. 5 - 1. 5 mg/week. BMD, serum PRL, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and osteocalcin (OC), and urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (Ntx) levels were measured before and every 6 months during treatment. At study entry, BMD values were lower in patients than controls at both lumbar spine (0. 82 +/- 0. 03 vs. 1. 18 +/- 0. 01 g/cm 2; P < 0. 001) and femoral neck (0. 85 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0. 92 +/- 0. 02 g/cm 2; P < 0. 05) levels. Osteopenia or osteoporosis was diagnosed in 16 patients at the lumbar spine and in 6 {{of them at the}} femoral neck level. A significant inverse correlation was found between lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD values and both PRL levels and disease duration (P < 0. 01). In the 20 patients, serum OC levels were significantly lower (2. 1 +/- 0. 1 vs. 9. 3 +/- 2. 4 microg/L; P < 0. 01), whereas Ntx levels were significantly higher (157. 8 +/- 1. 1 vs. 96. 4 +/- 7. 4 nmol bone collagen equivalent/mmol creatinine; P < 0. 001) than control values. A significant inverse correlation was found between serum PRL and OC (P < 0. 01), but not Ntx, levels. After 18 months of treatment, serum PRL levels were suppressed, and gonadal function was restored in all 20 patients, as shown by the normalization of serum T (from 2. 2 +/- 0. 2 to 5. 0 +/- 0. 2 microg/L) and dihydrotestosterone (0. 3 +/- 0. 02 vs. 0. 5 +/- 0. 01 nmol/L) levels, without any significant difference among groups. A progressive significant increase in serum OC levels together with a significant decrease in Ntx levels were observed after 6, 12, and 18 months of treatment in the 3 groups of patients. A slight, although significant, increase in BMD values was recorded in all patients after 18 months of bromocriptine, <b>quinagolide,</b> and cabergoline treatment, serum OC levels were normalized after treatment, whereas neither urinary Ntx levels nor BMD values were normalized by 18 months of treatment with dopaminergic agents. In conclusion, treatment with bromocriptine, <b>quinagolide,</b> and cabergoline for 18 months, although successfull in suppressing serum PRL levels and restoring gonadal function, was unable to restore lumbar spine and femoral neck BMD and normalize Ntx levels.

The anamnesis revealed allergic reactions to the administration of analgesics and antibiotics. The administration of dopamine agonist drugs, such as bromocriptine (BRC; 2. 5 mg) or lisuride (0. 2 mg), induced {{after a few minutes}} the appearance of nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension, headache, edema of the glottis with dispnea and acroedema. The edemas disappeared a few hours after the administration of antihistaminic drugs while nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension and headache persisted for a few days. Therefore, the patient was tested with another dopamine agonist non-ergot-derived drug, <b>quinagolide</b> (CV 205 - 502), which did not cause side effects or allergic reactions. Furthermore, not only was the responsiveness to the drug optimal but it also normalized the PRL levels, and menses reappeared after more than a 5 -year amenorrhea. This report suggests that ergot-derived drugs, such as lisuride and BRC, seldom induce allergic reactions apart from common side effects.

40|$|THE EFFECTIVENESS {{of medical}} {{treatment}} in acromegaly {{is based on}} the suppression of circulating GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations, remission of clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, and tumor shrinkage. Dopamine agonist drugs, in particular bromocriptine (BRC), have been used for over 20 yr in the medical therapy of acromegaly (1 – 3). Results often are disappointing because normalization of serum GH levels is reported only in 20 % of patients, although clinical improvement occurs in approximately 50 % of cases (4). Moreover, the effects of dopaminergic drugs in responsive patients are usually short-lasting (5). Since long-acting somatostatin analogs have became available, pharmacotherapy of acromegaly has significantly improved, and normalization of hormone levels has been reached in up to 50 % of acromegalics (6). The appearance of side effects, the need of thrice-daily administrations, and the high cost of the treatment are current limitations. It has been reported recently that <b>quinagolide</b> (CV 205 – 502) causes a suppression of GH levels more prolonged than BRC (7) and that it is effective either alone or combined with octreotide in a few acromegalics (8).

40|$|Medical {{treatment}} of acromegaly with dopamine agonists possesses 2 main advantages: the oral {{administration and the}} low costs. In this study, we reported {{on the results of}} chronic treatments with <b>quinagolide</b> (CV 205 - 502), cabergoline (CAB) and long-acting depot preparation of bromocriptine (BRC-LAR) in 34 acromegalics. Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of different treatment: CV 205 - 502 given to 16 patients at the dose of 0. 3 - 0. 6 mg/day for 6 months; CAB given to 11 patients at the dose of 1. 0 - 2. 0 mg weekly for 6 months; and BRC-LAR injected into 7 patients at the dose of 100 mg/month for 6 - 12 months. Basal and oral glucose tolerance test-stimulated serum GH levels, basal and TRH-stimulated PRL levels, plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels, computed tomography scan, and/or magnetic resonance imaging were assessed before and quarterly during treatments. The chronic administration of CV 205 - 502, CAB, and BRC-LAR caused a significant decrease of circulating GH, IGF-I, and PRL levels (P < 0. 005). Normalization of circulating GH and IGF-I levels was obtained in 7 of 16 (43. 8 %) patients treated with CV 205 - 502. Serum GH response to oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) significantly improved (P < 0. 005), and PRL levels were significantly suppressed during treatments. No correlation was found between basal and TRH-stimulated PRL levels and GH suppression during different therapies. Immunohistochemical staining revealed 19 GH-positive and 10 GH + PRL-positive adenomas. A significant association was found between GH/PRL staining and responsiveness to chronic treatments (chi 2 = 7. 985, P < 0. 005). Three patients had significant adenoma shrinkage.

40|$|In most mammals, {{prolactin}} (PRL) {{is essential}} for maintaining lactation and its suppression inhibits lactation. However, the involvement of PRL in the control of ruminant lactation is less clear because inconsistent effects on milk yield have been observed with short-term suppression of PRL by bromocriptine. Therefore, several experiments were conducted to assess the galactopoietic role of PRL. In an initial experiment, cows in early lactation received daily injections of the dopamine agonist <b>quinagolide</b> (QUIN) for 9 weeks. QUIN reduced milking-induced PRL release and caused a faster decline in milk production. Milk production was correlated {{with the amount of}} PRL released at milking. QUIN reduced mammary epithelial cell activity, survival and proliferation. In goats, QUIN did not affect either basal or milking induced PRL release and milk production, whereas injection of cabergoline, another dopamine agonist, caused a decrease of 28 % of milk yield the day after the injection. In another experiment, cows were injected for 5 d with QUIN; QUIN + injection of bPRL at milking time; or vehicles. Again, milk, protein and lactose yield were decreased by QUIN. Although PRL injections were not sufficient to restore milk yield, they tended to increase milk protein and lactose yields and increased the viability of milk purified mammary epithelial cells. In late lactation cows, QUIN decreased milk production within the first day of treatment and induced a more rapid changes in several markers of mammary gland involution after drying-off. Similarly, injection at drying-off of cabergoline hastened mammary involution and enhanced mammary gland remodeling. Recently, we stimulated PRL secretion with daily injection of the dopamine antagonist domperidone for 5 weeks. Milk production increased gradually and was greater in domperidone-treated cows during the last 4 weeks of the treatment period. Milk production of both groups became similar again 5 d after the last injection. In conclusion, these data, combined with those from other studies, provide a good body of evidence that PRL is galactopoietic in dairy ruminants...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we report}} the {{clinical}} presentation, response to medical treatment, and long-term follow-up of 26 patients with prolactinoma (15 macro- and 11 micro-adenomas) diagnosed {{at the age}} of 7 - 17 yr. All patients were first treated with bromocriptine (BRC) at doses ranging from 2. 5 - 20 mg/day orally. BRC was discontinued for intolerance and/or resistance to the drug and was replaced by <b>quinagolide</b> (CV) at doses ranging from 0. 075 - 0. 6 mg/day or by cabergoline at doses ranging from 0. 5 - 3. 5 mg/week orally. Two patients received external conventional radiotherapy after surgery. In 7 prepubertal males and 6 females with macroprolactinoma, headache and/or visual defects were the first symptoms. All females presented with primary or secondary amenorrhea. Growth arrest was observed in a male patient with microadenoma, whereas all the remaining patients had normal heights, and pubertal development was appropriate for their age. Spontaneous or provocative galactorrhea was observed in 12 patients (3 males and 9 females) and gynecomastia in 4 males. Mean serum PRL concentration (+/-SE) at the time of diagnosis was 1080 +/- 267 microg/L in patients with macroadenoma and 155 +/- 38 microg/L in patients with microadenoma. In 10 patients, BRC normalized PRL levels and caused variable, but significant, tumor shrinkage. CV normalized PRL concentrations and reduced tumor size in 5 patients. Cabergoline normalized PRL concentrations in 7 of 10 patients resistant to CV. Pregnancy occurred in 2 patients while on treatment. Pregnancies were uncomplicated, and the patients delivered normal newborns at term. Only 4 patients are still moderately hyperprolactinemic. Impairment of other pituitary hormone secretion was documented at the time of diagnosis in 7 patients, 5 of whom underwent surgery. Four patients became GH deficient in adult age.

40|$|Cabergoline (CAB), a new, potent, and {{long-lasting}} PRL-lowering agent, {{was shown}} {{to be effective in}} tumoral hyperprolactinemia. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effectiveness of CAB in patients with prolactinoma proven to be resistant to bromocriptine (BRC) and <b>quinagolide</b> (CV 205 - 502). Twenty-seven patients (19 macro- and 8 microprolactinomas) were treated with CAB at a weekly dose of 0. 5 - 3 mg for 3 - 22 months. All patients were previously shown to be resistant to BRC, and 20 of them were resistant to CV 205 - 502 as well. Basal serum PRL levels before CAB treatment ranged from 108 - 3500 micrograms/L in macroprolactinomas and from 64 - 205 micrograms/L in microprolactinomas. Gonadal failure was present in all patients, whereas symptoms of tumor expansion, such as visual field defects and headache, were present in 10 of 27 patients. Eight macroprolactinomas had previously undergone surgery and/or radiotherapy. CAB treatment normalized serum PRL levels in 15 of 19 macroprolactinomas and in all 8 microprolactinomas. In 3 of the remaining 4 patients it caused a notable decrease in prolactinemia (89 %, 80. 5 %, and 68. 7 % of the baseline). Only 1 patient was withdrawn from CAB therapy after 3 months at the weekly dose of 2 mg due to the absence of any significant clinical, hormonal, or radiological improvement. Gonadal function was restored in 18 of 27 patients, galactorrhea disappeared in 5 of 6 women, and headache improved in 7 of 8 patients. A significant tumor shrinkage was detected by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging in 9 macroprolactinomas and 4 microprolactinomas. CAB was well tolerated by all patients, except 6 who referred slight and short-lasting nausea, postural hypotension, abdominal pain, dizziness, and sleepiness at the beginning of treatment. In particular, CAB was well tolerated by 19 patients previously shown to be poorly tolerant to BRC and CV 205 - 502. In conclusion, CAB may represent, at the moment, the only successful therapy for prolactinoma-bearing patients resistant to BRC and CV 205 - 502, as it normalized PRL levels in 22 of 27 patients, reduced tumor size in 13 of 27 patients, and improved clinical symptoms in 25 of 27 patients in the present study...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{the last}} decade, the {{treatment}} of macroprolactinomas has been significantly improved by the introduction in the clinical practice of new drugs with dopamine-agonist properties. In particular, the availability of different forms of bromocriptine (BRC) with long duration of action and slow absorption, suitable for injectable (BRC-LAR) or oral (BRC-SRO) administration, has allowed one to obtain a more constant bromocriptinemia than with standard BRC, thus reducing adverse reactions. Moreover, a selective action on dopamine D 2 receptors has been achieved using a new non-ergot derivative: the <b>quinagolide</b> (CV 205 - 502). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of BRC-LAR, BRC-SRO and CV 205 - 502 in 34 patients with macroprolactinoma. PROTOCOL OF THE STUDY: BRC-LAR was given at the monthly dose of 50 - 100 mg for 6 - 24 months to 8 patients whose PRL levels were 150 - 700 micrograms/l. BRC-SRO was given at the daily dose of 5 - 20 mg for 1 - 24 months to 10 patients whose PRL levels were 120 - 900 micrograms/l. CV 205 - 502 was given at the daily dose of 0. 075 - 0. 6 mg for 6 - 12 months to 16 patients whose PRL levels were 250 - 2, 050 micrograms/l. CT and/or MRI scans were performed before and during treatment to evaluate tumor shrinkage. Data are presented as Mean +/- SD. RESULTS. Serum PRL levels normalized in 8 / 8 with BRC-LAR, 7 / 10 with BRC-SRO and 12 / 16 patients with CV 205 - 502. A significant shrinkage of tumor mass was obtained in 7 / 8 with BRC-LAR, 9 / 10 with BRC-SRO and 16 / 16 patients with CV 205 - 502, with consequent improvement of visual-field defects. Overall, the drugs were rather well tolerated: no patient stopped BRC-LAR or BRC-SRO and only 2 stopped CV 205 - 502. In particular, nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension that disappeared spontaneously were observed in 5 / 8 with BRC-LAR, 4 / 10 with BRC-SRO and 4 / 16 with CV 205 - 502. CONCLUSIONS: The medical approach with long-acting BRC preparations and CV 205 - 502 which selectively binds D 2 receptors allows one to obtain rapid normalization of PRL levels and shrinkage of macroprolactinomas in a large series of patients. These drugs are rather well tolerated also by patients proven to be untolerant to standard BRC...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{previously}} shown that the long-term inhibition of milking-induced prolactin (PRL) release by <b>quinagolide</b> (QN), a dopamine agonist, reduces milk yield in dairy cows. To further demonstrate that PRL is galactopoietic in cows, we performed a short-term experiment that used PRL injections to restore the release of PRL at milking in QN-treated cows. Nine Holstein cows were assigned to treatments during three 5 -d periods in a 3 × 3 Latin square design: 1) QN: twice-daily i. m. injections of 1 mg of QN; 2) QN-PRL: twice-daily i. m. injections of 1 mg of QN and twice-daily (at milking time) i. v. injections of PRL (2 µg/kg body weight); and 3) control: twice-daily injections of the vehicles. Mammary epithelial cells (MEC) were purified from milk so that their viability could be assessed, and mammary biopsies were harvested for immunohistological analyses of cell proliferation using PCNA and STAT 5 staining. In both milk-purified MEC and mammary tissue, the mRNA levels of milk proteins and BAX were determined using real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Daily QN injections reduced milking-induced PRL release. The area under the PRL curve was similar in the control and PRL injection treatments, but the shape was different. The QN treatment decreased milk, lactose, protein, and casein production. Injections of PRL did not restore milk yield but tended to increase milk protein yield. In mammary tissue, the percentage of STAT 5 -positive cells was reduced during QN but not during QN-PRL {{in comparison with the}} control treatment. The percentage of PCNA-positive cells was greater during QN-PRL injections than during the control or QN treatment and tended to be lower during QN than during the control treatment. In milk-purified MEC, κ-casein and α-lactalbumin mRNA levels were lower during QN than during the control treatment, but during QN-PRL, they were not different from the control treatment. In mammary tissue, the BAX mRNA level was lower during QN-PRL than during QN. The number of MEC exfoliated into milk was increased by QN injections but tended to be decreased by PRL injections. Injections of PRL also increased the viability of MEC harvested from milk. Although PRL injections at milking could not reverse the effect of QN treatment on milk production, their effects on cell survival and exfoliation and on gene expression suggest that the effect of QN treatment on the mammary gland is due to QN's inhibition of PRL secretion...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of a chronic treatment with the non-ergot-derived dopamine agonist <b>quinagolide</b> (CV 205 - 502) on sexual and gonadal function in hyperprolactinemic males. Thirteen males with macroprolactinoma and one with microprolactinoma were treated with CV 205 - 502 at the dose of 0. 15 - 0. 6 mg/day for 6 - 24 months. Baseline prolactin (PRL) was 464 +/- 75. 7 microg/l. All the patients suffered from libido impairment, five of reduced sexual potency, six had infertility and in four bilateral induced galactorrhea was shown. The semen analysis revealed a severe oligoasthenospermia with reduced sperm count, motility and forward progression, with an abnormal morphology and decreased viability. A significant reduction of serum PRL levels (nadir PRL = 12. 3 +/- 5. 4 microg/l) was obtained during the treatment. Normalization of prolactinemia was reached in 13 of the 14 patients after 3 months. After 1 year, a significant improvement of sperm parameters, in terms of increase of number (from 5600 +/- 111 to 20, 564 +/- 587 mm 3), motility at 1 h (from 24. 8 +/- 0. 1 to 52. 6 +/- 0. 5 %), forward progression (from 24 +/- 1. 4 to 62. 3 +/- 2. 9 %) and normal morphology (from 53. 8 +/- 2. 5 to 62. 2 +/- 2. 4 %), was recorded. In addition, a significant increase of serum follicle-stimulating hormone (from 5. 3 +/- 0. 6 to 7. 8 +/- 0. 4 U/l), luteinizing hormone (from 4. 4 +/- 0. 5 to 7. 7 +/- 0. 4 U/l) and testosterone (from 3. 4 +/- 0. 4 to 4. 7 +/- 0. 2 microg/l) was recorded. A significant increase of luteinizing hormone (9. 4 +/- 0. 7 U/l) and testosterone (5. 2 +/- 0. 4 microg/l), as well as a further improvement of sperm parameters, was found after 2 years of therapy. Sellar computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance showed a considerable shrinkage (> or = 30 %) of tumoral mass in 8 out of 13 patients with macroprolacinoma. Side effects were recorded in only one patient. In conclusion, the treatment with CV 205 - 502 normalizing PRL levels improves gonadal and sexual function and fertility in males with prolactinoma, providing good tolerability and excellent patient compliance to medical treatment. This result demonstrates that the impairment of gonadal function in hyperprolactinemic patients is a functional modification...|$|E
