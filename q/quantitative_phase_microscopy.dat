In this report, we present the first dispersion phase imaging of living eukaryotic cells. We have developed quantitative dispersion microscopy {{based on the}} principle of <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>microscopy.</b> The dual-wavelength quantitative phase microscope makes phase measurements at 310 nm and 400 nm wavelengths to quantify dispersion (refractive index increment ratio) of live cells. The measured dispersion of living HeLa cells is found to be around 1. 088, which agrees well with that measured directly for protein solutions using total internal reflection.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel multimodal microscopy system that incorporates confocal Raman, confocal reflectance, and <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>microscopy</b> (QPM) into a single imaging entity. Confocal Raman microscopy provides detailed chemical information from the sample, while confocal reflectance and <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>microscopy</b> show detailed morphology. Combining these intrinsic contrast imaging modalities {{makes it possible to}} obtain quantitative morphological and chemical information without exogenous staining. For validation and characterization, we have used this multi-modal system to investigate healthy and diseased blood samples. We first show that the thickness of a healthy red blood cell (RBC) shows good correlation with its hemoglobin distribution. Further, in malaria infected RBCs, we successfully image the distribution of hemozoin (malaria pigment) inside the cell. Our observations lead us to propose morphological screening by QPM and subsequent chemical imaging by Raman for investigating blood disorders.

50|$|Transparent objects, {{like living}} {{biological}} cells, are traditionally viewed in a {{phase contrast microscope}} or in a differential interference contrast microscope. These methods visualize phase shifting transparent objects by distorting the bright field image with phase shift information. Instead of distorting the bright field image, transmission DHM creates a separate phase shift image showing the optical thickness of the object. Digital holographic microscopy thus {{makes it possible to}} visualize and quantify transparent objects and is therefore also referred to as <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> contrast <b>microscopy.</b>|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the narrow}} focal depth of {{conventional}} microscopy, live cell imaging is {{to a large extent}} currently limited to observing cells on a single plane. Most implementations of <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> contrast <b>microscopy</b> allow for images to be created and focused at different focal planes from a single exposure. This opens up the future possibility of 3-dimensional live cell imaging by means of fluorescence techniques. A marker-free holographic technique that instead relies on complex deconvolution has been implemented and commercialized, which provides access to the non-invasive 3-dimensional imaging of live single cells.|$|R
40|$|Using novel {{interferometric}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>microscopy</b> methods, we {{demonstrate that}} the surface integral of the optical phase associated with live cells is invariant to cell water content. Thus, we provide an entirely noninvasive method to measure the nonaqueous content or “dry mass” of living cells. Given the extremely high stability of the interferometric microscope and the femtogram sensitivity of the method to changes in cellular dry mass, this new technique is not only ideal for quantifying cell growth but also reveals spatially resolved cellular and subcellular dynamics of living cells over many decades in a temporal scale. Specifically, we present quantitative histograms of individual cell mass characterizing the hypertrophic effect of high glucose in a mesangial cell model. In addition, we show that in an epithelial cell model observed {{for long periods of}} time, the mean squared displacement data reveal specific information about cellular and subcellular dynamics at various characteristic length and time scales. Overall, this study shows that interferometeric <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> <b>microscopy</b> represents a noninvasive optical assay for monitoring cell growth, characterizing cellular motility, and investigating the subcellular motions of living cells...|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} {{implementation}} of an image sensor chip, termed wavefront image sensor chip (WIS), that can measure both intensity/amplitude and phase front variations of a light wave separately and quantitatively. By monitoring the tightly confined transmitted light spots through a circular aperture grid in a high Fresnel number regime, we can measure both intensity and phase front variations with a high sampling density (11 µm) and high sensitivity (the sensitivity of normalized phase gradient measurement is 0. 1 mrad under the typical working condition). By using WIS in a standard microscope, we can collect both bright-field (transmitted light intensity) and normalized phase gradient images. Our experiments further demonstrate that the normalized phase gradient images of polystyrene microspheres, unstained and stained starfish embryos, and strongly birefringent potato starch granules are improved versions of their corresponding differential interference contrast (DIC) microscope images {{in that they are}} artifact-free and <b>quantitative.</b> Besides <b>phase</b> <b>microscopy,</b> WIS can benefit machine recognition, object ranging, and texture assessment for a variety of applications...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{characterization}} of red blood cell (RBC) structure and its dynamics with nanometric sensitivity using transport of intensity equation microscopy (TIEM). Conventional transport of intensity technique requires three intensity images and hence is not suitable for studying real-time dynamics of live biological samples. However, assuming the sample to be homogeneous, phase retrieval using transport of intensity equation has been demonstrated with single defocused measurement with x-rays. We adopt this technique for <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> light <b>microscopy</b> of homogenous cells like RBCs. The main merits of this technique are its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of implementation on a conventional microscope. The phase information can be easily merged with regular bright-field and fluorescence images to provide multidimensional (three-dimensional spatial and temporal) information without any extra complexity in the setup. The phase measurement from the TIEM has been characterized using polymeric microbeads and the noise stability of the system has been analyzed.

40|$|Digital {{holographic}} microscopy (DHM) is {{utilized for}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>phase</b> contrast <b>microscopy</b> in optical testing of reflective or transparent specimens and allows altering the focus numerically by propagating the complex wave. Especially for compensation of deformations or displacements and for long-term investigations of living cells, a reliable region selective numerical readjustment {{of the focus}} {{is of particular interest}} in digital holographic microscopy. Since this method is time consuming, a Halton point set with low discrepancy has been chosen. By this, the effective axial resolution can be enhanced numerically by post processing of complex wave fronts without narrowing the field of view leading to a loss of information around the focus plane by blurring. The concept of numerical parametric lenses is another key feature in DHM and used to correct aberrations in the reconstructed wave front caused by the setup. To reduce the number of parameters for parametric lenses, the polynomial basis by Forbes is applied for the needs of DHM. Both numerical approaches have been characterized and adapted to the requirements of DHM.
