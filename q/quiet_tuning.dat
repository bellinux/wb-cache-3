60|$|There {{ought to}} be a {{symmetry}} between all the parts and orders of a state. A poor clergy in an opulent nation can have little correspondence with the body it is to instruct, and it is a disgrace to the public sentiments of religion. Such irreligious frugality is even bad economy, as the little that is given is entirely thrown away. Such an impoverished and degraded clergy in <b>quiet</b> <b>tunes</b> could never execute their duty, and in time of disorder would infinitely aggravate the public confusions.|$|R
2500|$|The {{official}} soundtrack {{consisting of}} 212songs, titled , {{was released on}} November 13, 2013. The album debuted at number 12 on Top Albums Chart and number 3 on the Independent Albums Chart of Billboard-Japan. The soundtrack was released digitally worldwide on November20 through iTunes as Pokémon X & Pokémon Y: Super Music Collection. The soundtrack debuted at 104 on the Billboard 200, and peaked at number 5 on the Billboard soundtracks chart. Jim Sterling of Destructoid praised the music as [...] "utterly lovely", noting [...] "the <b>quieter</b> <b>tunes</b> are legitimately beautiful".|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{reactions}} to Loyal Wife's first studio effort have been positive. Stephen Carradini at Independentclauses.com called Faux Light [...] "an album of unfolding charms. After the immediate hit of 'Hold Up' and 'In Trouble,' {{the rest of}} the tunes here grew on me. It’s a definite progression, and one worth checking out. If you want passion in your rock and <b>quiet</b> <b>tunes,</b> Loyal Wife should be on your radar." [...] In addition, Josh Macala at the review site Raised By Gypsies, was also enthusiastic about this debut, stating: [...] "Really, this album takes you through such a fantastical journey that if you are not left wanting more after 'light off', then clearly you have no soul." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{popular music}} genres, the {{instrument}} is usually played with amplification and almost exclusively {{played with the}} fingers, pizzicato style. The pizzicato style varies between different players and genres. Some players perform with the sides of one, two, or three fingers, especially for walking basslines and slow tempo ballads, because this is purported to create a stronger and more solid tone. Some players use the more nimble tips of the fingers to play fast-moving solo passages or to pluck lightly for <b>quiet</b> <b>tunes.</b> The use of amplification allows the player to have {{more control over the}} tone of the instrument, because amplifiers have equalization controls that allow the bassist to accentuate certain frequencies (often the bass frequencies) while de-accentuating some frequencies (often the high frequencies, so that there is less finger noise).|$|R

40|$|Most active {{noise control}} (ANC) systems are {{designed}} and analyzed in ideal sound fields, where ANC performances are predictable with acceptable accuracies. In many ANC applications sound fields are non-ideal with significant differences between real ANC performances and theoretical predictions. If one uses an ideal model to optimize locations of actuators or error sensors for an ANC system in a non-ideal sound field, the actual quiet zone is inevitably different from its theoretical prediction. It is desired that users of ANC systems can <b>tune</b> <b>quiet</b> zones by adjusting ANC configurations, such as locations of secondary sources or error sensors. Model-independent ANC (MIANC) systems are preferred for this purpose. In this study, a model-independent ANC system is improved, implemented and applied to create a quiet zone in a non-ideal sound field. Users of the system can adjust locations of actuators or error sensors to tradeoff between sizes of quiet zones and levels of noise attenuations. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate observations and effects of <b>quiet</b> zone <b>tuning</b> using the improved ANC system. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|On this fifth {{solo album}} release, Solheim show her {{considerable}} abilities. In the studio sessions she {{was joined by}} Henry Olsen (Primal Scream, Nico, The Velvet Underground, John Cale and others), Emil Nikolaisen (Serena Maneesh), among other stellar musicians, resulting in a record with songs spanning from <b>quiet,</b> simple guitar-based <b>tunes,</b> through rock, {{and all the way}} to pop. This is an album you even can dance to.|$|R
5000|$|Entertainment Weekly critic Kyle Anderson stated of the soundtrack's second single, [...] "'Jar of Hearts' songstress Christina Perri's fantastically opulent 'A Thousand Years' {{sets the}} tone for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn—Part 1: stark {{acoustic}} strums, cascading strings, and a piercing croon expressing undying adoration." [...] Despite awarding the album a B grade, Anderson noted, [...] "If anything, this is the narrowest Twilight soundtrack yet: Even when the volume shifts from quiet to slightly less <b>quiet,</b> these weepy <b>tunes</b> about eternity and erotic mythical beasts grow wearisome." ...|$|R
5000|$|Caine {{recorded}} five albums, {{also working}} with Karl Jenkins {{who wrote a}} signature <b>tune</b> <b>Quiet</b> Please, The Lady's Gonna Sing using the theme from Sibelius's 5th Symphony. This was her third album, and her second with Jenkins, following the album Behind the Smile. The sweeping, theatrical, delivery of this title track contrasts with the easy, fluid style with which she approaches Ebony Eyes on the same album. However, her persona as cabaret host and comedian seemed to prevent any serious inroads into commercial musical success - though her recordings were marketed globally, in areas as far-flung as Scandinavia, South America and Australasia - with huge numbers bought by television audiences.|$|R
5000|$|Many of the {{recordings}} featuring the song are explicit tribute albums to Charlie Parker or a {{homage to the}} bebop revolution of the 1940s (cf. album titles in list below). Most interpretations follow the bebop respectively hard bop idiom. Exceptions may be e.g. The Modern Jazz Quartet that rewrote the song in their chamber music style (At Music Inn, Vol 2, 1958). Junior Cook played the <b>tune</b> <b>quiet</b> fast and ends his version citing John Coltrane, whereas Joe Lovano begins his twelve-minute-long interpretation as free floating ballad, then taking up speed in 6/8. Even former free jazz musicians like Archie Shepp and Anthony Braxton remember the avantgarde prior to them, but [...] "pay tribute to the spirit and chance-taking of Charlie Parker rather than to merely recreate the past." ...|$|R
5000|$|I. Lacrymosa. A slow marching lament in a {{persistent}} 6/8 rhythm {{with a strong}} tonal center on D. There are three main motives: 1) a syncopated, sequential theme announced by the cellos and answered by a solo bassoon; 2) a broad theme, based on the interval of a major seventh; 3) alternating chords on flute and trombones, outlined by piano, harps and trombones. The first section of the movement is quietly pulsating; the second is a long crescendo leading to a climax based on the first cello theme. There is no pause before:II. Dies irae. A form of Dance of Death, with occasional moments of quiet marching rhythm. The dominating motif of this movement is announced at the start by the flutes and includes an important tremolando figure. Other motives are a triplet repeated-note figure in the trumpets, a slow, smooth tune on the saxophone, and a livelier syncopated one in the brass. The scheme of the movement {{is a series of}} climaxes of which the last is the most powerful, causing the music to disintegrate and to lead directly to:III. Requiem aeternam. Very quietly, over a background of solo strings and harps, the flutes announce the <b>quiet</b> D-major <b>tune,</b> the principal motive of the movement. There is a middle section in which the strings play a flowing melody. This grows to a short climax, but the opening tune is soon resumed, and the work ends quietly in a long sustained clarinet note.|$|R
