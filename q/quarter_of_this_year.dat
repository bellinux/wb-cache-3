The objective <b>of</b> <b>this</b> research is to combine the dewatering and briquetting processes of fine coal preparation into a single stage operation, thereby enhancing the economic viability of utilizing fine coal. A bitumen based emulsion, Orimulsion, {{has proven to be}} an effective hydrophobic binder, which helps not only with the briquetting process but also in the expulsion of water from the coal.

40|$|This {{research}} project focuses on pollutants from the combustion of mixtures of dried municipal sewage sludge (MSS) and coal. The {{objective is to}} determine the relationship between (1) fraction sludge in the sludge/coal mixture, and (2) combustion conditions on (a) NOx concentrations in the exhaust, (b) the size segregated fine and ultra-fine particle composition in the exhaust, and (c) the partitioning of toxic metals between vapor and condenses phases, within the process. To this end we shall use an existing 17 kW downflow laboratory combustor, available with coal and sludge feed capabilities. The proposed study will be conducted in concert with an existing ongoing research on toxic metal partitioning mechanisms for very well characterized pulverized coals alone. Both high NOx and low NOx combustion conditions will be investigated (unstaged and staged combustion). The proposed work uses existing analytical and experimental facilities and draws on 20 years of research on NO{sub x} and fine particles that has been funded by DOE in this laboratory. Four barrels of dried sewage sludge are currently in the laboratory. Insofar as possible pertinent mechanisms will be elucidated.

(b) To identify and quantify the fundamental processes by which the transformations of minerals and organically-associated inorganic species occur. Emphasis will be placed on identifying any changes that occur as a result of combustion under sub-stoichiometric combustion conditions. (c) To incorporate the effects of combustion stoichiometry into an Engineering Model for Ash Formation based upon the understanding developed in (a) and (b). When completed, this model will predict the particle size and chemical composition distributions of ash formed during the combustion of pulverized coal under a broad range of conditions. The work discussed in this report highlights the accomplishments <b>of</b> the seventh <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> two <b>year</b> project. <b>This</b> includes University <b>of</b> Arizona efforts to minimize periodicity in the coal feeder for the drop tube furnace, and MIT efforts to calculate the concentrations of CO, CO{sub 2 }, and O{sub 2 } surrounding a burning char particle. In Section 3, the use of a pulsed gas flow to maintain a smooth coal feed to the drop tube furnace is discussed. Addition of pulsing action, driven by a peristaltic pump, has eliminated the coal feeder pluggage problems that had been occurring. In Section 4, the development of a single particle char combustion model by MIT is discussed.

40|$|The September 11 th {{attacks on}} the United States and the {{consequent}} combat against international terrorism have clouded the short-term outlook for the world economy. World economic growth had already slowed considerably from the final <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> last <b>year.</b> <b>This</b> was in part the consequence of past monetary tightening in reaction to persistently high growth rates in the US {{and the impact of}} rising energy prices. A major impetus, however, came from the bursting of the high-tech investment bubble, accompanied by a marked fall in equity prices, generating a sudden world-wide decline in confidence. Leading indicators in late summer suggested that the bottom of the cycle might have been near, at least for the United States, although the accumulation of debt by the private sector and the related large current account deficit remained a serious risk to growth. The attacks of September 11 have altered this picture drastically. A further deepening of the international cyclical downturn in the remaining part of the year now seems unavoidable, while the previously expected recovery of the international economy will be delayed by at least one to two quarters into early 2002 ( [...] .).

Over many years, governments in most countries have increasingly opened their economies to inter-national trade, whether through the multilateral trading system, increased regional cooperation or as part of domestic reform programmes. Trade and globalization more generally have brought enormous benefits to many countries and citizens. Trade has allowed nations to benefit from specialization and to produce more efficiently. It has raised productivity, supported the spread of knowledge and new technologies, and enriched the range of choices available to consumers. But deeper integration into the world economy has not always proved to be popular, nor have the benefits of trade and globalization necessarily reached all sections of society. As a result, trade scepticism is on the rise in certain <b>quarters.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>year’s</b> Report, whose main theme is “Trade in a Globalizing World”, is to remind ourselves of {{what we know about the}} gains from international trade and the challenges arising from higher levels of integration. The Report addresses a range of interlinking questions, starting with a consideration of what constitutes globalization, what drives it, what benefits does it bring, what challenges does it pose and what role does trade play in <b>this</b> world <b>of</b> ever-growing inter-dependency. The Report asks why some countries have managed to take advantage of falling trade costs and greater policy-driven trading opportunities while others have remained largely outside international commercial relations. It also considers who the winners and losers are from trade and what complementary action is needed from policy-makers to secure the benefits of trade for society at large. In examining these complex and multi-faceted questions, the Report reviews both the theoretical gains from trade and empirical evidence that can help to answer these questions...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundSeasonal {{fluctuations}} in tuberculosis (TB) notifications {{have been identified}} and reported {{in a number of}} countries. Nigeria remains one of the 22 TB high-burden countries (HBCs) in the world, and the notification of TB cases in the country over the years has shown a definite pattern that suggests seasonal variation. Previous studies conducted in India, Japan, Mongolia, the Netherlands, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States have evaluated the seasonality of TB notification. However, in Nigeria, there has been no systematic study to establish that this pattern is not just a myth. This study seeks to establish the seasonal variations suggested by the trend pattern of TB case notification (all forms of TB) in Nigeria over the past ten years. MethodThe yearly TB notification data in Nigeria from 2004 to 2013 was examined for seasonal fluctuations by plotting the quarterly notification figures for the years under review. A rapid trend analysis was done based on the amplitude of the fluctuating curves. Standardization was done by zones. ResultsThe trend analysis showed a spike in the first <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> the year for the ten-year period studied (with the exception of 2005 and 2011). This quarter is generally characterized by the dusty, dry harmattan wind {{in most parts of the}} country, particularly the northern region. The curves generally plummeted in the third quarter and remained in that neighborhood for the rest of the year. The differences in case notification between the first and last quarter for the ten-year period ranged from 347 to 4230 cases notified. The result <b>of</b> <b>this</b> trend analysis when standardized by zones for the six zones of the country was similar to the overall result for the country. ConclusionAccording to the results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> study, there is evidence to suggest that there are seasonal variations in notification of TB cases across the four <b>quarters</b> <b>of</b> the <b>year.</b> <b>This</b> has significant implications for TB control strategies. Further investigation of the reasons for seasonal variations may help to identify risk factors. Also, planning and forecast of TB commodities to order cannot be based on experience from the preceding quarters, but must rather be based on reports from the same quarter in the previous year. Allocation of resources may also have to be intensified during the peak periods in order to adequately control the disease at these periods. FootnotesFurther investigation is required to unmask the reasons for the seasonal variations in TB notification in Nigeria...|$|R
