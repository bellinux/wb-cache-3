40|$|The leakage {{flow through}} {{straight}} through labyrinth seals with tooth on stator was investigated by performing CFD simulations. ANSYS Fluent {{is used to}} simulate the fluid flow through straight through Labyrinth seals. The effect of seal geometry on discharge coefficient, <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> coefficient and expansion factor is studied by varying clearance, pitch, tooth height, tooth width,Reynolds number and rotor speed. Derived <b>quantities</b> Such as <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> coefficient, coefficient of discharge and expansion factor are analyzed {{as a function of}} the tooth with preceding cavity to predict the effectiveness of the seal. To understand the effect of varying seal geometries and swirl, 2 D CFD simulations were performed. It was found that the clearance to pitch ratio is a strong geometry factor which affect the performance of the seal. The carryover coefficient which describes the portion of kinetic energy <b>carried</b> <b>over</b> from one cavity to the next is also examined. It was found to be a function of Reynolds number and shaft speed. Discharge coefficient describes the losses which occur when fluid flows through the cavity and under the tooth. Just like the carryover coefficient, it is also discovered that it is a strong function of Reynolds number and shaft speed...|$|R

40|$|Task {{demands that}} {{influence}} scanning behaviour in one task can cause that behaviour to persist {{to a second}} unrelated task (<b>carry</b> <b>over).</b> This can also affect performance on a second task (e. g., hazard perception ratings), and {{has been attributed to}} a process of attentional bias that is modulated by top-down influences (Thompson & Crundall, 2011). In a series of experiments we explored how these top-down influences impact upon <b>carry</b> <b>over.</b> In all experiments, participants searched letters that were presented horizontally, vertically, or in a random array. They were then presented with a driving scene and rated the hazardousness of the scene. <b>Carry</b> <b>over</b> of eye-movements from the letter search to the scene was observed in all experiments. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that this <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect influenced hazard perception accuracy. The magnitude of <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> was correlated with task switching abilities, attentional conflicting, and attentional orienting (Experiment 1), and was affected by predictability of the primary task (Experiment 2). Furthermore, direct current stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and parietal areas affected the magnitude of the effect (Experiment 3). These results indicate that <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> is modulated by the specific ability to orient attention and disengage from this orientation. Over orienting leads to increased <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> and insufficient task switching is detrimental to task performance. As a result the current experiments provide evidence that the <b>carry</b> <b>over</b> effect is strongly influenced by attentional processes, namely orienting, inhibition, and task switching...|$|R
