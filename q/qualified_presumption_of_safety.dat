It is often used in veterinary applications, especially as a probiotic in pigs, cattle, poultry, and shrimp. Many references to use of this bacterium in humans exist, especially in improving the vaginal flora, improving abdominal pain and bloating in irritable bowel syndrome patients, and increasing immune response to viral challenges. There is evidence from animal research that suggests that Bacillus coagulans is effective in both treating as well as preventing recurrence of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. One strain of this bacterium has also been assessed for safety as a food ingredient. [...] Spores are activated in the acidic environment of the stomach and begin germinating and proliferating in the intestine. Sporeforming B. coagulans strains are used in some countries as probiotics for patients on antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{microbes}} {{are either}} newly isolated genera and species from natural sources or bacterial strains derived from existing bacteria. Novel microbes are gaining increasing attention {{for the general}} aims to preserve and modify foods and to modulate gut microbiota. The use of novel microbes to improve health outcomes {{is of particular interest}} because growing evidence points to the importance of gut microbiota in human health. As well, some recently isolated microorganisms have promise for use as probiotics, although in-depth assessment <b>of</b> their <b>safety</b> is necessary. Recent examples of microorganisms calling for more detailed evaluation include Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Akkermansia muciniphila, fructophilic lactic acid bacteria (FLAB), and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. This paper discusses each candidate's safety evaluation for novel food or novel food ingredient approval according to European Union (EU) regulations. The factors evaluated include their beneficial properties, antibiotic resistance profiling, history of safe use (if available), publication of the genomic sequence, toxicological studies in agreement with novel food regulations, and the <b>qualified</b> <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety.</b> Sufficient evidences have made possible to support and authorize the use of heat-inactivated B. xylanisolvens in the European Union. In the case of A. muciniphila, the discussion focuses on earlier safety studies and the strain's suitability. FLAB are also subjected to standard safety assessments, which, along with their proximity to lactic acid bacteria generally considered to be safe, may lead to novel food authorization in the future. Further research with F. prausnitzii will increase knowledge about its safety and probiotic properties and may lead to its future use as novel food. Upcoming changes in EUU Regulation 2015 / 2283 on novel food will facilitate the authorization of future novel products and might increase the presence of novel microbes in the food market. </p...|$|R

The other important criterion is the presence of transmissible antibiotic resistance markers. This review underlined that the main hazard of bacteria involved in food fermentations concerns antibiotic resistance and particularly the presence of transferable genetic determinants that may present a risk for public health.

30|$|It is {{well known}} that many types of {{bacteria}} and yeast strains are being used to enhance the fermentative reactions in food industries including bread, beer, wine and xylitol (Ortiz et al. 2013). Besides fermentation, these organisms are playing numerous beneficial roles in human, animal health and nutrition. A number of previous studies reported about the use of probiotics for the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal infections including food borne pathogens associated infections (Fooks and Gibson 2002). In addition, it is reported that yeast promotes both human and animal health (Zanello et al. 2009; O’Neil et al. 2012) and enhances the bioavailability of minerals through hydrolysis of phytate, folate biofortification, detoxification of mycotoxins and xenobiotics (Ohashi and Kazunari 2009).

40|$|Background and Objectives: Novel probiotics and {{prebiotics}} {{designed to}} modulate the gut microbiota for improving health outcomes are in demand as {{the importance of}} the gut microbiota in human health is revealed. A review of the scientific literature regarding the current knowledge and novel species and novel oligosaccharides for the treatment of dysbiosis-associated diseases has been carried out due to their growing interest.   Results and Conclusions: The regulations governing introduction of novel probiotics and prebiotics vary by geographical region. Novel foods and foods with health claims fall under specific regulations in several countries. In European Union (EU), safety is assessed by novel food approval process and by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established Quantitative <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>Safety</b> (QPS) system for bacteria and other biologicals. Any messages on health benefits are covered by the European Regulation on Health Claims (ERHC), also assessed by EFSA. Examples of recent novel probiotics in EU include Clostridium butyricum, and Bacteroides xylanisolvens and examples of novel prebiotics include human milk oligosaccharides such as Lacto- N -neotetraose. Yacon root is an example on a previously novel prebiotic food which is allowed due to the reported existing cultivation and use in EU prior to the novel food regulation. Potential future candidates include further human milk oligosaccharides and bacteria such Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermasia muciniphila. Increasing knowledge on human intestinal microbiota and microbiota development enables the design of new more specific and hitherto unknown probiotics and prebiotics. Also understanding the microbe and microbe host interactions facilitates the search for novel probiotics and prebiotics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Surrogacy {{arrangements}} {{have become}} an increasingly popular way for childless people to build a family. Yet many jurisdictions do not regulate surrogacy. Even in the ab-sence of surrogacy regulation, if a jurisdiction has no specific legal rules that clarify parenthood following surrogacy, the result is often uncertainty {{in relation to the}} legal parental status of the surrogate mother, her spouse or cohabitant, any possible donors, and the commissioning parents. This, in turn, leaves the surrogate-born child’s family law status uncertain.    This thesis examines the legal aspects of parenthood and how it is, or could be, determined in Sweden following surrogacy arrangements. Important aims are to estab-lish whether the current national laws regulating family law can sufficiently protect the interests of the surrogate-born child and the parties to surrogacy arrangements, with an emphasis on interests connected to family law status; to examine the ways in which other jurisdictions (England and Wales, and Israel) have responded to similar issues; and to identify problems and propose alternative solutions in relation to the specific issue of establishing legal parenthood following surrogacy at a domestic level, either with or without State regulation of surrogacy agreements.    Consideration is given to whether it might be appropriate to re-evaluate or <b>qualify</b> the existing <b>presumptions</b> <b>of</b> parenthood, in particular the unwritten <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> maternity. Several alternatives for the transfer of legal parenthood from the surrogate mother, and her spouse or cohabitant as the case may be, to the commissioning parent or parents are also examined. In addition, the ethical implications of surrogacy ar-rangements are explored in order to provide an insight into the way in which subcon-scious or hidden values might make it difficult for a State to regulate certain areas of private life such as parenthood.    The starting point for the thesis is that it is {{in the best interests of}} the child to have parents at birth and that this interest must be prioritised over an intended parent’s interest in becoming a parent.

40|$|The {{antibiotic}} resistances of 45 {{lactic acid}} bacteria strains belonging to the genera Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Lactococcus, Pediococcus, and Leuconostoc were investigated. The objective was to determine antibiotic resistances and to verify these at the genetic level, as is currently suggested by the European “qualified <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> safety” <b>safety</b> evaluation system for industrial starter strains. In addition, we sought to pinpoint possible problems in resistance determinations. Primers were used to PCR amplify genes involved in β-lactam antibiotic, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin resistance. The presence of ribosomal protection protein genes and the ermB gene was also determined by using a gene probe. Generally, the incidences of erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, or β-lactam resistances {{in this study were}} low (< 7 %). In contrast, aminoglycoside (gentamicin and streptomycin) and ciprofloxacin resistances were higher than 70 %, indicating that these may constitute intrinsic resistances. The genetic basis for ciprofloxacin resistance could not be verified, since no mutations typical of quinolone resistances were detected in the quinolone determining regions of the parC and gyrA genes. Some starter strains showed low-level ampicillin, penicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline resistances, but no known resistance genes could be detected. Although some strains possessed the cat gene, none of these were phenotypically resistant to chloramphenicol. Using reverse transcription-PCR, these cat genes were shown to be silent under both inducing and noninducing conditions. Only Lactobacillus salivarius BFE 7441 possessed an ermB gene, which was encoded on the chromosome and which could not be transferred in filter-mating experiments. This study clearly demonstrates problems encountered with resistance testing, in that the breakpoint values are often inadequately identified, resistance genes may be present but silent, and the genetic basis and associated resistance mechanisms toward some antibiotics are still unknown...|$|R

Additional to their well-known technological application, dairy propionibacteria increasingly attract attention for their promising probiotic properties. The purpose of this review is to summarize the probiotic characteristics of dairy propionibacteria reported by the updated literature. Indeed, they meet the selection criteria for probiotic bacteria, {{such as the ability}} to endure digestive stressing conditions and to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells. This is a prerequisite to bacterial persistence within the gut. The reported beneficial effects are ranked according to property’s type: microbiota modulation, immunomodulation, and cancer modulation. The proposed molecular mechanisms are discussed. Dairy propionibacteria are described as producers of nutraceuticals and beneficial metabolites that are responsible for their versatile probiotic attributes include short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), conjugated fatty acids, surface proteins, and 1, 4 -dihydroxy- 2 -naphtoic acid (DHNA). These metabolites possess beneficial properties and their production depends on the strain and on the growth medium. The choice of the fermented food matrix may thus determine the probiotic properties of the ingested product.

A total of thirty-four subjects received daily doses of 1 × 10 11 colony-forming units (cfu) of L. rhamnosus PRSF-L 477 (n 17) or placebo (n 17) for a period of 3 weeks, followed by a wash-out period of another 3 weeks. A questionnaire on gastrointestinal tolerance and a diary was kept daily to record compliance throughout these 6 weeks. Faecal and blood samples were collected for microbiological and haematological analysis. The recorded gastrointestinal symptoms, defecation frequency and stool consistency were not influenced indicating that L. rhamnosus PRSF-L 477 was well tolerated.

As {{the identity of the}} strain has been established and as no antibiotic resistance of concern was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is presumed safe for livestock species, for consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. The active agent is not an eye or skin irritant or a skin sensitiser. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent and the high dusting potential of the product tested, the FEEDAP Panel considers it prudent to treat this additive as a respiratory sensitiser. A total of 20 laboratory-scale ensiling studies were conducted with L. plantarum applied at 1 x 109 or 1 x 108 CFU/kg forage. In all the studies, forage containing the additive was compared with untreated control materials, and the duration of the studies was at least 90 days. L. plantarum has the potential to improve the production of silage by increasing lactic acid content and the preservation of dry matter, by reducing the pH and protein degradation. This was demonstrated in a range of easy and moderately difficult to ensile forage materials at a minimum concentration of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material and also in difficult to ensile forage materials when added at a concentration of 1 x 109 CFU/kg fresh material...|$|E
40|$|Within the European Union (EU), the use {{of genetically}} {{modified}} organisms (GMOs) in food production is not widely applied and accepted. In contrast to the United States of America, the current EU legislation limits the introduction of functional foods derived from GMOs that may bring a clear benefit to the consumer. Genetically modified lactic acid bacteria (GM-LAB) {{can be considered as}} a different class of GMOs, and the European Union is preparing regulations for the risk assessment of genetically modified microorganisms. Since these procedures are not yet implemented, the current risk assessment procedure is shared for GMOs derived from micro organisms, plants, or animals. At present, {{the use of}} organisms in food production that have uncontrolled genetic alterations made through random mutagenesis, is permitted, while similar applications with organisms that have controlled genetic alterations are not allowed. The current paper reviews the opportunities that genetically modified lactic acid bacteria may offer the food industry and the consumer. An objective risk profile is described for the use of GM-LAB in food production. To enhance the introduction of functional foods with proven health claims it is proposed to adapt the current safety assessment procedures for (GM) -LAB and suggestions are made for the related cost accountability. A <b>qualified</b> <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>safety</b> as proposed by SANCO (EU SANCO 2003), based on taxonomy and on the history of safe use of LAB applied in food, could in the near future be applied to any kind of LAB or GM-LAB provided that a series of modern profiling methods are used to verify the absence of unintended effects of altered LAB that may cause harm {{to the health of the}} consumer...|$|E
40|$|EFSA {{requested}} the preparation and prioritisation {{of a list}} of microorganism species likely to be notified to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in the future in the regulatory context of food and feed additives, food enzymes and food flavourings by consulting the following EFSA scientific Units (Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP), FEED, Genetically Modified Microorganisms (GMO), Pesticides). This list {{is intended to be}} considered for the annual updates and reviews of the <b>Qualified</b> <b>Presumption</b> <b>of</b> <b>Safety</b> (QPS) recommended list of biological agents. EFSA’s QPS assessment has entered EU law only recently with the publication of a new Commission Implementing Regulation No 562 / 2012 regarding specific data required for risk assessment of food enzymes having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331 / 2008 establishing a common authorising procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings and to the EFSA guidance on data requirements for the evaluation of food enzyme applications. An EFSA internal working group (WG) prepared a list of microorganism species that maybe likely to be notified to EFSA in the near future based on available information relevant in the legal framework. A high number of application dossiers for risk assessment of enzymes are expected to be submitted until March 2015 in the context of enzyme safety evaluation to the FIP Unit and Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) Panel. It is therefore recommended to consider the list as soon as possible by the annual QPS WG of the Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel to avoid where possible any unnecessary toxicity testing for taxonomic units which would potentially receive a QPS recommendation...|$|E
50|$|The <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> {{validity}} {{is another}} way of expressing a burden of proof: the official acts of courts are presumed valid, and those who would challenge them must overcome this presumption. This is also termed the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> regularity.|$|R
40|$|There has {{recently}} been a proliferation of case law dealing with potential inroads into the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in the criminal law of England and Wales, {{in the light of}} article 6 (2) of the European Convention on Human Rights. This article is concerned with the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. It considers two central issues. The first is how the courts should address the question <b>of</b> when the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is interfered with. The second {{is the extent to which}} interference with the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence may be justified on the grounds of proportionality. It is argued that the courts have not developed the appropriate concepts and principles properly to address these questions...|$|R
40|$|This article’s primary {{aim is to}} {{highlight}} the essentially critical potential <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence, {{as well as the}} need for this critical potential to be duly recognized. It is argued that the essential meaning <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence is best understood when approached from what is referred to as its counterfactual status. As a first step, the different values and functions that are attributed to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence in contemporary legal literature are discussed, in order to provide an outline of the central ideas it contains or is supposed to contain. Subsequently, the concept of ‘counterfactuality’ is introduced and it is argued that a counterfactual perspective can further clarify the nature <b>of</b> the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence. Next, a number of fundamental shifts in society and criminal justice are discussed that affect the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence and that lend a large measure of urgency to disclosing its essence and critical potential. The conclusion argues that today’s threats to the <b>presumption</b> <b>of</b> innocence are of a fundamental nature, and that attempts to preserve the principle’s efficacy should focus on the value attached to its counterfactual and critical nature...|$|R
