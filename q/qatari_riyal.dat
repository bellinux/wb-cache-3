The envoy returned with two letters from the Ottomans addressed to Jassim bin Mohammed. A fortnight later, the Al-Buainain tribe appealed to a Mutasarrıf of Al-Hasa, Mahir Pasha. This reinvigorated tensions between the British and the Ottomans, owing to the British belief that this had provided latitude for the Ottomans to exercise more authority over the Qatar Peninsula.|$|R
40|$|Background: Type II {{diabetes}} mellitus (DM) {{is one of}} the leading chronic diseases in Qatar as well as worldwide. However, the risk factors for DM in Qatar and their prevalence are not well understood. We conducted a case-control study with the specific aim of estimating, based on data from outpatients with DM in Qatar (cases) and outpatient/inpatient controls, the association between demographic/ lifestyle factors and DM. Methods: A total of 459 patients with DM from Hamad General Hospital (HGH) outpatient adult diabetes clinics, and 342 control patients from various outpatient clinics and inpatient departments within Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) (years 2006 – 2008), were recruited. The association between risk factors and DM was evaluated using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses. In addition to odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI), we estimated the population attributable risk fractions for the DM demographic/lifestyle risk factors. Results: Qatari nationality was the strongest risk factor for DM (adjusted OR 5. 5; 95 % CI 3. 5 – 8. 6; p, 0. 0001), followed by higher monthly income (defined as $ 3000 <b>Qatari</b> <b>Riyals...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Al Rabban {{was also}} the vice {{president}} and an initial donor of the Taliaa Club Qatar. Taliaa Club Qatar was is a Qatari cultural club that was founded in 1959 with the goals of the club based in foundations and principles of a sports club, but acted more as a political club or party. In 1961, tanks raided the club after Friday prayers, and members were taken to prison. Members were placed in isolation and were restricted from receiving any visitors in prison. Among those arrested was Khalid bin Mohammad al-Rabban, who spent 21 days in prison, and decided to go on a hunger strike. After the intervention of a few relatives of the members, they were released from prison. Some members who were imprisoned referred to those who assisted in their release as servants of God. [...] It is believed this arrest occurred because of controversial publications and plays that inspired the use of violence regarding the Arabs in Palestine in a violent struggle, the use of missiles, he political struggle between nationalists and leftists in Iraq during the reign of Abd al-Karim Qasim. The club also stated in its document of statues that it would interfere in religious and political matters. He also helped establish the Qatari Popular Committee to Support the Palestinian Intifada. This was a committee established in Doha sometime between 1988 and 1994 of 70 wealthy Qatari businessmen to lend financial support to Palestinians during the first Intifada uprising. The committee raised millions of <b>Qatari</b> <b>riyals</b> and partnered with numerous pro-Palestinian organizations including the Palestinian Cooperation foundation.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} oil shocks on Qatar’s gross domestic product using time series data from the period 1970 - 2007 covering all the oil shocks. The Johansen-Juselius (JJ) cointegration test and VECM Granger causality test are employed in this study. From the results we concluded that oil price has {{a positive effect on}} Qatar’s gross domestic product, but at the expense of higher inflation. Qatar seems to have suffered from financial surpluses and rapid economic growth caused by sharp increases in the oil price. At the same time, with a fixed exchange regime and tight monetary policy to deal with these events, this has caused the price of assets to increase sharply, leading to high levels of inflation in Qatar. Based on the results, we recommend that the <b>Qatari</b> currency (<b>riyal)</b> be pegged to a basket of currencies so as to increase the role of monetary policy to deal with the external shocks (oil shocks). ...|$|R
