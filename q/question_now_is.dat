500|$|Bill Carroll, Vice President and Director for the Katz Television Group, a {{consulting}} firm, wondered where the show would head after Grace got married: [...] "The real <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{where is the}} critical development of that show going to be? Now that they've married her off, where is the show's focus?" [...] The Hartford Courants Roger Catlin did not think Grace's and Leo's marriage would last long. [...] "Are we to believe Will & Grace will now be about a married woman, {{her husband and her}} gay roommate? That they'll all still live together? That Connick will no longer have merely special-guest status? The inevitable breakup and annulment to come are as obvious as the sweeps-timing of the ceremony." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{logic of}} the group in English is recursive, based on {{successive}} subsets: working leftwards from the head, the first question that can be asked is [...] "what kind of apples?" [...] (Jonathon apples.) Then, [...] "what kind of Jonathon apples?" [...] (Shiny Jonathon apples.) [...] "What kind of shiny Jonathon apples?" [...] (Beautiful shiny Jonathon apples) [...] "What kind of beautiful shiny Jonathon apples?" [...] (Here the recursive logic changes, {{since this is a}} multivariate, not a univariate, nominal group—the <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> [...] "How many beautiful shiny Jonathon apples?" [...] and after that, [...] "How do those five beautiful shiny Jonathon apples relate to me the speaker/writer, now?" [...] ("Those ones".) In contrast, the logical questions of a univariate group would be unchanged right through, typical of long strings of nouns in news headlines and signage ("International departure lounge ladies' first-class washroom").|$|E
2500|$|The problem lay {{in forming}} a {{primitive}} proposition which encompassed this and {{would act as}} the basis for all of logic. As he stated in correspondence with Russell in late 1913, “The big <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> how must a system of signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of logic!” [...] The importance Wittgenstein placed upon this fundamental problem was so great that he believed if he did not solve it, he had no reason or right to live [...] Despite this apparent life-or-death importance, Wittgenstein had given up on this primitive proposition {{by the time of the}} writing of the Tractatus. The Tractatus does not offer any general process for identifying propositions as tautologies; in a simpler manner, “Every tautology itself shows that it is a tautology.”. This shift to understanding tautologies through mere identification or recognition occurred in 1914 when Moore was called on by Wittgenstein to assist him in dictating his notes.|$|E
5000|$|Glasgow Warriors thus {{qualified}} for a European Champions Cup Quarter Final {{for the first}} time in their history. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was...</b> could they go even further? ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{what would}} be their next move? A great stir among the {{shipping}} seemed to indicate an expedition by water. But whither? Circumstances occurred to perplex the question.|$|R
60|$|The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{should he}} return to Slocum's office or seek outside assistance? He decided upon the latter course. To {{attempt to bring}} the rascally real estate agent to terms alone would be foolhardy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] said he, chuckling to himself. [...] "The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> about hoemoglobin. No {{doubt you}} see the {{significance}} of this discovery of mine?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The {{pressing}} <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> how {{to supply}} {{our young men}} and women, married Christian couples, with proper occupations to prevent their acquiescing in an indolent, useless, selfish life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{there is}} no use in deploring. There is nobody else to take the reins, so you may defy misfortunes. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{what are you going}} to do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Five {{minutes of}} {{struggling}} {{in the current}} found him safe on the opposite shore to that upon which the lower portion of the trail to Chilkoot Pass lay. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> how {{to get back to}} the other side of the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear lord," [...] said Mr. Camperdown, [...] "I shall wash {{my hands}} of the matter altogether. The {{diamonds}} are gone, and the <b>questions</b> <b>now</b> <b>are,</b> who stole them, and where are they? In our business we can't meddle with such questions as those." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> how to {{get down}} the trees, or {{how to get}} his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the {{thinnest}} ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{tell your}} reverence," [...] said Sir Peregrine, [...] "crooked stick though they term him, I had ten times rather have the dealing with him than with those comely great lubbers his brothers! The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> shall I {{tell him what}} is in store for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{cannot be}} the least doubt {{that he would have}} made a murderous attack upon me. It is, however, a game at which two may play. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> whether we should take a {{premature}} lunch here, or run our chance of starving before we reach the buffet at Newhaven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The wicked {{creature}} {{will never}} bother us again," [...] said the King. [...] "Yet {{it was only}} by accident we {{found a way to}} destroy it. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> what shall we do with this long, thin Dragon? If we leave it here it will trip any one who stumbles against it." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the trade}} Jazz had an up tempo team which {{led them to}} long winning streaks along with moving up the western conference standings. As a result, the Jazz had {{virtually}} clinched a spot in for the playoffs, the <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> which spot they would clinch.|$|R
60|$|The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> how to {{get down}} the trees, or {{how to get}} his dogs down? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the {{thinnest}} ones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple [hesitate] to ram them down with poles.|$|R
5000|$|... "Finally, Mozilla had {{a product}} that could compete with Microsoft. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> how to {{publicize}} it. Open-source management seemed to work well {{when it came to}} developing software. But open-source marketing was an unexplored concept. Would people be willing to volunteer {{to get the word out}} on Firefox? Baker thought they might, and one reason was Asa Dotzler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{difficulty}} {{is the more}} formidable of the two, for I think that we shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain forever a mystery. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> what shall we do with this poor wretch's body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} know all that. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{what can we do}} to help her? She is living now at this present moment, an orderly, sober life; but without occupation, or means, or friends. Will your wife let her come to her,--for a month or so, just to try her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, {{merely an}} exaggeration of scenes that must often have {{happened}} before. But the <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{whether you think}} there is any immediate danger of her husband's death; for in that case, I think, from what I have observed of her feelings, she would be pained afterwards to have been kept in ignorance.' ...|$|E
60|$|He had failed, that <b>was</b> evident. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{how to save}} himself. With a sudden, catlike {{movement}} he whirled over on his back, {{caught his}} heel in a tiny, saucer-shaped depression and sat up. Then his courage failed him. Day had at last penetrated {{to the floor of}} the valley, and he was appalled at the frightful distance.|$|R
60|$|The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> {{should she}} return again to Mrs. Wace, {{in the village}} of Lower Wessex, or wait in the town at which she had arrived. She would have {{preferred}} to go back, but the distance was too great; moreover, having left the place for good, and somewhat dramatically, to become a bride, a return, even for so short a space, would have been a trifle humiliating.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly;--some day, {{when the}} {{difficulty}} about {{the chairs and}} tables can settle itself. The real <b>question</b> <b>now</b> is,--what <b>am</b> I to do with myself when papa and mamma are gone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see might {{is right}} upon the waters,' he explained, {{with a smile}} which broke his whole face up into crinkles. 'I am an old soldier, a tough {{fighting}} man, and you are two raw lads. I have a knife, and you are unarmed. D'ye see the line of argument? The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> Where are we to go?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{somewhat}} lucky {{for all these}} people," [...] Ned said to himself, [...] "that I happened to fall in with Mynheer Genet. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> how to warn them. I see there are three orders of arrest against people here, and ten names on the suspected list. At any rate I can warn them myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> {{which of}} us two has mistaken it; {{and if it}} appear I have not, the world will suspect, [...] "what gentleman that was, who was allowed to speak twice in parliament, because {{he had not yet}} spoken to the question[A];" [...] and perhaps {{conclude}} it to be the same, who, as it is reported, maintained a contradiction in terminis, in the face of three hundred persons.|$|E
3000|$|... {{sufficiently}} large. A natural <b>question</b> <b>now</b> arises. What <b>is</b> an oscillation constant for equation (1.1) where [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or {{any other}} class {{that is less}} {{familiar}} with him," [...] retorted Bridge; [...] "but the burning <b>question</b> just <b>now</b> <b>is</b> pots, not poetry--flesh pots. I'm hungry. I could eat a cow." ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>now</b> {{whether this}} <b>is</b> {{the same thing}} asfor an {{arbitrary}} real number [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would not}} for another kingdom be the pasty which should {{encounter}} thee {{after such a}} vigil," [...] said the King; [...] "but the <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> not of thy dinner, but of my own. I admit to my table this day, and in strict privacy, the Cardinal Balue and this Burgundian--this Count de Crevecoeur--and something may chance; the devil is most busy when foes meet on terms of truce." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} a serious {{imputation}} upon the prudence of my friend, to have made even such trivial sacrifices {{as it was in}} his power to make for principles which he did not truly embrace or did not perfectly understand. In either case the folly would have been great. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is,</b> whether, when he first practically professed Whig principles, he understood what principles he professed, and whether in his book he has faithfully expressed them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{perfectly}} {{satisfied that}} so far as you are concerned I have not made any error. With twenty well-armed men I should not try to maintain my position, for to hold out against an attack would be impossible, and the only <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> whether we can escape. Having been here once I will come again, and {{at some time in}} the future you shall hear that I succeeded in bringing away treasure from this same wonderful city." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{decanter}} {{almost fell}} from the archdeacon's hand upon the table, and the start he made was so great as to make his wife jump up from her chair. Not accept the deanship! If it really ended in this, {{there would be no}} longer any doubt that his father-in-law <b>was</b> demented. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was</b> whether a clergyman with low rank and preferment amounting to less than £200 a year should accept high rank, £1,200 a year, {{and one of the most}} desirable positions which his profession had to afford! ...|$|R
60|$|It needed {{care and}} skill. We watched her for hours, and she {{showed no sign}} or gleam of recovery. Her sleep was deeper than either Sebastian's or Hilda's had been. She had taken a big dose, so as to secure immobility. The <b>question</b> <b>now</b> <b>was,</b> would she recover at all from it? Hour after hour we waited and watched; and {{not a sign of}} movement! Only the same deep, slow, {{hampered}} breathing, the same feeble, jerky pulse, the same deathly pallor on the dark cheeks, the same corpse-like rigidity of limb and muscle.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} go into that <b>question</b> <b>now.</b> It <b>was</b> settled, as I thought, some time ago by persons to whom you {{yourself}} referred it. But {{will you tell me}} this: Why on earth should Robarts be troubled in this matter? What has he done?" ...|$|R
