5|$|Regarded as {{pioneers of}} live music {{performance}} and renowned for their lavish stage shows, Pink Floyd also set high standards in sound quality, {{making use of}} innovative sound effects and <b>quadraphonic</b> speaker systems. From their earliest days, they employed visual effects to accompany their psychedelic rock music while performing at venues such as the UFO Club in London. Their slide-and-light show {{was one of the}} first in British rock, and it helped them become popular among London's underground.|$|E
5|$|Atom Heart Mother was {{released}} on 2 October 1970 in the UK and 10 October in the US. It reached number 1 and number 55, respectively in those countries' charts. It {{was released}} in the <b>quadraphonic</b> format in the UK, Germany and Australia. A remastered CD was released in 1994 in the UK and the US. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a 24KT gold CD in the US in 1994, while a LP version was released in the US in the same year. As part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, a remaster was released in 2011. Then the album was re-issued again in 2016 on the band's own Pink Floyd Records label.|$|E

2500|$|Childhood friends Eric Lewis and Merwyn Sanders {{were born}} and raised in Chicago, United States. At first, they formed a band called <b>Quadraphonics</b> in middle school, with Lewis on guitar, Sanders on drums, DJ Calvin on bass, and [...] "another friend named Edgwick" [...] on guitar. In high school, only Lewis and Sanders stuck together, a time when they {{acquired}} a drum machine, a Moog synthesizer and other equipment used by the burgeoning Chicago house scene. They had discovered house music at high school parties (like Mendel Catholic High School) and nightclubs such as Ron Hardy's Muzic Box, the Power Plant and The Warehouse; the duo also frequented nightclubs in Toronto, Canada. Sanders recalls: [...] "That was '80 or so, '81. We just started doing a bunch of music at home. At that time we got a 4-track. So, that's what we would do, go to school, and we would hang out and do music... and go shoot some ball, then work some more music." ...|$|R
40|$|Ambisonics was {{developed}} in the 1970 ’s as a flexible, psycho-acoustically aware system 1. Developed {{at the same time as}} <b>Quadraphonics</b> 2, Ambisonics is an often mis-understood system that was far ahead of it’s time. Due to the ubiquity of surround sound equipment in modern computers and interest in live surround events becoming more widespread, is the time, finally, right for Ambisonics to come into its’ own? In this paper, the definition of what makes a system Ambisonic is clarified with reference made to the traditional energy and velocity vector theory, higher order systems and use in both the live and domestic environment. More recent developments by the author are discussed with respect to irregular Ambisonic decoder design (such as for the ITU 5. 1 speaker array) and analysis using Head Related Transfer Function data showing the extra insight this can give into the performance of one, seemingly similar, decoder design over another. The freely available suite of VST plug-ins (comprising of decoders, panners and an Ambisonic reverb) created using this technology are also presented, with case studies of their use in student projects at the University of Derby...|$|R

25|$|In {{some ways}} {{similar to the}} laser {{turntable}} is the IRENE scanning machine for disc records, which images with microphotography in two dimensions, invented {{by a team of}} physicists at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories. IRENE will retrieve the information from a laterally modulated monaural grooved sound source without touching the medium itself, but cannot read vertically modulated information. This excludes grooved recordings such as cylinders and some radio transcriptions that feature a hill-and-dale format of recording, and stereophonic or <b>quadraphonic</b> grooved recordings, which utilize {{a combination of the two}} as well as supersonic encoding for <b>quadraphonic.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, {{she used a}} Buchla {{synthesizer}} to record the album Illuminations, which did not receive much notice. It was the first totally <b>quadraphonic</b> electronic vocal album ever.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of <b>quadraphonic</b> records {{was announced in}} 1971. These recorded four separate sound signals. This was achieved on the two stereo channels by electronic matrixing, where the additional channels were combined into the main signal. When the records were played, phase-detection circuits in the amplifiers were able to decode the signals into four separate channels. There were two main systems of matrixed <b>quadraphonic</b> records produced, confusingly named SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui). They proved commercially unsuccessful, but were an important precursor to later surround sound systems, as seen in SACD and home cinema today.|$|E
25|$|Efforts {{were made}} in the 1970s to record as many as four audio {{channels}} on an LP (<b>quadraphonic)</b> by means of matrix and modulated carrier methods. This development was neither a widespread success nor long lasting.|$|E
25|$|Days of Future Passed {{was issued}} as a {{discrete}} <b>Quadraphonic</b> open reel tape in 1977. This master {{was also used}} for a 2001 dts 5.1 channel audio CD release and again for a two-disc Deluxe Edition SACD release in 2006.|$|E
25|$|During {{the vinyl}} era, various {{developments}} were made or introduced. Stereo finally lost its previous experimental status, and eventually became standard internationally. <b>Quadraphonic</b> sound effectively {{had to wait}} for digital formats before finding a permanent position in the market place.|$|E
25|$|The tour {{featured}} elaborate stage {{design by}} Mark Fisher (the architect of Pink Floyd's The Wall shows), including giant puppets, large video screen displays and a 360° <b>quadraphonic</b> sound system. The performances {{were divided into}} two sets: the first being a collection of Pink Floyd material along with songs from Roger's solo career, and the second The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety, plus encores.|$|E
25|$|Massot hurriedly {{assembled}} a crew {{in time for}} Led Zeppelin's last leg of the tour starting on 23 July 1973, in Baltimore. He subsequently filmed the group's three concert performances at Madison Square Garden on the nights of 27, 28, and 29 July 1973. The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track <b>quadraphonic</b> sound recording. The live footage in the US alone cost $85,000.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Ned Lagin {{released}} {{an album of}} electronic noise music full of spacey rumblings and atmospherics filled with burps and bleeps entitled Seastones on Round Records. The album was recorded in stereo <b>quadraphonic</b> sound and featured guest performances {{by members of the}} Grateful Dead, including Jerry Garcia playing treated guitar and Phil Lesh playing electronic Alembic bass. David Crosby, Grace Slick {{and other members of the}} Jefferson Airplane also appear on the album.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{music in}} Cyprus is {{generally}} {{influenced by the}} Greek Laïka scene; artists who play in this genre include international platinum star Anna Vissi, Evridiki, and Sarbel. Hip Hop, R and reggae have been supported {{by the emergence of}} Cypriot rap and the urban music scene at Ayia Napa. Cypriot rock music and Éntekhno rock is often associated with artists such as Michalis Hatzigiannis and Alkinoos Ioannidis. Metal also has a small following in Cyprus represented by bands such as Armageddon (rev.16:16), Blynd, Winter's Verge, Methysos and <b>Quadraphonic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Six Wives of Henry VIII {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. It reached number 7 on the UK Albums Chart and number 30 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1975 for over 500,000 copies {{sold in the}} United States. In 2009, Wakeman performed the album in its entirety {{for the first time}} live at Hampton Court Palace as part of the 500th anniversary celebration of Henry's accession to the throne. The tracks were rearranged with sections, including a track dedicated to Henry himself, that were left off the original album due to the limited time available on a single vinyl. The album was reissued in 2015 with a <b>quadraphonic</b> sound mix and bonus tracks.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} active and {{outstanding}} composers of his generation, Sergio Fernández Barroso (also known as Sergio Barroso) (1946), is the author of an opera called La forma del camino, which also possesses the complementary title of s-XIV-69 (which means Siglo XIV – 1969). With an approximate duration of 60 minutes, this piece utilizes as a script a story from the Popol Vuh (the sacred text of the Maya culture) about the mythic brothers Hunahpu and Ixbalanqué. The score includes soloists and a choir of nine mixed voices, accompanied by an instrumental group and an electro-acoustic <b>quadraphonic</b> system. The scene requires a stage elevated over the choir spatial position, which members wear dinner jackets, in opposition to the more casual attire of the soloists. All singers wear Indian masks.|$|E
500|$|In April 1971, Aqualung {{peaked at}} number four on the UK Album Chart; when the CD version was {{released}} in 1996, it reached number 52. It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Music Charts' North American pop albums chart; the single [...] "Hymn 43" [...] hit No. 91 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album {{would go on to}} sell over seven million copies, and is the band's best-selling album. Aqualung was one of only two Jethro Tull albums released in <b>quadraphonic</b> sound, the other being War Child (1974). The <b>quadraphonic</b> version of [...] "Wind Up", which is in a slightly higher key, is included on the later CD reissue of the album as [...] "Wind Up (quad version)".|$|E
500|$|Throughout their career, Pink Floyd {{experimented with}} their sound. Their second single, [...] "See Emily Play" [...] premiered at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London, on 12 May 1967. During the performance, the group first used an early <b>quadraphonic</b> device called an Azimuth Co-ordinator. The device enabled the controller, usually Wright, to {{manipulate}} the band's amplified sound, combined with recorded tapes, projecting the sounds 270 degrees around a venue, achieving a sonic swirling effect. In 1972, they purchased a custom-built PA which featured an upgraded four-channel, 360-degree system.|$|E
500|$|The {{sound effects}} on [...] "Money" [...] {{were created by}} {{splicing}} together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which were {{used to create a}} 7-beat effects loop (later adapted to four tracks {{in order to create a}} [...] "walk around the room" [...] effect in <b>quadraphonic</b> presentations of the album). [...] At times the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs (particularly [...] "On the Run").|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} <b>quadraphonic</b> mix, {{created by}} Alan Parsons, {{was commissioned by}} EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' <b>quadraphonic</b> mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters' In the Flesh for SACD. [...] Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was [...] "possibly a little too true to the original mix", but was generally complimentary. [...] The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003, and has since sold more than 800,000copies. The cover image was created {{by a team of}} designers including Storm Thorgerson. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colours of the original. The idea is derived from the [...] "sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound..." [...] The image was created out of a desire to be [...] "the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognisable prism design, but was different and hence new".|$|E
500|$|Released in March 1973, the LP {{became an}} instant chart {{success in the}} UK and {{throughout}} Western Europe, earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted the press release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a <b>quadraphonic</b> mix {{had not yet been}} completed, and they felt presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient. Melody Makers Roy Hollingworth described side one as [...] "utterly confused... difficult to follow", but praised side two, writing: [...] "The songs, the sounds... the rhythms were solid... saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled". Rolling Stones Loyd Grossman described it as [...] "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the tracks}} were {{produced}} by Arif Mardin, {{with the exception of}} the two Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys covers, [...] "Stay All Night (Stay a Little Longer)" [...] and [...] "Bubbles in My Beer," [...] which were produced by Mardin and Jerry Wexler. The album also included Johnny Bush's [...] "Whiskey River". During the recording, there were rumors that there would be appearances by George Jones, Leon Russell, and Kris Kristofferson that ultimately did not happen. Waylon Jennings joined the backing band playing guitar, and provided backing vocals for [...] "Stay All Night (Stay a Little Longer)", along with Jessi Colter and Doug Sahm. Parts of the album were recorded in the <b>Quadraphonic</b> studios in Nashville, as well as in the Sam Phillips Recording studio in Memphis.|$|E
500|$|Several tracks, {{including}} [...] "Us and Them" [...] and [...] "Time", demonstrated Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's {{ability to}} harmonise their voices. [...] In the 2003 Classic Albums documentary The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon, Waters attributed {{this to the}} fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons utilised studio techniques such as the double tracking of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonise with himself. [...] The engineer also made prominent use of flanging and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the <b>quadraphonic</b> mix of [...] "On the Run", when the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker rapidly swirls around the listener).|$|E
500|$|Meddle was {{recorded}} between the band's various concert commitments, and therefore its production was {{spread over a}} considerable period of time. [...] The band recorded {{in the first half}} of April 1971, but in the latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month. [...] In May they split their time between sessions at Abbey Road, and rehearsals and concerts in London, Lancaster, Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Nottingham. [...] June and July were spent mainly performing at venues across Europe. [...] August was spent in the far east and Australia, September in Europe, and October to November in the US. [...] In the same period, the group also produced Relics, a compilation album of some of Pink Floyd's earlier works. [...] A <b>quadraphonic</b> mix of the album was prepared at Command Studios on 21 and 26September, but remains unreleased.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, Waters {{commenced}} The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour, a two-year, world-spanning {{effort that}} began in Europe in June and North America in September. The {{first half of the}} show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters' solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon, the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of The Wall. He used elaborate staging by concert lighting designer Marc Brickman complete with laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a [...] "handler" [...] dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree <b>quadraphonic</b> sound system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for The Dark Side of the Moon set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates. Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} {{conventional}} rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent synthesizers to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on [...] "Brain Damage" [...] and [...] "Any Colour You Like", and a Synthi A on [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "On the Run". [...] They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, {{such as an}} assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during [...] "On the Run"), and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat (during [...] "Speak to Me", [...] "On the Run", [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "Eclipse"). [...] This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, {{but it can also}} be heard sporadically on [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "On the Run". The assorted clocks ticking then chiming simultaneously at the start of [...] "Time", accompanied by a series of Rototoms, were initially created as a <b>quadraphonic</b> test by Parsons. The engineer recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop, and although his recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of the material were eventually used in the track.|$|E
500|$|Beginning on 1 June, {{the first}} track to be {{recorded}} was [...] "Us and Them", followed six days later by [...] "Money". [...] Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded {{to take advantage of}} the band's decision to record a <b>quadraphonic</b> mix of the album (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders). [...] "Time" [...] and [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky" [...] were the next pieces {{to be recorded}}, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US. [...] The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. [...] Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003 he said: [...] "We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on." ...|$|E
500|$|As the <b>quadraphonic</b> mix of {{the album}} was not then complete, the band (with the {{exception}} of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. [...] The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cut-outs of the band, and the stereo {{mix of the}} album was presented through a poor-quality public address system. [...] Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Makers Roy Hollingworth described side one as [...] "so utterly confused with itself {{it was difficult to}} follow", but praised side two, writing: [...] "The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night." [...] Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: [...] "I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life, I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon". [...] In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side [...] "a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement". In his 1981 review of the album, Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clichéd and its music pretentious, but called it a [...] "kitsch masterpiece" [...] that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.|$|E
500|$|Generally, {{all four}} members agreed that Waters' album concept unified {{by a single}} theme was a good idea. Waters, Gilmour, Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright participated in the writing and {{production}} of the new material, and Waters created the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a small studio built in his garden shed. Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of [...] "Breathe" [...] came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and {{the basic structure of}} [...] "Us and Them" [...] borrowed from an original composition by Wright for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by The Rolling Stones, and then at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with four <b>quadraphonic</b> outputs, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tonnes of kit was transported in three lorries; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour, but allowed improvement and refinery nonetheless, which by then had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). However, after discovering that that title had already been used by another band, Medicine Head, it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material premièred at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album the title was changed back to the band's original preference.|$|E
500|$|Wish You Were Here {{has been}} remastered and re-{{released}} on several formats. [...] In the UK and US {{the album was}} re-issued in <b>quadraphonic</b> using the SQ format in 1976, and in 1980 a special Hi-Fi Today audiophile print was released in the UK. [...] In the US it was released on CD in 1983, and in the UK 1985, and again as a remastered CD with new artwork in 1994. [...] In the US, Columbia's CBS Mastersound label released a half-speed mastered audiophile LP in 1981, and in 1994 Sony Mastersound released a 24-carat gold-plated CD, remastered using Super Bit Mapping, with the original artwork from the LP in both longbox and jewel case forms, the latter with a cardboard slipcover. [...] The album was included {{as part of the}} box set Shine On, and five years later Columbia Records released an updated remastered CD, 17seconds longer than the EMI remasters from 1994, giving a running time of 44:28. [...] Its label was a recreation of the original machine handshake logo, with a black and blue background. [...] The album was subsequently re-released in 2000 for its 25th anniversary, on the Capitol Records label in the US. The album was re-released and remixed in 2011 in multiple editions as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? reissue campaign. The Wish You Were Here - Immersion Box Set includes the new stereo digital remaster (2011) by James Guthrie on CD, an unreleased 5.1 Surround Mix (2009) by James Guthrie on DVD and Blu-ray, a Quad Mix (which had been released only on vinyl LP and 8-track tape) on DVD, as well as the original stereo mix (1975) on DVD and Blu-ray. This campaign also featured the 2011 stereo remaster on 180g heavyweight vinyl [...] as well as the 2011 stereo remaster and the 5.1 surround sound mix (2009) as a hybrid Super Audio CD (SACD). In 2016, the 180g vinyl was re-released on the band's own Pink Floyd Records label this time remastered by James Guthrie, Joel Plante and Bernie Grundman.|$|E
2500|$|Byrdmaniax was {{released}} on June 23, 1971 in the United States (catalogue item KC 30640) and August 6, 1971 in the United Kingdom (catalogue item S 64389). [...] Although the album was issued in stereo commercially, {{there is some evidence}} to suggest that mono copies of the album (possibly radio station promos) were distributed in the UK. [...] As well as being issued in the standard stereo format, Byrdmaniax was also released in 1971 as a <b>Quadraphonic</b> LP in Japan on the CBS Sony label (catalogue item SOPL-34001). [...] The <b>quadraphonic</b> version of the album features a noticeably different mix to the standard stereo version.|$|E
2500|$|Stereo {{amplifiers}} imply two {{channels of}} output (left and right), though the term simply means [...] "solid" [...] sound (referring to three-dimensional)—so <b>quadraphonic</b> stereo {{was used for}} amplifiers with four channels. 5.1 and 7.1 systems refer to Home theatre systems with 5 or 7 normal spatial channels, plus a subwoofer channel.|$|E
