5|$|The International System of <b>Quantities</b> (ISQ) is {{a system}} based on seven base quantities: length, mass, time, {{electric}} current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and luminous intensity. Other <b>quantities</b> such as area, pressure, and electrical resistance are derived from these base <b>quantities</b> by clear non-contradictory equations. The ISQ defines the <b>quantities</b> that are measured with the SI units. The ISQ is defined in the international standard ISO/IEC 80000, and was finalised in 2009 {{with the publication of}} ISO 80000-1.|$|E

25|$|Market {{equilibrium}} occurs where <b>quantity</b> supplied equals <b>quantity</b> demanded, {{the intersection}} of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, {{there is a shortage of}} <b>quantity</b> supplied compared to <b>quantity</b> demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of <b>quantity</b> supplied compared to <b>quantity</b> demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and <b>quantity</b> will stabilize at the price that makes <b>quantity</b> supplied equal to <b>quantity</b> demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.|$|R

The first two definitions say that a part of a <b>quantity</b> is another <b>quantity</b> that [...] "measures" [...] it and conversely, a multiple of a <b>quantity</b> is another <b>quantity</b> that it measures. In modern terminology, this means that a multiple of a <b>quantity</b> is that <b>quantity</b> multiplied by an integer greater than one—and a part of a <b>quantity</b> (meaning aliquot part) is a part that, when multiplied by an integer greater than one, gives the <b>quantity.</b>|$|R

5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw metals. Radium occurs in <b>quantities</b> {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) <b>quantities</b> with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM are expensive due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E
