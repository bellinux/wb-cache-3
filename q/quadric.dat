The point-preserving transformations are precisely the Möbius transformations. The Lie transformations which fix the ideal point at infinity are the Laguerre transformations of Laguerre geometry. These two subgroups generate the group of Lie transformations, and their intersection are the Möbius transforms that fix the ideal point at infinity, namely the affine conformal maps.|$|E

In {{trying to}} provide {{explicit}} deformations of <b>quadrics</b> {{the starting point of}} our investigation is to use Bianchi’s link between real deformations of totally real regions of real paraboloids and various totally real forms of the sine-Gordon equation coupled with Bianchi’s simple observation that the vacuum soliton of these totally real forms of the sine-Gordon equation provides precisely Peterson’s deformations of such <b>quadrics</b> in order to derive explicit Bäcklund transforms of Peterson’s deformations of <b>quadrics.</b> Based also on Bianchi’s approach of the Bäcklund transformation for <b>quadrics</b> via common conjugate systems and in analogy to the solitons of the sine-Gordon equation corresponding {{at the level of the}} geometric picture to the solitons of the pseudo-sphere we propose a model for the solitons of <b>quadrics.</b> Content...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} question {{was raised by}} M. Stillman. Main Question: Let C ⊂ P r = CP r be a smooth arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve which is cut out scheme theoretically by <b>quadrics.</b> Is the homogeneous ideal of C necessarily cut out by <b>quadrics?</b> In [4], it was shown that the question has an affirmative answer if r ≤ 5. The purpose of this note {{is to show that}} the question has a negative answer (there is a counterexample with r = 7). It is a pleasure to thank D. Eisenbud, M. Stillman, and C. Walter for helpful conversations. 1 Homogeneous and Scheme-Theoretic Generation by <b>Quadrics</b> Let X be a projective variety. It is often of interest to know whether or not the homogeneous ideal of X can be generated by <b>quadrics,</b> e. g. if X is a general canonical curve. In such a case, X is cut out scheme-theoretically by <b>quadrics</b> as well. It is usually easier to verify the scheme-theoretic statement — this amounts to ignoring the vertex of the affine cone over X. Problem: Let C ⊂ P r = CP r be a smooth curve which is cut out scheme theoretically by <b>quadrics.</b> Is the homogeneous ideal of C necessarily cut out by <b>quadrics?</b> In [4], this problem was investigated. The answer is a resounding no. A counterexample was found with r = 5. However, positive results were found. The problem has an affirmative answer for curves on scrolls, all curves with 1 r ≤ 4, and arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curves which lie on projectively normal K 3 surfaces cut out by <b>quadrics</b> (this includes all arithmetically C-M curves with r = 5). This leads to a more precise question, which we could not answer: Question: Let C ⊂ P r = CP r be a smooth arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve which is cut out scheme theoretically by <b>quadrics.</b> Is the homogeneous ideal of C necessarily cut out by <b>quadrics?</b> It turns out that this question also has a negative answer.

Then C is smooth and arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, C is cut out scheme-theoretically by <b>quadrics,</b> and the homogeneous ideal of C is not cut out by <b>quadrics.</b> 2 Candidate...|$|R
