The computer time used in this new implementation scales approximately linearly (with a low prefactor) with the number of solvent molecules. We test the ability of the frozen-density embedding to describe specific solvent effects due to hydrogen bonding for a small example system, as well as the convergence of the excitation energy with the number of solvent molecules considered in the solvation shell. Calculations with up to 500 water molecules (1500 atoms) in the solvent system are carried out.

To obtain snapshots of the dye molecule in solution, for which subsequent excitation energies are calculated, we use a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with a force field adapted to first-principles calculations. In the calculation of solvatochromic shifts between solvents of different polarity, the vertical excitation energy obtained at the equilibrium structure of the isolated chromophore is sometimes taken as a guess for the excitation energy in a nonpolar solvent. Our results show that this is, in general, not an appropriate assumption. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} the solute dynamics is neglected. The experimental shift between n-hexane and water as solvents is qualitatively reproduced, even by the simplest embedding approximation, and the results can be improved by a partial polarization of the frozen density. It is shown that the shift is mainly due to the electronic effect of the water molecules, and the structural effects are similar in n-hexane and water.

Quenching occurs in systems when the charge transfer (CT) state is brought below the fluorescing state (1 La) {{as a result of}} strong local electric fields. To further test this hypothesis, we have measured the fluorescence <b>quantum</b> yield in <b>solvents</b> of different polarity for the following systems: N-acetyl-L-tryptophanamide (NATA), an analogue for Trp in a protein; N-acetyl-L-tryptophan ethyl ester (NATE), wherein the Trp amide is replaced by an ester group, lowering the CT state energy; and 3 -methylindole (3 MI), a control wherein this quenching mechanism cannot take place. Experimental yields in water are 0. 31, 0. 13, and 0. 057 for 3 MI, NATA, and NATE, respectively, whereas, in the nonpolar aprotic solvent dioxane, all three have quantum yields near 0. 35, indicating the absence of electron transfer. In alkyl alcohols the quantum yield for NATA and NATE is between that found for water and that found for dioxane, and it is surprisingly independent of chain length (varying from methanol to decanol), revealing that microscopic H-bonding, and not the bulk dielectric constant, dictates the electron transfer rate. QM-MM calculations indicate that, when averaged over the six rotamers, the greatly increased quenching found in water relative to dioxane can be attributed mainly to the larger fluctuations of the energy gap in water.

The focus is on how the nonlinear response of a molecular solvent to a change in the charge distribution of the donor-acceptor pair influences the rate; <b>quantum</b> mechanical and <b>solvent</b> dynamical effects are ignored. Under these restrictions, the rate is determined by the probability density of the energy gap, which is defined as the instantaneous change in solvation energy upon moving an electron from the donor to the acceptor. It is shown how this probability density can be obtained from the free energies of transferring varying amounts of charge between the donor and acceptor (as specified by a charging parameter). A simple algorithm is proposed for calculating these free-energy changes (and hence the energy gap probability density) from computer simulations on just three states: the reactant, the product, and an "anti"-product formed by transferring a positive unit charge from the donor to the acceptor. Microscopic generalizations of the Marcus nonequilibrium free-energy surfaces for the reactant and the product, constructed as functions of the charging parameter, are presented. Their relation to surfaces constructed as functions of the energy gap is also established. The Marcus relation (i. e., the activation energy as a parabolic function of the free-energy change of reaction) is derived in a way that clearly shows that it is a good approximation in the normal region even when the solvent response is significantly nonlinear. A simple generalization of this relation, in which the activation energy is given by parabolic functions with different curvatures in the normal and inverted regions, is proposed. These curvatures are inversely proportional to the reorganization energies of the product and the antiproduct, respectively. Computer simulations of a simple model system are performed to illustrate and test these results and procedures...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes work {{in three}} inter-related areas – micro-fluidics, opto-fluidics and fluidic self-assembly. Micro-fluidics {{has gotten a}} boost in recent years {{with the development of}} multilayered elastomeric devices made of poly (dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), allowing active elements like valves and pumps. However, while PDMS has many advantages, it is not resistant to organic solvents. New materials and/or new designs are needed for solvent resistance. I describe how novel fluorinated elastomers can replace PDMS when combined with three dimensional (3 -D) solid printing. I also show how another 3 -D fabrication method, multilayer photo-lithography, allows for fabrication of devices integrating filters. In general, 3 -D fabrications allow new kinds of micro-fluidic devices to be made that would be impossible to emulate with two dimensional chips. In opto-fluidics, I describe a number of experiments with quantum dots both inside and outside chips. Inside chips, I manipulate quantum dots using hydrodynamic focusing to pattern fine lines, like a barcode. Outside chips, I describe our attempts to create quantum dot composites with micro-spheres. I also show how evaporated gold films and chemical passivation can then be used to enhance the emission of quantum dots. Finally, within fluids, self-assembly is an attractive way to manipulate materials, and I provide two examples: first, a DNA-based energy transfer molecule that relies on quantum mechanics and self-assembles inside fluids. This kind of molecular photonics mimics parts of the photosynthetic apparatus of plants and bacteria. The second example of self-assembly in fluids describes a new phenomena - the surface tension mediated self assembly of particles like quantum dots and micro-spheres into fine lines. This self assembly by capillary flows can be combined with photo-lithography, and is expected to find use in future nano- and micro-fabrication schemes. In conclusion, advances in fluidics, integrating materials like <b>quantum</b> dots and <b>solvent</b> resistant elastomers along with 3 -D fabrication and methods of self assembly, provide a new set of tools that significantly expand our control over fluids...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{exemplifies the}} utility of light in chemical research and technology, specifically focusing on oxene generation and environmental remediation. The first study compares direct and sensitized photolysis of dibenzothiophene-S-oxide (DBTO) and dibenzoselenophene-Se-oxide (DBSeO). <b>Quantum</b> yield and <b>solvent</b> oxidation data are used to separate the direct irradiation conditions, plus benzophenone-sensitized and anthraquinone-sensitized irradiation of DBSeO, into one mechanistic class. Acridine-sensitized photolysis of DBSeO and triplet sensizitization of DBTO result in deoxygenation, but go by different mechanisms than the direct irradations. The two sensitized cases that appear mechanistically linked to direct DBTO photolysis are ones in which the spectroscopic triplet of DBSeO, which is very likely of comparable energy to the selenium-oxygen BDE, is populated by triplet energy transfer. The main focus of the work presented in this dissertation is on exploration of modifications to TiO 2 {{in order to improve}} absorption of terrestrial sunlight [...] Aromatic organic probe molecules are used in these chapters to evaluate the oxidative chemistry of doped TiO 2 and test the efficacy of the catalyst with visible irradiation. Tungsten-modified titanium dioxide catalysts are compared for their photocatalytic activity. No special visible absorbance is apparent for the sol-gel catalyts. However, an increase in the single-electron transfer chemistry with the presence of WOx is noted, and a distinct wavelength dependence on the product ratios. 13 C-modified TiO 2 was prepared in order to facilitate study of the dopant atoms and trace their chemical fate throughout the process. Several different carbon species are identified. Some variation in the chemical degradation of quinoline is noted among the catalysts, but coke-containing TiO 2 catalysts are not qualitatively better catalysts for use with visible light with this substrate. S-TiO 2 was produced by a literature method, and was shown to facilitate the degradation of organic molecules under UV and visible light. Visible irradiation of sulfur-doped TiO 2 did not produce hydroxyl-type chemistry, but could accomplish single-electron transfers in favorable cases. The utility of sulfur-doped TiO 2 as a photocatalyst over undoped titania depends entirely whether the requirement for visible-light functionality, even if at low efficiency, outweighs a modest drop in the efficiency of catalysis using UV light. Selenium-modified TiO 2 is capable of degrading quinoline at a slightly faster rate than undoped TiO 2 under UV light. Irradiation with 3 ̆e 435 nm light shows no evidence for efficient production of hydroxyl-like species, but single-electron transfer chemistry is still operative. Examinations of Se-TiO 2 under hypoxic conditions show that the Se atoms are capable of trapping photogenerated electrons, as evidenced by XPS. The last study investigates the feasibility of using deep UV treatment for abatement of ammonia in livestock and poultry barn exhaust in a series of laboratory scale experiments. These experiments simulated moving exhaust air with controlled UV wavelength and dose, NH 3 concentrations, humidity, and presence of H 2 S. Reactions were monitored using chemiluminescence detection, GC-MS, and high resolution FTIR. The data show that removal of NH 3 is plausible, but highlights concerns over ozone and N 2 O emission...|$|R
40|$|Bond {{cleavage}} and formation are key {{steps in}} chemistry and biochemistry. The present work investigates {{the generation of}} diphenylmethyl cations (Ph 2 CH+) via photoinduced bond cleavage of diphenylmethyl derivatives with a cationic or neutral leaving group. The resulting Ph 2 CH+ cations and its numerous derivatives serve as reference electrophiles {{for one of the}} most extensive reactivity scales covering 40 orders of magnitude. In chapter 1, the focus is on the initial bond cleavage of diphenylmethyltriphenylphosphonium ions (Ph 2 CH−PPh 3 +) exhibiting a cationic leaving group. With the help of state-of-the-art quantum chemical and quantum dynamical methods, the reaction mechanism of the bond cleavage is revealed. Using a reduced model system, the potential energy surfaces can be calculated at the ONIOM level of theory along specially designed reactive coordinates. Two competing reaction channels emerge: a homolytic one in the S 1 state and a heterolytic one in the ground state. They are connected via an energetically accessible conical intersection which makes an efficient generation of the observed Ph 2 CH+ cations feasible. In contradiction with the experiment in polar or moderately polar <b>solvents,</b> <b>quantum</b> dynamical calculations for the isolated molecule reveal the formation of Ph 2 CH• radicals. While electrostatic solvent effects are negligible in this system, dynamic solvent effects emerge as being essential to explain the molecular mechanism. Two methods with increasing complexity to describe the dynamic impact of the solvent environment are developed. The first approach, the dynamic continuum ansatz, treats the environment implicitly. It uses Stokes’ law and the dynamic viscosity of the solvent in combination with quantum chemically and dynamically evaluated quantities to obtain the decelerating force exerted on the dissociating fragments. The ansatz does not require any fitting of parameters. The second method, the QD/MD approach, is based on an explicit treatment of the solvent surrounding. It combines molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the reactant in a box of <b>solvent</b> molecules with <b>quantum</b> dynamics (QD) calculations of the reactant’s dynamics. In this way, a more detailed microscopic picture of the molecular process can be derived taking into account individual arrangements of the solvent. Both methods unveil the crucial impact of the solvent cage on the bond cleavage mechanism. It hinders the free dissociation in the S 1 state and guides the molecular system to the conical intersection. QD simulations including the non-adiabatic coupling around the conical intersection show the formation of Ph 2 CH+ within ∼ 400 fs which compares well with the initial rise of the cation absorption in the experiment. Chapter 2 deals with the position of the counterion X– in the ion pairs Ph 2 CH−PPh 3 + X–, PhCH 2 −PPh 3 + X–, and (p-CF 3 -C 6 H 4) CH 2 −PPh 3 + X– in solution with X– being Cl–, Br–, BF 4 –, and SbF 6 –. These structures are essential to clarify the role of oxidizable counterions like e. g. Cl– during the initial bond cleavage in dichloromethane. The structures determined quantum chemically in dichloromethane show a similar counterion position than in the crystal. They are confirmed by the good accordance of the calculated and measured 1 H NMR shifts. The C(α) –H···X– hydrogen bonds account for the pronounced counterion-dependent 1 H NMR shifts of the C(α) –H in CD 2 Cl 2. The strong downfield shift of the signals increases according to SbF 6 – < BF 4 – << Br– < Cl–. The last part (chapter 3) focuses on the secondary processes within a few picoseconds to several nanoseconds after the C-Cl bond cleavage in diphenylmethylchloride in solution. Initially, the neutral leaving group Cl leads mainly to the formation of radical pairs; only a minor fraction of ion pairs is generated in the beginning. A combined Marcus-Smoluchowski model is used to simulate the interplay between geminate recombination, diffusional separation, and electron transfer of the radical and ion pair populations. The distance-dependent rates of the three processes together with broad distance-dependent population distributions faithfully reproduce the spectroscopically observed dynamics. The majority of Ph 2 CH+ cations is generated via electron transfer from the radical pairs. The detailed understanding of the secondary processes shows that a high Ph 2 CH+ cation yield can be expected if the radicals within a pair stay nearby for a long time to achieve an efficient electron transfer and if the resulting ions are separated fast to prevent geminate recombination...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{comprises}} {{two major}} themes of quantum statistical dynamics. One {{is the development}} of quantum dissipation theory (QDT). It covers the establishment of some basic relations of quantum statistical dynamics, the construction of several nonequivalent complete second-order formulations, and the development of exact QDT. Another is related to the applications of quantum statistical dynamics to a variety of research fields. In particular, unconventional but novel theories of the electron transfer in Debye <b>solvents,</b> <b>quantum</b> transport, and quantum measurement are developed on the basis of QDT formulations. The thesis is organized as follows. In Chapter 1, we present some background knowledge in relation to the afore-mentioned two themes of this thesis. The key quantity in QDT is the reduced density operator ρ(t) ≡ trBρT(t); i. e., the partial trace of the total system and bath composite ρT(t) over the bath degrees of freedom. QDT governs the evolu-tion of reduced density operator, where the effects of bath are treated in a quantum statistical manner. In principle, the reduced density operator contains all dynam-ics information of interest. However, the conventional quantum transport theory is formulated in terms of nonequilibrium Green's function. The newly emerging field of quantum measurement in relation to quantum information and quantum computing does exploit a sort of QDT formalism. Besides the background of the relevant theoretical development, some representative experiments on molecular nanojunctions are also briefly discussed. In Chapter 2, we outline some basic (including new) relations that highlight several important issues on QDT. The content includes the background of nonequi-librium quantum statistical mechanics, the general description of the total compos-ite Hamiltonian with stochastic system-bath interaction, a novel parameterization scheme for bath correlation functions, a newly developed exact theory of driven Brownian oscillator (DBO) systems, and its closely related solvation mode trans-formation of system-bath coupling Hamiltonian in general. The exact QDT of DBO systems is also used to clarify the validity of conventional QDT formulations that involve Markovian approximation. In Chapter 3, we develop three nonequivalent but all complete second-order QDT (CS-QDT) formulations. Two of them are of the conventional prescriptions in terms of time-local dissipation and memory kernel, respectively. The third one is called the correlated driving-dissipation equations of motion (CODDE). This novel CS-QDT combines the merits of the former two for its advantages in both the application and numerical implementation aspects. Also highlighted is the importance of correlated driving-dissipation effects on the dynamics of the reduced system. In Chapter 4, we construct an exact QDT formalism via the calculus on path integrals. The new theory aims at the efficient evaluation of non-Markovian dis-sipation beyond the weak system-bath interaction regime in the presence of time-dependent external field. By adopting exponential-like expansions for bath corre-lation function, hierarchical equations of motion formalism and continued fraction Liouville-space Green's function formalism are established. The latter will soon be used together with the Dyson equation technique for an efficient evaluation of non-perturbative reduced density matrix dynamics. The interplay between system-bath interaction strength, non-Markovian property, and the required level of hierarchy is also studied with the aid of simple spin-boson systems, together with the three proposed schemes to truncate the infinite hierarchy. In Chapter 5, we develop a nonperturbative theory of electron transfer (ET) in Debye solvents. The resulting exact and analytical rate expression is constructed {{on the basis of the}} aforementioned continued fraction Liouville-space Green's func-tion formalism, together with the Dyson equation technique. Not only does it re-cover the celebrated Marcus' inversion and Kramers' turnover behaviors, the new theory also shows some distinct quantum solvation effects that can alter the ET mechanism. Moreover, the present theory predicts further for the ET reaction ther-modynamics, such as equilibrium Gibbs free-energy and entropy, some interesting solvent-dependent features that are calling for experimental verification. In Chapter 6, we discuss the constructed QDTs, in terms of their unified math-ematical structure that supports a linear dynamics space, and thus facilitates their applications to various physical problems. The involving details are exemplified with the CODDE form of QDT. As the linear space is concerned, we identify the Schrödinger versus Heisenberg picture and the forward versus backward propaga-tion of the reduced, dissipative Liouville dynamics. For applications we discuss the reduced linear response theory and the optimal control problems, in which the correlated effects of non-Markovian dissipation and field driving are shown to be important. In Chapter 7, we turn to quantum transport, i. e. electric current through molecular or mesoscopic systems under finite applied voltage. By viewing the nonequilibrium transport setup as a quantum open system, we develop a reduced-density-matrix approach to quantum transport. The resulting current is explicitly expressed in terms of the molecular reduced density matrix by tracing out the degrees of freedom of the electrodes at finite bias and temperature. We propose a conditional quantum master equation theory, which is an extension of the conven-tional (or unconditional) QDT by tracing out the well-defined bath subsets indi-vidually, instead of the entire bath degrees of freedom. Both the current and the noise spectrum can be conveniently analyzed in terms of the conditional reduced density matrix dynamics. By far, the QDT (including the conditional one) has only been exploited in a second-order form. A self-consistent Born approximation for the system-electrode coupling is further proposed to recover all existing nonlinear current-voltage behaviors including the nonequilibrium Kondo effect. Transport theory based on the exact QDT formalism will be developed in future. In Chapter 8, we study the quantum measurement of a qubit with a quantum-point-contact detector. On the basis of a unified quantum master equation (a form of QDT), we study the measurement-induced relaxation and dephasing of the qubit. Our treatment pays particular attention on the detailed-balance relation, which is a consequence of properly accounting for the energy exchange between the qubit and detector during the measurement process. We also derive a conditional quantum master equation for quantum measurement in general, and study the readout characteristics of the qubit measurement. Our theory is applicable to the quantum measurement at arbitrary voltage and temperature. A number of remarkable new features are found and highlighted in concern with their possible relevance to future experiments. In Chapter 9, we discuss the further development of QDT, aiming at an effi-cient evaluation of many-electron systems. This will be carried out by reducing the many-particle (Fermion or Boson) QDT to a single-particle one by exploring, e. g. the Wick's contraction theorem. It also results in a time-dependent density func-tional theory (TDDFT) for transport through complex large-scale (e. g. molecules) systems. Primary results of the TDDFT-QDT are reported. In Chapter 10, we summary the thesis, and comment and remark on the future work on both the theoretical and application aspects of QDT...|$|R
