5000|$|IBM DB2 <b>Query</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Facility</b> (QMF)for z/OS is a {{business}} analytics software solution developed by IBM. It was originally created to be the reporting interface for the IBM DB2 for z/OS database and is used by many customers to generate reports for key business decisions. In its inception QMF’s reports were [...] "green-screen" [...] reports that could be accessed online. QMF is now a modern, visual dashboarding and analytical solution that handles data not just from DB2 for z/OS, but also other structured and unstructured data sources such as Oracle, Teradata, Adabas, Hadoop, and webpages. [...] Its dashboards and reports can be deployed via a workstation GUI, a browser, or a tablet or can be embedded within applications.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents criteria and necessary features {{by which to}} evaluate and design a good graphical user interface (GUI) for a Multimedia Database Management System (MDBMS). This material is also applicable to a traditional DBMS. Included in the thesis is the specifications for a <b>Query</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Facility</b> (QMF) for a MDMBS user interface. The nature and benefits of the GUI environment, requires that we consider GUI concepts early in the user interface conceptualization and design. In today's DBMS user interfaces, these GUI concepts {{are for the most}} part applied as an after-thought. This is a critical mistake. Early incorporation of GUI capabilities along with established user interface principles results in a superior user interface. The QMF presented herein is one such interface. It combines the ideas of simple operations and data flow to allow the user to specify his query. Additional concepts used include: picture of the database schema, picture of the developing query, selectable objects, direct manipulation, piecemeal query specification, display of immediate results and predefined joins. The resulting QMF is simple to use and enables the flexible expression of the simple as well as the complex database query. [URL] United States Marine Corp...|$|E
40|$|The tourism {{industry}} is {{a good candidate for}} taking up Semantic Web technology. In fact, there are many portals and web sites belonging to the tourism domain which promote tourist products (places to visit, food to eat, museums, …) and tourist services (hotels, events, …), published by several operators (tourist promoter associations, public agencies,…). This paper presents how the MOMIS system may be used for building a Tourism Information provider by exploiting the tourism information that is available in internet websites. MOMIS, (Mediator envirOnment for Multiple Information Sources), is a mediator framework that performs information extraction and integration from heterogeneous distributed data sources and includes <b>query</b> <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> to transparently support queries posed to the integrated data sources.

3000|$|The {{introduction}} of the relational model [29], prevalent today, addressed the shortcomings of earlier data models. Subsequent data models, in turn, were relegated or became complementary to the relational model. Further developments focused on transaction processing and on extending DBMS to support new types of data (e.g., spatial, multimedia, etc.), data analysis techniques and systems (e.g., data warehouses, OLAP systems, data mining). The evolution of data models and the consolidation of distributed systems {{made it possible to}} develop mediation infrastructures [109] that enable transparent access to multiple data sources through <b>querying,</b> navigation and <b>management</b> <b>facilities.</b> Examples of such systems are multi-databases, data warehouses, Web portals deployed on Internet/Intranets, polyglot persistence solutions [78]. Common issues tackled by such systems are (i) how to handle diversity of data representations and semantics? (ii) how to provide a global view {{of the structure of the}} information system while respecting access and management constraints? (iii) how to ensure data quality (i.e., freshness, consistency, completeness, correctness)? [...]...|$|R

The latter is a project initiated by the World Wide Web Consortium, aimed at providing better search capabilities to the World Wide Web through an improved metadata framework based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) standard. The <b>query</b> <b>management</b> system is mainly designed to interface with the Edutella peer-topeer network, which is an international initiative to create an RDF-based network that allows highly advanced searches. The development of the <b>query</b> <b>management</b> system has involved the design of: • The concept of template queries. • An RDF schema for forms. • The concept of query workflows. • A Java class library for the <b>query</b> <b>management</b> system. • An example implementation using the class library to add <b>query</b> <b>management</b> capabilities to the Conzilla concept browser...|$|R

Different divisions of water <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> are carried out (to public and private ones, natural and artificial ones, etc.), with determination of their legal relevance. Account is taken of the issue of protection from harmful effects of waters to such facilities, as well. The paper points also to rules on the water <b>management</b> <b>facilities,</b> from acts of planning, to individual administrative acts and measures for maintenance of required qualitative and quantitative condition of waters, depending on their purpose (general use or special, commercial use o waters). Albeit special rules on water <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> exist, due to the natural interlocking between all the components of the environment (water, air and soil), a comprehensive approach is required. A reference is made to other basic principles of protection of water <b>management</b> <b>facilities</b> as well, such as the principle of prevention, principle of sustainable development and the principle "polluter pays". The last one represents the achievement of contemporary law, which deviates from the idea accepted {{in the second half of}} 20 th century that supported the socialization of risk from harmful effects of waters...|$|R

30|$|Minimizing the {{communication}} overhead {{to reduce the}} energy consumption is an essential consideration in sensor network applications, and existing research has mostly concentrated on data aggregation and in-network processing. However, effective <b>query</b> <b>management</b> to optimize the query aggregation plan at the gateway side is also a significant approach to energy saving in practice. In this paper, we present a multiquery management framework to support historical and continuous queries, where the key idea is to reduce common tasks {{in a collection of}} queries through merging and aggregation, according to query region, attribute, time duration, and frequency, by executing the common subqueries only once. In this framework, we propose a <b>query</b> <b>management</b> scheme to support query partitioning, region aggregation and approximate processing, time partitioning and aggregation rules, multirate queries, and historical database. In order to validate the performance of our algorithm, a heuristic routing protocol is also described. The performance simulation results show that the overall energy consumption for forwarding and answering a collection of queries can be significantly reduced by applying our <b>query</b> <b>management</b> scheme. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed scheme are discussed, together with open research issues.|$|R
