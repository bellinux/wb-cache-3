The embodied form {{is tied to}} the individual and is the result of long-term socialisation processes in formal educational institutions, the family, political parties, clubs etc. (Bourdieu, 1983; Erel, 2010). It includes competencies, value orientations as well as thought and behavioural schemata. This embodied cultural capital manifests itself in the habitus of the individual. The second form is objectified cultural capital, for example, in the shape of cultural goods such as books and pictures. Finally, institutionalised cultural capital can include educational <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> academic <b>titles.</b> These are a reference for cultural competence that transfer a permanent and legally-guaranteed value to the holder (Bourdieu, 1983).|$|R

The writers hope that the findings can help local institutions of higher learning maximize the benefits involved in the cost of hiring expatriates. Using correlation analysis, significant relationships were found between organizational commitment dimensions and respondents' variables (marital status, institution, years in service, qualification); job characteristics (social and career opportunities); and organizational climate variables (structure, responsibility, reward, risk, warmth, support, standards, conflict and identity). The stepwise regression analysis on the other hand, determine that probable predictors of organizational commitment levels, such as institution, academic <b>qualification</b> <b>and</b> position <b>title,</b> career opportunities, structure, identity and risk. Prior knowledge of potential indicators of organizational commitment levels will help selected institutions upgrade its expatriates commitment levels. The long run effect of which is improved quality education for all, accelerated production and better services to its multiple clientele. This implies that to enhance organizational commitment levels (denoted by acceptance of organizational values, loyalty and devotion), considerable attention should be given to the alleged critical variables and predictors of organizational commitment levels...|$|R
40|$|Some {{fields in}} the {{research}} {{about the history of}} childcare in the nineteenth century in Sweden is lacking. In popular textbooks infant schools (småbarnsskolor) are thought of and described as a pedagogical and social activity, while a later phenomenon, the nursery schools, seemed to lack all pedagogical insight, care-taking was exclusively at hand. I have questioned this dichotomy. What happened to the infant schools when nursery schools appeared? My intention has been to focus on pedagogical change in infant schools. I had to start with a description of infant schools in Sweden, answering the questions when, where, how and why infant schools appeared and how they developed. Traces from infant schools in ten cities have been thoroughly examined and followed over the years. About thirty infant schools have existed. All of these are referred to, which have been possible thanks to anniversary publications and scientific documents in a mix. Focusing on pedagogical change and development, and inspired by the frame factor theory, I have analyzed organizational and economical factors, factors concerning the teachers, the children and the schoolwork. Factors concerning the management, the school control and the administration show an astonishingly rigid form over more than a century. The age of the children however, as well as <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>titles</b> of the teachers change according to the pedagogical change. Two very clear phases in the history of infant schools can be distinguished. In the early years the infant schools in Sweden worked as primary schools. Moving on to the late 19 th century, there was an institutional change in those infant schools, which had not been part of the national school system. The institutions were organized as nursery schools in which the pioneers of Froebelian work in Sweden appear. They continued to direct their work towards children from the lower classes. The results are discussed in a social, economic, political and ideological context. Above all the close relationship to three fields is recognized. These are the national school system at the time, the growing acknowledgement of psychology with the changing view of the child and the education of women. The domains are reflected about in relation to the course of events in infant schools in Sweden. In an attempt to understand the material some terms belonging to Pierre Bourdieus epistemological theory are used in the discussion...|$|R
