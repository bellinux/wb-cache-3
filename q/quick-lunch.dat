60|$|Such {{marionette}} tragedies mingled ever {{with the}} grander passion of seeing {{life as a}} ruined thing; her birthright to aspiring cleanness sold for a mess of <b>quick-lunch</b> pottage. And as she walked in a mist of agony, a dumb, blind creature heroically distraught, she could scarce distinguish between sordidness and the great betrayals, so chill and thick was the fog about her.|$|E
60|$|Eda Rawle, Janet's solitary {{friend of}} these days, {{must also be}} mentioned, though the {{friendship}} was merely an episode in Janet's life. Their first meeting was at Grady's <b>quick-lunch</b> counter in Faber Street, which they both frequented at one time, {{and the fact that}} each had ordered a ham sandwich, a cup of coffee, and a confection--new to Grady's--known as a Napoleon had led to conversation.|$|E
6000|$|In May Cupid shoots blindfolded--millionaires marry stenographers; wise professors woo white-aproned gum-chewers behind <b>quick-lunch</b> counters; schoolma'ams {{make big}} bad boys remain after school; lads with ladders steal lightly over lawns where Juliet waits in her trellissed window with her {{telescope}} packed; young couples {{out for a}} walk come home married; old chaps put on white spats and promenade near the Normal School; even married men, grown unwontedly tender and sentimental, whack their spouses on the back and growl: [...] "How goes it, old girl:" ...|$|E
60|$|At any rate, let us {{tell the}} story now with all the {{advantages}} of the atmosphere that has clung to it. You may suppose me, for the sake of argument, sitting at lunch in one of those <b>quick-lunch</b> restaurants in the City where men take their food so fast that it has none of the quality of food, and take their half-hour's vacation so fast that it has none of the qualities of leisure; to hurry through one's leisure is the most unbusiness-like of actions. They all wore tall shiny hats as if they could not lose an instant even to hang them on a peg, and they all had one eye a little off, hypnotised by the huge eye of the clock. In short, they were the slaves of the modern bondage, you could hear their fetters clanking. Each was, in fact, bound by a chain; the heaviest chain ever tied to a man--it is called a watch-chain.|$|E
6000|$|Of this, he had {{sufficient}} proof one evening when, after scheming and plotting {{in a way}} that had made the great efforts of Machiavelli and Richelieu seem like the work of raw novices, he had cut Molly out from the throng, and carried her off for the alleged purpose of helping him feed the chickens. There were, as he had suspected, chickens attached to the castle. They lived in a little world of noise and smells {{at the back of the}} stables. Bearing an iron pot full of a poisonous-looking mash, and accompanied by Molly, he had felt for perhaps a minute and a half like a successful general. It is difficult to be romantic when you are laden with chicken-feed in an unwieldy iron pot, but he had resolved that this portion of the proceedings should be brief. The birds should dine that evening on the <b>quick-lunch</b> principle. Then--to the more fitting surroundings of the rose-garden! There was plenty of time before the hour of the sounding of the dressing-gong. Perhaps, even a row on the lake-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Gradually, out of {{the chaotic}} melee in which these titans were engaged had emerged one group more {{powerful}} than the rest and more respectable, whose leader was the Personality to whom I have before referred. He and his group had managed to gain control of certain conservative fortresses in various cities such as the Corn National Bank and the Ashuela Telephone Company--to mention two of many: Adolf Scherer was his ally, and the Boyne Iron Works, Limited, was soon to be merged by him into a greater corporation still. Leonard Dickinson might be called his local governor-general. We manned the parapets and kept our ears constantly to the ground to listen for the rumble of attacks; but sometimes they burst upon us fiercely and suddenly, without warning. Such was the assault on the Ashuela, which for years had exercised an apparently secure monopoly of the city's telephone service, which had been able to ignore with complacency the shrillest protests of unreasonable subscribers. Through the Pilot it was announced to the public that certain benevolent [...] "Eastern capitalists" [...] were ready to rescue them from their thraldom if the city would grant them a franchise. Mr. Lawler, the disinterestedness of whose newspaper could not be doubted, fanned the flame day by day, sent his reporters about the city gathering instances of the haughty neglect of the Ashuela, proclaiming its instruments antiquated compared with those used in more progressive cities, as compared with the very latest inventions which the Automatic Company was ready to install provided they could get their franchise. And the prices! These, too, would fall--under competition. It was a clever campaign. If the city would give them a franchise, that Automatic Company--so well named! would provide automatic instruments. Each subscriber, by means of a numerical disk, could call up any other, subscriber; there would be no central operator, no listening, no tapping of wires; the number of calls would be unlimited. As a proof of the confidence of these Eastern gentlemen in our city, they were willing to spend five millions, and present more than six hundred telephones free to the city departments! What was fairer, more generous than this! There could be no doubt that popular enthusiasm was enlisted in behalf of the [...] "Eastern Capitalists," [...] who were made to appear in the light of Crusaders ready to rescue a groaning people from the thrall of monopoly. The excitement approached that of a presidential election, and became the dominant topic at <b>quick-lunch</b> counters and in street-cars. Cheap and efficient service! Down with the Bastille of monopoly! ...|$|E
5000|$|Samuel Longley Bickford (1885 - 1959) {{began his}} {{restaurant}} career in 1902, and, in 1921, he established his <b>quick-lunch</b> Bickford's restaurant chain. Bickford's [...] "lunchrooms," [...] {{as they were}} known, offered modestly priced fare and extended hours. Bickford's architect was F. Russell Stuckert, who had been associated with Samuel Bickford since 1917. Stuckert's father, J. Franklin Stuckert, had designed buildings for Horn & Hardart in the 1890s.|$|E
