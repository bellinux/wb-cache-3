50|$|Intranasal {{oxytocin}} (OT) {{has been}} used to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with Postpartum Depression (PPD). Research by McErlean and Dadds suggests that intranasal OT, when combined with behavioral interventions, can remediate some of the mother-infant disturbances associated with PPD. This was the first study to evaluate both the individual effects of OT and the combined effects of OT in conjunction with maternal coaching. The study consisted of seventy-seven mothers (with sub-clinical levels of PPD) with infants ranging from eight to thirty weeks. In addition to the mother-baby interaction coaching, randomly selected mothers were treated with either 24IU OT or a placebo nasal spray over a period of two sessions; measurements were taken over a course of three time periods. Both <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data</b> and observational data, such as eye contact, positive vocalizations, and interaction quality, were used for evaluation purposes. There were significant interactions between the therapy and the OT in regard to maternal behavior. OT also seemed to benefit those mothers who were not involved with the therapy when compared to those that received the placebo nasal spray1. OT has also been linked with lowering the human stress response3. Lowering a stress response in women that are suffering from PPD may be beneficial to the infant-mother bond. Studies have shown that breast-feeding causes levels of plasma OT to increase in women. Experiments designed and performed in the 1980s helped researchers understand the correlation between breastfeeding prior to a stressful event and the decreased stress response observed during the peripartum period. As part of this experiment, lactating women were asked to either breastfeed their infant or hold their infant for a fifteen-minute period approximately thirty minutes before being subjected to a Trier Stress Test (TSST). During the TSST, women were asked to give an unprepared speech and calculate mental arithmetic in front of an audience. Results indicate that the women that breastfed their infant exhibited less stress during the TSST in comparison to the women that just held their infant3. Rising OT levels during breastfeeding may contribute to the lower stress situation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Supporting human {{decision}} making is a major goal of data mining. The more {{decision making}} is critical, the more interpretability is required in the predictive model. This paper proposes a new framework to build a fully interpretable predictive model for <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data,</b> while maintaining high prediction accuracy {{with regards to the}} final outcome. Such a model has applications in project risk assessment, in health care, in sentiment analysis and presumably in any real world application that relies on <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data</b> for informative and accurate prediction. Our framework is inspired by models in Item Response Theory (IRT), which were originally developed in psychomet-rics with applications to standardized tests such as SAT. We first extend these models, which are essentially unsupervised, to the supervised setting. We then derive a distance metric from the trained model to define the informativeness of individual question items. On real-world <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data</b> obtained from information technology projects, we demon-strate the power of this approach in terms of interpretability as well as predictability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages the IRT framework to provide informative and accurate prediction on ordinal <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data.</b> Index Terms—psychometrics, <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data,</b> item re-sponse theory, metric learning I...|$|E
