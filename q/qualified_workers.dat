Regular senior middle schools were to be converted into vocational middle schools, and vocational training classes were to be established in some senior middle schools. Diversion of students from academic to technical education was intended to alleviate skill shortages and to reduce the competition for university enrollment.|$|E

Closely modeled after the Civil Rights Act and Section 504, the law was the most sweeping disability rights legislation in American history. It mandated that local, state, and federal governments and programs be accessible, that employers with more than 15 employees make “reasonable accommodations” for workers with disabilities and not discriminate against otherwise <b>qualified</b> <b>workers</b> with disabilities, and that public accommodations such as restaurants and stores not discriminate against people with disabilities and that they make “reasonable modifications” to ensure access for disabled members of the public.

40|$|Introduction: Population {{monitoring}} and screening of {{blood pressure is}} an important part of any population health strategy. <b>Qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> are expensive and often unavailable for screening. Non-health workers with electronic blood pressure monitors are increasingly used in community-based research. This approach is unvalidated. In a poor, urban community we compared blood pressure measurements taken by non-health workers using electronic devices against <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> using mercury sphygmomanometers. Method: Fifty-six adult volunteers participated in the research. Data were collected by five <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers,</b> and six non-health workers. Participants were randomly allocated to have their blood pressure measured on four consecutive occasions by alternating a <b>qualified</b> health <b>worker</b> with a non-health worker. Descriptive statistics and graphs, and mixed effects linear models to account for the repeated measurement were used in the analysis. Results: Blood pressure readings by non-health workers were more reliable than those taken by <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers.</b> There was no significant difference between the readings taken by <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> and those taken by non-health workers for systolic blood pressure. Non-health workers were, on average, 5 &#x 2013; 7 mmHg lower in their measures of blood pressure than the <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> (95 %HPD: &#x 2212; 2. 9 to &#x 2212; 10. 0) for diastolic blood pressure. Conclusion: The results provide empirical evidence that supports the practice of non-health workers using electronic devices for BP measurement in community-based research and screening. Non-health workers recorded blood pressures that differed from <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> by no more than 10 mmHg. The approach is promising, but more research is needed to establish the generalisability of the results...|$|R

The perspectives of line managers, people who use services and carers are also discussed. Findings from the research suggest that the social work degree has been well received by most newly <b>qualified</b> social <b>workers</b> and highlights the perceived importance of a statutory placement for social work degree students.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of diabetes {{and a significant}} proportion of unawareness of its risk among the patients indicate the need to include into general prophylactic examinations the standards of medical certification, which would prevent discrimination and ensure public safety. In certifying medical predispositions to work in a person with diabetes mellitus the key issue is to distinguish 2 categories of medical requirements: the higher - related to <b>qualifying</b> <b>workers</b> for jobs demanding psychophysical abilities, which affect the safety of the workers and their environment and the lower - related to <b>qualifying</b> <b>workers</b> for jobs characterized by harmful factors and nuisances, which might {{have a negative effect on}} the course of diabetes. The very fact of having diabetes cannot be the reason for the patient being disqualified and the decision on certifying the capacity to perform a particular job should always be based on an individual health assessment of the patient, taking into account the risk of hypoglycemia, metabolic control, the progression and dynamics of chronic complications, as well as the level of health awareness in patients. The objective assessment of the health status of the patient with diabetes involves the judgment of an attending physician, additionally supported by the consultation of a diabetes specialist to ensure that the patient is able to perform properly the job, requiring psychomotor abilities.

5000|$|There {{are several}} options {{available}} to US employers who wish to hire foreign, non-immigrant workers on a temporary but long-term basis: H-1B visas, L-1 visas, TN status and other options. These temporary options are often sufficient {{to meet the needs}} of employer and employee. When a US employer wishes to hire the services of the foreign worker on a permanent basis, however, a complex sponsorship process for the green card begins, a process that can take years. [...] Generally (although not always) the first step in that process is labor certification. Labor certification is a process of proving that there are no <b>qualified</b> US <b>workers</b> for the position being offered. If there are <b>qualified</b> US <b>workers</b> - in fact, even generally speaking if there are even minimally <b>qualified</b> US <b>workers</b> - then the foreign worker cannot be offered the position on a permanent basis. This does not necessarily mean that the foreign worker will be immediately replaced by a <b>qualified</b> US <b>worker,</b> though. The foreign worker can still serve out the remainder of their existing US temporary visa, and may well be able to re-apply for labor certification and be approved. But it does create a substantial inconvenience for the US employer who wishes to hire a foreign worker, which does provide some protection to US workers, although the process is controversial.|$|R
