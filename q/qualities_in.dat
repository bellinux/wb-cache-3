Several studies and experiments have analyzed {{the impact of}} vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, {{it was estimated that}} annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Male progeny go to {{a station}} in Pépieux {{in the south}} of France, where they are fed a ration of corn silage before being {{slaughtered}} at the age of 16 months. In addition to evaluations of growth and conformation in the live animals, carcases, including fat composition, are evaluated. The best bulls identified in progeny testing are formally given the award Young Beef Cattle (in French Viande Jeunes Bovins, abbreviated to JB). Female progeny go to a test station in Moussour in Corrèze, where they are inseminated with the same bulls and calve at two years in confinement before being put out to pasture with their calves. The test station evaluates weight, growth, morphology, fertility, calving ability and milking ability in order to assess their maternal qualities. The best bulls following the tests on their daughters are identified as Maternal <b>Qualities</b> (<b>in</b> French Qualités Maternelles, abbreviated to QM).|$|E
5|$|Many writers {{associate}} the boar and lion {{heads to the}} avatars Varaha and Narasimha, others associate with the Chaturvyuhas, however the latter is heavily disputed. The Vishnudharmottara Purana describes the Chaturvyuhas - Vasudeva (Krishna), Samkarshana (Balarama), Pradyumna, Aniruddha - four manifestations of Vishnu. Though the text does not explicitly equate the two forms. Many modern indologists as well as Pancharatra followers associate both of them based on the association of Chaturvyuhas with gunas (<b>qualities)</b> <b>in</b> the Vishnudharmottara Purana and the Pancharatra texts. The gunas are in turn associated with Vaikuntha Chaturmurti. The human face is Vasudeva, who symbolizes strength/power (bala); the lion is Samkarshana, who is knowledge/wisdom (jnana) personified; the demonic form is Pradyumna, who is prosperity/sovereignty (aishvarya) and the boar is Aniruddha, the Lord of energy (shakti).|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} later renamed the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club. Badger digging {{required}} {{a different type}} of dog than fox hunting, and it is likely that Bull terrier stock was introduced to strengthen the breed, which may have caused the creation of a shorter legged variety of Jack Russell terrier that started to appear around this period. At the same time that a split was appearing between show and working Fox terriers, a further split was occurring between two different types of white terrier, both carrying Jack Russell's name. Heinemann was invited to judge classes for working terriers at Crufts with an aim to bring working terriers back into the show ring and influence those that disregard working <b>qualities</b> <b>in</b> dogs. These classes were continued for several years by various judges, but Charles Cruft dropped the attempt as the classes were never heavily competed. Following Heinemann's death in 1930, the kennel and leadership of the club passed to Annie Harris, but the club itself folded shortly before World War II.|$|E

5|$|Tang has {{expressed}} concern about environmental and social issues through his art, such as the works They Poach the Rhino, Chop Off His Horn and Make This Drink (1989), Under the Table All Going One Direction (1992) and Tiger's Whip. He first presented the latter work, an installation and performance piece, in 1991 in Singapore's Chinatown. It consisted of ten life-sized tigers made from wire mesh covered with white linen. Tang, wearing a sleeveless white garment, dragged one of the tigers behind him. A {{modified version of the}} installation is in the Singapore Art Museum. It features a tiger with its front paws resting {{on the back of a}} rocking chair, which is draped with a piece of red cloth and with a phallus painted on it in red. The work highlights how the tiger is being hunted to extinction for its penis, which some Chinese believe has aphrodisiac <b>qualities.</b> <b>In</b> February 1995, the Museum chose Tiger's Whip to represent Singapore at the Africus International Biennale in Johannesburg, South Africa. Another of Tang's works in the Singapore Art Museum is an untitled sculpture often called Axe (1991), which is an axe with a plant growing out of its wooden handle. It is regarded as an early example of found art in Singapore.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> work and aggregate productivity in regions and sectors. Using recent Spanish aggregate data for the period 2001 - 2006, we find that <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> work {{may be an important}} factor to explain productivity levels in sectors and regions. We use two alternatives definitions of <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> work: one from survey data and the other from a social indicators approach. We also use two different measurements of labour productivity to test the robustness of our results. The estimates are run using a simultaneous equation model for our panel of data, and find important differences between high tech and low tech sectors: a positive relationship between <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> work and productivity in the former case, and a negative relationship in the latter. Consequently, on the one hand we see that <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> work is not only an objective per se, but may also be a production factor able to increase the wealth of regions; on the other hand, at the aggregate level, we may also find that high productivity levels coincide with lower <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> work conditions...|$|R

25|$|While in {{the fetal}} stages, {{hormonal}} influences of androgen, specifically testosterone, cause feminine <b>qualities</b> <b>in</b> regard to sexual development in females and masculine <b>qualities</b> <b>in</b> males. In typical sexual development, females {{are exposed to}} minimal amounts of testosterone, thus feminizing their sexual development, while males are typically exposed {{to high levels of}} testosterone, which masculinize their development. Epi-marks {{play a critical role in}} this development by acting as a buffer between the fetus and androgen exposure. Moreover, they predominantly protect XY fetuses from androgen underexposure while protecting XX fetuses from androgen overexposure. However, when androgen overexposure happens in XX fetuses, research suggests they can show masculinized behavior in comparison to females who undergo normal levels of androgen exposure. The research also suggests that excess androgen exposure in females led to reduced heterosexual interest in adulthood than did females with normal levels of androgen.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the current debate about {{educational}} <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> Kindergartens that has been taking place in Germany mainly since the 1990 s. Set {{against a background of}} different theoretical conceptions of educational <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> Kindergartens, this paper introduces a common theoretical framework of educational quality (structure-process model) that differentiates between four major components: structural characteristics, educational beliefs, educational processes, and networking with families.

In addition, the authors present standardized instruments that are also based on the structure-process model of quality. Furthermore, by drawing on the structure-process model of <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> Kindergartens, they report on national and international findings regarding the level of quality, prediction of quality, and effects of quality on child development.
