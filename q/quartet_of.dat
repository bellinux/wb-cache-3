5|$|This is {{the only}} <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> the set in a minor key. Haydn {{employed}} F-sharp minor as the home key of only three of his known works: this, his Symphony No. 45 ("Farewell"), and his Piano Trio No. 40 (Hob. XV/26).|$|E
5|$|A <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> riders {{made the}} climb in second {{position}} on the road behind Pellizotti: race leader Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, Ivan Basso, and Stefano Garzelli. Di Luca rode with a very high cadence {{in an attempt to}} separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for the finish line. By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{realized}} that musicians slated {{to play his}} music were hired for individual unique sessions; {{there was no need}} to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring leitmotiv played by low woodwinds, including a <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> alto flutes.|$|E

5|$|In tennis, {{the term}} Big Four {{refers to the}} <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> men's singles players {{comprising}} Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray. These players are considered dominant in terms of ranking and tournament victories, including Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters 1000 events, {{as well as the}} ATP World Tour Finals and Olympic Games, having dominated the sport amongst them from 2004 onwards. Never before in the history of tennis has there been a group of players as dominant as these four.|$|E
5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and destroy them with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E
5|$|Less {{than a month}} later, Raonic gained {{entry into}} a Grand Slam tournament {{for the first time}} at the 2010 US Open. He {{qualified}} for the main draw, but lost in the first round to Carsten Ball. Raonic's first ATP main draw singles victory came in September 2010 at the Malaysian Open against world No. 105 Igor Kunitsyn. He followed this with a second round victory over world No. 31 Sergiy Stakhovsky. The following week, Raonic lost in the second round of the 2010 Japan Open to world No. 1 Nadal. This marked his first singles match against a player ranked No. 1, and his first singles match against a member of the Big Four—a <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> dominant tennis players including Nadal, Djokovic, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like a Teddy boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having been disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E
5|$|On May 14, 2015, Hyman {{was part}} of a <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> University of Michigan student-athletes who were named Capital One First Team Academic All-District selections, the {{announcement}} coming from the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA), and his name was put forward for Academic All-American consideration. On June 11, 2015, Hyman was named to the 2015 Capital One Academic All-America Division I Men's At-Large team, as selected by CoSIDA. Hyman was the second ice hockey player at Michigan to be named an Academic All-America honoree, following Jeff Jillson in 2001, and the first to be named First Team Academic All American.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating {{him through a}} maze of consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by a <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam the maze, trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E

5|$|Iowa {{was then}} towed to Ingalls Shipbuilding, Pascagoula, Mississippi, where {{over the next}} several months the {{battleship}} was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available. Among the new weapons systems installed were four MK 141 quad cell launchers for 16 AGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles, and a <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> Phalanx Close-in weapon system Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Iowa was the first battleship to receive the RQ-2 Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. She could carry up to eight of the remotely controlled drones, which replaced the helicopters previously used to spot for her nine 16inch (410mm)/50 cal Mark 7 guns. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire-control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. Armed as such, Iowa was formally recommissioned on 28 April 1984, ahead of schedule, within her budget at a cost of $500million, and under the command of Captain Gerald E. Gneckow. In order to expedite the schedule, many necessary repairs to Iowa engines and guns were not completed and the mandatory Navy Board of Inspection and Survey (InSurv) inspection was skipped.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{began his}} 2013 season by {{retaining}} his Brisbane International title, defeating Grigor Dimitrov {{in the final}} in straight sets. Trying to win his second Major in a row, he began the 2013 Australian Open well with a straight sets victory over Dutchman Robin Haase. He followed this up with straight set victories over João Sousa, practice partner Ričardas Berankis and French No. 14 seed Gilles Simon. In the quarterfinals he cruised past Jérémy Chardy in straight sets {{to set up a}} semifinal clash with Roger Federer. After exchanging sets, Murray eventually prevailed in 5 sets, recording his first Grand Slam tournament triumph over Federer. With this victory, each member of the ATP's most dominant <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> the previous four years (Federer, Nadal, Djokovic and Murray) had beaten the other three at the Majors. This victory set up Murray's third consecutive Major final appearance, and second in a row against Djokovic. After taking the first set in a tiebreak, Murray was eventually defeated in four sets. His defeat in this final meant that Murray became only the second man in the Open Era to achieve three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open, the other being Stefan Edberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Christopher {{was part}} of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher, Black, Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> starting pitchers in the league. He spent most of spring training holding out for a new contract, which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March. He missed the first couple weeks of the season due to injury, and won his season debut on April 18, a 12-inning shutout against the Senators. He followed that up with a victory over the Boston Red Sox, allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season. In mid-June, Christopher had won ten games, which not only led the league, but was more than the seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined. On July 21, Christopher {{was part of}} a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1–1 tie; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11. Although Christopher had a strong start to the season, he struggled during the second half. He lost seven straight games over a two-month period before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers. He finished the year with a 13–13 record and a 3.17 ERA. He was selected to the American League All-Star team, however the game was canceled as a result of World War II.|$|E

5|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} month by taking {{two of a}} three-game series against the Giants, besting Jonathan Sánchez, who threw a no-hitter earlier in the 2009 season, and Tim Lincecum, who won the 2008 NL Cy Young Award. This was {{followed}} by a trip to Texas for a four-game series against the Houston Astros; the Phillies were unable to muster much offense during the series and were swept. On September 8, in {{the first game of the}} series against the Washington Nationals, Ibañez and Utley each hit their 30th home runs of the season, making them members of the 12th <b>quartet</b> <b>of</b> teammates in major league history to each reach 30 in a single season, joining Howard and Werth. The Phillies offense backed Lee to his sixth win the following night, with Madson earning his second consecutive save after assuming the de facto closer's role from Lidge. However, the Phillies could not overcome a pair of three-run home runs by Adam Dunn and Ian Desmond to secure the sweep in the last game of the series, despite Stairs' grand slam; it was their third loss of the season to Washington in fifteen games. The Mets came to Philadelphia for their last series of the season, which began on September 11. The Phillies won game one, 4–2, but the Mets came from behind in the second game of the series, scoring five runs in the final two innings to win 10–9. Making up a postponed game from earlier in the season, the Phillies won the first game of a day-night doubleheader behind Kyle Kendrick's first major league victory in 13 months. Eight shutout innings from Martínez in the nightcap gave the Phillies a 1–0 win, a 3–1 win in the 4-game set, and a 12–6 win in the season series. Martínez' eight innings also began a streak of 26 consecutive scoreless innings by Phillies pitchers: Madson followed with a scoreless ninth for his eighth save of the season; Cliff Lee pitched a complete game shutout against the Nationals the following night; and Blanton, Park, and Madson combined for eight scoreless innings against Washington on September 16 until Tyler Walker allowed a run in the top of the ninth inning, an RBI single by Willie Harris which scored Justin Maxwell. Hamels closed out the series with a strong performance, perfect through his first five innings and finishing with one run allowed in eight; with their 15th win over the Nationals, the Phillies matched their best season record against the franchise, set against the 1976 Montréal Expos.|$|E
