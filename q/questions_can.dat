5|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>can</b> {{be formed}} {{in several ways}} in Nafaanra. Basic yes–no {{questions}} are constructed by adding a sentence-final question marker rá. Constituent questions (sometimes called Wh-questions or question word questions) are doubly marked. They contain a sentence-initial question word and are marked with a sentence-final question marker hin.|$|E

50|$|In this study, {{the first}} point brought up in {{discussion}} is that the words used to phrase a <b>question</b> <b>can</b> heavily influence the response given. Second, the study indicates that the phrasing of a <b>question</b> <b>can</b> give expectations to previously ignored details, and therefore, a misconstruction of our memory recall. This indication supports false memory as an existing phenomenon.|$|R
25|$|On 10 July 2007, the then-Prime Minister Sogavare {{appointed}} Moti as Attorney General of the Solomon Islands. The Government of SI subsequently sent 666 {{questions to}} QC Damian Bugg regarding the affair. The 666 <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> now be read online.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> be {{addressed}} through simulation of the hydrologic system (using numerical models or analytic equations). Accurate simulation of the aquifer system requires {{knowledge of the}} aquifer properties and boundary conditions. Therefore, a common task of the hydrogeologist is determining aquifer properties using aquifer tests.|$|E
25|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>can</b> be {{constructed}} {{in various ways}} in Nobiin. Constituent questions ('Type 1', questions about 'who?', 'what?', etc.) are formed by use {{of a set of}} verbal suffixes in conjunction with question words. Simple interrogative utterances ('Type 2') are formed by use of another set of verbal suffixes.|$|E

25|$|The {{classification}} theorem has {{applications in}} many branches of mathematics, as {{questions about the}} structure of finite groups (and their action on other mathematical objects) can sometimes be reduced to questions about finite simple groups. Thanks to the classification theorem, such <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> sometimes be answered by checking each family of simple groups and each sporadic group.|$|E
25|$|It is {{virtually}} impossible to train a child for a WISC test or other gifted test. Some websites are known for publishing test questions and answers, although using these is considered illegal since it is highly confidential information. It would also be disastrous if a non-gifted student was placed in a gifted program. Reviewing actual test <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> confuse children and stifles their natural thinking process, however reviewing similar style questions is a possibility.|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} of similarities between DNA sequences from different organisms is also opening new avenues {{in the study}} of evolution. In many cases, evolutionary <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> now be framed in terms of molecular biology; indeed, many major evolutionary milestones (the emergence of the ribosome and organelles, the development of embryos with body plans, the vertebrate immune system) can be related to the molecular level. Many questions about the similarities and differences between humans and our closest relatives (the primates, and indeed the other mammals) are expected to be illuminated by the data in this project.|$|E
60|$|Some <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be made {{whether some}} of General Halleck's dispatches to General Schenk {{should not have}} been {{construed}} to be orders to withdraw the force, and obeyed accordingly; but no such <b>question</b> <b>can</b> be made against General Milroy. In fact, the last order he received was to be prepared to withdraw, but not to actually withdraw until further order, which further order never reached him.|$|R

25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent ability level have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair for both groups. Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E

2500|$|Any test {{in which}} the same test is given {{in the same manner}} to all test takers, and graded in the same manner for everyone, is a {{standardized}} test. Standardized tests {{do not need to be}} high-stakes tests, time-limited tests, or multiple-choice tests. The <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> be simple or complex. [...] The subject matter among school-age students is frequently academic skills, but a standardized test can be given on nearly any topic, including driving tests, creativity, personality, professional ethics, or other attributes.|$|E
2500|$|To {{hear the}} shape of a drum is to infer {{information}} about {{the shape of}} the drumhead from the sound it makes, i.e., from the list of overtones, via the use of mathematical theory. [...] "Can One Hear the Shape of a Drum?" [...] was the title of an article by Mark Kac in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1966, but the phrasing of the title is due to Lipman Bers. These <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> be traced back all the way to Hermann Weyl.|$|E

2500|$|California {{courts have}} {{generally}} allowed local governments significant leeway in preparing tax election ballot questions. [...] Ballot <b>questions</b> <b>can</b> sometimes be misleading to many voters or may include incomplete {{information regarding the}} specifics of a tax measure. [...] Local governments also sometimes “poll test” their ballot questions {{in an effort to}} further increase the chances of passing a tax measure. [...] This process involves conducting polling before officially calling an election to determine the specific ballot measure language that yields the highest level of voter support.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} other ways a {{password}} can be weak, corresponding to the strengths of various attack schemes; the core principle is that a password should have high entropy (usually taken to be equivalent to randomness) and not be readily derivable by any [...] "clever" [...] pattern, nor should passwords be mixed with information identifying the user. On-line services often provide a restore password function that a hacker can figure out and by doing so bypass a password.

Manual wh- signs are also accompanied by a non-manual grammatical marking, which includes lowered or [...] "scrunchy" [...] eybrows, a slight frown, head and body tilted forwards, slightly rounded lips, and sometimes a sideways head-shake.|$|E
