30|$|The {{moisture}} {{retention capacity}} of phosphates could improve the weight and volume of CSB significantly, while the hardness of steamed bread was reduced as the water absorption increased [55]. Besides, the leaven function was enhanced due to the sequestration of minerals and enhanced protein–starch interactions caused {{by the addition of}} phosphates [56]. It has been reported that the phosphate also contributed to the whiteness of steamed bread, which mainly due to a more intense and uniform crumb was formed after the addition of phosphate [57]. Phosphates are commonly used in the quality improvement of <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>foods.</b> <b>Quick</b> <b>frozen</b> dumplings accounts for 33 % of the total <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> <b>foods</b> in China [58], however, the common problems, such as frost cracking, outflow of stuffing juice, sticky texture, poor elasticity, browning and cooking loss, appeared in the practical production retarded its industrialization [59]. Therefore, phosphates were used as additives to alleviate the above-mentioned challenges in production. Phosphates added in frozen dumplings gave cracking resistance and good appearance for frozen dumplings due to their water-holding capacity, in which STPP showed the best performance in all the applied phosphates [59]. For the browning inhibiting, the function of phosphates can be explained in two ways. First, the enzymatic browning was delayed by the sequestering of metal ions [60]. Second, the water-holding rate was increased by the phosphates, which prevented the browning reaction caused by the outflow of stuffing [61].|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{quality of}} fresh, slow <b>frozen</b> and <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> tilapia fillets and its changes during storage at - 18 C° were investigated. For {{preparation}} the samples, fresh tilapia fillets were frozen by slow and <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> methods.

The sprila freezing tunle with - 30 C° was also used for preparation the <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> sample. The <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> samples were then stored at - 18 C°for six months. Proximate composition, fatty acid profiles, TBA, PV, TVN, Total cuont, Drip loss, and sensory evaluation of the samples were determined in every month. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used for study {{on the effects of}} the frozen condition on the microstructure of the fillets. Results indicated that two different frozen methods had significantly different effects {{on the quality of the}} fillets. Most of the proximate composition (protein, moistre and fat) reduced during the storage. <b>Quick</b> <b>frozen</b> filets had significantly (P< 0. 05) lower reduction than slow frozen samples. All of the chemical quality indexes (PV, TBA, and TVN) increased during the storage as compered to the fresh samples. In these paramethers, the slow freezing had higher changes than quick freezing metods (P< 0. 05). The microbial properties of the samples showed decrese during the storage. Lower amont of total cuont was observed at the end of the storage time in the <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> samples than slow frozen once (P< 0. 05). The large changes in the fatty acid profiles of the sample were fond in all samples. During the storage SFA and MUF of the samples increased however, the PUFA decresed. A lower change was obseved in the <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> samples than slow frozen samples (P< 0. 05). Drip loss was increased in both frozen samples during the storage period. The percentage of the drip in the slow frozen samples was significantly higer than <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> samples (P< 0. 05).
