60|$|We {{preferred}} {{walking home}} from Senor Otero's house through the bright, <b>quiescing</b> street, because in driving there we had met with an adventure which we did not care to repeat. We were driving most unaggressively across a small plaza, with a driver and a friend on the box beside him to help keep us from harm, when a trolley-car came wildly round a corner {{at the speed of}} at least two miles an hour and crossed our track. Our own speed was such that we could not help striking the trolley in a collision which was the fault of no one apparently. The front of the car was severely banged, one mud-guard of our victoria was bent, and our conversation was interrupted. Immediately a crowd assembled from the earth or the air, but after a single exchange of reproaches between the two drivers nothing was said by any one. No policeman arrived to constater the facts, and after the crowd had silently satisfied or dissatisfied itself that no one was hurt it silently dispersed. The car ambled grumbling off and we drove on with some vague murmurs from our driver, whose nerves seemed shaken, but who was supported in a somewhat lurching and devious progress by the caressing arm of the friend on the seat beside him.|$|E
60|$|I wish I {{could share}} with him, {{as easily as}} this assurance, the {{sentiment}} of the quaint place, with its traces of Early English architecture, and its look of being chopped in two; its intense quiet and remoteness {{in the heart of}} the city, with the slop-pail of its pew-opener mingling a cleansing odor with the ancient smells which pervade all old churches. But these things are of the nerves and may not be imparted, though they may be intimated. As rich in its way as the sentiment of St. Ethelburga was that of the <b>quiescing</b> streets of the city, that pleasant afternoon, with their shops closed or closing, and the crowds thinned or thinning in their footways and wheelways, so that we got from point to point in our desultory progress, incommoded only by other associations that rivalled those we had more specifically in mind. History, of people and of princes, finance, literature, the arts of every kind, were the phantoms that started up from the stones and the blocks of the wood-pavement and followed or fled before us at every step. As I have already tried to express, it is always the same story. London is too full of interest, and when I thought how I could have gone over as much ground in New York without anything to distract me from what I had in view, I felt the pressure of those thick London facts almost to suffocation. Nothing but my denser ignorance saved me from their density, as I hurried with my friend through air that any ignorance less dense would have found impassable with memories.|$|E

6000|$|There {{are certain}} characteristics, qualities, of London which I {{am aware of}} not calling aright, but which I will call sentiments for want of some better word. One {{of them was the}} feel of the night-air, {{especially}} late in the season, when there was a waste and weariness in it as if the vast human endeavor for pleasure and success had exhaled its despair upon it. Whatever there was of disappointment in one's past, of apprehension in one's future, came {{to the surface of the}} spirit, and asserted its unity with the collective melancholy. It was not exactly a Weltschmerz; that is as out-dated as the romantic movement; but it was a sort of scientific relinquishment, which was by no means scornful of others, or too appreciative of one's own unrecognized worth. Through the senses it related itself to the noises of the <b>quiescing</b> city, to the smell of its tormented dust, to the whiff of a casual cigar, or the odor of the herbage and foliage in the park or square that one was passing, one may not be more definite about what was perhaps nothing at all. But I fancy that relinquishment of any sort would be easier in London than in cities of simpler interest or smaller population. For my own part I was content to deny many knowledges that I would have liked to believe myself possessed of, and to go about clothed in my ignorance as in a garment, or defended by it as by armor. There was a sort of luxury in passing through streets memorable for a thousand things and as dense with associations as Long Island with mosquitoes when the winds are low, and in reflecting that I need not be ashamed for neglecting in part what no man could know in whole. I really suppose that upon any other terms the life of the cultivated American would be hardly safe from his own violence in London. If one did not shut one's self out from the complex appeal to one's higher self one could hardly go to one's tailor or one's hatter or one's shoemaker, on those missions which, it is a national superstition with us, may be more inexpensively fulfilled there than at home. The best way is to begin by giving up everything, by frankly saying to yourself that you will not be bothered, that man's days of travel are full of trouble, and that you are going to get what little joy you can out of them as you go along. Then, perhaps, on some errand of quite ignoble purport, you will be seized with the knowledge that in the very spot where you stand one of the most significant things in history happened. It will be quite enough for you, as you inhale a breath of the London mixture of smoke, dust, and fog, that it is something like the air which Shakespeare and Milton breathed when they were meditating the works which have given so many international after-dinner orators the assurance of a bond of amity in our common language. Once, in driving through one of the dullest streets imaginable, I chanced to look out of the side-window of my hansom, and saw on a flying house-wall a tablet reading: [...] "Here lived John Dryden," [...] and though Dryden is a poet to move one to tenderness as little as may be, the tears came into my eyes.|$|E

We also present a novel taxonomy of degrees of method purity in object-oriented programs, which characterizes methods whose effects are confined to their receiver object. Finally, we find significant amounts of mostly-functional behavior in realistic Java programs: in the benchmarks we analyzed, between 48 – 53 % of declared fields were identifiable as <b>quiescing</b> and between 24 – 78 % of dynamic field reads were from <b>quiescing</b> fields...|$|E

On the other hand, transactions access the most up-to-date data in the database without data contention from queries. Intermediate versions created between snapshots are automatically discarded. Furthermore, dirty pages updated by active transactions are allowed to be written back into the database before commitment (i. e., the STEAL policy), {{and at the same}} time, consistent logical snapshots can be advanced automatically without <b>quiescing</b> the ongoing transactions or queries. 1 Introduction C [...] ...|$|E

40|$|In {{software}} transactional memory (STM) systems, it {{is useful}} to isolate a memory region accessed by one thread from all others, so that it can then operate on it “privately”, that is, without the instrumentation overhead of inter-transactional synchronization. Allowing transactions to implicitly privatize memory is a source of major performance degradation in state-of-the-art STMs. The alternative, to explicitly declare and guarantee privacy only when needed, has been argued to be too tricky to be useful for general programming. This paper proposes private transactions, a simple intermediate that combines the ease of use of implicit privatization, with the efficiency that can be obtained from explicitly knowing which regions are private. We present a new scalable <b>quiescing</b> algorithm for implicit privatization using private transactions, applicable to virtually any STM algorithm, including the best performing TL 2 /LSA-style STMs. The new algorithm delivers virtually unhindered performance at all privatization levels when private transactions involve work, and even under the extreme case of empty private transactions, allows for a scalable “pay as you go ” privatization overhead depending on the privatization level. 1...|$|E

40|$|Any highly {{available}} data warehouse will use {{some form of}} data replication {{to ensure that it}} can continue to service queries despite machine failures. In this thesis, I demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} leverage the data replication available in these environments to build a simple yet efficient crash recovery mechanism that revives a crashed site by querying remote replicas for missing updates. My new integrated approach to recovery and high availability, called HARBOR (High Availability and Replication-Based Online Recovery), targets updatable data warehouses and offers an attractive alternative to the widely used log-based crash recovery algorithms found in existing database systems. Aside from its simplicity over log-based approaches, HARBOR also avoids the runtime overhead of maintaining an on-disk log, accomplishes recovery without <b>quiescing</b> the system, allows replicated data to be stored in non-identical formats, and supports the parallel recovery of multiple sites and database objects. To evaluate HARBOR's feasibility, I compare HARBOR's runtime overhead and recovery performance with those of two-phase commit and ARIES, the gold standard for log-based recovery, on a four-node distributed database system that I have implemented. (cont.) My experiments show that HARBOR incurs lower runtime overhead because it does not require log writes to be forced to disk during transaction commit. Furthermore, they indicate that HARBOR's recovery performance is comparable to ARIES's performance on many workloads and even surpasses it on characteristic warehouse workloads with few updates to historical data. The results are highly encouraging and suggest that my integrated approach is quite tenable. by Edmond Lau. Thesis (M. Eng.)

Therearetwomaindifficultiesinextendingthisapproach to distributed memory. In the shared memory approach, thieves (nodes without work) constantly attempt to asynchronously steal work from randomly chosen victims until they find work. In distributed memory, thieves cannot autonomously steal work from a victim without disrupting its execution. When work is sparse, this results in performance degradation. In essence, a direct extension of traditional work-stealing to distributed memory violates the work-first principle underlying work-stealing. Further, thieves spend useless CPU cycles attacking victims that have no work, resulting in system inefficiencies in multi-programmed contexts. Second, it is non-trivial to detect active distributed termination (detect that programs at all nodes are looking for work, hence there is no work). This problem is well-studied and requires careful design for good performance. Unfortunately, in most existing languages/frameworks, application developers are forced to implement their own distributed terminationdetection. In this paper, we develop a simple set of ideas that allow work-stealing to be efficiently extended to distributed memory. First, we introduce lifeline graphs: low-degree, lowdiameter, fully-connected directed graphs. Such graphs can be constructed from k-dimensional hypercubes. When a node is unable to find work after w unsuccessful steals, it <b>quiesces</b> after informing the outgoing edges in its lifeline graph. Quiescent nodes do not disturb other nodes.
