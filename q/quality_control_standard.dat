40|$|The {{functional}} properties of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from Rough Sike, a stream draining blanket peat in the northern Pennines, UK, were investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays. Nine stream samples were collected at different discharges during 2003 - 2006, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid {{was used as a}} <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>standard</b> in the assays. Dissolved organic matter in high-discharge samples was more light-absorbing at 280 and 340 nm and adsorbed more strongly to alumina, than DOM characteristic of low streamflow, but was less fluorescent and hydrophilic, and poorer in proton-dissociating groups. No significant differences were found in light absorption at 254 nm, copper- or benzo(a) pyrene binding, or photochemical fading. Combination of the Rough Sike data with previously-published results for other streams and a lake yields totals of 20 - 23 values per assay, for a range of DOM types. Analysis of these data shows that DOM hydrophilicity and adsorption are well-predicted by linear relationships with the extinction coefficient at 340 nm (E 340), while good quadratic relationships exist between E 340 and both buffering capacity and fluorescence. Variability in all the assays is significant (p < 0. 001), as judged by comparison with variations in repeat measurements on the <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>standard...</b>|$|E

40|$|Quality {{control of}} {{traditional}} Chinese medicines (TCMs) used clinically {{is becoming a}} challenge and has limited the development of TCM due to the high variability in concentration levels of active ingredients and markers {{as well as the}} lack of well-established criteria. Using Shengmai injection, which is a well-established TCM, as an example, we developed an integrated profiling approach that simultaneously captures the entire spectrum of ingredients and quantitatively determines the levels of seven key ingredients in the TCM product. A multivariate statistical model was constructed to establish a “seven-marker-” based quality standard that qualified the majority of samples in this study. This newly developed strategy showed that a panel of key ingredients or markers in the TCM product were relatively consistent within a statistically acceptable range. Therefore, this metabolomics-based approach will complement the current <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>standard</b> using the concentration of several key ingredients or their total content and help improve the consistency and clinic efficacy of TCM products...|$|E
40|$|Functional {{variability}} of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from the surface water of Esthwaite Water (N.

Suwannee River Fulvic Acid was used as a <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>standard.</b> For nine of the assays, variability among DOM samples was significantly (p< 0. 01) greater than could be explained by analytical error. Seasonal trends observed for six of the assays could be explained by a simple mixing model in which the two end-members were DOM from the catchment (allochthonous) and DOM produced within the lake (autochthonous). The fraction of autochthonous DOM predicted by the model is significantly correlated (p< 0. 01) with chlorophyll concentration, consistent with production from phytoplankton. Autochthonous DOM is less light-absorbing, less fluorescent, more hydrophilic, and possesses fewer proton-dissociating groups, than allochthonous material...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDeviated well {{is one of}} {{the main}} well types to develop coalbed methane in China. It's been widely used by various coalbed methane {{companies}} in recent years. Compared with traditional oil and gas wells, coalbed methane wells are characterized by shallow depth and strict well spacing, which means higher wellbore quality control technology. Furthermore, coalbed methane wells are apt to produce coal dust during dewatering and coal dust causes serious abrasion of pipe and rod. It's required to improve wellbore quality. This paper analyzes the weakness of current wellbore <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>standard</b> and technology for coalbed methane wells on the basis of the characterization of coaled methane wells and finds out the key factors that control wellbore quality of coalbed methane deviated wells. The technology is developed to improve wellbore quality of coalbed methane wells from trajectory design and real-time control. Through the on-site test in Baode block, Shanxi Province, the technology is further improved and it's confirmed by the test result that this technology can improve the wellbore quality of coalbed methane deviated wells. In addition, this paper also presents some good suggestions for compiling standard about wellbore quality control for coalbed methane deviated wells...|$|E
