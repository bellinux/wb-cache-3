5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred <b>quite</b> <b>naturally.</b>|$|E

That takes courage, and also we shouldn’t forget that this account today will also overshadow all of the good that they also did.|$|E
25|$|The role of Jupiter in the {{conflict}} of the orders {{is a reflection of}} the religiosity of the Romans. Whereas the patricians were able to claim the support of the supreme god <b>quite</b> <b>naturally</b> being the holders of the auspices of the State, the plebs (also known as the plebeians) argued that as Jupiter was the source of justice he was on their side since their cause was just.|$|E

25|$|However, {{it was his}} {{successor}} at the Lyceum, the philosopher Theophrastus, who made the greatest progress in antiquity in his work On Stones. He described many minerals and ores both from local mines such as those at Laurium near Athens, and further afield. He also <b>quite</b> <b>naturally</b> discussed types of marble and building materials like limestones, and attempted a primitive classification of the properties of minerals by their properties such as hardness.|$|E
500|$|According to Menken, the [...] "plot-furthering songs" [...] in Beauty and the Beast, {{including}} [...] "Belle", developed <b>quite</b> <b>naturally</b> as {{a result}} of the fact that the film was written to [...] "almost ... exist as a stage musical", having been [...] "presented in the style of a traditional Broadway musical." [...] According to Broadway actress and singer Paige O'Hara, who both recorded the song and provided the voice of Belle, Ashman and Menken [...] "wanted to leave the pop music sound of Mermaid behind and go for something more Jerome Kern/Rodgers & Hammerstein" [...] for Beauty and the Beast. The film's songs and musical numbers, which were written to both [...] "propel the plot" [...] and offer [...] "character development", were heavily influenced by French, classical and traditional Broadway music. Additionally, Menken described [...] "Belle" [...] and the other Beauty and the Beast songs to The New York Times as [...] "tangents from 18th-century France".|$|E
500|$|Kimberly Ann [...] "Kim" [...] Possible (voiced by Christy Carlson Romano): a smart, {{popular and}} {{athletic}} {{high school student}} who moonlights as a crime-fighter, dividing {{much of her time}} between saving the world and attending cheerleading practice. Although protecting the world comes to her <b>quite</b> <b>naturally,</b> Kim actually finds growing up an average teenager much more challenging, struggling with everyday personal issues ranging from homework and schoolwork to bullying, embarrassment, family, dating, relationships, and self-doubt, remaining shy and insecure in the presence of boys she finds attractive despite her own good looks, competence and heroics. A straight-A student, the character is also a strong-willed, naturally competitive perfectionist. However, she remains humble, refusing to take much credit for her actions. Speaking in easygoing teenage slang, Kim's most famous catchphrases include [...] "No big", [...] "So not the drama" [...] and [...] "What's the sitch?", short for [...] "situation". Combined, her first and last names are a pun of the word [...] "impossible".|$|E

50|$|The Grecian gate pillars, {{and some}} of the {{subsidiary}} stone buildings, were probably survivors of the original mill, and stood until <b>quite</b> recently. <b>Naturally,</b> the mill became the principal source of employment in the locality. Most of the workers lived in Killyleagh, but a number of blackstone workers' cottages, by no means unattractive though of course lacking modern conveniences, were built in a cluster along the three streets at the mill gate.|$|R

500|$|Balzac's use of {{recurring}} characters {{has been}} identified as a unique component of his fiction. It enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." [...] Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin". The characterization in La Cousine Bette is considered especially skillful. Anthony Pugh, in his book Balzac's Recurring Characters, says that the technique is employed [...] "for the most part without that feeling of self-indulgence that mars some of Balzac's later work. Almost every example arises <b>quite</b> <b>naturally</b> out of the situation." [...] Biographer Noel Gerson calls the characters in La Cousine Bette [...] "among the most memorable Balzac ever sketched".|$|E
500|$|Waugh {{arrived at}} Boa Vista on 4 February 1933, to find no boats {{available}} {{to take him}} on to Manaus. Days of inactivity and boredom followed, with [...] "nothing to read except some lives of the Saints in French and Boussuet's sermons". Waugh passed {{some of the time}} by writing a short story; although not identified in the diaries, this story has been generally accepted as [...] "The Man Who Liked Dickens". Apart from using different names and some minor details this story {{is the same as the}} episode that Waugh later used as the climax to A Handful of Dust: an elderly settler (modelled in manner, speech and appearance on Christie), rescues and holds captive a lost explorer and requires him to read aloud the novels of Dickens, in perpetuity. The story was published in 1933, in America in Hearst's International–Cosmopolitan, and in Britain in Nash's Pall Mall Magazine. In an article written many years later, Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel: [...] "The idea [...] came <b>quite</b> <b>naturally</b> from the experience of visiting a lonely settler ... and reflecting how easily he could hold me prisoner. Then, after the short story was written and published, the idea kept working in my mind. I wanted to discover how the prisoner got there, and eventually the thing grew into a study of other sorts of savage at home and the civilized man’s helpless plight among them." ...|$|E

In a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply.|$|R

The sensational school <b>quite</b> <b>naturally</b> produced the demagogic party, and the theological school became quite as naturally absolutism, safe to borrow from time to time the mask of the demagogue in order the better to reach its ends, as in philosophy it is by scepticism that it undertakes to restore theocracy.

2500|$|Despite its {{simplicity}} compared with classical logic, {{this combination of}} Horn clauses and negation as failure {{has proved to be}} surprisingly expressive. For example, it provides a natural representation for the common-sense laws of cause and effect, as formalised by both the situation calculus and event calculus. It has also been shown to correspond <b>quite</b> <b>naturally</b> to the semi-formal language of legislation. In particular, Prakken and Sartor credit the representation of the British Nationality Act as a logic program with being [...] "hugely influential for the development of computational representations of legislation, showing how logic programming enables intuitively appealing representations that can be directly deployed to generate automatic inferences".|$|E

Young men proposed as naturally as they now ask a young girl to go for a walk,--and were refused <b>quite</b> as <b>naturally.</b> An offer of marriage was not the fearful and wonderful thing--to be dealt with gingerly--which it has since become. Seventeen was often the age at which they began. And one of the big Catherwood boys had a habit of laying his heart and hand at Virginia's feet once a month. Nor did his vanity suffer greatly when she laughed at him.|$|R
