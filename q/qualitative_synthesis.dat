40|$|Context  Formal <b>{{qualitative}}</b> <b>synthesis</b> is {{the process}} of pooling qualitative and mixed-method research data, and then drawing conclusions regarding the collective meaning of the research. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> is regularly used within systematic reviews in the health professions literature, although such use has been heavily debated in the general literature. This controversy arises in part from the inherent tensions found when generalisations are derived from in-depth studies that are heavily context-dependent. Methods  We explore three representative <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methodologies: thematic analysis; meta-ethnography, and realist synthesis. These can be understood across two dimensions: integrative to interpretative, and idealist to realist. Three examples are used to illustrate the relative strengths and limitations of these approaches. Discussion  Against a backdrop of controversy and diverse methodologies, readers must take a critical stand when reading literature reviews that use <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> to derive their findings. We argue that notions of qualitative rigour such as transparency and acknowledgment of the researchers’ stance should be applied to <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{describes}} an approach {{for the use}} of a specific type of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> in the matrix approach, a mixed studies reviewing method. The matrix approach compares quantitative and qualitative data on the review level by juxtaposing concrete recommendations from the <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> against interventions in primary quantitative studies. However, types of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> that are associated with theory building generate theoretical models instead of recommendations. Therefore, the output from these types of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> cannot directly be used for the matrix approach but requires transformation. This approach allows for the transformation of these types of output. Method: The approach enables the inference of moderation effects instead of direct effects from the theoretical model developed in a <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis.</b> Recommendations for practice are formulated on the basis of interactional relations inferred from the <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis.</b> In doing so, we apply the realist perspective to model variables from the <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> according to the context-mechanism-outcome configuration. Findings: A worked example shows {{that it is possible to}} identify recommendations from a theory-building <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> using the realist perspective. We created subsets of the interventions from primary quantitative studies based on whether they matched the recommendations or not and compared the weighted mean effect sizes of the subsets. The comparison shows a slight difference in effect sizes between the groups of studies. The study concludes that the approach enhances the applicability of the matrix approach. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last decade}} the {{contribution}} of qualitative evidence to the assessment of interventions has internationally been recognized, with an increasing amount of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> published {{and the development of}} methodologies of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> to respond to the growing interest.

40|$|Abstract Background Each {{year over}} five million people develop chronic non-malignant pain and can {{experience}} healthcare as an adversarial struggle. The aims {{of this study}} were: (1) to bring together <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> that explore patients’ experience of living with chronic non-malignant pain and develop conceptual {{understanding of what it}} is like to live with chronic non-malignant pain for improved healthcare; (2) to undertake the first mega-ethnography of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> using the methods of meta-ethnography. Methods We used the seven stages of meta-ethnography refined for large studies. The innovation of mega-ethnography is to use conceptual findings from <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> as primary data. We searched 7 bibliographic databases from inception until February 2016 to identify <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> that explored patients’ experience of living with chronic non-malignant pain. Results We identified 82 potential studies from 556 titles, screened 34 full text articles and included 11 <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> synthesising a total of 187 qualitative studies reporting more than 5000 international participants living with chronic pain. We abstracted concepts into 7 conceptual categories: (1) my life is impoverished and confined; (2) struggling against my body to be me; (3) the quest for the diagnostic ‘holy grail’; (4) lost personal credibility; (5) trying to keep up appearances; (6) need to be treated with dignity; and (7) deciding to end the quest for the grail is not easy. Each conceptual category was supported by at least 7 of the 11 <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses.</b> Conclusions This is the first mega-ethnography, or <b>synthesis</b> of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> using the methods of meta-ethnography. Findings help us to understand that the decision to end the quest for a diagnosis can leave patients feeling vulnerable and this may contribute to the adversarial nature of the clinical encounter. This knowledge demonstrates that treating a patient with a sense that they are worthy of care and hearing their story is not an adjunct to, but integral to health care...|$|R
40|$|Context: In recent years, {{software}} researchers begun {{to benefit from}} <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> to systematically build knowledge about the impact and preconditions of software technologies. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> refers to qualitative research methods (as opposed to quantitative) used to bring together empirical evidence in a narrative or systematic review. However, only few of the qualitative syntheses published in software engineering have shown a rigorous approach to <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis.</b> Thus, the current <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> findings are neither understandable nor trustworthy. Problem: These results indicate {{software researchers}} have difficulties in identifying quality issues in qualitative syntheses and in applying existing <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods. I found three problems that have hindered the use of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods in software engineering. First, the lack of consensus on the meaning on quality has impeded the definition of quality criteria and {{the design of a}} quality appraisal instrument. Second, it is unclear to what extent <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods are suitable for synthesizing evidence in software engineering. Finally, the lack of evidence on the suitability of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods has impeded their proper tailoring to software engineering needs and so, their effective use. Objectives: I aimed in this PhD thesis to design a reliable and valid quality appraisal instrument for qualitative synthesis; empirically evaluate the suitability of the most mature <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods, i. e., meta-ethnography and thematic analysis; and enhance existing guidelines for meta-ethnography and thematic analysis. Contributions: First, I developed an instrument to support software researchers in appraising the quality of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> using psychometric guidelines. I operationalized the notion of quality of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> into four criteria: inter-subject comprehensibility, indication of the research process, trustworthiness, and relevance. Then, I designed and validated the instrument. The results of two empirical studies indicate the instrument has acceptable inter-rater agreement, substantial inter-rater reliability, good criterion validity, and high acceptance. Second, I designed and performed a multiple-case study to characterize the suitability of meta-ethnography and thematic analysis in software engineering. Third, I tailored the current guidelines for performing meta-ethnography and thematic analysis. I specified a prescriptive process; formalize the identification, extraction, and integration of evidence; and formalize the notation used for documenting synthesis findings. Then, I designed and performed interviews to validate the proposed guidelines. The results indicates software researchers perceived the proposed guidelines as understandable, useful, and easy to use...|$|E

This potential is currently underused because the synthesis methods need further development, in particular methods that extract evidence about relationships between concepts. This article addresses the adjustment of current <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis</b> methods for theory building purposes. We use a five- step procedure that includes innovations: 1) Search and retrieval of relevant qualitative articles; 2) Rank the articles based on the richness of information to facilitate the progress of analysis; 3) Extraction of concepts and a newly developed method to determine relationships and draw path models for each separate article; 4) Synthesis of the separate path models into a theoretical model, and 5) Evaluation of the theoretical model, to answer the review question with, amongst others, the use of expert opinions and statistical testing of the model. The method is applied on the case of Triple P – Positive Parenting Program, in order to provide a practical example.

40|$|Background An {{increasing}} number of <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>syntheses</b> papers are found in health care literature. Many of these syntheses use a strictly exhaustive search strategy to collect articles, mirroring the standard template developed by major review {{organizations such as the}} Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration. The hegemonic idea behind it is that non-comprehensive samples in systematic reviews may introduce selection bias. However, exhaustive sampling in a <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> has been questioned, and a more purposeful way of sampling papers has been proposed as an alternative, although {{there is a lack of}} transparency on how these purposeful sampling strategies might be applied to a <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis.</b> We discuss in our paper why and how we used purposeful sampling in a <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> about ‘sexual adjustment to a cancer trajectory’, by giving a worked example. Methods We have chosen a mixed purposeful sampling, combining three different strategies that we considered the most consistent with our research purpose: intensity sampling, maximum variation sampling and confirming/disconfirming case sampling. Results The concept of purposeful sampling on the meta-level could not readily been borrowed from the logic applied in basic research projects. It also demands a considerable amount of flexibility, and is labour-intensive, which goes against the argument of many authors that using purposeful sampling provides a pragmatic solution or a short cut for researchers, compared with exhaustive sampling. Opportunities of purposeful sampling were the possible inclusion of new perspectives to the line-of-argument and the enhancement of the theoretical diversity of the papers being included, which could make the results more conceptually aligned with the synthesis purpose. Conclusions This paper helps researchers to make decisions related to purposeful sampling in a more systematic and transparent way. Future research could confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis of conceptual enhancement by comparing the findings of a purposefully sampled <b>qualitative</b> evidence <b>synthesis</b> with those drawing on an exhaustive sample of the literature. status: accepte...|$|R

Until now, {{the strength of the}} evidence in the primary studies has not been taken into account in the outcome of the <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis.</b> In this paper, a method is developed and evaluated to assign weights to the findings of the qualitative studies using both the frequency {{and the quality of the}} reported results. Method Seventeen qualitative studies were retrieved in an illustrative example project on children and trauma. Findings were extracted from the primary studies with the use of coding which resulted in 14 themes. The quality of the studies was appraised using both expert judgement and a quality checklist. These outcomes are used to calculate the weights. Results When the outcomes of the checklist appraisal are compared with those of the expert judgement, the effect on the strength of the evidence is virtually always in the same direction. We found that as the frequency with which a concept is studied is low, the strength of the evidence oftentimes decreases even further when using the quality of the results in the weighing process. Conclusions In the end, the outcomes of a critical appraisal affect the weight that is placed on particular studies. The use of a checklist is recommended because of its more distinguishing ability. The method that was developed for assigning weights to the evidence is discussed in light of both the quality appraisal in qualitative research and the objectives of <b>qualitative</b> <b>synthesis.</b> © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
