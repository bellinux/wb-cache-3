40|$|A sample {{preparation}} method based on supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) is developed {{to determine the}} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content in ambient air. Unlike conventional liquid solvent extractions, the SFE method nearly eliminates the use of organic solvents and significantly shortens {{sample preparation}} time. Organic pollutants from air are collected with a sampling cartridge consisting of a filter and an adsorbent bed. After sample collection, both the filter and adsorbent are extracted to determine their PAH and PCB content. For the SFE method, Florisil is the best sampling adsorbent because it allows for <b>quantitative</b> <b>recoveries</b> of spiked PCB and PAH standards from the adsorbents using supercritical C O 2 or N 2. O in {{the presence or absence}} of an organic modifier. Florisil also permits fractionation of PCBs from PAHs during SFE by first quantitatively extracting all the PCBs at 5000 psi and 250 °C and then the PAHs at 9000 psi and 250 °C using supercritical C 0 2.

40|$|The lungs of cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) patients are chronically colonized by a polymicrobial biofilm community, leading to difficult-to-treat infections. To combat these infections, CF patients are commonly {{treated with a}} variety of antibiotics. Understanding the dynamics of polymicrobial community composition in response to antibiotic therapy is essential in the search for novel therapies. Culture-dependent quantification of individual bacteria from defined multispecies biofilms is frequently carried out by plating on selective media. However, the influence of the selective agents in these media on <b>quantitative</b> <b>recovery</b> before or after antibiotic treatment is often unknown. In the present study we developed selective media for six bacterial species that are frequently co-isolated from the CF lung, i. e. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus anginosus, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Rothia mucilaginosa, and Gemella haemolysans. We show that certain supplementations to selective media strongly influence <b>quantitative</b> <b>recovery</b> of (un) treated biofilms. Hence, the developed media were optimized for selectivity and <b>quantitative</b> <b>recovery</b> before or after treatment with antibiotics of four major classes, i. e. ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, colistin, or tobramycin.
