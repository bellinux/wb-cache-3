50|$|The site {{chosen for}} the {{construction}} of the new gaol was a former sheep <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground,</b> located approximately eight kilometres from town. The new gaol buildings were sited conveniently near the Great Northern Railway, which made possible the rapid and easy transit of prisoners and supplies to and from Townsville.|$|R
60|$|Our {{ship was}} named after this noble stream. We got on board of her off Bedlow's, and dropped quietly down {{as far as the}} <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground</b> before we were met by the flood. Here we came to, to wait for a wind, more passengers, and that {{important}} personage, whom man-of-war's men term the master, and landsmen the captain. In the course of the afternoon we had all assembled, and began to reconnoitre each other, and to attend to our comforts.|$|R
60|$|I {{left the}} Plato at the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground,</b> {{going to the}} Sailor's Retreat. Here the {{physician}} told me I never could recover the use of my limb as I had possessed it before, but that the leg would gradually grow stronger, and that I might get along without crutches in the end. All this {{has turned out to}} be true. The pain had long before left me, weakness being now the great difficulty. The hip-joint is injured, and this in a way that still compels me to rely greatly on a stick in walking.|$|R
60|$|The ship {{only got}} to the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground</b> that day, but in the morning we went to sea. Our passage was long and stormy. The ship was on a bow-line most of the time, and we were {{something}} like forty days from land to land. Nothing extraordinary occurred, however, and we finally made the Bill of Portland. The weather came on thick, but we found a pilot, and ran into St. Helen's Roads and anchored. The captain got into his boat, and taking four men pulled ashore, to look for his orders at Cowes.|$|R
60|$|We {{filled up}} with mahogany, and took in a heavy deck-load, {{in the course of}} four months, which was a most {{laborious}} process. When ready, the brig sailed for New York, We encountered a heavy gale, about a week out, which swept away our deck-load, bulwarks, &c. At this time, the master, supercargo, mate, cook, and three of the crew, were down with the fever; leaving Mallet, Barnet and myself, {{to take care of the}} brig. We three brought the vessel up as far as Barnegat, where we procured assistance, and she arrived safe at the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{a voyage}} to Norfolk Island, Murray was {{instructed}} to continue {{the exploration of the}} southern coastline. He set out from Sydney on 12 November for the Kent Group; there he successfully navigated and charted the passage between Deal and Erith Islands, which would later be named in his honour. In December he undertook a survey of Western Port. On 4 January 1802, he sighted the entrance to Port Phillip, but decided the entrance was too dangerous, so continued to survey the east coast of King Island. On 14 February 1802 he returned and entered Port Phillip {{for the first time and}} anchored off what became the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R
50|$|On November 14, 2008, four adult flies {{were found}} in El Cajon, California. The San Diego County Agricultural Commission {{implemented}} a treatment plan, including distributing millions of sterile male flies, local produce <b>quarantines,</b> and <b>ground</b> spraying with organic pesticides.|$|R
50|$|It {{was during}} this time that the Hobart Mercury and other sports {{commentators}} began to headlines calls for the club to vacate Queenborough Oval and relocate to either the North Hobart Oval or into the Kingborough region, south of Hobart. Despite improving attendances at home in 1981 and 1982, the Seagulls made the move to North Hobart Oval in 1983, where they played all of their home fixtures at the <b>ground.</b> <b>Buoyed</b> by increased attendances, the club {{made it all the}} way to the Preliminary Final, where it suffered a 53-point loss to New Norfolk. But the success of the 1983 season proved to be mirage, as the club sunk back down the ladder, struggling for attendances.|$|R
25|$|Expertise for a {{laboratory}} came {{the following year}} when Louis Pasteur, responding to a notice for the extermination of rabbits in New South Wales, sent a mission that included the French scientists Adrien Loir and Louis Germont. While in Australia, Loir and Germont were engaged by the Queensland Government to research the origin of pleuropneumonia and its preventive inoculation, setting up a temporary laboratory at the old Immigration Barracks (Brisbane central business district) {{in conjunction with the}} (sheep) <b>quarantine</b> <b>grounds</b> at Indooroopilly for experimental animals. The supervisory commission viewed the results as promising and recommended establishing a permanent institution and laboratory for all diseases of stock, with suitable buildings and a scientist.|$|R
60|$|It was Sunday, but we {{were soon}} visited by boats from the town. Some came to carry us ashore, others {{to see that we}} carried nothing off with us. At first, the officer of the customs {{manifested}} a desire to make us all go without the smallest article of dress, or anything belonging to our most ordinary comforts; but he listened to remonstrances, and we were eventually allowed to depart with our night-bags. As the Hudson was to sail immediately for London, all our effects were sent within the hour to the custom-house. At 3 P.M. July 2nd, 1826, we put foot in Europe, after a passage of thirty-one days from the <b>quarantine</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|R

6000|$|... 'How can I say? I {{always know}} what the hour is, and where I am. I was brought in here at night, {{and out of a}} boat, but I know where I am. See here! Marseilles harbour;' on his knees on the pavement, mapping it all out with a swarthy forefinger; 'Toulon (where the galleys are), Spain over there, Algiers over there. Creeping away to the left here, Nice. Round by the Cornice to Genoa. Genoa Mole and Harbour. <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Ground.</b> City there; terrace gardens {{blushing}} with the bella donna.

5000|$|The {{means of}} combating tick-fever caused by cattle-tick {{resulted}} from research by Charles Joseph Pound who began investigating [...] "redwater disease of cattle" [...] in the gulf district in 1894. He established that redwater or tick fever was confined to bovines and that the disease was readily transmissible by ticks and identified the genus of tick vector Boophilus. In the mid-1890s, Pound, as Queensland Government Bacteriologist, undertook tick fever inoculation studies. These, the first such trials in Australia, established a methodology and dosage that is still used worldwide. A cattle dip was built at the former Indooroopilly Sheep <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Grounds</b> in 1898 and until 1905 {{was used by the}} Department of Agriculture to establish a suitable dipping preparation and procedure for the destruction of cattle ticks.|$|R
50|$|Gun Runner, {{who would}} likely have been the third choice in the field, was refused entry due to a {{disagreement}} over testing protocols arising from a <b>quarantine</b> at Fair <b>Grounds</b> Race Course in New Orleans. His owners, Winchell Thoroughbreds and Three Chimneys Farm, had negotiated with shareholder Ruis Stable for a spot.|$|R
5000|$|Lady MacNaghten sailed from Britain to Australia non-stop, as was {{customary}} for emigrant ships, and {{the first}} news to reach the outside world that anything was amiss was when the ship and HMS Rattlesnake, with Governor Bourke on board, made contact about 200 mi south of Port Phillip around 24 February. Captain Hustwick passed the news to Captain W. Hobson that around 50 adults and children had died on board, mostly from typhus, and many more, including the ship's surgeon, Dr. J. A. Hawkins, were seriously ill. Assistant surgeon Bowler of HMS Rattlesnake was placed on board and the two ships went their separate ways. On 26 February the ship pulled in to Spring Cove, where she lay at anchor and those unaffected or recovering were ferried ashore and quarantined under guard. Their clothing and bedding was burnt and they were accommodated in tents, while those still suffering remained on board. Hawkins, who was on his first voyage as a ship's surgeon, died on 2 April and {{was buried in the}} <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Ground.</b> Captain Hustwick had contracted the disease but recovered as did Dr. Bowler of the Rattlesnake. These three were popularly regarded as heroes; John Marshall, the London shipping agent whose duty it was to select prospective migrants and arrange their transportation, was the villain, dubbed [...] "dealer in human flesh" [...] for overcrowding the ship. Government regulations stipulated a maximum of 2 persons (including crew) for every 5 tons of Registered Burthen; Lady MacNaghten, of 550 tons should have carried no more than 334; she was carrying an equivalent of 336 adults, so certainly the ship was overcrowded, but the previous year she carried 300 convicts, a crew of 37 and 49 guards; 386 in all, but only lost two. Sixty-one Lady McNaghten passengers were lost, though probably not all to typhus.|$|R
50|$|Upon commissioning, Tringa was {{assigned}} to Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 8 and operated out of the submarine base at New London, Connecticut. During her first six years of active service, she remained close to the eastern seaboard. Fortunately, her services as a submarine rescue vessel were not required. On the other hand, Tringa remained busy practicing simulated submarine rescues and serving as target ship and recovery ship for submarines in torpedo-firing drills. In addition, she participated {{in a number of}} rescue experiments for the Bureau of Ships, testing diving bells, submarine <b>buoys,</b> <b>ground</b> tackle, mooring gear, and related equipment.|$|R
50|$|July 2010 - During {{a routine}} {{inspection}} at the Port of Genoa, on Italy's northwest coast, a cargo container from Saudi Arabia containing nearly 23 000 kg of scrap copper was detected to be emitting gamma radiation {{at a rate}} of around 500 mSv/h. After spending over a year in <b>quarantine</b> on Port <b>grounds,</b> Italian officials dissected the container using robots and discovered a rod of cobalt-60 23 cm long and 0.8 cm in diameter intermingled with the scrap. Officials suspected its provenance to be inappropriately disposed of medical or food-processing equipment. The rod was sent to Germany for further analysis, after which it was likely to be recycled.|$|R
6000|$|Look {{at those}} spars, how they creak and groan with every heave {{of the long}} glassy swell. How those sails flap, and thunder, and rage, with useless outcries and struggles--only because they are idle. Let the wind take them, {{and they will be}} steady, silent in an instant--their {{deafening}} dissonant grumbling exchanged for the soft victorious song of the breeze through the rigging, musical, self-contented, as of bird on bough. So it is through life; there is no true rest but labour. [...] "No true misery," [...] as Carlyle says, [...] "but in that {{of not being able to}} work." [...] Some may call it a pretty conceit. I call it a great worldwide law, which reaches from earth to heaven. Whatever the Preacher may have thought it in a moment of despondency, what is it but a blessing that [...] "sun, and wind, and rivers, and ocean," [...] as he says, and [...] "all things, are full of labour--man cannot utter it." [...] This sea which bears us would rot and poison, did it not sweep in and out here twice a day in swift refreshing current; nay, more, in the very water which laps against our bows troops of negro girls may have hunted the purblind shark in West Indian harbours, beneath glaring white-walled towns, with their rows of green jalousies, and cocoa- nuts, and shaddock groves. For on those white sands there to the left, year by year, are washed up foreign canes, cassia beans, and tropic seeds; and sometimes, too, the tropic ocean snails, with their fragile shells of amethystine blue, come floating in mysteriously in fleets from the far west out of the passing Gulf Stream, where they have been sailing out their little life, never touching shore or <b>ground,</b> but <b>buoyed</b> each by his cluster of air-bubbles, pumped in at will under the skin of his tiny foot, by some cunning machinery of valves--small creatures truly, but very wonderful to men who have learned to reverence not merely the size of things, but the wisdom of their idea, and raising strange longings and dreams about that submarine ocean-world which stretches, teeming with richer life than this terrestrial one, away, away there westward, down the path of the sun, toward the future centre of the world's destiny.|$|R
