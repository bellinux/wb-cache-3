Accessory fiber posts are recently introduced to enhance the fiber post adaptation. This study evaluated the effectiveness of glass versus <b>quartz</b> accessory <b>fiber</b> posts. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 mandibular premolar roots with similar dimension (radius of 3. 5 ± 0. 2 mm and length of 13 ± 0. 5 mm) were selected and their root canals were flared until 1. 5 mm of dentin wall remained. They {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups (n = 10) and restored as follows: Exacto glass fiber post (EX), Exacto glass fiber post + 2 Reforpin accessories (EXR), D. T. Light <b>quartz</b> <b>fiber</b> post (DT), and D. T. Light <b>quartz</b> <b>fiber</b> post + 2 Fibercone accessories (DTF). All posts were cemented with Duo-Link resin cement and the cores were built with the particulate filler composite. Following 1 -week water storage, specimens were subjected to fracture loads in a universal testing machine. The maximum loads and failure modes were recorded and analyzed with the two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Fisher′s exact tests (α = 0. 05). Results: The mean fracture resistance values (N) were 402. 8 (EX), 378. 4 (EXR), 400. 1 (DT), and 348. 5 (DTF).

The aim of this study was to compare the fracture resistance and failure mode of endodontically treated teeth restored with two different types of <b>quartz</b> <b>fiber</b> post. Materials and Methods: In this experimental, in-vitro study, twenty mandibular premolars with similar size were chosen and randomly divided into 2 groups (n= 10). After cutting the crowns and endodontic therapy, the teeth were restored with a <b>quartz</b> <b>fiber</b> single taper light-posts in group A and <b>quartz</b> <b>fiber</b> D. T light-post in group B. All posts were cemented with a dual cure cement. Composite resin cores were built up using a pre-formed polyester matrix and every specimen was embedded in an acrylic resin block with a layer of elastic polyether Impergum surrounding the roots as PDL. Compressive load was applied at 135 degree angle to the long axis of the tooth at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min until fracture occurred. T-test was used to determine the significance of the failure load values between the two groups. Results: : There was no significant statistical difference in fracture resistance among two groups. The fracture load in groups A and B were 366. 7 ± 102. 7 (N) and 382. 4 ± 67. 3 (N) respectively.

Materials & Methods: This semi experimental in vitro study was performed on 27 extracted human primary maxillary incisors. The coronal portion of specimens was sectioned 1 -mm above the cementoenamel junction. Complete pulpectomy was performed for all specimens. The post space was created using a straight fissure bur approximately 3 mm. Samples were randomly divided into 3 groups.
