The α-decay half lives calculated in this formalism using the experimental <b>Q-values</b> are in good agreement {{over a wide range}} of experimental data. Half lives are also calculated using <b>Q-values</b> extracted from two mass formulae. The Viola-Seaborg-Sobiczewski (VSS) estimates of α-decay half lives with the same <b>Q-values</b> are presented for comparison. The half life calculations are found to be quite sensitive to the choice of <b>Q-values.</b> Comparison with the experimental data delineates the inadequacies of older mass predictions in the domain of heavy and superheavy elements as compared to the newer one by Muntian et al., and highlights necessity of a more accurate mass formula which can predict <b>Q-values</b> with even higher precision...|$|R
40|$|The life-long {{learning}} architecture attempts {{to create an}} adaptive agent through the incorporation of prior knowledge over the lifetime of a learning agent. Our paper focuses on task transfer in reinforcement learning and specifically in Q-learning. There are three main model free methods for performing task transfer in Qlearning: direct transfer, soft transfer and memory-guided exploration. In direct transfer <b>Q-values</b> from a previous task are used to initialize the <b>Q-values</b> of the next task. Soft transfer initializes the <b>Q-values</b> of the new task with a weighted average of the standard initialization value and the <b>Q-values</b> of the previous task. In memory-guided exploration the <b>Q-values</b> of previous tasks are used as a guide in the initial exploration of the agent. The weight that the agent gives to its past experience decreases over time. We explore stability {{issues related to the}} off-policy nature of memory-guided exploration and compare memory-guided exploration to soft transfer and direct transfer in three different environments...|$|R

Equation (4) can be approximately executed with using Q-table. It is enough to converge this learning if all <b>Q-values</b> of the sets of states and actions are continue to be updated. Because this concept is simple, it makes the analysis of algorithm easier.|$|R

50|$|From an {{economic}} perspective, languages are ‘hypercollective’ goods since they exhibit properties of collective goods and produce external network effects. Thus, the more speakers a language has, the higher its communication value for each speaker. The hypercollective nature and <b>Q-Value</b> of languages thus {{help to explain}} the dilemma that a speaker of a peripheral language faces when deciding whether to learn the central or hypercentral language. The hypercollective nature and <b>Q-value</b> also help to explain the accelerating spread and abandonment of various languages. In that sense, when people feel that a language is gaining new speakers, they would assign a greater <b>Q-value</b> to this language and abandon their own native language {{in place of a}} more central language. The hypercollective nature and <b>Q-value</b> also explain, in {{an economic}} sense, the ethnic and cultural movements for language conservation.|$|E

In a volcano plot, the p-value (or <b>q-value),</b> instead of SMCV or SSMD, is plotted against average fold-change [...] The advantage of using SMCV over p-value (or <b>q-value)</b> is that, if there exist any non-zero true effects for a gene or compound, the estimated SMCV goes to its population value whereas the p-value (or <b>q-value)</b> for testing no mean difference (or zero contrast mean) goes to zero when the sample size increases [...] [...] Hence, the value of SMCV is comparable whereas the value of p-value or <b>q-value</b> is not comparable in experiments with different sample size, especially when many investigated genes or compounds do not have exactly zero effects.

In Q-MAP, <b>Q-values</b> are associated with different upstream nodes and the best <b>Q-values</b> are disseminated directly from the sinks to the nodes thus making exploration of routes unnecessary, while speeding up the convergence of the learning process. Indeed an exploration-free approach eventually leads to maximum routing performance since only actions with maximum <b>Q-values</b> are selected, however it reduces the protocol to a static approach that is insensitive to topology changes.|$|R

30|$|AdaR {{is tested}} on a {{simulated}} WSN with varying node residual energy and link reliability. Results {{show that the}} algorithm converges faster than Q-learning; a routing success rate of ∼[*] 95 % with a low deviation was reached even before the 5 th learning episode, whereas, it took 40 episodes for Q-learning to reach comparable success rates. This {{can be explained by}} Q-learning’s initial <b>Q-values</b> and the selected learning rate (α= 0.5). Appropriate initial <b>Q-values</b> and higher learning rate would have helped Q-learning converge faster. In fact, the authors show that Q-learning is more sensitive to the initial choice of <b>Q-values</b> than AdaR. Indeed AdaR has some useful properties, like taking into account different routing cost metrics and having faster convergence time. However, this comes at the price of higher computational complexity, and communication overhead due to the growing size of the packets at each hop and the broadcasting of <b>Q-values,</b> which also makes it more sensitive to link failures and node mobility.|$|R

50|$|When {{considering}} whether a specific nuclear transmutation, a reaction or a decay, is energetically allowed, one only needs to sum {{the masses of}} the initial nucleus/nuclei and subtract from that value {{the sum of the}} masses of the product particles. If the result, or <b>Q-value,</b> is positive, then the transmutation is allowed, or exothermic because it releases energy, and if the <b>Q-value</b> is a negative quantity, then it is endothermic as at least that much energy must be added to the system before the transmutation may proceed. For example, to determine if 12C, the most common isotope of carbon, can undergo proton emission to 11B, one finds that about 16 MeV must be added to the system for this process to be allowed. While Q-values can be used to describe any nuclear transmutation, for particle decay, the particle separation energy quantity S, is also used, and it is equivalent to the negative of the <b>Q-value.</b> In other words, the proton separation energy Sp indicates how much energy should be added to a given nucleus to remove a single proton.

Decision making is mainly based on the relative <b>Q-values</b> of these two actions. However, no reward has been provided to the CASH action and hence the <b>Q-values</b> of this action reflect little information on the price trend of the asset. In this regard, a novel method, called the bidirectional reinforcement learning, is introduced to actively persuade for the appropriate <b>Q-values</b> of the CASH action.

40|$|A multiple-valued {{function}} is a "function" that assumes {{two or more}} distinct values in its range {{for at least one}} point in its domain. While these "functions" are not functions in the normal sense of being single-valued, the usage is so common {{that there is no way}} to dislodge it. This thesis is devoted to a particular class of {{multiple-valued function}}s: <b>Q-valued</b> functions. A <b>Q-valued</b> function is essentially a rule assigning Q unordered and not necessarily distinct points of R^n to each element of R^m. This object is one of the key ingredients of Almgren's 1700 pages proof that the singular set of an m-dimensional mass minimizing integral current in R^n has dimension at most m- 2. We start by developing a decomposition theory and show for instance when a continuous <b>Q-valued</b> function can or cannot be seen as Q "glued" continuous classical functions. Then, the decomposition theory is used to prove intrinsically a Rademacher type theorem for Lipschitz <b>Q-valued</b> functions. A couple of Lipschitz extension theorems are also obtained for partially defined Lipschitz <b>Q-valued</b> functions. The second part is devoted to a Peano type result for a particular class of nonconvex-valued differential inclusions. To the best of the author's knowledge this is the first theorem, in the nonconvex case, where the existence of a continuously differentiable solution is proved under a mere continuity assumption on the corresponding multifunction. An application to a particular class of nonlinear differential equations is included. The third part is devoted to the calculus of variations in the multiple-valued framework. We define two different notions of Dirichlet nearly minimizing <b>Q-valued</b> functions, generalizing Dirichlet energy minimizers studied by Almgren. Hölder regularity is obtained for these nearly minimizers and we give some examples showing that the branching phenomena can be much worse in this context. (MATH 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R
