50|$|Investigation of {{the above}} {{problems}} started {{at the end of}} the 1980s with work on bifurcation control and continued with work on the control of chaos. Ott, Grebogi and Yorke and their followers introduced a new class of control goals not requiring any <b>quantitative</b> <b>characteristic</b> of the desired motion. Instead, the desired qualitative type of the limit set (attractor) was specified, e.g., control should provide the system with a chaotic attractor. Additionally, the desired degree of chaoticity may be specified by specifying the Lyapunov exponent, fractal dimension, entropy, etc. See.|$|E
5000|$|... == Risk Assessment == When {{quality control}} of TEMPs is considered, a risk {{assessment}} needs to be conducted. A risk {{is defined as a}} “potentially unfavourable effect that {{can be attributed to the}} clinical use of advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs) and is of concern to the patient and/or to other populations (e.g. caregivers and off-spring)”. Some risks include immunogenicity, disease transmission, tumor formation, treatment failure, undesirable tissue formation, and inadvertent germ transduction. A risk factor is defined as a “qualitative or <b>quantitative</b> <b>characteristic</b> that contributes to a specific risk following handling and/or administration of an ATMP”. The integration of all available information on risks and risk factors is called risk profiling. Due to the fact that every TEMP is different, the risks associated with each one of them vary and, subsequently, the procedures that must be implemented to ensure its quality are also unique to the product. Once the risks associated with the TEMP are identified, the appropriate tests must be developed and validated accordingly. Thus, there is no standard set of tests for the quality control of TEMPs. The EMA has released a set of regulatory guidelines on the topics to be considered by companies involved in the development and marketing of medicines for use in the European Union. These guidelines have to be followed in order for the marketing authorization of a product to be issued. Fictitious examples of risk analysis for further elucidation of the process are provided in the EMA guidelines.|$|E

Using plant growth regulators to improve yield parameters is suggested. In this research influence of arginine at different levels and application time on qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>characteristics</b> of strawberry ‘Paros’ were considered. Strawberry plants were foliar sprayed with arginine at concentration of 0, 250 and 500 μM in two stages (30 days aft er planting and at the start of bloom) with a factorial experiment in a completely randomized design with four replications in greenhouse conditions. Results showed that fruits of treated plants by arginine at concentrations of 250 and 500 μM had improved qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>characteristics</b> compared to control treatment.
