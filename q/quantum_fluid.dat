40|$|In this dissertation, I devise {{computational}} {{approaches to}} model and understand {{two very different}} sys-tems which exhibit stochastic behavior: <b>quantum</b> <b>fluids</b> with topological defects arising during quenches and forcing, and complex microbial communities living and evolving withing the gastrointestinal tracts of vertebrates. As such, this dissertation is organized into two parts. In Part I, I create a model for <b>quantum</b> <b>fluids,</b> which incorporates a conservative and dissipative part, and I also allow the fluid to be externally forced by a normal fluid. I use then this model to calculate scaling laws arising from the stochastic interactions of the topological defects exhibited by the modeled fluid while undergoing a quench. In Chapter 2 I give {{a detailed description of}} this model of <b>quantum</b> <b>fluids.</b> Unlike more traditional approaches, this model is based on Cell Dynamical Systems (CDS), an approach that captures relevant physical features of the system and allows for long time steps during its evolution. I devise a two step CDS model, implementing both conservative and dissipative dynamics present in <b>quantum</b> <b>fluids.</b> I also couple the model with an external normal fluid field that drives the system.

50|$|Building on this picture, {{as well as}} a 2000 {{article on}} time-correlated soliton tunneling, a more recent quantum model proposes Josephson-like {{coupling}} (see Josephson effect) between complex order parameters associated with nucleated droplets of charged soliton dislocations on many parallel chains. Following Richard Feynman in The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III, Ch. 21, their time-evolution is described using the Schrödinger equation as an emergent classical equation. The narrow-band noise and related phenomena result from the periodic buildup of electrostatic charging energy and thus do not depend on the detailed shape of the washboard pinning potential. Both a soliton pair-creation threshold and a higher classical depinning field emerge from the model, which views the CDW as a sticky <b>quantum</b> <b>fluid</b> or deformable quantum solid with dislocations, a concept discussed by Philip Warren Anderson.|$|E
50|$|A charge density wave (CDW) is an ordered <b>quantum</b> <b>fluid</b> of {{electrons}} in a linear chain compound or layered crystal. The electrons within a CDW form a standing wave pattern and sometimes collectively carry an electric current. The electrons {{in such a}} CDW, like those in a superconductor (see superconductivity), can flow through a linear chain compound en masse, in a highly correlated fashion. Unlike a superconductor, however, the electric CDW current often flows in a jerky fashion, much like water dripping from a faucet due to its electrostatic properties. In a CDW, the combined effects of pinning (due to impurities) and electrostatic interactions (due to the net electric charges of any CDW kinks) likely play critical roles in the CDW current's jerky behavior, as discussed in sections 4 & 5 below.|$|E

Furthermore, a magnetic-field Feshbach resonance is used to change them between miscible and immiscible by tuning the 85 Rb scattering length.

5000|$|The HNC and PY {{integral}} equations {{provide the}} pair distribution {{functions of the}} particles in a classical fluid, even for very high coupling strengths. The coupling strength {{is measured by the}} ratio of the potential energy to the kinetic energy. In a classical fluid, the kinetic energy is proportional to the temperature. In a <b>quantum</b> <b>fluid,</b> the situation is very complicated as one needs to deal with quantum operators, and matrix elements of such operators, which appear in various perturbation methods based on Feynman diagrams. The CHNC method provides an approximate [...] "escape" [...] from these difficulties, and applies to regimes beyond perturbation theory. In Robert B. Laughlin's famous Nobel Laureate work on the fractional quantum Hall effect, an HNC equation was used within a classical plasma analogy. In the CHNC method, the pair-distributions of the interacting particles are calculated using a mapping which ensures that the quantum mechanically correct non-interacting pair distribution function is recovered when the Coulomb interactions are switched off. The value of the method lies in its ability to calculate the interacting pair distribution functions g(r) at zero and finite temperatures. Comparison of the calculated g(r) with results from Quantum Monte Carlo show remarkable agreement, even for very strongly correlated systems.|$|E
