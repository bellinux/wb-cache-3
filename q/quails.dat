40|$|ABSTRACT Polymorphism {{of three}} <b>quail</b> {{communities}} was analyzed by using 12 microsatellite markers in this paper, aiming to provide scientific references for the evaluation, protection and utilization of <b>quail</b> genetic resources in China. Results {{demonstrated that the}} number of observed alleles by 12 microsatellite markers ranges between 4 ~ 7. The average polymorphism information contents (PIC) of the Chinese yellow <b>quail,</b> the Chinese black <b>quail</b> and the Korean <b>quail,</b> as detected by 12 microsatellite markers, are 0. 6853, 0. 6401 and 0. 6565,respectively, and average heterozygosity values are 0. 7333, 0. 6957 and 0. 7111, respectively. This indicates that the Chinese yellow <b>quail</b> has the richest genetic polymorphism. According to cluster analysis, the Chinese black <b>quail</b> and the Korean <b>quail</b> have the smallest genetic distance (0. 0628), which reflects that they have the closest genetic relationship. The genetic distance between the Chinese yellow <b>quail</b> and the Korean <b>quail</b> is 0. 0951.

5|$|Both Crex crakes are omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feed on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. The corn crake may take pests such as Sitona weevils, leatherjackets and wireworms. In Africa, termites, cockroaches and dung beetles may be consumed. These opportunist hunters {{will take the}} occasional vertebrate such as a small frog, rodent or fish. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. In Africa, both species will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach. Indigestible material is regurgitated as pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. Crex crakes forage singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes {{in association with the}} other member of the genus or with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue <b>quails</b> and common <b>quails.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the hooded pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming <b>quails</b> (although toxicity in <b>quails</b> is unusual), and the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{habitats}} in the park supports a diverse population of birds including some, such as the vermilion flycatcher and the whiskered screech owl, uncommon elsewhere in the United States. Among the park's 107 bird species are great horned owls, cactus wrens, ravens, kestrels, turkey vultures, roadrunners, woodpeckers, hawks, <b>quails,</b> and hummingbirds, and one threatened species, the Mexican spotted owl.|$|E
50|$|The brown <b>quail</b> is also {{a member}} of the family Phasianidae that looks similar to the stubble <b>quail,</b> however the brown <b>quail</b> appears darker in colour. The white streaks that are obvious on the back of the stubble <b>quail</b> are thinner and less obvious on the brown <b>quail.</b> The brown <b>quail</b> does not have white streaks {{underneath}} its body like the stubble <b>quail,</b> but has black horizontal bars instead. This makes the brown <b>quail</b> look much darker than the stubble <b>quail</b> in flight. The brown <b>quail's</b> wings produce a whistling noise when flushed which is different from the whirring sound produced by the stubble <b>quail's</b> wings. The plains-wanderer is a highly endangered native species that looks very similar to the stubble <b>quail</b> but can be distinguished by their long yellow legs that can be observed during flight. The little buttonquail is a member of the Turnicidae family but is another species that is sometimes confused with the stubble <b>quail.</b> The little button-quail is a smaller bird with short, round wings and often makes a call of alarm when flushed, whereas stubble <b>quail</b> are vocally silent.|$|R

5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, <b>quails,</b> finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity {{is that they can}} be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for dogs or cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E

40|$|WOS: 000272361400006 International audienceThis {{experiment}} explored {{links between}} individual social traits and behavioural rhythms {{by comparing the}} feeding activity rhythms of HSR (high social reinstatement) Japanese <b>quail</b> that will cover long distances to reach conspecifics, to those of LSR (low social reinstatement) <b>quail</b> that will cover only short distances to reach conspecifics. We evaluated the functioning of their circadian and ultradian clocks under constant darkness (M), and then under photoperiodic conditions (LD). Our results revealed that, under DO conditions, the circadian periods of HSR <b>quail</b> were closer to 24 h than those of LSR <b>quail.</b> Under LD conditions, the daily rhythm of HSR <b>quail</b> was clearer than that of LSR <b>quail.</b> HSR <b>quail</b> synchronized faster and better to the environmental LD cycle than LSR <b>quail.</b> Our results also showed that, under DID conditions, more LSR than HSR <b>quail</b> expressed ultradian rhythmic phenotypes and that the ultradian rhythm of LSR <b>quail</b> was clearer than that of LSR <b>quail.</b> Under LD conditions, these differences between HSR and LSR <b>quail</b> showed the same tendencies. LSR <b>quail</b> seem to present a more functional ultradian system, and thus could possibly synchronise better on an ultradian environmental cue than HSR <b>quail.</b> Our study demonstrated a link between individual rhythmicity and social traits at an intra-specific level.

40|$|We {{conducted}} comparative {{chromosome painting}} and chromosome mapping with chicken DNA probes against the blue-breasted <b>quail</b> (Coturnix chinensis, CCH) and California <b>quail</b> (Callipepla californica, CCA), which are classified into the Old World <b>quail</b> and the New World <b>quail,</b> respectively. Each chicken probe of chromosomes 1 - 9 and Z painted {{a pair of}} chromosomes in the blue-breasted <b>quail.</b> In California <b>quail,</b> chicken chromosome 2 probe painted chromosomes 3 and 6, and chicken chromosome 4 probe painted chromosomes 4 {{and a pair of}} microchromosomes. Comparison of the cytogenetic maps of the two <b>quail</b> species with those of chicken and Japanese <b>quail</b> revealed that there are several intrachromosomal rearrangements, pericentric and/or paracentric inversions, in chromosomes 1, 2 and 4 between chicken and the Old World <b>quail.</b> In addition, a pericentric inversion was found in chromosome 8 between chicken and the three <b>quail</b> species. Ordering of the Z-linked DNA clones revealed the presence of multiple rearrangements in the Z chromosomes of the three <b>quail</b> species.

5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{has been}} used in falconry for centuries and was favoured by Emperor Akbar the Great (1542–1605) of the Mughal Empire. There is a tradition of using migrant Eurasian sparrowhawks to catch common quail in Tunisia and Georgia, where there are 500 registered bazieri (sparrowhawkers) and a monument to bazieri in the city of Poti. Eurasian sparrowhawks are also popular in Ireland. At Cap Bon in Tunisia, and in Turkey, thousands are captured each year by falconers and used for hunting migrant common <b>quails.</b> Although they were formerly released {{at the end of the}} season, many are now kept because of the scarcity of migrants.|$|E
5|$|Western Swing, {{a musical}} genre with roots in country music, was made popular at Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom.

5|$|Both species {{walk with}} a high-stepping action, and can run swiftly through grass {{with the body}} held {{horizontal}} and laterally flattened. When disturbed, they typically fly less than , frequently landing behind a bush or thicket, and then go into a crouch. In short grass, they can escape from a dog using their speed and maneuverability, running with the body held almost horizontal. The typical flight is weak and fluttering, especially that of the African crake, but for longer flights, such as migration, the corn crake has a steadier, stronger action with its legs drawn up. Flocks of up to 40 corn crakes may form on migration, sometimes associating with common <b>quails.</b> Migration takes place at night, and flocks resting during the day may aggregate to hundreds of birds at favoured sites. The ability to migrate is innate, not learned from adults; chicks raised from birds kept in captivity for ten generations were able to migrate to Africa and return with similar success to wild-bred young.|$|E

5|$|Many {{sleeping}} birds bend {{their heads}} over {{their backs and}} tuck their bills in their back feathers, although others place their beaks among their breast feathers. Many birds rest on one leg, while some may pull up their legs into their feathers, especially in cold weather. Perching birds have a tendon locking mechanism that helps them {{hold on to the}} perch when they are asleep. Many ground birds, such as <b>quails</b> and pheasants, roost in trees. A few parrots of the genus Loriculus roost hanging upside down. Some hummingbirds go into a nightly state of torpor accompanied with a reduction of their metabolic rates. This physiological adaptation shows in nearly a hundred other species, including owlet-nightjars, nightjars, and woodswallows. One species, the common poorwill, even enters a state of hibernation. Birds do not have sweat glands, but they may cool themselves by moving to shade, standing in water, panting, increasing their surface area, fluttering their throat or by using special behaviours like urohidrosis to cool themselves.|$|E
5|$|The African crake {{feeds on}} {{invertebrates}} including earthworms, gastropods, molluscs and the adults and larvae of insects, especially termites, ants, beetles and grasshoppers. Vertebrate prey such as small frogs or fish {{may also be}} taken. Plant material is eaten, especially grass seeds, but also green shoots, leaves and other seeds. The crake searches for food both within vegetation and in the open, picking insects and seeds from the ground, turning over leaf litter, or digging with its bill in soft or very dry ground. It will chase faster moving prey, reach up to take food from plants, and wade to pluck food items from the water. Crop plants such as rice, maize and peas may sometimes be eaten, but this bird is not an agricultural pest species. It forages singly, in pairs or in family groups, sometimes in association with other grassland birds such as great snipes, blue <b>quails</b> and corn crakes. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E

50|$|A domesticated <b>quail</b> {{is a small}} fowl {{that lives}} in the wild and nests on the ground, absent human interference. Thousands of years of {{breeding}} and domestication have guided the bird's evolution. Humans domesticated <b>quail</b> for its meat and egg production. Additionally, <b>quail</b> can be kept as a pet. Domesticated <b>quail</b> are commonly kept in long wire cages and are fed game bird feed. The most common domesticated breed is the Coturnix <b>quail</b> (also known as the Japanese <b>quail).</b>|$|R
50|$|The Japanese <b>quail</b> is {{considered}} to be a closely related allopatric species to the common <b>quail,</b> though both are still recognized as distinct species. Due to their close relationship and phenotypic similarities, as well as the recent decline in wild common <b>quail</b> populations throughout Europe, the Japanese <b>quail</b> is often crossed with the common <b>quail</b> in order to create hybrids that are used to restock the declining wild <b>quail</b> populations. Countries such as Greece, France, Spain, Portugal, England, Scotland, Canada, China, Brazil, Australia, and Italy all release thousands of such hybrids each year in order to supplement their dwindling wild <b>quail</b> populations, often releasing these birds right before the start of the hunting season. These hybrids are practically indistinguishable from the native common <b>quail</b> in these areas, though there are worries that such hybridizations could be detrimental to the native <b>quail</b> populations.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Within certain {{limitations}} of timing, embryos {{of one of}} the two species, Bobwhite <b>quail</b> (Colinus virginianus) and Japanese <b>quail</b> (Cotumix cotumix japonica), influ-enced the hatching time of embryos of the other species when embryonating eggs of the two species were in contact during the latter stages of incubation. When the expected hatching time of Bobwhite <b>quail</b> was approximately three days later than that of Japanese <b>quail,</b> neither species exerted a significant influence over the hatching time of the other. Virtual synchroniza-tion of hatching time was achieved when Japanese <b>quail</b> were expected to hatch approxi-mately two days ahead of Bobwhite <b>quail</b> and was accomplished by a significant speeding-up of hatching time of the Bobwhite <b>quail</b> coupled with a significant retarding of hatching time of the Japanese <b>quail.</b> Synchronization occurred where Japanese <b>quail</b> were expected to hatch approximately one day ahead of Bobwhite quail; however, in this case, the synchronization was achieved solely by a significant retarding of hatching time of the Japanese <b>quail.</b> When eggs of the two species were set at such a time that they were expected to hatch at approximately the same time, synchronization of hatching time was easily achieved. Where Bobwhite <b>quail</b> were expected to hatch approximately one day ahead of Japanese <b>quail,</b> sycnhronization of hatching time was not achieved even though hatching time of the Japanese <b>quail</b> was sig-nificantly speeded-up.
