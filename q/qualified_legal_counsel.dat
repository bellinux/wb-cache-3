5000|$|The law {{provides}} for [...] "expeditious" [...] action. The meaning of [...] "expeditious" [...] {{in the context}} of this law has not yet been determined by the courts. Black's Law Dictionary defines [...] "expeditious" [...] as [...] "performed with, or acting with, expedition; quick; speedy." [...] In the common law, the term [...] "expeditious" [...] has been interpreted according to the circumstances, allowing more time than [...] "immediate" [...] but not undue delay. Some suggest that the most prudent courses are to comply [...] "immediately" [...] or to seek immediate legal advice from <b>qualified</b> <b>legal</b> <b>counsel.</b> In the commercial online world, taking more than 24 hours may well be viewed as undue delay. However, when legal advice is factored into the equation it is reasonable to give counsel time to review all the facts, verify the necessary elements of the notice and conduct minimal research to ascertain the current state of the law. This may reasonably occur when the material posted appears likely to be covered by a fair use, for fair use is not copyright infringement. So, in some situations it may be reasonable to determine that [...] "expeditious" [...] would take more than 24 hours, and if the ISP was a small not-for-profit provider, or a server run by volunteers, it may not have the resources to obtain a legal opinion with the same speed that a large multinational corporation may have resources at its disposal to comply immediately. There may not even be a person immediately available who is qualified to determine if the notice complies with the standards set forth in the act. Perhaps a reasonable court would take these factors into consideration. The courts in the United States have yet to rule on these issues.|$|E
