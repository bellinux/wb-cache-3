25|$|I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller {{in whose}} {{companionship}} I might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an overmastering impulse within {{me and a}} desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries. So I braced my resolution to <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being yet in the bonds of life, it weighed sorely upon me to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.|$|E
500|$|Berkman {{encouraged}} Diener and Boxenbaum {{to fly out}} to Los Angeles {{to watch}} a showcase gig at The Viper Room for the four-piece Kara's Flowers. After watching Levine onstage, they were convinced. Berkman told HitQuarters he believed what the band needed was a [...] "fifth member to play the guitar and free up the singer, {{so he could be}} the star I perceived him to be." [...] Octone immediately insisted that the band change its name to break with its pop past. Also, the label began looking for a full-time guitarist to enable Levine to focus on performing as the frontman. James Valentine (from the L.A. band Square) was recruited for the job. On his joining the band, Valentine commented: [...] "I became friends with them and we sort of started jamming together, it was very much like I was cheating on my band, we were having sort of an affair and I eventually <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> other band to join up with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx in 1954 and from Fordham University in the Bronx with a bachelor's degree in Communication Arts in 1958, DeLillo {{took a job}} in {{advertising}} because he couldn't get one in publishing. He worked for five years as a copywriter at the agency of Ogilvy & Mather on Fifth Avenue at East 48th Street, writing image ads for Sears Roebuck among others, working on [...] "Print ads, very undistinguished accounts....I hadn’t made the leap to television. I was just getting good at it when I left, in 1964." [...] DeLillo published his first short story in 1960—"The River Jordan", in Epoch, the literary magazine of Cornell University—and began {{to work on his}} first novel in 1966. Discussing the beginning of his writing career, DeLillo said, [...] "I did some short stories at that time, but very infrequently. I <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> job just to quit. I didn't <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> job to write fiction. I just didn't want to work anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the BBC's {{decision}} not to renew Clarkson's contract with the show on 25 March 2015, Hammond's contract expired on 31 March. In April he ruled {{out the possibility of}} continuing to present Top Gear, commenting via Twitter that [...] "amidst all this talk of us 'quitting' or not: there's nothing for me to 'quit' not about to <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> mates anyway". On 12 June 2015 the BBC confirmed that Top Gear will return with a 75-minute special, combining two unseen challenges featuring all three presenters from series 22, with studio links from Hammond and May. It aired in the UK on BBC Two on 28 June at 8 p.m, and in the United States on BBC America on 13 July at 9 p.m.|$|E
2500|$|Comedy Central premiered Office Space on August 5, 2001 and 1.4 {{million viewers}} tuned in. By 2003, the channel had {{broadcast}} the film another 35 times. These broadcasts {{helped develop the}} film's cult following and Ron Livingston remembers being approached by college students and office workers. He said, [...] "I {{get a lot of}} people who say, 'I <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> job because of you.' That's kind of a heavy load to carry." [...] People approached Stephen Root asking him to sign their staplers. The red Swingline stapler featured prominently in the film was not available until April 2002 when the company released it in response to repeated requests by fans of the film. Its appearance in the film was achieved by taking a standard Swingline stapler and spray-painting it red.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 August 2010, the Russian Islamist website Kavkaz Center claimed Umarov had officially {{announced}} his resignation {{for health reasons}} and appointed his military deputy Aslambek Vadalov as his successor. He appointed Vadalov saying [...] "that jihad should be led by younger and more energetic commanders." [...] Although {{he added that he}} would [...] "continue to wage jihad and will do his utmost to help the new leadership. [...] does not mean that I give up jihad. I will do whatever I can by word and deed." [...] On 4 August, he contradicted the claim issued by him on video saying [...] "Due to the situation in the Caucasus I consider that it is impossible for me to <b>quit</b> <b>my</b> duties. The previous declaration is annulled. It is a falsification. I declare that my health is good to serve Allah. And I will serve the word of Allah and work to kill the enemies of Allah in all the time that he gives me to live on this earth." [...] He called the initial video a [...] "fabrication," [...] but did not say why there was a conflict. Later in 2010, Vadalov and the Arab mujahid Muhannad attempted to overthrow Umarov {{as the leader of the}} Caucasus Emirate. The [...] "supreme judge" [...] of the group, Sayfullah and Emir Adam, the [...] "governor of Ingushetia province", continued to support Umarov. Umarov blamed the split in the organization for Muhannad, who was killed by Russian forces in April 2011, paving the way for re-unification. In July 2011, the insurgents' supreme Islamic court ruled in favour of recognizing Umarov as the leader of the Caucasus Emirate. Amir Khamzat, the commander of the Riyad-us-Saliheen Martyr Brigade suicide battalion was named the commander of the western sector; Hussein Gakayev was named to lead the eastern sector. Vadalov and Tarkhan Gaziyev consequently followed suit and re-affirmed their allegiance to Umarov. Umarov then warned Russia that it would be the target of a new strengthened insurgency as he promised a year of [...] "blood and tears" [...] as a result of the new unity.|$|E
