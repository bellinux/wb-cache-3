50|$|In 1964, {{after the}} epic The Fall of the Roman Empire failed, the company filed for federal {{bankruptcy}} protection. Two years later, its owner was being questioned under oath at a creditors' committee meeting about the company's overseas assets. It {{included the following}} exchange between Bronston {{and one of the}} lawyers for his creditors: <b>Q.</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr. Bronston?A. No, sir.Q. Have you ever?A. The company had an account there for about six months, in Zürich.Q. Have you any nominees who have bank accounts in Swiss banks?A. No, sir.Q. Have you ever?A. No, sir. All those answers were truthful, although the second one is not a direct answer to the question. It would later be discovered that Bronston personally had had an account with International Credit Bank in Geneva, on which he made deposits and drew checks totalling up to $180,000 during the five years in which the company was active and closed just before the bankruptcy filing. As a result, the matter was referred to federal prosecutors, who secured a perjury indictment against Bronston.|$|E
40|$|Rationale for changes: i) {{we need to}} be able {{to store}} other sorts of {{knowledge}} reference such as cross references, that were not catered for in the original draft. ii) we need to describe more fully how name resolution works, as this was not described in the original draft. iii) there seems to be little point in making the knowledge ref a labelled URI, since we don't make full use of the URI features, so a simpler format is proposed. Replication or retrieval of an attribute on its own is not very useful (it is context-less), so we usually need to know the DN of the entry from which the attribute was obtained, in order to have useful information. Therefore it is quite acceptable that a knowledge reference comprises a combination of the DN of the entry and the attribute it holdings. This allows us to simplify the syntax of the knowledge ref substantially (which cant be bad). When an entry is copied (replicated) both the DN of the entry and its attributes are replicated at the same time, so we can still replicate simplified knowledge references in this way. This is why the proposed sharedRef attribute does not need to be a URI, it can simply be a pointer to the server which holds the naming context named by the DN of the entry in which the sharedRef attribute is held.
