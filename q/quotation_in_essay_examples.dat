40|$|Salman Rushdie’s prose {{is celebrated}} by many critics for its {{creativity}} on the whole, and linguistic creativity, in particular. <b>In</b> the <b>essay,</b> some <b>examples</b> of the unusual collocations and wordplay {{in the novel}} The Moor’s Last Sigh are examined {{from the point of}} view of their stylistic functions. It is demonstrated that the use of the above-mentioned creative features adds semantic density to the text and simultaneously creates an undeniable ‘Indian flavour’ that permeates the text...|$|R
5000|$|The {{commodities}} {{bubble of}} 2008 led to global food shortages and prompted {{the price of}} oil to rise over $140 per barrel. Taibbi depicts as its cause investment-bank led commodity speculation, after having convinced regulators to dismantle sensible regulations that had safeguarded the process of commodity trading, in place since the Great Depression. The sell-off of public assets is described <b>in</b> another <b>essay</b> with <b>examples</b> of frittering away assets under value to the detriment of future generations. The health care reform by the Obama administration is described as a [...] "grotesque give-away" [...] to the health insurance industry and a betrayal of the public trust. Taibbi argues that the insurance industry unfairly continues to be exempted from anti-trust legislation.|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} James Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s work upon later Writers {{manifests itself in}} a variety of ways. The stylistic range {{displayed}} in Ulysses and the perceptual and epistemological possibilities implied in the eighteen episodes have perhaps most effectively furthered Joyce 2 ̆ 7 s international presence. <b>In</b> this <b>essay</b> <b>examples</b> of J oyce 2 ̆ 7 s continuity are given from the literatures of France and Yugoslavia in the 1950 s and 1960 s, i. e. roughly simultaneously, but at different stages in the intrinsic developoment of letters in the two countries. An analysis of R. Pinget 2 ̆ 7 s "Inquisitory" and A. Robbe-Grillet 2 ̆ 7 s "Jealousy on the one hand", and of O. Davico 2 ̆ 7 s "The Poem" and R. Marinković 2 ̆ 7 s "The Cyclops" on the other, testifies that the richness and variety of Joycean discourse can be put to a great range of uses - dependent on what task the fiction ina particular language needs to assume at a particular moment. In France and Yugoslavia these are historically different at the same moment in time, but «in both countries the most advanced and the most independent writing has felt the 2 ̆ 7 need to enlist Joyce in its own pursuit after new fictional correlates to the changing world of their authors...|$|R

40|$|Without further ado: the perplexities {{surrounding}} {{the relation of}} Arendt’s early and late theories of judgment are rooted in her singular commitment to the abiding yet fragile possibility of human freedom. These perplexities are not {{a function of the}} theoretical faux paux conventionally ascribed to her by well meaning interpreters and sympathetic critics. Indeed, her work exhibits an admirable, if scandalous, refusal to be reduced to the imperatives of an overdetermined moral-theoretical field, an impertinence I hope to honor <b>in</b> this <b>essay.</b> For <b>example,</b> Seyla Benhabib seek to “resolve” Arendtian “puzzles” through reinscribing them within the neo-Kantian architectonics of discourse ethics. Ronald Beiner, by contrast, wonders why Arendt didn’t further mine Aristotelian wells in elaborating her own account(s) of judgment. 2 Herein I will take up these putative ambiguities. Interpreters are undoubtedly correct that decisive ambiguities remain between Arendt’s early and late accounts of judgment, but these ambiguities issue from Arendt’s own problems, concerns, and project...|$|R
40|$|The {{reign of}} the Tokugawa Shogunate {{was similar to the}} Chinese Qing dynasty. The Tokugawa Shogunate enacted a {{cultural}} and educational policy that resulted in the revolution of calligraphic style. Two styles of calligraphy developed: Karayo (Chinese Style) and Wayo (Japanese Style). Karayo was developed by Kitajima Setsuzan. After him the three most influential Karayo calligraphers of the late Edo period were Ichigawa Beian, Maki Ryoko and Nukina Suo, who were known as the Bakumatsu Sanpitsu. Seal script calligraphy is less practical than clerical script, regular script, and running hand script. Seal script calligraphy experienced a renaissance during the Qing dynasty, rising in importance. It went through a number of innovations during this time, and {{it is important to note}} that Karayo developed alongside these innovations and can be thought to have been influenced by them. <b>In</b> this <b>essay,</b> an <b>example</b> of Maki Ryoko's work will be examined in order to discuss the process of reception of Qing calligraphic style in the late Edo period...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} many move {{analyses}} of research article introductions, including several that have drawn on academic corpora, starting with (and heavily influenced by) the work of Swales (1981, 1990, 2004). The conventions for structuring research articles are relatively stable and are well-understood {{by members of the}} relevant research communities; research article introductions are almost always demarcated by section headings, for example, and typically consist of a series of moves aiming to create a ‘research space’ for the article to occupy. In many other academic genres, however, there is greater variation in the purpose and structure of introductory sections. Even if they all function to ‘introduce the academic work’ (Bhatia 1997 : 182), practitioners do not necessarily agree about their generic features. Nesi and Gardner (2012 : 98) found considerable variation in the role of introductions <b>in</b> student <b>essays,</b> for <b>example,</b> and Bhatia’s informants disagreed about the distinctions between introductions, prefaces and forewords to academic books (1997 : 183) ...|$|R
40|$|This essay explores Zhu Zi School (朱子学) 's {{consideration}} of Monarchy, especially regarding with Zhen Dexiu (真徳秀) in Li Zong (理宗) period. Mencius' "Yixing Revolution" (易姓革命) {{was the most}} radical thoughts in Confucian's idea history. He was high worshipped since Southern Sung Dynasty which should be most contributed to Zhu Zi School, while his Monarchy thoughts was not infiltrated into the School deeply. Concerning the history of Monarchy in pre-modern China, {{it is evident that}} genetic relationship (家天下) was not only the essence of Monarch's inherit Law, but also the succession was varnished with the declaration of successor's virtue which was coincide with the Confucian ideal. The illegal law of Monarchy had been the absolute truth for even the Confucians gradually, while Zhen Dexiu was also not a exception. Regarding with Monarchy, Zhu Xi's thoughts of Monarch-official relationship and the emphasis of Monarch's symbolization could be comprehended into the absolute endorsement for monarchy, <b>in</b> this <b>essay</b> the <b>example</b> is Zhen Dexiu, even though the emperor was illegal from the Zhu Zi School's rigorous ethical perspective...|$|R
