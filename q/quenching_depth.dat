The grain evolution is mediated by local grain rotations. In the deep quenching regime, the grain assembly typically reaches a metastable state where the kinetic barrier for recrystallization across boundaries is too large and grain rotation with subsequent coalescence is infeasible.

40|$|Diffuse {{ultrasonic}} backscatter measurements {{have been}} especially useful for extracting microstructural information and for improving flaw detection in materials. In this dissertation, this approach is applied to inspection of railroad wheels. To improve the wear resistance, the tread surfaces of railroad wheels are usually quenched with water to increase the hardness. The pearlite phase of iron, characterized by alternating ferrite and cementite phases, is created by the quenching and the lamellar spacing within grains increases progressively from the quenched tread surface to deeper locations due to the non-uniform cooling rate. The <b>quench</b> <b>depth</b> is an important parameter governing the wheel performance. ^ In this dissertation, several aspects of ultrasonic methods are studied. A new singly-scattered response (SSR) model that includes lamellar duplex microstructure within grains is developed to investigate the dependence of ultrasonic backscatter on such a microstructure in pearlitic wheel steel. An ultrasonic attenuation model is developed to study the influence of pearlite phase on ultrasonic attenuation. The experimental results show that both ultrasonic scattering amplitudes and longitudinal attenuation drop dramatically near the tread surface of a quenched wheel due {{to the presence of}} pearlite. The <b>quench</b> <b>depth</b> is measured by fitting the variance curve from the tread surface with the SSR model that includes the graded lamellar spacing on the propagation path. A mode-converted (longitudinal-to-transverse, or L-T) SSR model that includes duplex microstructure within grains is also developed to examine the preferred orientation of microstructure in a quenched sample. Finally, the dependence of ultrasonic backscatter on stress is verified by observing the decrease of backscatter amplitudes measured from a 1018 steel block under a uniaxial load. The experimental results show a trend that is similar to the theoretical prediction. The residual stress in a quenched steel sample is estimated by quantifying the change of backscatter amplitudes with and without residual stress. ^ Diffuse ultrasonic backscatter techniques exhibit strong sensitivity to duplex microstructure, texture and stress, outcomes that can be applicable for quality control including microstructure evaluation, measurement of <b>quench</b> <b>depth</b> and residual stress. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} {{of phase}} separation of sodium Poly(styrene sulfonate) (NaPSS) in water with barium chloride (BaCl 2) was studied by static and dynamic light scattering. This polyelectrolyte system shows an upper critical solution temperature behavior, {{such that the}} solutions are homogeneious at temperatures above the phase boundary. Using dynamic light scattering, two diffusive modes were detected, and unaggregated polyelectrolyte chains and aggregates coexist in the homogeneous phase. ^ The hydrodynamic radius (RH) of the unaggregated chains is {{of the order of}} 1 to 10 nm depending on the molecular weight of NaPSS, while RH of aggregates is of the order of 100 nm independent of the molecular weight of NaPSS. Unaggregated chains follow good solution behavior with a fractal dimension of 5 / 3. On the other hand, the fractal dimension of aggregates is larger than 3. 5. The value of the fractal dimension suggests that the structure of aggregate is similar to branched polymers, such as star polymers. ^ Upon rapidly cooling the NaPSS sample below the phase boundary, phase separation takes place. During the initial stage, unaggregated chains were converted to aggregates. Newly generated aggregates have a similar fractal dimension and size to aggregates found above the phase boundary. The size of aggregates remained constant while the number of aggregates increased. During the initial stage, nucleation time is sensitive to <b>quench</b> <b>depth</b> and salt concentration. Either deepening a <b>quench</b> <b>depth</b> or increasing BaCl 2 concentration shortened the nucleation time. After the nucleation time, the size of aggregates grew linearly with time. This marks the growth period, at which time the growth rate is higher for deeper <b>quench</b> <b>depths</b> and higher BaCl 2 concentrations. The mechanism of phase separation of NaPSS in water and BaCl 2 is similar to the nucleation and growth mechanism where the aggregate serves as a nucleus. However, it is different from conventional nucleation and growth theory in that the nucleus already exists above the phase boundary. ...|$|R

Understanding the self-assembling behavior, especially the ordering process of micelles in the concentrated regime, is of great importance to the processing and application of these complex systems. An abnormal thermally induced gelation was observed in squalane solutions of a high-molecular-weight polystyrene-b-ethylene-alt-propylene (SEP) block copolymer, and was attributed to the formation of the BCC phase from a nonequilibrium disordered state. Both rheology and SAXS measurements were used for the investigations. The ordering mechanism of the BCC phase in SEP/squalane solutions was proved to be “nucleation and growth” by SAXS experiments in both deep and shallow quenches. The ordering half time (t 0. 5) showed a minimum at an intermediate temperature. This is similar to the crystallization process of polymer melts. In the case of a shallow quench, the ordering process of block copolymer solutions was controlled by the nucleation effects, and t 0. 5 was found to vary with <b>quenching</b> <b>depth</b> as: ln t 0. 5 ∝ (TODT − T) −n with n varying around 2. For deep quenches t 0. 5 followed an Arrhenius relationship with temperature, indicating the dominance of the diffusion effects. The activation energy of the ordering process following a deep quench showed no significant variation with concentration, but it changed from 70 to 40 kJ/mol as the molecular weight of the copolymer increased. ^ The disordered micelles in SEP/squalane solutions were found to be thermalrheologically simple. At 30 °C, from intermediate to low frequencies, the master curves of G′ and G″ of the disordered block copolymer solutions displayed two separate relaxation processes. Rheological tests showed that the fast relaxation mode corresponds to reptation of individual corona chains tethered on the cores of the micelles, similar to a star polymer. The slow relaxation mode accounts for a terminal flow behavior of the disordered block copolymer solutions and was attributed to the diffusion of individual micelles, which in return determines the ordering kinetics of block copolymer solutions in deep quenches. The rheological and phase behavior of diblock copolymer solutions can be effectively tuned by adding homopolymer of the corona block of the micelles. In SEP/squalane solutions, adding PEP homopolymer with high enough molecular weight inhibited the formation of the ordered BCC structure and decreased the zero-shear viscosity of the disordered solutions. SAXS measurement clearly showed that this behavior was caused by the depletion effects of the free homopolymer chains, which shrink the corona chain conformation and thus decrease the micellar repulsion interaction range and intensity. ...|$|E

The faster component (PVME) has a higher molecular weight (80 kDa) than the slower component (PS, 35 kDa), which makes this system quite interesting to study with respect to the evolving morphology, as the blends transit through the binodal and the spinodal envelopes. An unusual demixing behavior was observed in both PVME rich and PS rich blends. Temperature modulated differential scanning calorimetry measurements showed that the Tg value for the blends with sNP was slightly lower than that of the neat blends. A decreased volume of cooperativity at Tg suggests confined segmental dynamics in the presence of sNP. Although, the addition of sNP had no influence on the thermodynamic demixing temperature, it significantly altered the elasticity of the minor component during the transition of the blend from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous state. This is manifested from energetically driven localization of the sNP in the PVME phase during demixing. As a direct consequence of this, the formation of the microstructures upon demixing was observed to be delayed in the presence of sNP. Interestingly, in the intermediate <b>quench</b> <b>depth,</b> the higher viscoelastic phase evolved as an interconnected network, which subsequently coarsened into discrete droplets in the late stages for the 90 / 10 PS/PVME blends.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the structural, dynamical, and rheological properties of colloid-polymer mixtures in a volume fraction range of = 0. 15 – 0. 35. Our systems are density-matched, residual charges are screened, and the polymer-colloid size ratio is ~ 0. 37. For these systems, {{the transition to}} kinetically arrested states, including disconnected clusters and gels, coincides with the fluid-fluid phase separation boundary. Structural investigations reveal that the characteristic length, L, of the networks is a strong function of the quench depth: for shallow quenches, L is significantly larger than that obtained for deep quenches. By contrast, L is for a given <b>quench</b> <b>depth</b> almost independent of Ø; this indicates that the strand thickness increases with Ø. The strand thickness determines the linear rheology: the final relaxation time exhibits a strong dependence on Ø, whereas the high frequency modulus does not. We present a simple model based on estimates of the strand breaking time and shear modulus that semiquantitatively describes the observed behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{homogeneous}} and heterogeneous nucleation of a Lennard-Jones {{liquid is}} investigated using the umbrella sampling method. The free energy cost of forming a nucleating droplet is determined {{as a function}} of the <b>quench</b> <b>depth,</b> and the saddle point nature of the droplets is verified using an intervention technique. The structure and symmetry of the nucleating droplets is found for a range of temperatures. We find that for deep quenches the nucleating droplets become more anisotropic and diffuse with no well defined core or surface. The environment of the nucleating droplets form randomly stacked hexagonal planes. This behavior is consistent with a spinodal nucleation interpretation. We also find that the free energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation is a minimum when the lattice spacing of the impurity equals the lattice spacing of the equilibrium crystalline phase. If the lattice spacing of the impurity is different, the crystal grows into the bulk instead of wetting the impurity. Comment: 22 pages, 15 figure...|$|R
40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} viscoelastic {{phase separation}} in polymer solutions under shear using a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model. The gross variables in our model are the polymer volume fraction and a conformation tensor. The latter represents chain deformations and relaxes slowly on the rheological time {{giving rise to}} a large viscoelastic stress. The polymer and the solvent obey two-fluid dynamics in which the viscoelastic stress acts asymmetrically on the polymer and, as a result, the stress and the diffusion are dynamically coupled. Below the coexistence curve, interfaces appear with increasing the <b>quench</b> <b>depth</b> and the solvent regions act as a lubricant. In these cases the composition heterogeneity causes more enhanced viscoelastic heterogeneity and the macroscopic stress is decreased at fixed applied shear rate. We find steady two-phase states composed of the polymer-rich and solvent-rich regions, where the characteristic domain size is inversely proportional to the average shear stress for various shear rates. The deviatoric stress components exhibit large temporal fluctuations. The normal stress difference can take negative values transiently at weak shear.
