60|$|Obviously {{it is this}} {{reduction}} of the sensible phenomena it represents, to relations of magnitude, which gives to any division of knowledge its especially scientific character. Originally men's knowledge of weights and forces {{was in the same}} condition as their knowledge of smells and tastes is now--a knowledge not extending beyond that given by the unaided sensations; and it remained so until weighing instruments and dynamometers were invented. Before there were hour-glasses and clepsydras, most phenomena could be estimated as to their durations and intervals, with no greater precision than degrees of hardness can be estimated by the fingers. Until a thermometric scale was contrived, men's judgments respecting relative amounts of heat stood on the same footing with their present judgments respecting relative amounts of sound. And as in these initial stages, with no aids to observation, only the roughest comparisons of cases could be made, and only the most marked differences perceived; it is obvious that only the most simple laws of dependence could be ascertained--only those laws which, being uncomplicated with others, and not disturbed in their manifestations, required no niceties of observation to disentangle them. Whence it appears not only that in proportion as knowledge becomes quantitative do its previsions become complete as well as certain, but that until its assumption of a <b>quantitative</b> <b>character</b> it is necessarily confined to the most elementary relations.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwo {{populations of}} the selfing annual Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (Leguminoseae), each {{subdivided}} into three subpopulations, were studied for both metric traits (<b>quantitative</b> <b>characters)</b> and genetic markers (random amplified polymorphic DNA and one morphological, single-locus marker). Hierarchical analyses of variance components show that (1) populations are more differentiated for <b>quantitative</b> <b>characters</b> than for marker loci, (2) the contribution of both within and among subpopulations components of variance to overall genetic variance of these characters is reduced as compared to markers, and (3) at the population level, within population structure is slightly but not significantly larger for markers than for quantitative traits. Under the hypothesis that most markers are neutral, such comparisons {{may be used to}} make hypotheses about the strength and heterogeneity of natural selection in the face of genetic drift and gene flow. We thus suggest that in these populations, <b>quantitative</b> <b>characters</b> are under strong divergent selection among populations, and that gene flow is restricted among populations and subpopulations...|$|R

50|$|His {{research}} from 1947 {{has been largely}} concerned with the causes and functions of intraspecific genetic variation, {{on the nature of}} continuous genetic variation and on the effects of selection on such variation. He has published an important thesis on the meaning of biological progress in evolution and the role of genetic variation in determining long term fitness. He has pioneered a method for the location on chromosomes of genes mediating continuous variation, and showed (contrary to accepted theory) that the genes at different loci affected the <b>quantitative</b> <b>character</b> in qualitatively different ways. He has pioneered experiments into disruptive selection (selection in the same population for both extremes and against intermediates), and (again contrary to theoretical expectation), showed such selection could be extremely effective, increasing variance, establishing and maintaining polymorphisms, and, if the selected individuals were allowed to choose their mates, dividing the population into two partially isolated parts, something which is a step towards speciation.|$|E

However, {{the information about the}} inheritance of qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>characters</b> on hypocotyl and cotyledon of Chili pepper was not available. The aim of this research was to determine the inheritance of qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>characters</b> on hypocotyl and cotyledon of Chili pepper. This research used purple Chili pepper (P 1 (IPB C 20)), green Chili pepper (P 2 (IPB C 2)), F 1, F 1 R, BCP 1, BCP 2, and F 2 populations. Analysis for qualitative characters used mendelian genetics analysis, whereas model genetic prediction for <b>quantitative</b> <b>characters</b> used join scaling test analysis. The result showed that hypocotyl and cotyledon color of Chili pepper controlled by single gene. The gene controlling purple color was dominant than the gene controlling green color on hypocotyl, whereas the gene controlling green color was dominant than the gene controlling purple color on cotyledon. The additive-dominant genetic model with influence of additive-additive and additive-dominant interaction was suitable for hypocotyl length.

The {{aim of the}} study was to : (i) determine induced variability of yield and the other <b>quantitative</b> <b>characters</b> such as plant height, number of fertile tiller, spike length, after selection in single plant grain yield and (ii) evaluate the applicability of micro-mutations in durum wheat breeding. Test populations were M 2 and M 3 generations of durum wheat variety called “Sofu” resulting from EMS (Ethyl Methane Sulphonate) for 8 hours at 24 °C without presoaking or gamma ray treatments. Base populations were constructed by selecting normal appearing single plants from the M 2 generations, plants, selected based on the micro-mutation procedures, were grown as M 3 generate. The experiments were designed in the randomized complete blocds with 3 replications. Each micro-mutant population was grown separately from each other. Estimated variation of segregating generations increased depending on the character investigated and the mutagen used. The high heritability estimates in response to selection demonstrated that the part of the induced variability remains in generations. As a result of expected genetic advances in the M 3 generation that obtaining plants with higher yield by selection is possible.

Although the inactivation of an X chromosome in any particular somatic cell of the embryonic lineage {{is thought to be}} a stochastic and epigenetic event, a strong genetic influence on this process has been described in the mouse. We have attempted to uncover evidence for genetic control of X-chromosome inactivation in the human by examining X chromosome-inactivation patterns in 255 females from 36 three-generation pedigrees, to determine whether this <b>quantitative</b> <b>character</b> exhibits evidence of heritability.

40|$|A gametic {{model of}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>character</b> {{dynamics}} is introduced that fills {{the gap between}} the two existing models: genic and zygotic/phenotypic. In this model, a gamete is treated as the elementary unit of evolution, all biological processes at the levels below gametic remain unspecified, and a gamete is characterized by its effect on the <b>quantitative</b> <b>character</b> rather than by the genotype. The hereditary and developmental processes are accounted for in a generalized form by gametogenetic and developmental functions defined for a pair of gametic effects representing an individual. A parameterization of these functions is suggested that imposes constraints on the heredity of quantitative characters similar to the constraints imposed by traditional genic models. It is shown that this parameterization can be derived for some polygenic additive models. General expressions for the dynamics of the mean and variance of additive quantitative characters are obtained, and the dynamics under random mating for sex-independent, sex-controlled, and sex-linked characters are considered. Comparisons with the dynamics predicted by genic models are made...|$|E

40|$|Most {{areas of}} engineering, science, and {{management}} use important tools based on probabilistic methods. The common thread {{of the entire}} spectrum of these tools is aiding in decision making under uncertainty: {{the choice of a}}n interpretation of reality or the choice of a course of action. Although the importance of dealing with uncertainty in decision making is widely acknowledged, dissemination of probabilistic and decision-theoretic methods in Artificial Intelligence has been surprisingly slow. Opponents of probability theory have pointed out three major obstacles to applying it in computerized decision aids: (1) the counterintuitiveness of probabilistic inference, which makes it hard for system builders, experts, and users to translate knowledge into probabilistic form, create knowledge bases, and to interpret results; (2) the <b>quantitative</b> <b>character</b> of probability theory, which implies collection or assessment of vast quantities of numbers and, since these are not always readily available, raises questions about their quality; and (3) closely related to its <b>quantitative</b> <b>character,</b> the computational complexity of probabilistic inference.

Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications was used. Data was collected on morphological features of watermelon which include vine, leaf, flower, fruit and seed characteristics. A descriptor list with 21 morphological (qualitative and <b>quantitative)</b> <b>characters</b> was adopted from Diez et al., (2005) and Jarret and Griffin, (2007) and was refined and used in characterization.

40|$|The {{computer}} system [1] The system of computer programs for modeling of population dynamics of interacting patterns of polygenes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) {{in the course}} of selection for the <b>quantitative</b> <b>character</b> was developed. The multi-loci pattern always is very interesting stochastic subject in population, requesting the special means of description. Actually this is stochastic (Monte-Carlo) system of modeling, accounting of the main sources of random and directed changes of patterns: recombinations, MGE transpositions and excisions, genetic drift, different deterministic «trends » of selection, and the types of interaction between polygenes and MGE copies in the finite population. The model permits to watch «from inside » the dynamics of all population characteristics, inaccessible for direct measurements in experiment: the frequencies of the polygenes and MGE copies, their average heterozygosity, proportions of adaptive and random fixations, coefficient of inbreeding, heritability, etc. Moreover, this system of modeling could be used for checking of different hypotheses of interaction between polygenes and MGE copies.
