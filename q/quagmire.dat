5|$|Later that evening, Peter, <b>Quagmire</b> and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that <b>Quagmire</b> could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while <b>Quagmire</b> says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill <b>Quagmire</b> in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, <b>Quagmire</b> talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which <b>Quagmire</b> is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry <b>Quagmire,</b> alive and well, behind the wheel of Peter's car. <b>Quagmire</b> reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and <b>Quagmire</b> return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with <b>Quagmire</b> and Joe. <b>Quagmire</b> {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his John Wayne impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces <b>Quagmire</b> to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|Peter asks <b>Quagmire</b> {{where he}} heard the dirty joke in the first place, and <b>Quagmire</b> reveals that he heard it from Bruce. Locating Bruce at {{his job at the}} bowling alley, the group discovers that the joke has been {{transmitted}} by a large number of people, and eventually trace it to a Virginia bartender.|$|E
25|$|The Baudelaires {{go see the}} <b>Quagmires</b> {{and tell}} them what happened. Then the <b>Quagmires</b> plot a plan. The <b>Quagmires</b> {{disguise}} themselves as Klaus and Violet, get a sack of flour to represent Sunny, and do the exercises (at night) so that the Baudelaire orphans can study and make staples (Coach Genghis doesn't know that it's the <b>Quagmires</b> that are running because it is night time and he can't see them.) The <b>Quagmires</b> leave their notebooks with Violet and Klaus so that they can study. Violet invents a staple-making device (using a small crab, a potato, metal rods, creamed spinach, and a fork) and makes staples while Klaus reads the notebooks out loud.|$|R
5000|$|The {{transition}} {{scene from}} Peter's house to <b>Quagmire's</b> house when Peter decides {{to talk to}} him about a revenge lay is a parody of the transition scenes from the original Transformers cartoon series, with the Autobot and Decepticon symbols being replaced with Peter and <b>Quagmire's</b> faces.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quagmires</b> are similar, morass-like {{structures}} in set theory.|$|R
5|$|After {{a horrible}} night, <b>Quagmire</b> {{approaches}} Lois about talking to Brenda about leaving Jeff. At lunch, Lois and Brenda begin {{talking about the}} situation, and requests that Brenda remove her sunglasses, revealing a bruise over her eye. Upon seeing this, Lois tries to convince Brenda to leave Jeff, but Brenda only makes excuses for Jeff's treatment of her, much to Lois' disapproval. Later, at the bar, Peter, <b>Quagmire</b> and Joe discuss the matter, asking if the police can solve the situation. Joe then suggests that the group have an intervention with Brenda, where <b>Quagmire</b> confesses that the sister he knew growing up no longer exists, and he wants her back. The two then embrace each other by hugging, until Jeff enters the intervention, causing an enraged <b>Quagmire</b> {{to tell him that}} Brenda has agreed to leave him. Pressured by Jeff, Brenda reveals that the two are engaged, and that she is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Brian {{tries to}} join Peter's group, but Peter {{says it is}} not a good idea because <b>Quagmire</b> dislikes him. Brian {{attempts}} to rectify the situation outside Quagmire's house. However, Brian ends up making things worse by mistaking Quagmire's sister, who is hiding out from her abusive boyfriend, for one of his dates. Brian tricks <b>Quagmire</b> into going to dinner with him by making him think Cheryl Tiegs, Quagmire's long-lost love, is the one inviting him.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{decides to}} go fishing with <b>Quagmire</b> and Joe, but when <b>Quagmire</b> does not show up, they decide {{to try to find}} him at his house. After {{entering}} his home, they discover that he has hanged himself in a fit of autoerotic asphyxiation. Attempting to save his life, they take him to the hospital, where they discover that he is in a coma. Peter invites Quagmire's sister, Brenda, to visit him at the hospital, and she manages to wake up her brother. Brenda also brings along Jeffery Fecalman, her obnoxious, aggressive and abusive boyfriend, who harasses her throughout the night much to the fury and concern of <b>Quagmire</b> and his neighbors.|$|E
50|$|Klaus finds a Lot #50, V.F.D., in {{the auction}} catalog. The Baudelaires {{believe this is}} the item the <b>Quagmires</b> will be hidden in, because the <b>Quagmires</b> had told them (at the end of The Austere Academy) that Count Olaf was {{involved}} in a secret called V.F.D. The Baudelaires tell Esmé about this, but it is revealed that Esmé knew who Gunther was, and was actually in on the plan to kidnap the <b>Quagmires.</b> When the Baudelaires show her the ersatz elevator, she pushes them down the empty shaft. They land halfway down in a net.|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} they flee the pitchfork-carrying mob {{and run for}} the {{outskirts}} of town. As they go, the <b>Quagmires</b> explain that Count Olaf locked them in the tower of his house. Then he had his associates build the fountain and imprisoned the <b>Quagmires.</b> The <b>Quagmires</b> attached a couplet to the crows' feet every morning, which fell off in the Nevermore Tree when the paper was dry. They tell the Baudelaires {{that the man who}} died was Jacques Snicket, but the mob catches sight of them and they have to continue to run.|$|R

5|$|<b>Quagmire</b> {{returns home}} from a holiday in Florida and comes to the Griffins' house to tell Peter that he has smuggled some {{fireworks}} into Quahog by hiding them in his anus. Peter tells him that fireworks aren't illegal in Quahog, so he didn't need to hide them and could have just brought them in normally, but <b>Quagmire</b> doesn't see any fun in doing that. Later on, the Griffins and <b>Quagmire</b> start {{to play with the}} fireworks. Peter attaches ten M-80s together and shows <b>Quagmire,</b> but they explode, detaching all the fingers from his right hand. With Joe's help, Peter is able to find his fingers and later gets them reattached to his hand. The next day, Peter celebrates getting his fingers reattached by going to The Drunken Clam with Cleveland, Joe and <b>Quagmire,</b> and they decide to continue their celebrations at Pawtucket Brewery after the bar closes. Peter is behind on his work at the brewery, as he is unable to type due to his hand injury, and Angela threatens him with the prospect of being fired if he fails to catch up, so he asks Lois to help him. When Lois agrees to help Peter catch up with his work, Peter attempts to seduce her numerous times. Later at the brewery, after a final attempt to seduce Lois in his office, she gives in and they have sex in front of their co-worker Opie, who runs away screaming. In the end, Peter is caught up with his work and enjoys having Lois help out and have sex with him.|$|E
5|$|As the Thanksgiving holiday begins, Lois invites Glenn <b>Quagmire</b> and {{his father}} (now Ida), the Swansons, Carter and Babs Pewterschmidt, Mayor Adam West, and Carol Pewterschmidt to join the Griffin family in a Thanksgiving dinner.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and <b>Quagmire</b> {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past lives they have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark, and <b>Quagmire</b> was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows {{the story of this}} past life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately for Brian, {{when his}} novel is released, it is universally panned by {{literary}} critics {{and does not}} sell a single copy. Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis (and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught <b>Quagmire</b> arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is still looking for James and offers a reward of $50. Peter nonchalantly takes the reward, admits that he killed him and slams his door before <b>Quagmire</b> {{has a chance to}} react.|$|E

Griffin Peterson moves on with his life, even marrying another woman (Meg).|$|E
5000|$|The Baudelaires {{figure out}} a number of things: The sapphires refer to the Quagmires' fortune. The <b>Quagmires</b> way of [...] "speaking" [...] to the Baudelaire orphans is not V.F.D., but the first letter in each verse, which spells out FOUNTAIN. They rush to Fowl Fountain but can do nothing. They begin falling and Sunny {{inadvertently}} presses a secret button {{in the eye of the}} crow, which opens the beak, revealing the damp <b>Quagmires</b> inside.|$|R

5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, Peter, Joe and <b>Quagmire</b> are shown {{watching}} television at the Drunken Clam, when an infomercial featuring Rat Pack members Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dean Martin is shown, featuring several songs with racially offensive lyrics. Immediately after, the group believes that they see their old friend, Cleveland, who moved to Virginia, across the bar, but are disappointed when it is revealed to be a lamp. Peter {{then goes on to}} express his desire to finally replace Cleveland, stating that their group is just like the Muppets character Statler without Waldorf. Deciding to hold auditions for a replacement for their entourage, they first audition actor Kevin Connolly, who is discouraged from joining once <b>Quagmire</b> attempts to steal his Lucky Charms cereal.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{was cast}} as {{four of the}} show's main {{characters}}: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, Stewie Griffin, and Glenn <b>Quagmire.</b> MacFarlane chose to voice these characters himself, believing {{it would be easier}} to portray the voices he already envisioned than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. The voice of <b>Quagmire</b> was inspired by fast-speaking radio advertising spokesmen from the 1950s. MacFarlane also provides voices for various other recurring and one-time characters, including news anchor Tom Tucker and Lois' father Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Adam West deploys {{the entire}} Quahog Police Department to Cartagena, Colombia {{to search for}} Elaine Wilder (a fictional {{character}} from the film Romancing the Stone which he was watching), leaving Joe behind (as he was not deployed due to his disability {{and the fact that}} parts of Cartagena aren't wheelchair-accessible) with the police station's skeleton crew. Peter, Cleveland and <b>Quagmire</b> join the department to assist Joe.|$|E

5|$|Peter, Joe, Cleveland, and <b>Quagmire</b> win {{a costume}} contest as {{characters}} from The A-Team (because {{they had an}} actual black guy as B. A. Baracus and the other team had a Jewish man for the same role). The four men find Brian, {{who is writing a}} report for the local newspaper. When Peter and his friends win the costume contest, Brian writes a report about it, and is later telephoned by a member of The New Yorker, who tell him they would like him to work for their magazine. Brian is initially given a warm welcome by the staff, but he is immediately fired after he informs them he never graduated from college. Meanwhile, disappointed at no longer being able to be The A-Team, Peter decides to become an unofficial A-Team alongside Joe, Cleveland, and <b>Quagmire,</b> and decide to help their local community. Peter designs a replica of the van used by The A-Team.|$|E

Officer Luciana's final harpoon pierces the books, destroying and scattering many of the pages, as the hot-air mobile home heads towards the horizon.|$|R
