We specifically examine the consequences for the Norwegian occupational defined benefit schemes, primarily for the private sector. The standard formulas in QIS 5 to some extent specify stress scenarios without giving explicit formulas {{as they should be}} exact for the application. We therefore outline exact formulas for the Norwegian occupational defined benefit schemes. We do this both for the net expected cash flows and for the stressed cash flow. The latter we do by giving a method for calculating the stressed survival and hazard rate functions. We also price the embedded interest rate guarantee using market consistent prices from the Norwegian swaption market. We discuss bonds specifically and redistribution of cash flows generally to improve the precision. Using the contract boundary principle in Solvency II we base our calculations on that all policies are converted to paid up policies. This may primarily be relevant for pension schemes in the private sector. However, formulas for active policies are also given. Additionally one would only need the future risk premiums for market risk. At the end we perform a full QIS 5 consequence study for a Norwegian pension fund, using the outlined formulas and discussing all relevant steps.

40|$|The European Project Solvency II {{is devoted}} to the {{appraisal}} of a Solvency Capital Requirement that should capture the overall risk profile of insurance companies. In this framework there is a growing need to develop so-called internal risk models to get accurate estimates of liabilities. In the context of non-life insurance, it is crucial to correctly assess risk from different sources, such as underwriting risk with particular reference to premium, reserving and catastrophe risks. In particular the underwriting cycle is not quantified in standard formula under <b>Quantitative</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Study</b> 4, but probably it could be included, as it provides additional volatility to liabilities distribution and so it could increase the capital requirement. The aim {{of this paper is to}} correctly model the underwriting cycle for non-life insurance companies, also taking into account its effect on the solvency ratio. Starting from Collective Risk Theory, a dynamic control policy is defined to specify the relationship between solvency ratio and safety loading, to model the underwriting cycle. The corresponding dynamic equation for the solvency ratio, under some assumptions, assumes the form of a one dimensional piecewise linear map. In the first part of the work a deterministic version of this map is analyzed, where aggregate losses are simply regarded as a parameter.

Chronosequential single-beam echosoundings, high-resolution multibeam bathymetrical and backscatter data, ground-truthed with boxcores and vibrocores, were used.

The present morphology of the old dumping site -an irregular-shaped dump mound, with sand piles on the edges and a depression in the centre- reflects the way of disposal. On the new dumping site, a dump mound is found, which is characterised by impact features such as depressions and topographic highs. After cessation of the disposal of dredged sediments on the old dumping site, the site has restored quickly its morphodynamic equilibrium.

The changes made to accounting legislation at national, European and international level, with consequences on specific information presented in the financial statements of insurance companies, was another reason of our research. The appearance of the IFRS 4 "Insurance contracts", followed by its evolution phases allowed the creation of XBRL's in as the international standard of publication, exchange and financial analysis of data reported. Also, we cannot forget that the legislative changes in accounting have interesting consequences on economic risk management specific to this field, in terms of huge efforts from national and European supervisory authorities to control and prevent the ban kruptcy of its firms.

Previously, the BIS <b>Quantitative</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Studies</b> have focused on internationally active banks; this study provides information on the possible impact of the New Accord on domestic banks with asset size between $ 1 billion and $ 40 billion. These institutions are often grouped with community banks. The Department found that implementation of the most recent version of the Standardized Approach could lead to an average decrease of 7 % in required capital for credit risk, but adding the proposed operational risk charge could bring the total capital charge on average to an increase of 12 %. In addition, the estimated impact of the New Standardized Approach varies widely across institutions in the study: the change in minimum capital required for credit risk ranges from a decrease of 23 % to an increase of 6 %. The Basic Indicator charge for operational risk ranges from 5 % of minimum regulatory capital for one savings bank to 83 % of minimum required capital for a specialty bank. In this paper, we present a breakdown {{of the effects of the}} various elements of the proposed Standardized Approach, and consider a modified approach. We also analyze Call Report data for the survey banks to determine their “complexity profile” and review possible changes to their capital ratios.

40|$|The Basel Accord of 1988 is the {{principle}} regulation for the international banking sector, and proposed revisions to the Accord represent {{some of the most}} significant changes to impact upon the sector in recent years. The new Accord incorporates operational risk, with the intention of better aligning regulatory capital to the underlying risks by encouraging better and more systemic risk management practices. Profit maximisation {{is said to be the}} key driver of banking activities; optimal risk management practices would facilitate a reduction in the capital charge enabling greater competitiveness. However, the impact of Basel II on the level of required capital is uncertain, with <b>quantitative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>study</b> results showing large reductions in minimum required capital, but uncertainty caused by banks historically holding capital above required minimums for both internal risk management purposes as well as to address the expectations of the market. This paper examines the impact of a new regulatory environment and the subsequent approaches taken in risk management within the banking sector. Strategic decision-making theory, the major schools of strategy, knowledge transfer and computer network risk management are reviewed to propose that regulatory dominance does not determine risk management sophistication; that environmental factors take precedence over regulatory mandates, and that strategy perspectives are shifting towards an organic approach to network risk strategies management. Measures of standards compliance, the impact of regulation upon relationships between sources and recipients of knowledge, environmental scanning, degrees of risk management sophistication, risk management strategy perspectives and heterogeneity of methodology were collected from 82 banking organisations from an initial sample of 652, from August 2004 to August 2005.

40|$|The {{determination}} of capital requirements represents the first Pillar of Solvency II. In this framework the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) {{is defined as}} the amount of capital that an insurer needs in order to remain viable in the market and maintain its default probability below a certain level. The main purpose of the new solvency regulation is to obtain a more realistic modelling and assessment of the different risks insurance companies are exposed to. According to this regulation the SCR standard calculation in based on a modular approach where the overall risk is split into several modules and submodules for which SCRs are computed separately and then aggregated according to pre-specified correlation matrices. The European Commission for calibrating this standard model has recently published the Technical Specification of 5 Th <b>Quantitative</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Study</b> (QIS 5) where the effects of the new capial requirements are analysed. Longevity risk {{is one of the major}} risks that an insurance company or a pension fund will have to deal with and it is expected that its importance will grow in the near future. In agreement with these considerations in Solvency II standard formula longevity risk is explicity considered representing a sub-module of the life underwriting risk module. In this paper we will refer exactly to the sub-module of longevity risk and we suggest a multiperiod forward approach for the correspondig SCR, that is, we estimate at issue time the solvency adequacy along the overall portfolio contract duration. Then we propose a backtesting framework for measuring the consistency of SCR calculations for life insurance policies. In particular to evaluate the performances of the SCR calculation methodologies we quantify the convergence of SCR forecasts through the time. Finally we provide graphical analysis and numerical evidences...|$|E
40|$|Economics Research Paper, no. 04 - 14 At {{the end of}} June 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (henceforth, the 'Basel Committee') finally {{issued the}} 'New Capital Accord' (henceforth called "Basel II"), {{following}} endorsement by G 10 bank supervisors. This Accord replaces the original accord (now termed "Basel I") agreed in July 1988 and implemented by most major banks around the World since 1993. Publication follows years of exhausting work by the Basel Committee to improve upon the original {{in the light of}} market developments, advances in risk management and revealed deficiencies in the operation of the current scheme (which will remain in place until end- 2006 for all banks and, for many, very much longer). This article traces the evolution of Basel II from its inception in June 1999 to agreement on its final form, focussing on the period since the publication of a revised set of proposals for a new Accord in January 2001. The impact of the consultation entered into with interested parties (there were three formal rounds of consultation) on the final shape of the Accord is explored, as is the role played by the <b>Quantitative</b> <b>Impact</b> <b>Studies</b> (particularly, "QIS 3 ") in the moulding of Basel II. Finally, the agreed package of proposals is assessed from a "cost-benefit" standpoint, and outstanding concerns are identified. In particular, {{the question of whether or}} not the Committee has done enough to try and ensure that its ultimate objectives are realised is addressed, as is the possibility that it overlooked a golden opportunity to more fully embrace market discipline within the supervisory process...|$|R
30|$|The {{quality of}} life in medical {{students}} is considered to be affected by burnout and sleep difficulties; however, the <b>quantitative</b> <b>impact</b> is unknown. <b>Studies</b> have addressed the relationship between burnout and sleep (Mazurkiewicz et al. 2012) or between burnout and {{quality of life}} (Henning et al. 2009) among medical students. In a different way, our study appraised the combined effect of burnout and sleep difficulties on quality of life, measuring quantitatively the influence of both factors in preclinical medical students. The quality of life presented a compelling association with burnout dimensions and sleep difficulties. Together, they explained 22 and 21  % {{of the variance in the}} physical and psychological well-being, respectively.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{governmental}} management accounting research {{around the turn}} of the century, as published in FAM, MAR and EAR, is different from general management accounting research in some respects. Although there are variations related to topics, theories and research methods, a mainstream in governmental management accounting research seems to exist. Research is predominantly directed to the way in which technical management accounting innovations are used, including organizational and contextual factors that might influence the use of these new techniques. Qualitatively oriented case and field studies are the dominant research methods, and the research is inspired by various theoretical viewpoints, e. g. economics, organization theory and neo-institutional theory. NPM, regarded as a lower level economic theory, turns out to be highly influential. The paper gives recommendations for governmental management accounting research in the future: more attention has to be paid to <b>quantitative</b> research, <b>impact</b> <b>studies</b> on NPM must be promoted, and jointly conducted research projects by management accounting and public administration researchers are welcomed. ...|$|R
