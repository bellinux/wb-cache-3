5|$|In the Smarta {{tradition}} of Hinduism, Shiva {{is a part}} of its Panchayatana puja. This practice consists of the use of icons or anicons of five deities considered equivalent, set in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern. Shiva is one of the five deities, others being Vishnu, Devi (such as Parvati), Surya and Ganesha or Skanda or any personal god of devotee's preference (Ishta Devata).|$|E
5|$|The {{church of}} Hagia Sophia in the Empire of Trebizond dates to between 1238 and 1263 {{and has a}} {{variation}} on the <b>quincunx</b> plan. Heavy with traditional detailing from Asia Minor, and possibly Armenian or Georgian influence, the brick pendentives and drum of the dome remain Byzantine.|$|E
5000|$|Astrology {{explains}} that raised or multi-aspected planets within the Yod can produce unusual situations and personalities, and {{should therefore be}} carefully examined. One possible approach is for an individual to view the yod as an exchange of positive forces around a mediating middle (though oppositional) planet. The <b>quincunxed</b> planet will act as a conduit of energy, or as a profound and deeply felt block. This aspect can produce a heightened direction {{of energy in the}} chart which may also oscillate between [...] states or situated personalities. A planetary opposition to the <b>quincunxed</b> planet of the Yod can be malefic, or can produce situations of dramatic reversal.|$|R

50|$|It {{was laid}} out in 1820 {{on the site of}} Château Trompette and wasintended to prevent {{rebellion}} against the city. Its guns were turned towards the centre. Its current shape (lengthened rectangle rounded off with a semicircle) was adopted in 1816. Trees were planted (in <b>quincunxes,</b> hence the name of the square) in 1818.|$|R
5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central <b>quincunx</b> of towers symbolises the five peaks of the mountain, and the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E
5|$|The cross-in-square plan, with {{a single}} dome at the {{crossing}} or five domes in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period. Examples include an early 9th century church in Tirilye, now called the Fatih Mosque, and the palace chapel of the Myrelaion, built around 920. The Nea Ekklesia of Emperor Basil I was built in Constantinople around 880 {{as part of a}} substantial building renovation and construction program during his reign. It had five domes, which are known from literary sources, but different arrangements for them have been proposed under at least four different plans. One has the domes arranged in a cruciform pattern like those of the contemporaneous Church of St. Andrew at Peristerai or the much older Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Others arrange them in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern, with four minor domes in the corners of a square and a larger fifth in the center, as part of a cross-domed or cross-in-square plan. It is often suggested that the five-domed design of St. Panteleimon at Nerezi, from 1164, is based on that of the Nea Ekklesia.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, Greek Orthodox churches {{beginning}} in the 1950s tended to use a large central dome with a ring of windows at its base evocative of the central dome of Hagia Sophia, rather than more recent or more historically common Byzantine types, such as the Greek-cross-octagon or five-domed <b>quincunx</b> plans. Examples include Annunciation Greek Orthodox Church, completed in 1961 but designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1957, Ascension Greek Orthodox Cathedral of Oakland (1960), and Annunciation Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Atlanta (1967). The use of a large central dome in American Greek Orthodox churches continued in the 1960s and 1970s before moving toward smaller Middle Byzantine domes, or versions of Early Christian basilicas.|$|E
50|$|The {{midpoint}} of the sextile is a very sensitive point in the chart, as transiting planets, when conjunct with this midpoint, will then be {{in opposition to the}} <b>quincunxed</b> planet. This situation is said to trigger major events, thus revealing the true power of the Yod. Multiple sextiles and trines involving Yod planets can be extremely beneficial and thus spread the energy of this aspect in one side of the chart or produce a focal point for intense energies {{on the other side of}} the chart. Hence, the yod is the most difficult natal chart aspect to interpret and requires a great aptitude in astrological interpretation to divine accurately.|$|R
5000|$|The small, oblong {{shell is}} pretty thick, {{cylindrical}} and smooth. It is fawn colored or red, dotted with small, round, white dots, disposed regularly in <b>quincunxes,</b> or {{in a net}} work. The spire is composed of eleven whorls, generally truncated at the summit. The whorls are subconnate, surrounded at their upper part by an articulated band of white and brown. The body whorl is ornamented towards its base with numerous transverse fine striae. The aperture is narrow, of a violet color. The outer lip is obtuse, thick, almost straight, interiorly having small folds or teeth in large quantities. The upper extremity forms the commencement of an emargination. All the external surface of this shell is covered by a membranous, reddish, thin periosteum, so transparent, that the colors are seen through it.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} Camillan system of {{organisation}} of the 3rd and 4th centuries BC, men were sorted into classes based on wealth, the principes being the wealthiest after the triarii. Principes were armed with short spears, or hastae, up to 1.8metres (6ft) long. They fought in a <b>quincunx</b> formation, usually carrying scuta, large rectangular shields, and bronze helmets, {{often with a}} number of feathers fixed onto the top to increase stature. They wore heavier armour types, the most common form being chainmail, which offered a good degree of protection without hindering movement.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a length}} of at least , the Tasmanian {{numbfish}} has a trowel-shaped pectoral fin disc with a short, blunt snout and concave leading margins. The medium-sized eyes are followed by smaller, nearly circular spiracles with smooth rims. A pair of large electric organs are located {{on either side of}} the head. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils with a three-lobed posterior margin. The narrow, highly protrusible mouth is encircled by a deep groove. The teeth are small and diamond-shaped with pointed tips; they are arranged with a <b>quincunx</b> pattern into bands, which remain exposed when the mouth is closed. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{stands on}} a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three {{rectangular}} galleries rising to a central tower, each level higher than the last. Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, Brahma, the moon, and Vishnu. Each gallery has a gopura {{at each of the}} points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a <b>quincunx</b> with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a <b>quincunx</b> pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth is small and blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
5|$|Mistra {{was ruled}} from Constantinople after 1262, then was the suzerain of the Despotate of the Morea from 1348 to 1460. In Mistra, {{there are several}} {{basilica}} plan churches with domed galleries that create a five-domed cross-in-square over a ground-level basilica plan. The Aphentiko at Brontochion Monastery was built c. 1310–22 and the later church of the Pantanassa Monastery (1428) is of the same type. The Aphentiko may have been originally planned as a cross-in-square church, but has a blend of longitudinal and central plan components, with an interior divided into nave and aisles like a basilica. The barrel-vaulted nave and cross arms have a dome at their crossing, and the corner bays of the galleries are also domed to form a <b>quincunx</b> pattern. A remodeling of the Metropolis church in Mistra created an additional example. The Pantanassa incorporates Western elements in that domes in its colonnaded porch are hidden externally, and its domes have ribs of rectangular section {{similar to those of}} Salerno, Ravello, and Palermo.|$|E
5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} has a diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc about a sixth wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are nearly straight and converge {{at the tip of}} the snout at up to a 130° angle; the anterior disc shape distinguishes this species from the similar Atlantic stingray (D.sabina), which has a longer, more acute snout. The mouth is curved, with a central projection on the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There is a row of five papillae across the floor of the mouth, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 36–50 upper tooth rows; the teeth have quadrangular bases and are arranged with a <b>quincunx</b> pattern into flattened surfaces. The tooth crowns are rounded in females and juveniles, while those of males in breeding condition are triangular and pointed. The pelvic fins are triangular with rounded tips.|$|E
5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} obtuse angle. The snout is fleshy and blunt, generally not protruding from the disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by teardrop-shaped spiracles, which have rounded to angular posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril may form a small knob at the back. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin. The mouth is small and strongly arched, containing 36 papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor and}} an additional patch of papillae is present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small, with rounded margins.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the mangrove whipray is very thick and oval in shape, measuring 0.9–1.0 times {{as wide as}} long. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at a broad angle on the snout tip. The medium-sized, widely spaced eyes are immediately followed by the spiracles. Between the long, thin nostrils is a short, broad curtain of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin. The lower jaw is bow-shaped, and there are 0–5 papillae across {{the floor of the}} mouth. The teeth are arranged in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern and number 40–50 rows in the upper jaw and 38–50 rows in the lower jaw. There are five pairs of gill slits beneath the disc. The pelvic fins are small and narrow.|$|E
5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the ocellated electric ray is heart- or trowel-shaped and slightly wider than long. A pair of large, kidney-shaped electric organs are {{visible through the}} skin {{on either side of}} the head. The small eyes are followed by smaller spiracles, which have seven to ten small, rounded projections on their rims. The snout is broadly rounded, with each nostril divided into two openings by a strut. Between the nostrils is a curtain of skin with a smooth to gently wavy posterior margin. The small mouth forms a transverse line; the edge of the lower jaw is scalloped, and when closed usually conceals the teeth. There are 14–16 tooth rows in each jaw. The small and pointed teeth become progressively longer and sharper towards the back, and are arranged in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern. Five pairs of small gill slits are present on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|The round ribbontail ray has a thick {{pectoral}} fin disc wider {{than it is}} long, with a smoothly rounded outer margin. The eyes are of medium size and are followed by larger spiracles. There is a short and broad curtain of skin between the oval nostrils, with a finely fringed trailing margin. The mouth is wide and curved, with faint furrows at the corners. There is a row of seven papillae on the floor, with the outermost pair smaller and set apart from the others. There are 37–46 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 39–45 tooth rows in the lower jaw. The teeth are small with a deep groove across the crown, and are arranged in a dense <b>quincunx</b> pattern into flattened surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted {{stingray}} {{has a more}} or less diamond-shaped {{pectoral fin}} disc wider than long, with rounded outer corners. The anterior margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy snout, the tip of which barely protrudes from the disc. The small eyes are immediately followed by comma-shaped spiracles with angular or rounded posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril is enlarged into a knob towards the back. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin with a finely fringed trailing margin; only the Kapala stingaree (U.kapalensis) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The small mouth contains five or six papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor, most of which have forked tips. Additional small papillae are present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. The teeth in both jaws are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
5|$|Hastati (singular: Hastatus) were a {{class of}} {{infantry}} employed in the armies of the early Roman Republic who originally fought as spearmen, and later as swordsmen. These soldiers were the staple unit after Rome threw off Etruscan rule. They were originally some of the poorest men in the legion, and could afford only modest equipment—light chainmail and other miscellaneous equipment. The Senate supplied their soldiers with only a short stabbing sword, the gladius, and their distinctive squared shield, the scuta. The hastatus was typically equipped with these, and several soft iron tipped throwing spears called pila. This doubled their effectiveness, {{not only as a}} strong leading edge to their maniple, but also as a stand-alone missile troop. Later, the hastati contained the younger men rather than just the poorer, though most men of their age were relatively poor. Their usual position was the first battle line. They fought in a <b>quincunx</b> formation, supported by lighter infantry. The enemy was allowed to penetrate the first battle line consisting of hastati, after which the enemy would deal with the more hardened, seasoned soldiers, the principes. They were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms of 107 BC.|$|E

25|$|Italian church {{architecture}} {{from the}} late sixth century {{to the end of}} the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans.

25|$|Venice, Southern Italy and Sicily {{served as}} {{outposts}} of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy. Venice's close mercantile {{links to the}} Byzantine empire resulted in the architecture of that city and its vicinity being a blend of Byzantine and northern Italian influences, although nothing from the ninth and tenth centuries has survived except for {{the foundations of the}} first St. Mark's Basilica. This building was presumably similar to Justinian's Church of the Holy Apostles based on its layout, but how it was roofed is unknown. That southern Italy was reconquered and ruled by a Byzantine governor from about 970 to 1071 explains the relatively large number of small and rustic Middle Byzantine-style churches found there, including the Cattolica in Stilo and S. Marco in Rossano. Both are cross-in-square churches with five small domes on drums in a <b>quincunx</b> pattern and date either to the period of Byzantine rule or after. The church architecture of Sicily has fewer examples from the Byzantine period, having been conquered by Muslims in 827, but <b>quincunx</b> churches exist with single domes on tall central drums and either Byzantine pendentives or Islamic squinches. Very little architecture from the Islamic period survives on the island, either.|$|E
25|$|The church proper, {{which has}} never been studied systematically, has a cross-in-square (or <b>quincunx)</b> plan, with each side nine meters long. Together with the Eski Imaret Mosque, {{provides}} an example of the Komnenian style in Constantinople. Its masonry consists of bricks, mounted adopting the technique of the recessed brick, typical of the Byzantine architecture of the middle period. In this technique, alternate courses of brick are mounted behind the line of the wall, and are plunged into a mortar bed. Due to that, the thickness of the mortar layers is about three times greater than that of the brick layers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{thousands}} of years later, human civilization has gone through many Rebirths, or Renaissances. The chance infusion of a mentality from 1949 through a freak combination of the active mode of the Dirac within a radio telescope results in the formation, after many adventures and an ultimate resurgence of Man, of the Quint, the Autarch of Rebirth V. A computer of this far future time uses the Dirac as both a means of communication and infinite memory storage (Midsummer Century). Its existence was foretold {{at the time of}} Capt.

The mouth is gently curved, without papillae on the floor. There are 4055 tooth rows in either jaw, arranged with a <b>quincunx</b> pattern into pavement-like surfaces. The teeth of adult males have pointed cusps while those of juveniles and females are blunt.|$|E
