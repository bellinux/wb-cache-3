40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{classical}} <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> (QT) <b>steels</b> have been progressively substituted for economically superior vanadium microalloyed steels with medium carbon content which are continuous cooled from the forging temperature.

A new post forging treatment has been developed therefore and proves a promising alternative to the continuous cooling of microalloyed steels with medium carbon content.

This study {{concentrated on the}} use of precipitation hardening by copper to maintain the strength of reduced carbon, <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>steels.</b> Many studies have concentrated on copper proportions above 1 % in as rolled steels. It was the intent of this study to examine the effect of copper levels between 0 and 1 % {{in the development of a}} low carbon, 690 MPa yield strength <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> structural <b>steel.</b> The changes in hardness upon tempering, tensile testing, Charpy v-notch impact testing, Jominy hardenability, bead-on-plate weld testing and optical microscopy were used to evaluate the steels.

In studying the copper containing steels, precipitation hardening was observed in a steel containing 0. 4 % copper (nominal composition). It was shown that the strength and fracture toughness targets of military and commercial specifications can be met by the steels developed. As a result of copper based precipitation hardening, Jominy hardenability tests showed a hardenability much higher than would be predicted on the basis of carbon content and the volume fraction of martensite produced as a function of cooling rate. It was demonstrated that the weldability of the low carbon copper steels, as assessed by the bead on plate test, is superior to that of currently used alloys. Therefore, the aim of maintaining strength and increasing weldability by reducing carbon content was clearly achieved...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the hardenability is important in steel development with respect to weldability of steels {{as well as to}} the design of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>steels.</b> The common way to judge if steel is suitability to welding is the use of a carbon equivalent, which reflects the alloy content to the hardenability of the heat affected zone (HAZ). Most common of these equivalent is the IIW carbon equivalent wich has been in use for decades. However, this is an empirical equivalent, developed for CMn steels, and it doesn't say anything about the mechanical properties obtained in the HAZ. As a guideline a maximum HAZ hardness of 350 HV is normally put to avoid cold cracking in the HAZ. Numerous carbon equivalents have been published during the years, but few have been accepted and used. A drawnback of all these equivalents is that they have been evaluated for a set of chemical compositions which may be quite narrow, or that they have been evaluated on steels produced having other cleanliness, residual element levels etc. as is common in modern steelmarketing. The hardenability of <b>steel</b> designated to <b>quenching</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempering</b> is normally evaluated using either Jominy testing or using a calculation using the Grossmann formalism. As the hardenability described in the carbon equivalents used in welding and the hardenability of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>steels</b> using the Grossmann formalism are two different descriptions of the same phenomenon the aim of this thesis is to link these two formalisms together and use the knowledge from the HAZ hardenability to design <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>steels.</b> The goal is to produce such steel grades having a much better weldability as compared with standard grades available at the market.

40|$|Purpose: In this paper, the {{prediction}} of working stress of quenched and tempered shaft has been done. Prediction was done for two different manufacture processes. In the first manufacture process the shaft was made of steel and in second one the shaft was made of cast steel. The working stress was characterized by yield strength and impact toughness. The method of computer simulation of working stress was applied in workpiece of complex form. Design/methodology/approach: Hardness distribution of quenched and tempered workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of quenching using a finite volume method. Hardness of <b>quenched</b> <b>and</b> <b>tempered</b> <b>steel</b> can be expressed as function of maximal hardness of actual steel, hardness of steel with 50 % of martensite in microstructure, according to the time and temperature of tempering. The algorithm of estimation of yield strength and impact energy was based on hardness, HV. Starting point in studying of the mechanical properties of steel castings can be {{the fact that the}} mechanical properties of steel castings are derived from the mechanical properties of ordinary steel metal matrix reduced by the influence of the typical as-cast structure, i. e. casting defects on those properties. Hardness and yield strength will be unaffected by most defects. The only effect will be that due to the reduction in area. Coarse as-cast microstructure of cast steel lowers ductility and toughness. Impact energy of quenched and tempered cast steel was predicted based on pouring temperature, temperature of mould during the pouring and fact that steel castings are not subjected to different metallurgical and mechanical processes of microstructure improvement in so far as wrought steels.

Welding is the desired joining technique because it results in a lower weight than other joining techniques. The mechanical and corrosion properties of the weld region material were fully studied...|$|R
