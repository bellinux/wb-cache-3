5|$|After Wyllie's {{death in}} May 2012, a giant <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> was {{suspended}} from the crane in an acknowledgement of his work. In 2013, microphones were attached to the crane by American artist Bill Fontana, to record the sounds made by the structure.|$|E
5|$|An {{optional}} query, {{separated from}} the preceding part by a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (?), containing a query string of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attribute–value pairs separated by a delimiter.|$|E
5|$|Beckett's surgery, which {{included}} his having a rib removed, {{made him a}} <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> for the Dodgers heading into 2014.

40|$|Sentences {{that begin}} with Why don’t you （I, we） or Why not are {{primarily}} interrogatives, and they normally take <b>question</b> <b>marks.</b> A {{large number of}} these instances are used with <b>question</b> <b>marks,</b> {{but some of them}} are not. The instances with <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> can imply suggestions, offers or requests as well as doubt or interrogative meanings. The instances without <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> can also imply suggestions, offers or requests. The expressions similar to Why don’t you or why not include How （What）about, Can I, Can（ Could） you, Can’t（ Couldn’t） you, Will（ Would） you, Won’t（ Wouldn’t） you and Will （Would） … please. The objective {{of this article is to}} explore how and why these expressions are sometimes used without <b>question</b> <b>marks.</b> The instances were largely taken from the corpora in the BNC and Wordbanks. Although both of these expressions used with or without <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> can show suggestions, offers or requests, when they are not used with <b>question</b> <b>marks,</b> they sound less polite than when they are used with them...|$|R
50|$|<b>Question</b> <b>marks</b> (also {{known as}} problem children) are {{businesses}} operating {{with a low}} market share in a high-growth market. They are {{a starting point for}} most businesses. <b>Question</b> <b>marks</b> have a potential to gain market share and become stars, and eventually cash cows when market growth slows. If <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> do not succeed in becoming a market leader, then after perhaps years of cash consumption, they will degenerate into dogs when market growth declines. <b>Question</b> <b>marks</b> must be analyzed carefully in order to determine whether they are worth the investment required to grow market share.|$|R
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between Spears {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of Spears, both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of Spears, as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of Spears in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows Spears dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a <b>question</b> <b>mark,</b> symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> {{in his work}} because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it a definitive assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|The anime {{adaptation}} shows Deep Blue as a voice {{coming from}} a blue light, to whom Kisshu gives progress reports, and a shadowed version of his true form is seen when Quiche brings him some mew aqua in episode twenty-six. His death is changed in the anime to come {{at the hands of}} Mew Ichigo rather than Masaya, though Masaya aids her by taking over the body. To keep the true identity of Deep Blue a secret, his voice actor's name is shown only as a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> until his identity is revealed in episode forty-nine; after which the credits are changed to list Megumi Ogata (who also voices Masaya and the Blue Knight). Deep Blue {{is one of the few}} characters whose name remains unchanged in the Mew Mew Power dub. The anime slightly modified his role from that of a savior for the aliens to a destructive force that wants to do nothing but destroy the Earth which causes the aliens to turn against him.|$|E
30|$|If {{regional}} “states” want to {{have some}} future potential, regions need to pay serious attention to <b>Question</b> <b>Marks.</b> Without <b>Question</b> <b>Marks,</b> no region has a prosperous future. Typically, this means active science, technology and innovation (STI) policy activities. It is good to remember that there will not be any <b>Question</b> <b>Marks</b> to observe, if there is not some kind of regional innovation system with R&D activities.|$|R
50|$|Writers using {{informal}} language may use several alternating <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> and {{exclamation marks}} {{for even more}} emphasis:He did what?!?!?!Like multiple exclamation <b>marks</b> and multiple <b>question</b> <b>marks,</b> such strings count as poor style in formal writing.|$|R
25|$|<b>Question</b> <b>marks</b> (?) and {{exclamation marks}} (!) are {{used at the}} end of a clause, and may be {{internal}} to a sentence. Question words generally come at the beginning of a question, obviating the need for Spanish-style inverted <b>question</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|R
5|$|In his youth, {{he enjoyed}} polo and boxing. He led a polo team {{known as the}} Zardari Four. His father owned Bambino—a famous cinema in Karachi—and donated movie {{equipment}} to his school. He also appeared in a movie, Salgirah, as a child artist. Zardari's academic background remains a <b>question</b> <b>mark.</b> He received his primary education from Karachi Grammar School. His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972. He went to St Patrick's High School, Karachi from 1973–74; a school clerk says he failed his final examination there. In March 2008, he claimed he had graduated from the London School of Business Studies with a {{bachelor of education degree}} in the early 1970s. Zardari's official biography states he also attended Pedinton School in Britain. His British education, however, has not been confirmed, and a search did not turn up any Pedinton School in London. The issue of his diploma was contentious because a 2002 rule required candidates for Parliament to hold a college degree, but the rule was overturned by Pakistan's Supreme Court in April 2008.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid (c. 633– c. 709) was an English {{bishop and}} saint. Born a Northumbrian noble, he entered {{religious}} {{life as a}} teenager and studied at Lindisfarne, at Canterbury, in Gaul, and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at Ripon. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman position at the Synod of Whitby, and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul {{because of the lack}} of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, Oswiu, leaving a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed Ceadda in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria.|$|E

40|$|The {{puzzle of}} the {{persistent}} <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> (a phrase coined by Harvey in 1993) {{refers to the}} occurrence of residual learnable alleles in simulations of the Baldwin effect, which concerns interactions between learning and evolution. Explanations of the puzzle {{have focused on the}} role of fitness proportional selection pressures and of drift. We replicated the original 1987 model by Hinton and Nolan, extending the number of generations simulated until populations converged on stable genotypes, thus quantifying the number of residual <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> and the time to homogeneity (only one allele remaining in the population for each gene in a chromosome). Previous explanations of the residual <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> imply that algorithms that maintain strong selection pressure should not result in residual <b>question</b> <b>marks.</b> We tested this implication by simulating Hinton and Nolan's Baldwin model replacing frequency proportional selection by tournament selection...|$|R
5000|$|A {{programmer}} {{may want}} to place two <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> together yet not have the compiler treat them as introducing a trigraph. The C grammar does not permit two consecutive [...] tokens, so the only places in a C file where two <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> in a row may be used are in multi-character constants, string literals, and comments. This is particularly {{a problem for the}} classic Mac OS, where the constant [...] may be used as a file type or creator. To safely place two consecutive <b>question</b> <b>marks</b> within a string literal, the programmer can use string concatenation [...] or an escape sequence [...]|$|R
25|$|Other {{languages}} of Spain: Catalan and Galician also uses the inverted opening <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> though usually only in long sentences or in cases which {{would otherwise be}} ambiguous. Basque only use one <b>question</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{exclamation mark}} is {{sometimes}} {{used in conjunction}} with the <b>question</b> <b>mark.</b> This can be in protest or astonishment ("Out of all places, the squatter-camp?!"); a few writers replace this with a single, nonstandard punctuation mark, the interrobang, which is the combination of a <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> and an exclamation mark.|$|E

25|$|The rhetorical <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> or percontation {{point was}} invented by Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of}} a rhetorical question; however, its use died out in the 17th century. It was later revived in modern-day society by Matt DiRoberto. It was the reverse of an {{ordinary}} <b>question</b> <b>mark,</b> so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it. This character can be represented using the reversed <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the Irony mark, but these are very rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|The <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> motif {{was common}} {{throughout}} the 1980s, {{in part as}} a branding attempt. Beginning with season eighteen, the Fourth through Seventh Doctors all sported costumes with a red <b>question</b> <b>mark</b> motif (usually on the shirt collars, except for the Seventh Doctor – it appeared on his pullover and {{in the shape of}} his umbrella handle). In the 1978 serial The Invasion of Time, the Fourth Doctor is asked to sign a document; although the signature itself is not directly seen on screen, his hand movements clearly indicate that he signs it with a <b>question</b> <b>mark.</b> A similar scene occurs with the Seventh Doctor in Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E
