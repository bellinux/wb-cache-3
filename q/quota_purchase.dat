40|$|A {{survey of}} 190 dairy farms in a {{co-operative}} {{area in the}} south of Ireland served as the main source of data in the present study. Eight farms representative of the different types of dairy farms were chosen and their data were analysed using the Finpack financial analysis program. These eight case studies were analysed using alternative funding strategies to determine the effect of alternative funding strategies for farm buildings on net farm income. The data obtained were extrapolated to the national dairy herd. There are some 14, 050 dairy farms with quotas of less than 15, 000 gallons and 40 % of these were classified as non viable. The corresponding figures for other quota categories are as follows: 8, 150 farms with quotas of 15, 000 - 25, 000 gallons with 40 % non-viable; 7780 farms with quotas of 25, 000 - 40, 000 gallons with 20 % nonviable; and 8, 535 farms with quotas > 40, 000 gallons with 10 % nonviable. Non-viable dairy farms were those with low income, low contact with advisory services, low household dependence on farm income, a poor attitude to development and expansion and generally inadequate farm facilities. Non-viable dairy farms should consider changing from dairying into a suckler and/or beef enterprise and should be assisted to do so by the advisory service. They should be considered for a suckler quota unit for each 987 gallons of milk they had been producing. They should consider using income assistants, e. g., REPS, Early Retirement Scheme and/or unemployment benefits as relevant. Training schemes should be targeted at young farmers and their spouses who are not working so that they {{have a better chance of}} offfarm employment, when relevant. Potentially viable and viable dairy farms should be assisted on a sliding scale depending on their quota size, as follows: Grant aid for upgrading milking facilities, grant aid for milking and milk cooling equipment, interest subsidies on interest payment on money borrowed for agricultural development, the smallest milk quota farms should be considered the priority for milk quota reallocation, <b>quota</b> <b>purchase</b> should be subsidised if possible, quota leasing should be subsidised for the smallest quota category (< 15, 000 gallons), installation Aid should be introduced for all viable and potentially viable dairy farms.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the first version}} of a long-term computable general equilibrium model for the Icelandic economy. The model development has been a joint project of the National Economic Institute of Iceland and the Research Department of Statistics Norway. The motivation behind the construction of the model was to enable analysis of the cost of alternative policies for reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases in accordance with the restrictions set forth in the Kyoto protocol. The modelling framework and initial model were provided by the Norwegians while some further development of various parts of the model and the data work were carried out by the Icelanders. The paper describes the main features of the model. It also contains a discussion of some simulation results. First, a baseline scenario is presented. Then the model is used to analyse the impact of different measures (CO 2 taxes, afforestation and land reclamation, CO 2 <b>quota</b> <b>purchases)</b> aimed at reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from the baseline scenario. The baseline scenario does not assume any increase in metal production from current levels. The analysis assumes land reclamation will be recognised as a CO 2 sink. However, it {{does not take into account}} the possible effect of Iceland’s proposal of largely exempting big projects in small economies that use renewable energy sources from the emission restrictions set forth in the Kyoto protocol.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{is to examine the}} impact of the Berlin {{agreement}} on EU agricultural policy reform at farm level and to estimate how farmers are likely to respond to new policy changes. Eight Representative farms in the cattle and dairy sectors are developed in order to analyse the different sectors of the farming community. Linear programming models are constructed to estimate how these farmers are likely to respond to the changing policy. Estimates of farm income are also produced. The impact of Agenda 2000 on these representative farms was analysed. The key findings showed that all farms will be subjected to a price-cost squeeze over the next ten years. By responding to policy changes farmers will be able to maintain farm net margins and in some cases increase them modestly. The key to success for dairy farmers is expansion of milk <b>quota.</b> <b>Purchasing</b> of currently leased quota and additional quota, where possible, allows larger dairy farms to maintain profits. However, smaller dairy farms, 20, 000 gallons of quota or less, are pushed and pulled out of farming. Rising production costs, static milk prices and unaffordable quota push them out, while attractive sale prices for quota and potentially high off farm incomes pull them out of dairy farming. In relation to cattle farming, results show that the key to success is the maximisation of direct payments. Small and part-time farms will find extensification schemes increasingly more profitable over the coming years. While larger farms can expand operations following the changes in premia limits set out in Agenda 2000. Off farm employment {{will continue to be a}} major issue for cattle farmers to consider.

40|$|Between 1978 and 1984, {{a massive}} shift from {{collective}} to household agricultural production {{took place in}} China. These incremental reforms, which Deng Xiaoping called "crossing the river while feeling the rocks," eventually gave 95 percent- 160 million rural Chinese families-the right to oversee household plots, leading to stunning gains in productivity. 1 Despite {{the success of the}} HRS, the enhancement of property rights is an ongoing reform process. Landholders depended on tenure agreements that could be changed at any time. Rural areas did not have the same right to profit from appreciating land values as urban landholders. As cities have expanded rapidly, municipalities have requisitioned rural land and issued it to new users at urban prices much higher than that paid to the rural villages. The policy debate about the appropriate pace for strengthening rural land use rights continues. This reform, the Household Responsibility System (HRS), provided strong incentives for farmers to increase labor and improve land, since they could profit from any marketable surplus they produced. Meanwhile, the state set <b>quotas</b> and <b>purchased</b> crops, providing reliable markets for increased production. It also strongly supported farmers by managing irrigation and the agricultural extension system. The state's earlier investments in rural nonfarm infrastructure paid off under the reforms, as workers released from agriculture by the more efficient use of labor found employment in local rural industries. In the years following the property reforms, {{the quality of life in}} rural China improved dramatically: per capita rural income more than doubled from 1978 to 1984. Having examined the substance, process, and effects of the reforms, this paper asks what lessons from the reforms are relevant for other developing countries.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{increasing}} evidence that individual health {{is at least}} partly determined by neighbourhood and regional factors. Mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood, and evidence from Germany is scant. This study explores whether regional as well as neighbourhood deprivation are associated with physical health {{and to what extent}} this association can be explained by specific neighbourhood exposures. Methods Using 2004 data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP) merged with regional and neighbourhood characteristics, we fitted multilevel linear regression models with subjective physical health, as measured by the SF- 12, as the dependent variable. The models include regional and neighbourhood proxies of deprivation (i. e. regional unemployment <b>quota,</b> average <b>purchasing</b> power of the street section) as well as specific neighbourhood exposures (i. e. perceived air pollution). Individual characteristics including socioeconomic status and health behaviour have been controlled for. Results This study finds a significant association between area deprivation and physical health which is independent of compositional factors and consistent across different spatial scales. Furthermore the association between neighbourhood deprivation and physical health can be partly explained by specific features of the neighbourhood environment. Among these perceived air pollution shows the strongest association with physical health (- 2. 4 points for very strong and - 1. 5 points for strong disturbance by air pollution, standard error (SE) = 0. 8 and 0. 4, respectively). Beta coefficients for perceived air pollution, perceived noise and the perceived distance to recreational resources do not diminish when including individual health behaviour in the models. Conclusions This study highlights the difference regional and in particular neighbourhood deprivation make to the physical health of individuals in Germany. The results support the argument that specific neighbourhood exposures serve as an intermediary step between deprivation and health. As people with a low socioeconomic status {{were more likely to be}} exposed to unfavourable neighbourhood characteristics these conditions plausibly contribute towards generating health inequalities. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} practical, market-based {{solution}} to the resource provisioning problem {{in a set of}} heterogeneous resource clusters. We focus on provisioning rather than immediate scheduling decisions to allow users to change long-term job specifications based on market feedback. Users enter bids to <b>purchase</b> <b>quotas,</b> or bundles of resources for long-term use. These requests are mapped into a simulated clock auction which determines uniform, fair resource prices that balance supply and demand. The reserve prices for resources sold by the operator in this auction are set based on current utilization, thus guiding the users as they set their bids towards under-utilized resources. By running these auctions at regular time intervals, prices fluctuate like those in a real-world economy and provide motivation for users to engineer systems that can best take advantage of available resources. These ideas were implemented in an experimental resource market at Google. Our preliminary results demonstrate an efficient transition of users from more congested resource pools to less congested resources. The disparate engineering costs for users to reconfigure their jobs to run on less expensive resource pools was evidenced by the large price premiums some users were willing to pay for more expensive resources. The final resource allocations illustrated how this framework can lead to significant, beneficial changes in user behavior, reducing the excessive shortages and surpluses of more traditional allocation methods.

40|$|Alaska fishing {{charter service}} owners are seeking an {{increased}} share of halibut fish resources {{be reserved for}} the recreational guided angler sector. An organization representing the owners who fish in the International Pacific Halibut Commission Regulatory Area 2 C (southeast Alaska) and Area 3 A (southcentral Alaska) titled the Catch Accountability through Compensated Halibut (CATCH) Project are designing a plan whereby quota shares owned by commercial fishing sector are <b>purchased</b> and the <b>quota</b> pounds they represent are annually deposited in a guided angler harvest common pool. If necessary to assist in augmenting available harvestable fish from stock abundance to attain the same management regulations for both guided and unguided anglers in both regulatory areas, then the inter-sector transfers through purchases would be used. While this could {{be perceived as a}} fishery resource allocation dispute, the organization is not attempting to influence management bodies in reallocating the resource based on optimizing social welfare and economic development values. Instead the organization is looking for mechanisms that would allow it to <b>purchase</b> <b>quota</b> shares using voluntary market approaches consistent with privatized user rights and privileges. The quota share inter-sector transfer procedures will necessarily be complex for several reasons. The amount to purchase needs to be estimated within the bounds of possible future resource abundances and what new effort might be attracted into the guided angler sector. Guided angler trip demand forecasts must be developed to account for less restrictive regulations, possibly higher angler costs, and other guided angler motivations for trip making such as nationwide general economic conditions. The possible cost increases are because one <b>quota</b> share <b>purchase</b> fund raising option is to use proceeds from imposing a guided angler fishing license endorsement fee. Diverting quota pounds from the seafood market for the quota share amounts to be purchased during years of lower exploitable stock abundance (range of 500 thousand to one million net weight pounds in Area 2 C) will not in itself appreciably influence harvest price. Another reason the plan is complex is that the existing program's quota share sales rules are highly regulated in order to satisfy an objective to retain the pre-privatized fishery structure. Quota share sales in recent years are very small and amounts needed for the inter-sector transfer would greatly exceed amounts annually coming to market. The inter-sector ask price would have to be high enough to incentivize new holders to the market. It is suggested that program rules on restraining certain transfers may need to be relaxed for sufficient purchases to occur. The acquisition is for an asset that is primarily needed by the guided angler sector during periods of relative low fish resource abundances. If stock recovery is sufficient, then the asset could be leased or even divested back to the commercial fishing sector. A report was developed by economists to assist in the CATCH Project design. The report explains there will be significant challenges in conducting purchases for the benefit of a heterogeneous set of fishing charter service firms. There will be plan design problems associated with determining own industry needs; estimating angler response to fees and the changed quality of the angling experience; and, assessing commercial fishing industry quota share supply functions. There is probably sufficient flexibility for federal authorization of such a program, although establishing one is without precedent. The approval of a design is neither imminent nor assured given the required state legislative and administrative processes, the many federal and international treaty implementing unknowns, judicial review avenues, etc. However, the innovative process is deserving of consideration due to higher marginal economic benefits to local communities and the nation from reserving additional recreationally harvested fish, and concerns for a viable charter industry from customer demand response for the unequal fishery access...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{focus on}} {{motivation}} factors for market oriented value adding (MOVA) in {{the fishing industry}} of the limited fish resources. Analytical the paper interpreter the market orientation concept into the Structure- Conduct-Performance model from industrial economics. It shows that most established fisheries management systems as Olympic style, licenses and transferable quotas and licenses systems reduce the motivation for market oriented value adding and by this waste resource rent. An improved management model is introduced which {{make it possible to}} motivate marketorientation and cost-efficiency together with sustainability and fair social allocation. This model combines Seasonal Quota Auction (SQA) and administrative allocation (AA) through licenses and community or fisher group quota. In contrast to a pure ITQ model, this model offer a solution to motivate fishers to: (i) Increase resource rent without privatizing the fish resources on few private hands (ii) Ease seasonal <b>quotas</b> instead of <b>purchasing</b> permanent <b>quotas</b> as in ITQ. (iii) Improve rent generating from the most market oriented and efficient fishers by leasing quotas on credit. The auction mechanism makes it possible to collect the resource rent for use through fisher’s co-operatives or regions, ITQ owners, government or redistributed as bonus to all fishers.

The AMC was {{a government agency}} whose objective was to influence the supply and price of crops. It purchased grain from peasant associations at fixed prices. The AMC set <b>quotas</b> of grain <b>purchases</b> to be delivered by peasant associations and cooperatives and also bought from private wholesalers, who were required to sell half of their purchases at predetermined prices. State farms sold their output to the AMC. Although the AMC had agents in all regions, it was particularly active in the major cereal producing regions, namely, Gojjam, Shewa, Arsi, and Gondar. In 1981/82, out of the AMC's purchases of 257,000 tons of grain, Gojjam accounted for 32 percent of the purchases, and Arsi, Shewa, and Gonder accounted for 23%, 22%, and 10%, respectively.

For instance, the 1984/85 official procurement price for 100 kilograms of teff was 42 birr at the farm level and 60 birr when the AMC purchased it from wholesalers. But the same quantity of teff retailed at 81 birr at food stores belonging to the urban dwellers' associations (kebeles) in Addis Ababa and sold for as much as 181 birr in the open market. Such wide price variations created food shortages because farmers as well as private merchants withheld crops to sell on the black market at higher prices.|$|R

The most established and largest scheme operates in the Shetland Isles, where there was concern quota holdings could be traded out-with the community. This study originated from a Scottish Executive research programme tasked with analysing the effectiveness of community quota schemes in the UK. This paper outlines the current approach to quota management in the UK and examines the compatibility of community quota schemes with the current Fixed Quota Allocation approach using Shetland as a case study. Research methods involved desk-based background research and face-to-face interviews with industry stakeholders in Shetland. Shetland CQS set out to preserve and improve fishing opportunities for the island community and allow young fishermen to affordably gain access to the local industry. Significant <b>quota</b> holdings were <b>purchased</b> by Shetland Islands council from other UK areas and Shetland fishermen were given preferential access to this quota. After an investigation by the EC, the Shetland CQS was found to contravene EU State Aid law. Enforced changes to the scheme ensured the competitive advantage of Shetlands catching sector was removed. However, {{both before and after the}} EU ruling the scheme failed to encourage new vessel builds or increase employment. In addition, fishermen disliked the lack of transparency and financial costs attached to FQA method of allocation.

30|$|A {{number of}} various {{approaches}} are presented for supplier selection. For example, Weber et al. (1998) defined three methods for selecting and negotiating with sellers not yet selected. Additionally, they clarified how two multi-criteria analysis tools, MOP, {{as well as}} DEA can be used simultaneously for this process of selection and negotiation under some circumstances. Karpak et al. (2001) introduced one of the decision support systems which were ‘‘user friendly’’ with multiple criteria known as visual interactive goal programming (VIG). VIG makes the presentation of a decision support system for improvements in the decisions of supplier selection. Talluri and Narasimhan (2003) proposed a max–min productivity based method deriving variability measures of vendor performance, which are then used in a nonparametric statistical manner for the identification of groups of vendors to have an effective selection. Kumar et al. (2004) used fuzzy GP method. They formulated a vendor selection problem as a fuzzy mixed integer GP to include the imprecise aspiration levels of the objectives. This consists of three main goals: minimizing the net cost, reducing the net rejections, and minimizing the net late deliveries depending on realistic restrictions over customer’s demand, vendor’s capacity as well as <b>quota</b> flexibility, <b>purchasing</b> value of items, allocating the budget to the individual seller, etc. After specifying the weights of a selected rank, Liu and Hai (2005) made {{a comparison of the}} weighted sum of the selection number of rank vote. They proposed a fresh weighting technique instead of pairwise comparison of AHP for supplier selection. They introduced a simpler technique than AHP known as voting analytic hierarchy process. However, it does not miss the organized method of deriving the weights which are adopted and scored the suppliers’ performance. Saen (2007) suggested an original method for supplier selection when there are both ordinal and cardinal data. His method identified best suppliers whose efficiency score is equal to one and is not able to find most efficient supplier. Indeed, using his method, decision maker cannot decide which supplier is the best among other units. Ting and Cho (2008) offered a combined method using LP that blends AHP and LP. The procedure takes both tangible and intangible factors into account in the selection of the best suppliers and in giving them ideal order quantities. The aim is to maximize total purchasing value. Kokangul and Susuz (2009) proposed an integrated AHP with nonlinear integer and MOP. The approach is used under certain limitations including quantity discounts, capacity, and budget to specify the best suppliers and put the optimum order quantities among them. Toloo and Nalchigar (2011) propose an innovative integrated DEA model that can detect the most efficient supplier when there exist both cardinal and ordinal data.|$|R
30|$|In this strict {{management}} by objectives, L County’s original plan of “reasonably and lawfully” shutting down coal mines to smoothly reconcile conflicts and industrial restructuring became unrealistic. The new objectives demanded speedy measures to forcibly fulfill {{the task of}} shutting down 16 coal mines. Of the 53 coal mines in L County {{at the end of}} 2012, 16 had to be shut down in 2013, accounting for 30  %. L County took three steps to fulfill this task. The first step was regional coordination of quotas. In its analysis, the L County government found that the mining conditions and technology in L County were fairly good and forcibly shutting the mines down was economically unwise. L County thus decided to <b>purchase</b> <b>quotas</b> of rectification from other counties and supplement them with its own mines. Through information collection and coordination, the L County government purchased five coal mines in other counties in Y Municipality, spending 10 million yuan on average for each coal mine. The five mines had limited production output and {{were on the verge of}} shutdown and were thus willing to be sold to L County to meet its shutdown quota. 18 The second step was to shut down four problematic coal mines, among which one had an industrial accident, one underwent an initial shutdown, and the other two were technically difficult to upgrade. 19 There were only seven shutdown quotas remaining after the first and second steps. Since there was no widely acceptable criterion for selection, the coal mines were ranked in terms of the quantity of coal resources, and the mines ranked the lowest were forced to shut down. This practice was illegal, but given the mandates from the S Provincial Government, L County had to take extraordinary measures. According to the directive from the S Provincial Government in March 2013, these types of mines should not be shut down.|$|R
40|$|This study {{resulted}} in construction an econometric {{model for the}} Chinese agriculture. The model reflects the current Chinese mixed planning and market system. Related policy variables are directly included in objective function for the representative producer. In the mixed system, marginal decisions of producers are affected by state prices only if market price is uncertain. If market price is known, marginal decision rules much like those in market economies are directly applicable;Output supply and input demand equations for risk averse producers were derived from a specific utility function and a normalized quadratic profit function. The complete model includes seven outputs (grain, protein feed, other food from crop, nonfood agricultural products, bovine meat, dairy products, and other meat), two variable inputs (fertilizer and feed), two fixed inputs (land and livestock inventory), two policy variables (state grain price and state grain quota), and one time variable to reflect technical change;The two submodels for the dual system, crops and livestock, were separately estimated using annual data, 1978 to 1985. Full information maximum likelihood methods were used to estimate the system while maintaining the theoretical restrictions following from the optimal process behavior. The elasticity estimates were plausible. Model validation statistics implies satisfactory performance in the sample period for all endogenous variables;The model was used to analyze policy scenarios for the state purchase price and the state <b>purchase</b> <b>quota</b> of grain for years from 1978 to 1988. Two policy conclusions were suggested by the empirical results. First, the government should increase the state price of grain and decrease the state quota of grain if grain production is {{a high priority for}} the Chinese agricultural development. Alternatively, if the government wishes to stimulate production of other food and nonfood agricultural products, then a decrease in the state price and an increase in the state quota of grain should be adopted. Second, if the free market is treated as a residual in the state planning process, unintended price variations may have significant impacts on producer resource allocation decisions and incomes. Therefore, {{it is important not to}} ignore the free market in mixed systems, as perhaps has been the case for central planners in China...|$|R
40|$|Management of {{straddling}} {{fish stocks}} has been noted for its political complexity. Negotiations frequently falter as each party seeks to focus upon their own individual and shorter-term goals than the collective interest of the sector. Entrenched positions are often only deepened as new entrants participate to establish their own claims to any emergent share of resource. Unsurprisingly, deadlocks are common and typically compromises are reached only after the real period of biological then economic crisis has passed. Examples to illustrate this tendency {{can be found in}} most of the world's oceans and is writ large within the current impasse over blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) in the North Atlantic. The development of this fishery is discussed and it is shown that despite the scope to add value to the resource base through a pattern of exploitation focussed more upon human consumption than fish meal and oil, there seems little incentive to extricate participants from the cycle of demise that has engulfed negotiations so far. In an attempt to consider how such seemingly intractable problems might be resolved, attention is next turned to {{the construction of a new}} model for resource management specifically intended to contend with the problems thrown up by straddling stocks. Central to this is the need to ensure motivation and incentivisation of value chain members in both national economic zones and international waters. It is proposed that a Multinational Resource Cooperative (MRC) is established and would be the key element in the management model. The MRC, on behalf of the national stakeholders, would auction quota so that fish enterprises can <b>purchase</b> <b>quota</b> units defined in terms of species, quantity, catch area and the time of catch. The MRC would also be financed through a quota auction fee as explained below and arrange its own quota control and enforcement services. By auctioning rights to stakeholders the MRC will enable control and enforcement of the TAC; allocations of fair national shares of resource and critically, motivate fish enterprises to devise and implement market-oriented value adding strategies. Adoption of such a scheme should result in a more efficient use of the remaining straddling stocks whilst there is still time to do so. Importantly, the proposed rent distribution mechanism would also shift the focus of negotiations from being dominated by quotas and access rights to more evident pecuniary metrics.

40|$|Abstract only. ITQ {{introduction}} has {{had several}} effects on fisheries in terms of, for example, {{changes in the}} composition of the fishing fleet and fishing efficiency gains. After ITQ introduction in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry in 1998, an increasing number of fishers have become dependent on quota leasing to catch fish (Putten van and Gardner Accepted). At the same time quota owners who lease out their entire quota, increasingly characterises the fishery. The economic, social and cultural implications of structural changes observed in ITQ fisheries around the world (Eythórsson 2000) also apply in Tasmania, although the particulars of these developments vary. Changes in the Tasmanian industry are also observed in terms of the characteristics of the lease quota market and market participants. Brokers have an increasingly important role in trading lease quota thereby reducing the number of personal interactions. The role of processors in the lease quota market is also pertinent {{not only in terms of}} price developments but also in market interactions and dependencies. The change in market relationships and connections, in parallel with increasing dependence on lease quota by a large component of the industry, may be particularly relevant as strong social connections characterise this fishery. In this research, social networks in the quota lease market of the ITQ managed Tasmanian rock lobster fisheries are analysed. Changes in lease quota trade networks and network characteristics proceeding quota introduction in 1998 are analysed. The economic characteristics of different lease quota fisher types are also considered in this context. Network parameters indicate that the lease quota market can be represented by a scale-free network. Over time the market has become more strongly dependent on internal networks, in particular processors who take on the roles of pseudo brokers to ensure fisher loyalty. The change in network structure of the lease quota market indicates that a small number of quota owner investors and processor quota redistributors appear to be in an increasingly powerful position in this market. This development is surprising because disproportionate quota ownership by processor, as observed in many other ITQ managed fisheries, has been averted in Tasmania. Processor control in the lease market cannot be gained by <b>purchasing</b> <b>quota</b> due to a successful input control where quota ownership by one legal entity was capped. Because market control cannot be gained through investment in quota, it has been gained by virtue of redistributing lease quota...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is aimed}} at the income and expense amendment at a contributory organization in Hradec Králové region. In the theoretical part there are basic facts about contributory organizations, the founder, the foundation document, the dividing into main and by work or their budget. Following by the characterization of the incomes and selected expenses which can be often found in a contributory organization accountancy. The last part brings a closer view of conducting of accountancy in the selected accounting units including accounting documentary evidence and financial analysis. The last chapter shows theoretical possibilities of income and expense amendment at a contributory organization. At {{the beginning of the}} working part there is shown the certain contributory organization Gymnázium Broumov (grammar school Broumov) following by the detailed analysis of its profits and selected costs. This part also describes the economization of the school individual funds and then the way of conducting of accountancy in this contributory organization. Other chapters of this dissertation pay attention to the financial analysis of economization and factual project of income and expense amendment at the grammar school. In the chapter 4. 7 you can find the possibilities of the incomes increase. It is conected with the taking advantage of appropriation projects given by the organizer, the Ministry of Education or the EU, the closure of new agreements for lease of school not flat space or establishing of complementary educational activities. The expenses can be amended by lowering the power consumption thanks to the project EPC or using central purchase of power and some services {{within the framework of the}} HK region. The saving can be reached by correct utilization of substitute <b>quota</b> with the <b>purchase</b> of products and services or by optimum drawing of wage means. The conclusion contains the evaluation of the amendment results. Thanks to the amendment the incomes are risen up to 750, 000 Czech crowns more than 80 % of it are the incomes from appropriation projects. It brings to school better study conditions for students, possibilities of further education for teachers or getting new teaching aids. The incomes from the lease of school not flat space have to be, according to the foundation document, used for repairs and maintenance of the school building at the same calendar year. The establishing of complementary educational activities is more both administratively and organizationaly demanding than possibilities of income amendment so it might be set up in Sept. 2017. The Grammar School Broumov can get up to 300, 000 Czech crowns a year thanks to the expense amendment. The saving made by lowering total power, service and material expenses can be used without any restrictions for example for purchase of new modern technology, interactive boards or for school environment innovation. The grammar school management can use the saving made by optimum drawing of wage means as a motivation for the teachers via bonuses or personal extra pays...|$|R
