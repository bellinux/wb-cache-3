25|$|The name item {{response}} {{theory is}} due to the focus of the theory on the item, as opposed to the test-level focus of classical test theory. Thus IRT models the response of each examinee of a given ability to each item in the test. The term item is generic: covering all kinds of informative item. They might be multiple choice <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> incorrect and correct responses, but are also commonly statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (a rating or Likert scale), or patient symptoms scored as present/absent, or diagnostic information in complex systems.|$|E

25|$|Other <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been {{considered}} {{in the study of}} primate aggression, including in humans, is how aggression affects the organization of a group, what costs are incurred by aggression, and why some primates avoid aggressive behavior. For example, bonobo chimpanzee groups are known for low levels of aggression within a partially matriarchal society. Captive animals including primates may show abnormal levels of social aggression and self-harm that are related to aspects of the physical or social environment; this depends on the species and individual factors such as gender, age and background (e.g. raised wild or captive).|$|E
25|$|The era {{since the}} 1980s flourished, in large part, because of {{contributions}} {{made in the}} 1970s, a decade during which child psychiatry witnessed a major evolution {{as a result of}} the work carried out by Michael Rutter. The first comprehensive population survey of 9- to 11-year-olds, carried out in London and the Isle of Wight, which appeared in 1970, addressed <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> continued to be of importance for child psychiatry; for example, rates of psychiatric disorders, the role of intellectual development and physical impairment, and specific concern for potential social influences on children's adjustment. This work was influential, especially since the investigators demonstrated specific continuities of psychopathology over time, and the influence of social and contextual factors in children's mental health, in their subsequent re-evaluation of the original cohort of children. These studies described the prevalence of ADHD (relatively low as compared to the US), identified the onset and prevalence of depression in mid-adolescence and the frequent co-morbidity with conduct disorder, and explored the relationship between various mental disorders and scholastic achievemment.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Tom Kessenich, {{in his book}} Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying it [...] "wonderfully" [...] developed the show's characters as [...] "it unveiled many of {{the answers to the}} <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been dangling about for some time with out using Mulder or Scully as conduits for many of these answers." [...] The main reason behind creating a resolution to the Syndicate arc was that Chris Carter thought the series was going to be cancelled by early 2000. While promoting the episode, Carter said it would give many long-waited answers {{but at the same time}} create new ones. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk named [...] "Two Fathers," [...] along with its follow-up [...] "One Son," [...] as one of the [...] "highlights of season six." [...] Joyce Millman from Salon magazine said the episode (along with [...] "One Son") was one [...] "of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run". The Michigan Daily reviewer Melissa Runstrom said [...] "Two Fathers" [...] along with [...] "One Son" [...] and season finale [...] "Biogenesis" [...] were the highlights of the sixth season.|$|E

Club, {{columnist}} Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with an A-, and praised September's stumbling {{entrance into the}} lab as [...] "yet another rich and remarkable scene". Entertainment Weekly writer Jeff Jensen had a more negative opinion, and commented that the episode [...] "failed to make my dinger hum," [...] which he attributed to high expectations set by fellow staff writer and former Fringe reviewer Ken Tucker. Jensen continued, [...] "It was, to my eyes, 'just okay.' Certainly not the equal {{of the past two}} episodes. And not the strongest possible kicker to a strong second act for Fringes fourth season, which now takes a four-week snooze before rising anew on March 23 for the first of eight consecutive episodes– a sweep of story that might represent the very end of all things Fringe. Damn, I’m such a downer this week, aren’t I? Ah, but so was this episode." [...] In January 2013, IGN ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the series, explaining that [...] "when Season 4 needed a boost of excitement, this episode delivered it in a timely fashion. It had a thrilling pace and offered answers to some <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> lingering since the series began." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recently {{there have}} been two city <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> gone to the ballot for city {{residents}} to vote for. In 2008, the citizens voted 53% to 47% to allow for private development of a defunct golf course instead of having the City purchase the land for future public development or open space. [...] In 2004 and in 2007, voters were presented with plans drafted by an established Charter Commission calling for the city to scrap its current governing structure as a statutory city and adopt a new home-rule city charter. The measure failed 80% to 20% in 2004 and 91% to 9% in 2007. The Charter Commission was dissolved on June 18, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|This {{case has}} {{prompted}} some commentators {{to discuss the}} futility of life support in such cases and even {{refer to it as}} [...] "death support".

McMath's attorney, Christopher Dolan said, [...] "There would have been no legal battle if Jahi had had her tonsils out in New Jersey”, referring to a New Jersey state law allowing religious objection to a declaration of death on the basis of neurological criteria. Public confusion surrounding differences between brain death and cardiac death raised by this case led some doctors to voice concern about how the case could affect live organ recovery from brain dead patients. The impact of this case on medical negligence awards in California has also been discussed, as there is no compensation limit if the patient is alive, while compensation is capped at $250,000 if the patient has died.|$|E
