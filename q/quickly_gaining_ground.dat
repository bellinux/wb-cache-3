Our proposed scheme overcomes the numerous coding dependencies, and minimizes the changes to the original compressed videos. Experimental results show that our proposed transcoding scheme achieves extraordinary video quality and significantly reduces the bit rate and computational cost. Compared with the cascaded transcoding scheme, our proposed logo-insertion method achieves an average of 1. 16 dB PSNR increase, or a 68. 6 % bit-rate reduction.

Remarkably, our simple modeling is able to account quantitatively for the observed experimental features, with a surprisingly high accuracy.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{discrete}} electromagnetism (DEM) is <b>quickly</b> <b>gaining</b> <b>ground</b> in the computational electromagnetism community. It reﬂects {{in an unprecedented}} clarity the topological and geometrical properties of the phenomena of electromagnetism. The structural analogies of the Finite Element Method (FEM) and DEM formulations has attracted many researchers’ attention over the past years.

To this end we introduce a boundary term and transfer matrices in DEM, both of which ﬁnd their analogue in a FEM equation system. As {{an alternative to the}} Galerkin-Hodge operator used in FEM we propose a geometrically deﬁned Hodge operator on simplicial cells, thus presenting a solely geometrically and topologically deﬁned variant of DEM formulations. The coupling of DEM with a Boundary Element Method (BEM) has proven to combine the advantages of both methods. The resulting DEM-BEM algorithm is found to be suited for the simulation of accelerator magnets: non-linear and conductive material is discretized for a DEM formulation whereas the superconductive coils are considered at the highest accuracy in a BEM formulation. The goal of this thesis is the implementation of a DEM-BEM coupling with the Whitney-form based Galerkin-Hodge operator being used in the DEM formulation...|$|E

Communities of web users categorize resources by associating metadata with them, {{in the form of}} freely chosen text labels, or tags.

We collect data from a popular system, focusing on tagging data associated with a given resource, and report our experimental findings. Remarkably, we observe a universal power-law behavior for the dynamics of tag accumulation. On studying the frequency distribution of tags, we find a generalized Zipf’s behavior and quantitatively describe the observed distributions in terms of a previously introduced Yule-Simon process with heavy-tailed memory. 1 Collaborative Tagging A new paradigm has been <b>quickly</b> <b>gaining</b> <b>ground</b> in online information systems: Collaborative Tagging [1, 2].

Neurophysiological tools, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) have been used in the past for affective state characterization with varying degrees of success [17 – 20], as well as for QoE assessment [21 – 23]. While EEG relies on measuring the electrical activity in the brain with high temporal precision (order of milliseconds), it suffers from limited spatial resolution.

40|$|A {{new concept}} <b>quickly</b> <b>gaining</b> <b>ground</b> {{in the field}} of cancer {{research}} is that the inflammatory process {{plays a key role in}} cancer development and metastasis; however, the molecular mechanisms of such an involvement in cancer progression remain largely unspecified. YKL- 40, also known as human cartilage glycoprotein 39, is a secreted heparin-binding protein with ties to both cancers and inflammatory disease. In these diseases, YKL- 40 has been suggested to play a role in regulating tissue and extracellular matrix remodeling. It has been found that in certain cancers, including breast, colorectal and brain, that high YKL- 40 serum levels correlate with poor outcome, and consequently it may serve as a biomarker. Our recent study has shown that tumor-derived YKL- 40 acts as an angiogenic factor due to its ability to up-regulate vessel formation and metastasis during tumor development. However, blockade of the function of YKL- 40, which implicates therapeutic value, has not been explored yet. The goal of this project was to better understand the importance of tumor-derived YKL- 40 in angiogenesis through both functional and structural studies. By establishing a monoclonal YKL- 40 antibody for blocking YKL- 40, the function of tumor-derived YKL- 40 in inducing endothelial cell angiogenesis and tumor cell survival was uncovered, confirming YKL- 402 ̆ 7 s importance in tumor signaling as well as offering evidence in the benefit of its neutralization.

While the good performance of CNNs for image classification are unambiguously recognised, {{which of the two}} has the upper hand in the image retrieval context is not entirely clear yet. In this work, we propose a comprehensive study that systematically evaluates FVs and CNNs for image retrieval. The first part compares the performances of FVs and CNNs on multiple publicly available data sets. We investigate a number of details specific to each method. For FVs, we compare sparse descriptors based on interest point detectors with dense single-scale and multi-scale variants. For CNNs, we focus on understanding the impact of depth, architecture and training data on retrieval results. Our study shows that no descriptor is systematically better than the other and that performance gains can usually be obtained by using both types together. The second part of the study focuses on the impact of geometrical transformations such as rotations and scale changes. FVs based on interest point detectors are intrinsically resilient to such transformations while CNNs do not have a built-in mechanism to ensure such invariance. We show that performance of CNNs can quickly degrade in presence of rotations while they are far less affected by changes in scale. We then propose a number of ways to incorporate the required invariances in the CNN pipeline. Overall, our work is intended as a reference guide offering practically useful and simply implementable guidelines to anyone looking for state-of-the-art global descriptors best suited to their specific image instance retrieval problem.

40|$|Most image {{instance}} retrieval pipelines {{are based}} on comparison of vectors known as global image descriptors between a query image and the database images. Due to their success in large scale image classification, representations extracted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are <b>quickly</b> <b>gaining</b> <b>ground</b> on Fisher Vectors (FVs) as state-of-the-art global descriptors for image instance retrieval. While CNN-based descriptors are generally remarked for good retrieval performance at lower bitrates, they nevertheless present a number of drawbacks including the lack of robustness to common object transformations such as rotations compared with their interest point based FV counterparts. In this paper, we propose a method for computing invariant global descriptors from CNNs. Our method implements a recently proposed mathematical theory for invariance in a sensory cortex modeled as a feedforward neural network. The resulting global descriptors can be made invariant to multiple arbitrary transformation groups while retaining good discriminativeness. Based on a thorough empirical evaluation using several publicly available datasets, we show that our method is able to significantly and consistently improve retrieval results every time {{a new type of}} invariance is incorporated. We also show that our method which has few parameters is not prone to over fitting: improvements generalize well across datasets with different properties with regard to invariances. Finally, we show that our descriptors are able to compare favourably to other state-of-theart compact descriptors in similar bitranges, exceeding the highest retrieval results reported in the literature on some datasets. A dedicated dimensionality reduction step –quantization or hashing– may be able to further improve the competitiveness of the descriptors.
