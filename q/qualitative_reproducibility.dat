40|$|The {{toluidine}} red unheated serum test (TRUST) antigen, a macroscopic flocculation test antigen developed by Pettit et al. (J. Clin. Microbiol. 18 : 1141 - 1145, 1983) by modifying the color-coded antigen of Kasatiya and Lambert (Appl. Microbiol. 28 : 317 - 318, 1974), was {{compared with the}} Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) 18 -mm circle card tests for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility. Two lots of TRUST antigen were prepared by two laboratories in the Centers for Disease Control. Both laboratories performed the TRUST and VDRL slide test on serum samples from 1, 102 patients attending the DeKalb County, Georgia, Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic. In addition, one laboratory performed the RPR card test. Reactive sera were quantitated in the three nontreponemal tests and confirmed with the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test. The sensitivity in untreated syphilis for all nontreponemal tests involved was 98. 4 %. The specificity for these tests was 98. 6 %. The <b>qualitative</b> <b>reproducibility</b> among the four lots of TRUST antigen, VDRL slide, and RPR card tests was 98. 2 %. Only 20 sera showed discrepant results. Intralaboratory reproducibility of the two TRUST antigens was 100 % for one laboratory and 99. 6 % for the other. Interlaboratory reproducibility for the four lots of TRUST and the VDRL slide test was 99 %. Quantitative agreement +/- 1 dilution between the TRUST and RPR card test was 92. 3 %, and quantitative agreement +/- 1 dilution for the TRUST and RPR card test versus the VDRL slide test averaged 50 %. The TRUST appeared to be comparable to the RPR card test in all parameters compared...|$|E
40|$|From November 5 th, 2001 to March 15 th, 2004, 495 {{patients}} (164 with arrhythmias, 64 with WPW syndrome, 58 with Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), 110 {{with different}} kinds of cardiomyopathy, 95 normals, 4 FMCG) have been consecutively investigated at the Catholic University of Rome, with unshielded Magnetocardiographic Mapping (MCG) : 20 with the 9 -channel system only and 475 with the 36 -channel system (184 of them with both systems). 86 patients were investigated also after physical stress, carried out with a standard bicycle ergometer. In all patients MCG was recorded at least three times, to check for reproducibility and/o for clinical follow-up, {{for a total of}} more than 1600 MCG recordings. Method: MCG was performed in the supine position with a 36 -channel system (CardioMag Imaging, CMI, Schenectady, NY), at a sampling rate of 1 KHz in the bandwidth DC- 100 Hz, with at least one simultaneous ECG lead. In the last 200 pts, 12 -lead ECG was simultaneously recorded with amagnetic electrodes. On each patient file, post-processing and signal analysis for the quantitative assessment of ventricular repolarization and for 3 D localization and electroanatomical imaging of cardiac arrhythmias, were carried out independently with two different approaches and software programs developed by CMI and at the by Neuromag (Finland). The results with the two methods have been compared. For 3 D electroanatomical integration of MCG localization results, 3 D cardiac models have been used, constructed from patient MRI, and/or from orthogonal fluoroscopic images taken at the moment of MCG recording (see Veisterä, this conference). Conclusions: <b>qualitative</b> <b>reproducibility</b> of MCG was satisfactory. However the estimate of quantitative parameters has shown a certain degree of variability, which deserves further evaluatio...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This study {{aimed to}} compare the <b>qualitative</b> and {{quantitative}} <b>reproducibility</b> of quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Ureaplasma species (Ureaplasma spp.) throughout pregnancy {{and according to the}} genital sampling site. Study Design. Between 5 and 14 weeks of gestation (T 1), vaginal, fornix, and two cervical samples were taken. Sampling was repeated during the 2 nd (T 2) and 3 rd (T 3) trimester in randomly selected T 1 positive and negative women. <b>Qualitative</b> and quantitative <b>reproducibility</b> were evaluated using, respectively, Cohen’s kappa (κ) and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and repeated measures ANOVA on the log-transformed mean number of DNA copies for each sampling site. Results. During T 1, 51 / 127 women were positive for U. parvum and 8 for U. urealyticum (4 patients for both). Sampling was repeated for 44 / 55 women at T 2 and/or T 3; 43 (97. 7 %) remained positive at the three timepoints. κ ranged between 0. 83 and 0. 95 and the ICC for cervical samples was 0. 86. Conclusions. Colonization by Ureaplasma spp. seems to be very constant during pregnancy and vaginal samples have the highest detection rate...|$|R

40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the accuracy of two semi-quantitative scoring systems to assess response to 131 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) therapy in recurrent neuroblastoma. Procedures Diagnostic mIBG scan pairs (n[*]=[*] 57) were collected for patients who underwent 131 I-mIBG therapy for relapsed neuroblastoma. Two scoring systems were designated: Method 1, which divided the body into nine segments to view osteomedullary lesions with an additional tenth segment to assess soft tissue involvement; and Method 2, which divided the body into seven segments without a corresponding compartment for soft tissue involvement. Four nuclear medicine physicians independently assigned extension and intensity scores utilizing both methods, and separately recorded their impression of whether the post-therapy scan had improved, not changed, or worsened. Inter- and intra-observer concordance and correlation with overall response and progression-free survival (PFS) were performed. Results Method 1 produced the highest inter-observer concordance and was used to calculate the relative extension scores (post-therapy score divided by pre-therapy score), which correlated significantly with overall response. Patients who achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (n[*]=[*] 21) had lower relative extension scores, compared to those without response (P [*] 5. Relative extension score did not predict PFS. Conclusion Semi-quantitative scoring of mIBG scans provides a more reliable method of assessing response in patients with relapsed neuroblastoma than <b>qualitative</b> impression. The <b>reproducibility</b> and high inter-observer concordance makes mIBG score an important component of overall response criteria in patients with recurrent neuroblastoma.
