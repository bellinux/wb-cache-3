Our {{investigation of the}} explanatory reasoning processes is organized around the central theme of <b>question</b> <b>asking.</b> PREG, a model of human <b>question</b> <b>asking,</b> predicts when and what types of <b>questions</b> are <b>asked</b> by humans while comprehending expository texts. PREG has two salient predictions. First, deep comprehenders should <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> that converge on plausible faults. Second, eye movements should converge on those likely faults. An eye tracking study supported these predictions. The present research supports the claim that <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and eye tracking are two excellent indicators of device comprehension {{in the context of}} breakdown scenarios...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of videotaped exemplars taken from a regular education mathematics class to teach generalization of <b>question</b> <b>asking.</b> Three mildly handicapped fourth-grade students who <b>asked</b> few <b>questions</b> in the regular education class served as subjects. Measures of the frequency of <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and percentage of accuracy on assignments were obtained in the regular class. Treatment included showing the videotapes to the subjects, structuring opportunities for rehearsing <b>question</b> <b>asking,</b> and providing feedback.

40|$|We {{supplement}} broad {{definitions of}} leadership behaviour {{with the concept}} of micro-level leadership behaviour, leaders’ verbal and non-verbal visible conduct and interaction. For the context of team decision-making, we identify two potentially beneficial micro-level leadership behaviours, <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and behavioural mimicry. Specifically, we propose that under conditions of informational complexity and unshared information, participative leadership is most appropriate for team decision-making, that its effects are mediated by inquiring and empathy, and that <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and mimicry are the behavioural micro-level manifestations of inquiring and empathy. We thus hypothesize that the effect of participative leadership on team decision quality and leader evaluation is mediated by <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> and mimicry. We conduct a laboratory experiment with student teams working on a hidden profile decision-making task and measure <b>question</b> <b>asking</b> through behavioural coding and mimicry with motion sensors. Results show that the effect of participative leadership on decision quality is mediated by <b>question</b> <b>asking,</b> and that the effect of participative leadership on leader evaluation as transformational is mediated by leaders’ behavioural mimicry and <b>question</b> <b>asking.</b> Under control of these micro-level behaviours, team decision quality and leader evaluations were unrelated...|$|R

40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the questioning patterns of teachers in science classes. The design employed for the study was a case study. To guide this study, five research <b>questions</b> were <b>asked</b> and answered. The samples of the study consisted of 20 senior secondary schools and 60 science teachers. The instruments used for data collection were Science Class Questioning Categories. The major findings of the study included: 21. 4 % of science instructional time was spent on questioning; most of the <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> in science classes were on knowledge; there were significant differences between male and female teachers on <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> on knowledge and analysis; the bulk of <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> in science classes were directed at the male and high ability students; and most of the <b>questions</b> <b>asked</b> in science classes received an average wait-time of 3 seconds.

However, respondents only favoured capital punishment for adult murder, the polling <b>question</b> <b>asked</b> by other organisations such as Gallup, by small majorities or pluralities: overall, 51% favoured the death penalty for adult murder, while 56% in Wales did, 55% in Scotland, and only 49% in England.|$|E
25|$|When the {{campaign}} began, Lenihan {{was seen as}} a near certainty to win the presidency. The only <b>question</b> <b>asked</b> was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as {{the campaign}} proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey and the rising popularity of the Labour Party leader Dick Spring. Notwithstanding, Fianna Fáil knew they could count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.|$|E
25|$|Murphy briefly {{suspended}} the tour on 28 August 2014, after an egg was thrown at {{him by a}} member of the public in Kirkcaldy. Video evidence showed other members of the public wearing 'Yes' campaign insignias and berating Murphy as he spoke. Murphy claimed that this was the result of an orchestrated attack by mobs of protesters organised by the Yes Scotland campaign in a deliberate attempt to intimidate him. The man responsible was a local resident who was a supporter of Scottish independence, who alleged that Jim Murphy had not answered a <b>question</b> <b>asked</b> of him. Pleading guilty to assault, he apologised for 'bringing the Yes campaign into disrepute unintentionally'.|$|E

There, George is busy dealing with possible investment clients: firstly, an ambitious man named Herr Von Hussler with an elaborate money-making scheme, and then a middle-class man named John Northbrook with a simple factory project. George is furious when Mary turns up with the children, but an innocent <b>question</b> <b>asked</b> by Jane (What's more important, a good man or a good idea?) makes him realise how much his values have changed ("A Man Has Dreams") since he was an idealistic young man. He then decides to accept Northbrook's project and rejects Von Hussler's, but unfortunately things take {{a turn for the}} worse afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The ballot {{consisted}} of two questions; voters could vote on one or the other, or on both. The first <b>question</b> <b>asked</b> whether Gray Davis should be recalled. It was a simple yes/no question, and if a majority voted no, then the second question would become irrelevant and Gray Davis would remain California governor. If a majority voted yes, then Davis would {{be removed from office}} once the vote was certified, and the second question would determine his successor. Voters had to choose one candidate from a long list of 135 candidates. Voters who voted against recalling Gray Davis could still vote for a candidate to replace him in case the recall vote succeeded. The candidate receiving the most votes (a plurality) would then become the next governor of California. Certification by the Secretary of State of California would require completion within 39 days of the election, and history indicated that it could require that entire time frame to certify the statewide election results. Once the results were certified, a newly elected governor would have to be sworn into office within 10 days.|$|E
25|$|The {{decline in}} {{religious}} affiliation {{continued in the}} early twenty-first century. In the 2001 census, 27.5 per cent who stated {{that they had no}} religion (which compares with 15.5 per cent in the UK overall) and 5.5 per cent did not state a religion. In the 2011 census roughly 54 per cent of the population identified with a form of Christianity and 36.7 per cent stated they had no religion. Other studies suggest that those not identifying with a denomination or who see themselves as non-religious may be much higher at between 42 and 56 per cent, depending on the form of <b>question</b> <b>asked.</b> In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through immigration and higher birth rates among ethnic minorities, rather than large numbers of converts. Those faiths with the most adherents in the 2011 census were Islam (1.4 per cent, mainly among immigrants from South Asia), Hinduism (0.3 per cent), Buddhism (0.2 per cent) and Sikhism (0.2 per cent). Other minority faiths include Judaism, the Bahá'í Faith and small Neopagan groups. There are also various organisations which actively promote humanism and secularism.|$|E
