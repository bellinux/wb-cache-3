The objective of this study is to examine to what extent the change of auditor is related to the type of opinion that the auditor expressed in the audit report. In pursuit of this objective, an empirical study was carried out supported by a sample from a set of entities with securities admitted to trading on the Portuguese stock market in the period between 2006 and 2012 (seven years) and using logistic regression to test whether the reception of the qualified audit report indicated the change of auditor.

The largest number of <b>qualified</b> <b>opinions</b> occur in the years 2007, 2009 and 2011, most of which were related to equity and assets, and the change of auditor is more associated with <b>qualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on assets and other <b>qualified</b> <b>opinions</b> than the <b>qualified</b> <b>opinions</b> on equity and liabilities...|$|R

50|$|In {{accordance}} with the US GAAP, auditors must release an opinion of the overall financial statements in the auditor's report. Auditors can release three types of statements other than an unqualified/unmodified opinion. The unqualified auditor's opinion is the opinion that the financial statements are presented fairly. A <b>qualified</b> <b>opinion</b> is that the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects in {{accordance with}} US GAAP, except for a material misstatement that does not however pervasively affect the user's ability {{to rely on the}} financial statements. A <b>qualified</b> <b>opinion</b> can also be issued for a scope limitation that is of limited significance. Further the auditor can instead issue a disclaimer, because there is insufficient and appropriate evidence to form an opinion or because of lack of independence. In a disclaimer the auditor explains the reasons for withholding an opinion and explicitly indicates that no opinion is expressed. Finally, an adverse audit opinion is issued when the financial statements do not present fairly due to departure from US GAAP and the departure materially affects the financial statements overall. In an adverse auditor's report the auditor must explain the nature and size of the misstatement and must state the opinion that the financial statements do not present fairly in accordance with US GAAP.|$|E

Consistent with the {{monitoring}} role of auditor opinions on accounting quality, we find that a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> is associated with an average increase of 18 basis points in the interest rate of loan facilities issued in the following year. We find that this effect persists for an additional three years in the interest rate for new loans. We also find evidence that lenders replace financial covenants with non-financial covenants following a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> of the borrower's financial statements. Furthermore, we also find that a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> is associated with a decrease in loan size and an increase in the likelihood of requiring collateral from the borrower, but we find no evidence that a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> is associated with a change in the length of loan maturity. Finally, we find that a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> is associated with a decreased use of financial ratios in performance pricing provisions. A variety of additional tests demonstrate that the effects of a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> on contractual terms are robust after controlling for other indicators of accounting quality such as abnormal accruals, volatility of accounting accruals and disclosure of internal control weakness. These results are not obvious given that private lenders have access to proprietary information unavailable to most market participants and suggest that auditors play a unique role in debt contracting through monitoring borrowers' financial reporting quality...|$|R

50|$|James Cook led three {{separate}} voyages to chart unknown {{areas of the}} globe for the British Empire. It was on his third and finale voyage that he encountered what we know today as the Islands of Hawaii. He arrived in the islands on January 18, 1778. After Cook's initial visit he left but was forced to return to Hawaii in mid February 1779 after a ship's mast broke in bad weather. When Cook had first arrived in the islands he was greeted with great honor. His arrival coincided with the Makahiki, a festival celebrating the yearly harvest while worshipping the Hawaiian deity, Lono. On February 13, while anchored in Kealakekua Bay a small boat was stolen {{by one of the}} lesser chiefs, testing the foreigner's reaction to see how far they could go. After he and the crews of both ships, the HMS Resolution and HMS Discovery left the islands, the festival season had ended and the season for battle and war had begun under the worship and rituals for Kūkaʻilimoku, the god of war. The Hawaiians had begun openly challenging the foreigners. In retaliation, Cook tried to kidnap the aliʻi nui of the island of Hawaii, Kalaniʻōpuʻu. Cook made several mistakes on his third journey being quite sick and ill tempered. The hostage attempt would prove fatal. The idea or suggestion that the Native Hawaiians considered Cook to be the God Lono himself is considered to be inaccurate and is attributed to William Bligh through the man's less than <b>qualified</b> <b>opinion.</b> It is possible that some Hawaiians may have used the name of Lono as a metaphor when describing Cook or other possible explanations other than that the Hawaiians mistook the explorer for their own deity.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: This study {{examines}} whether the disaffiliation program {{introduced by the}} Chinese government improved auditor independence and whether auditor quality affects this relationship. Auditor independence is {{measured in terms of}} the likelihood of receiving a qualified report and the level of earnings management (measured by noncore operating income). The results show that the likelihood of receiving <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinions</b> for listed companies significantly increased, and noncore operating earnings significantly decreased, after auditors were disaffiliated. However, companies audited by auditors without any affiliation also showed an increase in the likelihood of receiving <b>qualified</b> <b>opinions</b> and a decrease in noncore operating earnings, possibly because of the increased surveillance by the regulatory bodies that accompanied the act of disaffiliation. The results also show that the association between the disaffiliation program and the likelihood of receiving <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinions</b> is stronger for small auditors than for large auditors, possibly because of the initial lower audit quality of small auditors. Auditor size, however, did not significantly affect the association between the disaffiliation program and noncore operating earnings...|$|R

The ultimate purpose {{of this research is}} to gain better understanding on the issuance level of <b>qualified</b> <b>opinion</b> and the reliability of audit opinion rendered by auditors in Indonesia. First, we estimated earnings management through cross-sectional modified Jones (Becker et al, 1998) model in our sample. Then, we performed a linear regression model (Johl et al, 2007) in order to analyze the relation between the earnings management measure and the independent and control variables influencing it. There are two hypotheses in this research. For the first hypothesis results, there is a negative relationship between (ABDA) and (QUAL). This surprisingly means when the company practices (EM) it does not necessarily mean they are likely to receive <b>qualified</b> <b>opinion</b> from their auditors. For the second hypothesis results, there is a positive relationship between (ABDA*AQ) and (QUAL). This means when the company practices (EM) and being audited by the Big 4 and industry specialist auditors, they are likely to render a <b>qualified</b> <b>opinion.</b> However, the results for both hypotheses are insignificant due to extremely low evidence of only 4. 76 % companies with <b>qualified</b> <b>opinion.</b> There is still low probability of issuance of audit qualification in Indonesia as indicated with only 4. 76 % of total 672 firm years from 2008 - 2010 receive audit qualification.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{three models}} to predict a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> in the Indonesian financial market by incorporating corporate governance, audit, and financial characteristics. The hypotheses are built upon agency theory {{which suggests that}} board of director, external auditor, and financial information {{can be used as}} an effective device to monitor the credibility of financial reporting—proxied as <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion.</b> The argument in this study is that if <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> is defined as a low quality of financial report, then a high quality of board of directors,external auditor, and financial information can be used to reduce the incidence of qualified audit opinionUsing a sample of 732 companies listed in the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) for the period 2002 - 2006, this study employs logistic analysis to predict the <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion.</b> Overall, the study shows the audit opinion can be predicted successfully with accuracy rate ranges from 83. 4 percent to 84. 5 percent for an estimation sample and holdout sample respectively. The variables that have significant predictive power are board of director size, board ownership, audit committee with more than three members, auditor report lag, leverage, liquidity, and industry type. The logistic analysis results show a positive and significant relationship between ownership stake held by board of director’s (supervisory board) members and <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion.</b> This result is contradictory to the traditional agency theory expectation which suggests that management ownership can be used to align conflict of interest between shareholders and managers. The  logistic analysis results confirm the entrenchment effect hypothesis that concentrated ownershipin the hands of family members or individuals will shield the stockholder-controlled companiesfrom monitoring by a board of directors (supervisory board). Nevertheless, the results support the agency theory expectation that members of a smaller board of director (supervisory board) perform better monitoring than larger boards. As expected in the hypothesis, the results show that where an audit committee comprises more than three members it is an effective device for monitoring the credibility of the financial report. The study provides evidence that incorporating corporate governance and audit characteristics in predicting a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> provides additional information that can not be elicited directly from financial statement information. Thus, the logistic models used by this study provide better accuracy rate in predicting a <b>qualified</b> audit <b>opinion</b> than studies incorporating only financial information into the models...|$|R
