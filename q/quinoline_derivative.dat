50|$|Because of the {{similarity}} of these to the reagents in the Friedlander quinolone synthesis, a benzaldehyde with an aldehyde or ketone, the Niementowski quinoline synthesis mechanism is minimally {{different from that of}} the Friedländer synthesis. While studied in depth, two reaction pathways are possible and both have significant support. The reaction is thought to begin with the formation of a Schiff base, and then proceed via an intra-molecular condensation to make an imine intermediate. There is then a loss of water that leads to a ring closing and formation of the <b>quinoline</b> <b>derivative.</b> Most evidence supports this as the mechanism in normal conditions of 120-130 °C. Alternatively, the reaction begins with an intermolecular condensation and subsequent formation of the imine intermediate. The latter has been shown to be more common under acidic or basic conditions. A similar pathway has been proposed for the Niementowski quinazoline synthesis.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} article, we {{describe}} a mechanistic {{study of a}} novel derivative of N-amidino-substituted benzimidazo[1, 2 -alpha]quinoline in two human colorectal cancer cell lines differing in p 53 gene status. We used a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry to complement the results obtained by common molecular biology methods for analyzing cell proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Tested <b>quinoline</b> <b>derivative</b> inhibited colon cancer cell growth, whereby p 53 gene status seemed to be critical for its differential response patterns. DNA damage and oxidative stress {{are likely to be}} the common triggers of molecular events underlying its antiproliferative effects. In HCT 116 (wild-type p 53), this compound induced a p 53 -dependent response resulting in accumulation of the G(1) - and S-phase cells and induction of apoptosis via both caspase- 3 -dependent and caspase-independent pathways. <b>Quinoline</b> <b>derivative</b> triggered transient, p 53 -independent G(2) -M arrest in mutant p 53 cells (SW 620) and succeeding mitotic transition, whereby these cells underwent cell death probably due to aberrant mitosis (mitotic catastrophe).
