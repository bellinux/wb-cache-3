40|$|The parser {{generator}} {{has proven to}} be an extremely useful, general purpose tool. It can be used effectively by programmers having only a knowledge of grammars and no training at all in the theory of formal parsing. Some of the application areas for which a table-driven parser can be used include interactive, <b>query</b> languages, <b>menu</b> systems, translators, and programming support tools. Each of these is illustrated by an example grammar...|$|R
30|$|Wiki Drilldown The wiki {{drilldown}} enables {{users to}} “formulate” individual <b>queries</b> by <b>menu</b> options that provide selections from main categories (for example, data, theoretical frameworks, or assessment standards) through {{a hierarchy of}} properties, subproperties, and values. For example, a user can use the wiki drilldown feature to quickly locate all vulnerability assessments that employ an indicator-based approach and filter the information to identify which of these use expert judgment versus statistical methods for weighting indicators or how many use the Hazards of Place model as their theoretical framework.|$|R

Starting with a use case analysis and a conceptual model of the application we first provide guidelines for modeling the navigation space. From the navigation space model we can derive, in a next step, a navigational structure model which shows how to navigate through the navigation space using access elements like indexes, guided tours, <b>queries</b> and <b>menus.</b> Finally, a presentation model is constructed that can be directly implemented by HTML frames.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{systematic}} design method for Web applications which {{takes into account}} the navigation space and the presentational aspects of the application. The method is based on a UML profile for the Web domain. Starting with a use case analysis and a conceptual model of the application we first provide guidelines for modeling the navigation space. From the navigation space model we can derive, in a subsequent step, a navigational structure model which shows how to navigate through the navigation space using access elements like indexes, guided tours, <b>queries</b> and <b>menus.</b> Finally, a static and dynamic presentation model is constructed. The different models of the design process are represented by using a Web extension of UML. The strength of the presented methodology is that most steps can be performed in a semi-automatic way, thus providing the basis for a systematic mechanism for Web design...|$|R
40|$|Demonstration of {{compliance}} with the Texas Building Energy Conservation Design Standard involves completion of a summary checklist for each of its sections. This manual checking is tedious. Furthermore, no comprehensive documentation of the user's compliance is provided and the compliance checker must manage the data collected. To assist designers in complying with the Standard and to reduce the time required, the Center for Energy Studies (CES) at the University of Texas at Austin has developed an expert system to serve as both the compliance procedure and its documentation. This expert system directs the user with <b>queries</b> (screen <b>menus),</b> prompting the user for all relevant information. A graphical user interface has been developed to facilitate quick navigation through the Standard, easy data entry, and identification {{of compliance}} failures. This paper describes the research approach to the expert system, the system features, current status of project, and the benefits {{to be derived from}} this innovative compliance tool...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Telecommunications Emergency Decision Support System (TEDSS) {{was developed by}} the National Communications System (NCS) to assist in the management of national communication assets during times of emergency. TEDSS is currently approaching the end of its system life, and is only marginally capable of meeting existing and future requirements. The personal computer-based system uses a structured menu-oriented interface developed within an INGRES database management system application environment. The system provides predefined <b>queries</b> and <b>menus</b> which minimize the amount of decision support provided for emergency management. This thesis reviews the current operational capabilities of TEDSS and the emergency decision making environment in which it operates. It proposes a conceptual shift of TEDSS from its current textually-oriented information system to a graphically-oriented Tactical Decision Aid (TDA). The proposed system would employ a Graphical User Interface (GUI) providing a standard interface to a Geographical Information System (GIS). The GIS would provide a map[based environment in which the user manipulates data and models. Software and hardware issues relating {{to the development of a}} TDA-based TEDSS are discussed.

40|$|We present {{preliminary}} results from two studies examining the selection techniques suitable for paper maps using handheld computers or cellphones as interaction devices. An informal mockup exploration indicated a strong tendency toward pointand-click style interaction when {{participants were asked}} to envision how a range of queries might be expressed. A subsequent study involving a functional prototype and a short training session showed that participants were receptive to other interaction styles, including tracing paths, circling regions, constraining <b>queries</b> with paper <b>menus,</b> and selecting multiple non-adjacent map icons. The contrasting results underline the importance of using a range of design evaluation techniques when developing applications involving handheld devices as interactors...|$|R
40|$|Bioinformatics {{arose from}} the need to manage and extract {{knowledge}} from the vast amount of sequence data generated by automated Molecular Biology techniques. One important step for this was {{the development of the}} Gene Ontology (GO), which provided a unified and structured vocabulary to describe proteins, and also a background to compare them, contributing to the integration of knowledge from the sequence level to the system level. Several approaches have been proposed to measure protein similarity in this context, but there are few tools for this purpose available to the scientific community. We present a new web tool, ProteInOn, focused on calculating GO-based protein semantic similarity. It features a stepwise <b>query</b> selection <b>menu,</b> which together with the possibility of selecting results as input for new queries, makes it flexible and customizable. It also incorporates data on protein interactions, allowing for comparative studies between protein similarity and interactions. The tool implements a preliminary weighting factor which increases the specificity of existing semantic similarity measures, and a score for measuring the representativeness of a GO term within a set of proteins. ProteInOn is available at: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} precise UML-based {{authoring}} method for Web applications. This authoring method {{is part of}} the UML-based Web Engineering (UWE) approach. Starting with a requirement analysis done by use cases technique, it focuses on the design phase. The conceptual model of the application is used as guideline for modeling the navigation space. From the navigation space model we derive, in a next step, a navigation structure model which shows how to navigate through the navigation space using access elements like indexes, guided tours, <b>queries</b> and <b>menus.</b> Finally, a presentation model is constructed based on the navigation structure model. It provides an appropriate UML notation to support sketching and storyboarding. In addition, we suggest to use UML interaction diagrams to represent the presentation flow. During the whole development process we identify steps that can be performed in an automatic way thus providing the basis for a generation mechanism for Web application design. The different models of the design process are represented by using a UML conform extension of UML for Web applications (UML profile). The authoring process is illustrated with an example: a Web [...] based conference review system. The strength of the presented Web engineering approach is given by the fact that we use exclusively the UML notation and techniques. Moreover, our specification of constraints with OCL (part of UML) allows augmenting the exactitude of the models. In the same way our methodology has a high degree of precision in the description of guidelines of the authoring process of Web application, which can even partially be automated.
