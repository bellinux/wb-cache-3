25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low <b>quiescent</b> <b>current)</b> and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the circuit}} {{involving}} Q16 (variously named rubber diode or VBE multiplier), the 4.5k resistor must be conducting about 100μA, with the Q16 VBE roughly 700mV. Then the VCB must be about 0.45V and VCE at about 1.0V. Because the Q16 collector {{is driven by}} a current source and the Q16 emitter drives into the Q19 collector current sink, the Q16 transistor establishes a voltage difference between Q14 base and Q20 base of ≈ 1V, regardless of the common-mode voltage of Q14/Q20 base. The standing current in Q14/Q20 will be a factor exp(100mV / VT [...] ) ≈ 36 smaller than the 1mA <b>quiescent</b> <b>current</b> in the class A portion of the op amp.
