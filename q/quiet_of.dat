She notes that in the <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> the night, despite falsehoods and tears, she can feel satisfaction by touching herself. By stroking herself and perhaps her metaphorical wolf-pelt, Gaga is engaging {{in a moment of}} self-acceptance and self-soothing. Lady Gaga realizes that {{it will be difficult to}} maintain her dualistic nature, and alludes to upcoming death when she tells audiences that she is so content that she would welcome death. These words appear to foreshadow the end of , as the singer alludes to a calm acceptance of her spiritual/ghostly side.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{was killed}} in action {{on the evening of}} 7September 1940, after he intercepted a Dornier Do17 bomber taking part in a {{large-scale}} attack on London. His Spitfire crashed in a field between Sundridge and Bessels Green in Kent. He apparently bailed out, but his parachute failed to open; his body was found in a garden on Main Road, Sundridge, not far from the wreck of his Spitfire. The Dornier came down in the River Darent. No.234 Squadron lost its commanding officer, O'Brien, in the same action. Mystery surrounds exactly how Hughes came to grief, though his close-in tactics are believed to have played a major part in it. The strain of regular combat without respite, manifesting itself in fatigue and spots before the eyes, may also have contributed. He is generally thought to have collided with flying wreckage from the crippled German bomber, rendering his Spitfire uncontrollable. It is also possible that Hughes accidentally rammed his target. Further speculation suggested that he was the victim of friendly fire from another British fighter attacking the same Dornier, or was struck by German bullets from a Bf109. Some observers on the ground, including collier Charles Hall, maintained that Hughes rammed the Dornier on purpose. Four days after his death, No.234 Squadron was moved back to the relative <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> Cornwall.|$|E

25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply flicked the lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

Isolationism, Reynolds writes, [...] "breaks with all of ambient's feel-good premises", and [...] "evokes an uneasy silence: the uncanny calm before catastrophe, the deathly <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> aftermath."

2500|$|Social {{justice is}} neither communism, nor despotism, nor atomism, nor anarchy, but the humanization {{of laws and}} the {{equalization}} {{of social and economic}} forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated.

Here, in the <b>quiet</b> <b>of</b> the Parisian suburbs, Madetoja began to compose his Third Symphony, Op. 55, and upon returning to Finland in October (due to financial worries), {{his work on the}} project continued. The new symphony received its premiere in Helsinki on 8 April 1926, and although Madetoja received the usual praise, the audience and critics found the new work somewhat perplexing: with the monumental, elegiac Second Symphony having set expectations, the optimism and restraint of the Third came as a surprise, its (subsequent) significance eluding nearly everyone. Some years later, the French music writer, Henri-Claude Fantapié, described the cheerful, pastorale Third Symphony as a [...] "sinfonia Gallica" [...] in spirit and explained the premiere as thus: [...] "The listeners expected the opera [...] to be followed by a nationalistic anthem and were disappointed to hear something that seemed to them to be hermetic and that, to crown it all, was lacking in pomposity and solemnity … the properties the majority of Finnish music-lovers always expect in a new work." [...] Nevertheless, today the Third Symphony is widely regarded as Madetoja's [...] "masterpiece", the rare Finnish symphony equal in stature to Sibelius's seven essays in the form.|$|E
2500|$|While {{state of}} the art in 1908, when the last brand new MP54 rolled off the {{assembly}} line 28 years later, the design did more to suit the PRR's desire for standardization than the comfort of the passengers that rode them.

[...] Using AC motors of this type resulted in poor acceleration compared to equivalent DC motors, a problem that was exacerbated by the frequent stops the MP54s would make in local commuter service. [...] While the 99 1950's rebuilt E5 and E6 units had better performance and a stated top speed of 65mph, older E1 and E2 cars would struggle to reach [...] [...] A further design flaw in the propulsion gear of the E1 and E2 models required that if power was taken off at speeds above , it could not be reapplied until the train slowed back to 30mph lest arcing damage the motors. The 1908 truck design provided {{little in the way of}} ride quality, and friction bearings on unmodified cars retarded performance further.
