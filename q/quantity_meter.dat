40|$|More then {{forty years}} ago R. I. Pimenov {{introduced}} a new geometry [...] semi-Riemannian one [...] {{as a set of}} geometrical objects consistent with a fibering pr: M_n → M_m. He suggested the heuristic principle according to which the physically different <b>quantities</b> (<b>meter,</b> second, coulomb etc.) are geometrically modelled as space coordinates that are not superposed by automorphisms. As there is only one type of coordinates in Riemannian geometry and only three types of coordinates in pseudo-Riemannian one, a multiple fibered semi-Riemannian geometry is the most appropriate one for the treatment of more then three different physical quantities as unified geometrical field theory. Semi-Euclidean geometry ^ 3 R_ 5 ^ 4 with 1 -dimensional fiber x^ 5 and 4 -dimensional Minkowski space-time as a base is naturally interpreted as classical electrodynamics. Semi-Riemannian geometry ^ 3 V_ 5 ^ 4 with the general relativity pseudo-Riemannian space-time ^ 3 V^ 4, and 1 -dimensional fiber x^ 5, responsible for the electromagnetism, provides the unified field theory of gravitation and electromagnetism. Unlike Kaluza-Klein theories, where the 5 -th coordinate appears in nondegenerate Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian geometry, the theory based on semi-Riemannian geometry is free from defects of the former. In particular, scalar field does not arise. PACS: 04. 50. Cd, 02. 40. -k, 11. 10. KkComment: 16 pages, 2 figures. Submited to Physics of Atomic Nucle...|$|R

30|$|Acidizing {{technology}} is widely {{applied in the}} petroleum industry. It {{plays an important role}} in increase either oil and gas well production or the injection amount of a water injection well (Hassan et al. 2014; Carpenter 2014; Stolyarov and Alam 2013). Acidizing is a broad field that was gradually expanded through scientific perception and empirical experience. Because of the complication and uncertainty of applying an appropriate acidizing process in different cases and scenarios, a significant amount of gathered information does not necessarily lead to an accurate quantitative measurement. This strongly obstructs precise analysis via classic mathematical methods. Instead, the process relies on the relatively subjective experience and knowledge of acidizing experts (Enelamah et al. 2003; Retnanto et al. 2013; Saputelli et al. 2007; Blackburn et al. 1990; Van Domelen et al. 1992). Developments in innovative artificial intelligence technique (AIT) have led to rapid developments in expert system (ES), a crucial subfield of AIT. Currently, ES has been applied in many process designs in the petroleum industry, including well drilling, well completion, log analysis, well test interpretation, numerical simulation, diagnosis to formation damage, rod pumping, well production stimulation, oil extraction rate, heavy oil exploitation, well repair, sand prevention, water plugging, oil <b>quantity</b> <b>metering,</b> oil production and management, and so on (Blackburn et al. 1990; Van Domelen et al. 1992; Braunschweig 1990; Peveraro and Lee 1988; Bergen and Hutter 1986; Ali et al. 2003, 2004; Haitham et al. 2002; Chiu et al. 1992; Ebrahim et al. 2014). ES has effectively resolved the difficulties between production and theory.|$|R

5000|$|Diomedes Grammaticus was a Latin grammarian who {{probably}} {{lived in the}} late 4th century AD. He wrote a grammatical treatise, known either as De Oratione et Partibus Orationis et Vario Genere Metrorum libri III or Ars grammatica in three books, dedicated to a certain Athanasius. Since he is frequently quoted by Priscian (e.g. lib. ix. pp. 861, 870, lib. x. 879, 889, 892), he must have lived before the year 500. His third book on poetry is particularly valuable, containing extracts from Suetonius's De poetica. This book contains {{one of the most}} complete lists of types of dactylic hexameters in antiquity, including the teres versus, which may (or may not) be the so-called [...] "golden line." [...] Diomedes wrote {{about the same time as}} Charisius and used the same sources independently. The works of both grammarians are valuable, but whereas much of Charisius has been lost, the Ars of Diomedes has come down to uscomplete (although probably abridged). In book I he discusses the eight parts of speech; in II the elementary ideas of grammar and of style; in III poetry, <b>quantity,</b> and <b>meters.</b> The best edition is in H.

50|$|The {{reason why}} {{residual}} book inventory may {{exist in the}} MRP/ERP system may have multiple causes. A few of them are:- the quantity in the original packaging was not completely exact (e.g. the supplier indicated a <b>quantity</b> of 10000 <b>meters</b> per coil, but some coils had only 9500 meters);- the workplace has consumed some materials for adjusting the machine {{without being able to}} report that quantity exactly;- the operator has omitted to assign a new handling unit to the workplace or has assigned the false handling unit.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the {{continuation}} and completion {{of an earlier}} presentation {{on the structure of}} Psalm 119. The first part dealt mainly with the acrostic pattern of the poem as a whole, and the number and distribution of key-words in it (Freedman, forthcoming 1). This part will deal with questions of <b>quantity</b> and <b>meter</b> in this poem, along with other related matters. Before turning to these, however, I wish to consider two textual problems not treated in the former paper that may have some bearing on the metrical analysis below, since they are sufficiently problematic to warrant possible emendation of MT. In both cases we have alternate readings in the I IQ Psalm Scroll (l IQPs•) and the LXX whose evidence, while not identical in either case, tends to support a reading that may well be more original and superior to that in MT. I) In v 49, MT reads zelcor diibiir, while I IQPs • has zkwrh dbrykh and LXX has mnestheti ton logon sou, reflecting a Hebrew Vorlage: zelcor debiirekii. It seems likely that LXX preserves the original reading of the key-word diibiir, that is, the singular noun with the second m. s. suffix; MT apparently has lost the suffix, while 11 QPs • modified the singular noun to a plural. LXX and I IQPs • agree in representing the pronominal suffix omitted in MT. In the whole poem, this is the only instance in which the key-word diibiir lacks the suffix in MT. The argument is not decisive, and this may be a deliberate exception to the pattern, but the preponderanee of the evidence points to the reading of LXX and 11 QPs•. I.

5000|$|The Latin school {{curriculum}} was based mainly on reading Classical and some Medieval authors. Students {{had to learn}} the principles of Ars Dictaminis {{in order to learn}} how to write formal letters. Authors often had lists of books that were supposed {{to be used in the}} curriculum that would teach students grammar. These texts however, were often not the original texts, as more often than not, texts were changed to include moral stories or to display rules of grammar. These were usually in the form of fables or poems. New students generally started off with easy basic grammar, and steadily moved into harder Latin readings such as the Donatus (Ars Minor stage), which was a syntax manual that was memorized, or even more advanced with glossaries and dictionaries. Although many teachers used many books that varied from person to person, the most popular textbook would have been the Doctrinale. The Doctrinale was a long verse of Latin grammar. This textbook dealt with parts of speech, syntax, <b>quantity</b> and <b>meter,</b> as well as figures of speech. The Doctrinale as well as a large sum of other books (though not nearly as popular) was often referred to as the [...] "canon of textbooks". Similarly, as the student advanced into the Ars Dictaminis stage more theory and practice writing formal or prose letters were focused on. Poetry was often a teachers favorite as it taught not only Latin, but mnemonic value and [...] "truth". Poetry was not chiefly studied during the medieval times, although some classic poems were taken into the curriculum.

40|$|An {{anhydrous}} fixation {{method has}} been used to examine the de- and rehydration of pollen grains of Brassica oleracea, and to follow their early development after both compatible and incompatible intraspecific pollinations. Conventional water-based fixation techniques were shown to present a very artefactual image. Using the anhydrous method, specific stages of de- and rehydration were recognized in the pollen cytoplasm, and the most dehydrated grains were found not to possess an organized plasma membrane, but rather a superficial mosaic composed of vesicles, membranes and granules. The surface of the stigmatic papillae and of the pollen grain coating appear to be structurally adapted for the passage of <b>metered</b> <b>quantities</b> of water into the pollen grain. Evidence is presented that the self-incompatibility mechanism operating in these plants consists of a recognition stage occurring at the interface between the stigmatic pellicle and a membrane-like investment of the pollen coating, and a response phase involving the translocation of an inhibitor into the pollen grain cytoplasm. Since this system may be overridden by changes either in the plant or in its environment, the mechanism would seem to be uniquely adapted to changes in breeding strategy. © 1985...|$|R

However, control of diesel particulate matter (PM) and NOx emissions remains a significant challenge. Indeed, {{in order to meet the}} stringent PM and NOx emission limits proposed by future legislation, more efficient, durable and cost effective aftertreatment devices will be required. Ongoing research by the authors aims to develop a diesel emissions reduction system with enhanced performance by utilisation of hydrogen produced on-board in an exhaust gas assisted diesel fuel reformer. This type of fuel reforming process involves the on-board generation of hydrogen-containing gas by direct catalytic interaction of hydrocarbon fuels with engine exhaust gases.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the reader to}} electric and magnetic fields, particularly those fields produced by electric power systems and other sources using frequencies in the power-frequency range. Electric fields are produced by electric charges; a magnetic field also is produced if these charges are in motion. Electric fields exert forces on other charges; if in motion, these charges will experience magnetic forces. Power-frequency electric and magnetic fields induce electric currents in conducting bodies such as living organisms. The current density vector is {{used to describe the}} distribution of current within a body. The surface of the human body is an excellent shield for power-frequency electric fields, but power-frequency magnetic fields penetrate without significant attenuation; the electric fields induced inside the body by either exposure are comparable in magnitude. Electric fields induced inside a human by most environmental electric and magnetic fields appear to be small in magnitude compared to levels naturally occurring in living tissues. Detection of such fields thus would seem to require the existence of unknown biological mechanisms. Complete characterization of a power-frequency field requires measurement of the magnitudes and electrical phases of the fundamental and harmonic amplitudes of its three vector components. Most available instrumentation measures only a small subset, or some weighted average, of these <b>quantities.</b> Hand-held survey <b>meters</b> have been used widely to measure power-frequency electric and magnetic fields.
