Once {{the ranks}} of the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E
25|$|An {{information}} retrieval process begins when a user enters a query into the system. <b>Queries</b> <b>are</b> formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in web search engines. In {{information retrieval}} a query does not uniquely identify a single {{object in the}} collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy.|$|E

This book is called by the more progressive members Faith and Practice, following the late-twentieth century example of liberal yearly meetings. The Discipline includes provisions for business organization; the naming of ministers, elders, and overseers; marriage procedures; and the Advices and Queries.

25|$|Windows Search <b>queries</b> <b>are</b> {{specified}} in Advanced Query Syntax (AQS) which supports not only simple text searches but provides advanced property-based query operations as well. AQS defines certain keywords {{which can be}} used to refine the search query, such as specifying boolean operations on searched terms (AND, OR, NOT) as well as to specify further filters based on file metadata or file type. It {{can also be used to}} limit results from specific information stores like regular files, offline files cache, or email stores. File type specific operators are available as well. WDS also supports wildcard prefix matching searches. It also includes several SQL-like operators like GROUP BY. AQS is locale dependent and uses different keywords in international versions of Windows 7.|$|E

This process produces a list of top queries which gives the most accurate predictions of CDC ILI data when using the linear model. Then the top 45 <b>queries</b> <b>are</b> chosen because, when aggregated together, these queries fit the history data the most accurately. Using the sum of top 45 ILI-related queries, the linear model is fitted to the weekly ILI data between 2003 and 2007 so that the coefficient can be gained. Finally, the trained model is used to predict flu outbreak across all regions in the United States.|$|E

Individual records can be accessed using their accession numbers and other text <b>queries</b> <b>are</b> enabled through the EB-eye search engine.

Since range <b>query</b> <b>is</b> not straight-forward within space-filling Z-order curve [22], a query aggregation algorithm for grouping neighbor geohashes is developed so that the number of generated <b>queries</b> <b>is</b> optimized.|$|R
50|$|A media query {{consists}} of a media type and one or more expressions, involving media features, which resolve to either true or false.

2500|$|<b>Queries</b> <b>are</b> the {{mechanisms}} that Jet uses to retrieve {{data from the}} database. They can be defined in Microsoft QBE (Query By Example), through the Microsoft Access SQL Window or through Access Basic's Data Access Objects (DAO) language. These are then converted to an SQL SELECT statement. The query is then d [...] this involves parsing the query (involves syntax checking and determining the columns to query in the database table), then converted into an internal Jet query object format, which is then tokenized and organised into a tree like structure. In Jet 3.0 onwards these are then optimised using the Microsoft Rushmore query optimisation technology. The query is then executed and the results passed back to the application or user who requested the data.|$|E
2500|$|In Prolog, {{program logic}} is {{expressed}} in terms of relations, and a computation is initiated by running a query over these relations. [...] Relations and <b>queries</b> <b>are</b> constructed using Prolog's single data type, the term. Relations are defined by clauses. [...] Given a query, the Prolog engine attempts to find a resolution refutation of the negated query. If the negated query can be refuted, i.e., an instantiation for all free variables is found that makes the union of clauses and the singleton set consisting of the negated query false, it follows that the original query, with the found instantiation applied, is a logical consequence of the program. This makes Prolog (and other logic programming languages) particularly useful for database, symbolic mathematics, and language parsing applications. [...] Because Prolog allows impure predicates, checking the truth value of certain special predicates may have some deliberate side effect, such as printing a value to the screen. [...] Because of this, the programmer is permitted to use some amount of conventional imperative programming when the logical paradigm is inconvenient. [...] It has a purely logical subset, called [...] "pure Prolog", {{as well as a number}} of extralogical features.|$|E
