5|$|Boyer and the University Press' {{credibility}} {{was severely}} damaged. In 2000 the University referred all <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> university lawyers who investigated {{some of the}} allegations about Boyer's work. Later that year the Press removed the book from their catalog. The book has been discredited as a fraud and a hoax that cannot be relied on.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg {{also became}} {{an expert in}} dealing with noted Berkeley {{physicist}} Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer had a daunting reputation, and often answered a junior man's question before it had even been stated. Often the question answered was more profound than the one asked, but of little practical help. Seaborg learned to state his <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Oppenheimer quickly and succinctly.|$|E

5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Thornton about his show business career. Thornton {{went on to}} say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused an outpouring of criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|In 1799, after {{a seven-year}} journey, Nilkanth's travels as a yogi {{eventually}} concluded in Loj, {{a village in}} the Junagadh district of Gujarat. In Loj, Nilkanth Varni met Muktanand Swami, a senior disciple of Ramanand Swami. Muktanand Swami, who was twenty-two years older than Nilkanth, answered the five <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Nilkanth's satisfaction. Nilkanth decided to stay {{for the opportunity to}} meet Ramanand Swami, whom he met a few months after his arrival in Gujarat. He later claimed in the Vachnamrut that during this period, he took up a severe penance to eliminate his mothers flesh and blood from his body so that the sign of his physical attachment to family, was completely removed.|$|E
5|$|In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a final judgment had been entered. In Ex parte Milligan (1866), after the repeal of those amendments, the Court held that habeas petitions in the circuit courts could {{be a source of}} certified <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|In May 1645, Parliament {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} allowing excommunicants {{to appeal the}} church's sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To {{the majority of the}} divines' dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.|$|E
5|$|LeapFrog Enterprises {{released}} a Sonic X educational math game for its Leapster handheld game console; {{it was released}} in 2005 in North America and 2007 in Europe. The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced platform/action game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> continue. The game features three levels, {{each with its own}} math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction). There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.|$|E

5|$|When Marceau {{believes}} she has solved the murder, Poirot gathers the passengers and poses {{a series of}} <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Marceau about the clues found. He goes on to reveal three possible solutions to Ratchett's death. The first two are identical to the novel. Poirot suggests that an assassin may have come aboard the train during the night, killed Cassetti, and then escaped the train, which is supported by evidence such as a bloodied stiletto with fingerprints that do not match anyone on the train. The second solution pieces together a number of clues showing {{that all of the}} trains' passengers and the conductor, Pierre Michel, are responsible for the murder, to which they confess.|$|E

However, Veronica asks several <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> him which he does not answer very well. Veronica suddenly connects the dots and says that Tim committed the murder in order to frame Hank, who denied him a job opportunity. Tim is arrested and confesses to the murder, while Hank is being tried for manslaughter {{in the death of}} Mindy. Keith and Veronica share dinner after solving their cases.|$|E
5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|During the study, various {{accusations of}} foul play by or unsuitability of both {{submarine}} designers were made by Australian politicians and the media. These included claims that the similar left-wing political leanings of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the Swedish Social Democratic Party, both in power at the time, {{would lead to a}} pro-Kockums bias, investigations into perceived coaching of IDL/HDW representatives in the <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> be asked at an ALP Caucus briefing session on the project, and public emphasis on security incidents in both Sweden and West Germany. These incidents either lacked supporting evidence or were proven false, and were the result of the Liberal Party attempting to discredit the Labor government, or pro-British politicians and organisations who believed both submarines were inferior to the Vickers Type 2400offering.|$|E

Bass is unsettled by the brutal way that Epps treats his slaves and expresses his opposition to American slavery, earning Epps's enmity. Solomon overhears the conversation and decides to reveal his kidnapping to Bass. Once again, Northup asks for help in getting a letter to Saratoga Springs. Bass, risking his life, agrees to send it. One day, the local sheriff arrives in a carriage with another man. The sheriff asks Northup a series of <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> confirm that his answers match the facts of his life in New York. Northup recognizes the sheriff's companion as Mr. Parker, a shopkeeper he knew in Saratoga. Parker has come to free him, and the two embrace, though an enraged Epps furiously protests the circumstances and tries to prevent him from leaving. Solomon gives an emotional farewell to Patsey and rides off to his freedom. Patsey faints as Solomon leaves.|$|E
5|$|Question Time is an {{opportunity}} for the British public to put <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> politicians of every ideological hue. Politicians from the UK's biggest parties appear most frequently, but from time to time representatives of parties with many fewer supporters – from the Scottish Socialists and Respect to the Green party – also take their seats on the stage. Question Time is the most prominent programme of its kind on British television, and we carefully study the support gained in elections by each of the parties, large and small, before deciding who to invite and how frequently they should appear. It is a straightforward matter of fact that, with some 6% of the vote and the election of two MEPs in this spring's European elections – and with some success in local elections as well – the BNP has demonstrated a level of support that would normally lead to an occasional invitation to join the panel on Question Time. It is for that reason – not for some misguided desire to be controversial, but for that reason alone – that the invitation has been extended.|$|E
5|$|Richard (died 1184) was {{a medieval}} Benedictine monk and Archbishop of Canterbury. Employed by Thomas Becket {{immediately}} before Becket's death, Richard arranged for Becket {{to be buried}} in Canterbury Cathedral and eventually succeeded Becket at Canterbury in a contentious election. Much of Richard's time as archbishop was spent in a dispute with Roger de Pont L'Evêque, the Archbishop of York over the primacy of England, and with St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury over the archbishop's jurisdiction over the abbey. Richard had better relations with King Henry II of England than Becket had, and was employed by the king on diplomatic affairs. Richard also had the trust of the papacy, and served as a judge for the papacy. Several of his <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> Pope Alexander III were collected into the Decretals, a collection of ecclesiastical laws, and his patronage of canon lawyers did much to advance the study of canon law in England.|$|E
