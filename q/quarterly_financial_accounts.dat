40|$|Based on a Financial Almost Ideal Demand System (FAIDS), {{this paper}} investigates the wealth {{structure}} of German households. The long-run wealth elasticities and interestrate elasticities were calculated using a unique new <b>quarterly</b> <b>financial</b> <b>accounts</b> macrodata set which covers {{the period from}} 1959 to 2009 and contains a portfolio of eight different financial assets. Descriptive analysis shows that all financial assets were characterized by substantial volatility of their weight in the portfolio of households. We found that portfolio shifts {{in the long run}} are determined significantly by changes in interest rates. The estimated model provides evidence that currency (and transferable deposits) is mainly a substitute for other assets and time deposits are typically a complement. Wealth elasticity is for most assets around unity. JEL Classification: E 21, G 11, C 32 financial wealth, household, portfolio structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{changing}} economic environment on Irish households has been significant, with net worth falling 30 per cent since 2006. This article uses <b>Quarterly</b> <b>Financial</b> <b>Accounts</b> data to investigate how they have adjusted to the vastly different economic climate {{with which they are}} now faced. It finds that households ’ portfolio composition has shifted considerably, due largely to falling asset values. Results also suggest that households are now entering a long period of debt reduction. The consequence of deleveraging is a reduction in household consumption; a process that cannot proceed without an increase in the household savings rate. In the wake of the economic slowdown, there is a risk that increased savings could be a drag on consumption and bank lending in the future, with negative implications for the speed of economic recovery. * The authors are Economists in the Bank’s Statistics Department.

The enhancements to the data will include the publication of whom-to-whom data for deposits and loans {{for the first time in}} end-April 2015. Other notable features of the enhancements to QFA include a change to the definition of non-financial corporations (NFCs) and the publication of NFCs trade credit liabilities, which is an important source of funding for NFCs. Further enhancements to the data will be made during 2016. This article analyses some of the insights which can be gained from the enhancements to the QFA data. It finds that since the financial crisis intensified in Q 3 2008, there have been significant inflows into government deposit accounts by households and outflows from monetary financial institutions (MFIs) deposit accounts. The change in definition of NFCs under ESA 2010 markedly reduced Irish NFC debt, but it still remains quite elevated. Nearly half of NFC debt was with non-resident lenders, most likely reflecting the activities of multinational corporations (MNCs). The enhancements to the QFA data will be particularly useful in assessing financial stability risks to the economy and the potential transmission of risks between the institutional sectors of the economy...|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} {{stock market}} fluctuations observed since the mid- 1990 s have generated major unrealised holding {{gains and losses}} and sizeable changes in the market capitalisation of listed companies. Indeed, stock prices rose up to 2000 and then fell until 2003 - 2004, when they posted a recovery. Such fl uctuations have no doubt affected {{the way in which}} economic agents perceive their fi nancial position and have consequently infl uenced their fi nancial behaviour and their use of credit. This study attempts to distinguish, in changes in household and company borrowing behaviour, between the effects of a specifi c fi nancial constraint, attributable to stock market shocks, and more traditional effects, stemming from the business cycle. To do so, the study uses a model, based on the <b>quarterly</b> <b>financial</b> <b>accounts</b> published by the Banque de France in autumn 2004, that tracks the financial behaviour of households and companies over the recent period of equity market turbulence between 1995 and 2003. Given the subject under review, the model focuses on two fi nancial assets – loans and equities – thus making it possible to analyse the borrowing behaviour of these two agents, the structure of their fi nancial assets and the composition of companies’ liabilities. However, it does not take account of households’ real estate assets and therefore measures only the impact of equity market bubbles on credit. In this model, it is assumed that flows of bank loans to households and companies not only depend on their consumption and investment spending but on their fi nancial position as well. More specifi cally, in the case of households, they depend on their net wealth and, in the case of companies, on the share of loans in their liabilities. A stock market shock brings about changes in outstanding amounts of equities held by households and in the valuation of companies’ equity capital. The financial position of these two agents and, consequently, their borrowing behaviour are affected. According to the simulations of this model, companies in France appear much more sensitive than households to stock market shocks. Wealth effects seem to have a fairly limited impact on loans to households. However, the balance sheet structure effect appears to be largely responsible for the expansion of loans to companies. The rise in stock prices {{in the latter half of}} the 1990 s seems to have sharply increased companies’ equity capital, thus allowing them to increase their leverage. Assessing the impact of an equity market bubble on credit remains, in principle, contingent on the way this bubble is measured and in particular on the assumption made regarding the share price trend growth rate that acts as the reference trend. However, whether we assume the latter to be that of the fi rst half of the 1990 s, i. e. 4 % per year, or even twice that rate, the amplitude of stock market fl uctuations over the period was such that this assumption is not a determining factor for the orders of magnitude. In both cases, outstanding loans to companies appeared to rise by just over 8 % in 2001 compared with the amount by which they would have increased had there not been an equity market bubble. ...|$|E
