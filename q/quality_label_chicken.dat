The thesis describes various food <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> granted by various organizations. A research question is: "Prefer costumers buying food with a quality label?" An author conducted a questionnaire research focused on the <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> Klasa, which is granted by the Department of Agriculture of the Czech Republic. Results of the research were compared with a research focused on the other <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> - Regionální potravina. In the following part of the thesis are compared systems of food <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> in the Czech Republic and in foreign countries. The problem of costs connected with working of private labels is also mentioned in the thesis. Special {{attention is paid to}} private labels of food retail chains, because they are very important and economically strong players on the food market in the Czech Republic...|$|R

We analyzed that by {{using one of the}} most well-known <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> for food products in Austria as our research object (the <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> of the organization AgrarMarkt Austria, the so-called AMA Seal). Apparently, {{there is a lack of}} consumer-oriented information. Up to now, the type of information consumers of AMA sealed products demand is more or less unknown. Therefore, the objectives of this study were (1) to identify consumers’ actual use of information and (2) their information needs about <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> to provide needs-based consumer information...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> {{utilization}} {{in the food}} products sector from consumer {{point of view and}} presents the results of research study which was conducted in the Czech Republic by interviewing a sample of 250 respondents selected by quota sampling methods. The study was aimed at analysing the consumers’ awareness and perceived credibility of food <b>quality</b> <b>labels,</b> at revealing their willingness to pay a higher price for certified products, and at determining whether significant differences do exist in the way consumers perceive the food <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> based on their socio-demographic characteristics. The findings revealed a low awareness of food <b>quality</b> <b>labels.</b> A higher level of recognition as well as perceived credibility was proven for national <b>quality</b> <b>labels.</b> As the main problem were identified a poor information about <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> and lack of confidence that certified products have declared characteristics. Consumers show an interest in getting information about the topic, they also express a willingness to pay a slightly higher price for certified products if they trust them. Our findings confirmed that significant differences do exist between socio-demographic characteristics of respondents (gender, age, education, and responsibility for food purchases) and their attitudes toward the labels; no significant difference was found based on income...|$|R
40|$|<b>Quality</b> {{assurance}} and <b>labeling</b> play {{an important}} and increasing role in firms’ marketing strategies. In almost all cases, a price incentive has been stressed as the major incentive for firms to participate in such schemes. We argue here that important non-price incentives for participation in <b>quality</b> <b>labeling</b> may exist, too. In German retailing, it can be observed that discount retailers are listing more and more foods with <b>quality</b> <b>labels.</b> Processors may then participate in voluntary <b>quality</b> <b>labeling</b> in order to enter the large and growing market of discount retailers. The price-premium versus the market-entry hypothesis are analyzed theo-retically. We investigate then in an empirical hedonic pricing model for the German fruit juice market and {{for participation in the}} <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> of the Deutsche Landwirtschafts-Gesellschaft (DLG) which of the two hypotheses is consistent with the data. There is strong support for the market-entry hypothesi...|$|R

40|$|Both {{industry}} and firm characteristics influence {{the survival of}} a firm in an industry over time. Aging, size, structure are factors often discussed in the literature, but public intervention effects - through public <b>quality</b> <b>labeling</b> for example - may also have an effect that is examined here. We use data on French firms producing cheese under public <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> or not over the period 1990 - 2006. We perform a nonparametric estimation using Kaplan-Meier estimators as well as proportional hazard rate models {{to assess the impact}} of such factors on firms survival. Our results confirm existing finding on firm survival determinants. We also shed light on the effect of public intervention into that industry. More precisely, our focus on public <b>quality</b> <b>labeling</b> in the French cheese industry shows that <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> reduces the risk of exiting for firms and more particularly for small firms. In other words, public intervention in this industry is well designed to increase the competitiveness of small firms enabling the coexistence on the market of both small and large firms.

40|$|In {{this article}} the authors study {{one aspect of}} the {{proliferation}} of <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> in the agro-food sector: the coexistence of two signs on one same product and its consequences on the value of each sign. The context is that of the competition between national brands and private labels on a certain number of goods carrying a public <b>quality</b> <b>label.</b> The authors show that the value of a sign decreases when it is combined with another one on the same product. This result is verified for six products involving four <b>quality</b> <b>labels.</b> This allows for an interpretation of retailers' strategy concerning their private labels.

In multiple countries, <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> have emerged for this insulation service. In this research project, an evaluation framework for cavity wall insulation is developed by means of literature research, interviews and a multiple case study. The standards of various <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> prescribing the insulation process are assessed using this framework. Although the analyzed standards can be considered similar to a large extent, some remarkable differences have been identified. The results also indicate {{that none of the}} standards address all aspects of the insulation process. This means that the highest quality cannot be guaranteed when following the currently existing standards. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} a new <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> that overcomes the shortcomings of the existing standards identified in this research project...|$|R

40|$|As {{in other}} products, <b>quality</b> <b>labels</b> that {{designate}} {{the origin of}} lamb meat are increasingly used by consumers as a cue for inferring {{the quality of the}} meat. The aim of the present paper is to identify those factors that most affect the purchase of lamb with an origin <b>quality</b> <b>label.</b> For this purpose a total of 371 questionnaires were carried out in the region of Aragón located in the north east of Spain. This region produces 48. 5 % of the total amount of lamb meat with a Spanish protected geographical indication, whilst it also has the country’s greatest per capita consumption (6. 8 kg/person/year). To identify the most determining factors a logistic regression analysis was performed between three groups of buyers, characterised by their degree of loyalty towards purchasing origin quality-labelled lamb. The results show that those buyers who are less loyal to the label pay less attention to the origin of the meat when forming quality expectations at the time of purchase, whilst these are the buyers that place greatest importance on animal feeding as an aspect affecting the final quality of lamb meat. The buyers that are very loyal to the <b>quality</b> <b>label</b> associate this label with a product that offers greater guarantees and is healthier. Lamb meat buyers with medium loyalty to <b>quality</b> <b>labels,</b> consider quality-labelled lamb meat has better intrinsic attributes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
