40|$|Ab s t r a c t. The paper {{describes}} mass {{losses and}} fruit firmness changes during {{the storage of}} picked fruits, both with stalks and without. The fruits were kept in ‘shelf-life ’ conditions (2 oC, 75 % humidity) and in a coolhouse (2 oC, 95 % humidity). Quicker mass and firmness losses were observed during the storage of the fruits picked without stalks. <b>Quick</b> <b>chilling</b> permitted storage of picked fruits for 5 days with not too much quality changes. Fruits kept for 8 hours in ‘shelf-life ’ conditions showed significant mass (10 %) and firmness losses. K e y wo r d s: firmness changes, mass losses, strawberry, storag...|$|E

Adopting {{self-reaction}} quenching technology {{based on}} flame spraying technique, self-propagating high-temperature synthesis and <b>quick</b> <b>chilling</b> technique, hollow multiphase ceramic microspheres are prepared. With Al+Cr 2 O 3 +Fe+Fe 2 O 3 +MnO 2 as reactive system, agglomerate powders are obtained and then distinguished as thick powders and fine powders {{according to the}} different particle size. The relationship between agglomerate powders initial particle size and hollow ceramic microspheres is analyzed by the means of SEM, EDS, XRD and particle-size analyzer. The result shows that average particle diameter of thick powder is 24. 49 µm and that of fine powder is 17. 15 µm. Particle diameters of thick powder quenching product distribute {{within the range of}} 20 ~ 50 µm, and those of fine powder distribute within the range of 5 ~ 30 µm. The thick powder quenching product phase composition consists of Mn 2 AlO 4, Fe 2 O 3, Fe 3 O 4, FeCr 2 O 4, Cr 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3. The fine powder quenching product phase composition consists of Mn 2 AlO 4, Fe 2 O 3, FeCr 2 O 4, Fe 3 O 4...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} has been undertaken to evaluate the effect of cold and hot cutting techniques of heavy pig carcasses on microbiological contamination and meat quality. The results have shown that hot cutting has no negative effects on bacterial levels of exposed muscular surfaces. On the meat quality side hot cutting improves colour of internal muscles {{as a consequence of}} <b>quicker</b> <b>chilling</b> and, therefore, slower post mortem glycolysis...|$|R

40|$|Research on a {{sintered}} fly ash aggregate is presented. The aggregate was manufactured through material {{orthogonal test}} and <b>quick</b> <b>chilled</b> firing schedule test. It displayed high strength (7. 8 MPa) and low water absorption (4. 2 %). Lightweight aggregate concrete made with this aggregate reached compressive strength more than CL 60, slump over 20 cm, 60 minutes slump loss less than 2 cm, and expansibility higher than 50 cm. Such properties meet the modern concrete requirements for high strength and pump-ability. This new technology has important {{economic and social}} impacts {{on the use of}} industrial waste residue and on the environmental protection. 1...|$|R

Ah, why didn't you wait?"--if that inconsequent appeal kept rising {{to her lips}} to be cut short before it was spoken, this was only because at first the humility of {{gratitude}} helped her to gain time, enabled her to present herself very honestly as too overcome to be clear. She kissed her companion's hands, she did homage at her feet, she murmured soft snatches of praise, and yet {{in the midst of}} it all was conscious that what she really showed most was the wan despair at her heart.
