5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet had an interest in luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> he has answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E
60|$|The last remark {{was more}} of a <b>question</b> <b>than</b> an assertion, and Evelyn knew the man could be direct. She also esteemed candour.|$|R

6000|$|... 'And the beer,' {{said the}} lady of the caravan, with an {{appearance}} of being more interested in this <b>question</b> <b>than</b> the last; 'is it passable, George?' ...|$|R
25|$|The {{publication}} of the report caused a sensation in Ireland, {{as shown by the}} political and media reaction. It is generally agreed that the report raised more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered and that it opened up new avenues of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} for late L2 learners generally having issues with plurals and past tense, {{and not so}} many issues with Subject-Verb-Object testing, in which they show native-like results; there is better performance on Yes/No as well as Wh- <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> on articles and past tense.|$|E
25|$|Human Rights Watch {{likewise}} {{called for}} an independent international inquiry, saying that the IDF's report did not explain the attack, that it in effect raised more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered, and that contradicted eyewitness accounts of the timing, which denied legitimate military targets were around the building.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think, Clara,' said Mr. Murdstone, {{in a low}} grave voice, 'that {{there may}} be better and more dispassionate judges of such a <b>question</b> <b>than</b> you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No?" [...] and Lane spoke slowly, {{rather as}} one asking a <b>question</b> <b>than</b> {{with a hint}} of menace. [...] "Feel more like letting me foreclose on you?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{opinions}} of the collector of the port and {{of the board of}} official appraisers were no more admissible on this <b>question</b> <b>than</b> those of any other competent experts.|$|R
25|$|Nickell {{contends that}} the pirate theory raises more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answers. He contends that a journey into Kentucky was a {{dangerous}} undertaking, and that Swift {{could just as easily}} set up a clandestine coining operation in the backwoods of Virginia or aboard his ship. He also questions why Swift would take the time to produce such a detailed journal to cover his story.|$|E
25|$|In {{the seventh}} series, a mystery man arrives asking for Janey – Susan finally discovers the {{identity}} of Kenzo's father. Roger and Abi's marriage announcement gives Susan the idea to renew her marriage vows despite protests from Ben. A death in the dentist's chair is not very good for business, but Ben discovers it's not good for his private life either. Michael succeeds in placing the whole family on The Weakest Link, but Anne Robinson raises more difficult <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> might have been expected.|$|E
25|$|England's second innings batting {{effort was}} an {{improvement}} on the first, but still left people with more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers. Andrew Strauss was out for 0, Michael Vaughan looked brilliant for 21 runs but then edged Makhaya Ntini through to Mark Boucher. Alastair Cook scored a decent score of 60, {{but not enough}} to get England out of trouble. Kevin Pietersen came in for the most criticism, scoring 13 runs of 4 balls before edging through to the keeper off the bowling of Jacques Kallis.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's more in that <b>question</b> <b>than</b> you think, James," [...] Pamela replied. [...] "All the same, I think I {{shall be}} able to answer it in a few days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{sooner or}} later. But where? Perhaps {{you have lost}} a picture or two in your time, Mr. Quatermain, and {{are better able to}} answer the <b>question</b> <b>than</b> I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. Of that, gentlemen, {{there can}} be no more <b>question</b> <b>than</b> there is about Vesuvius {{standing}} up {{at the head of the}} Bay, smoking like a brick-kiln. That was Captain Rule's sole a'r'n'd." ...|$|R
25|$|Thomas Medwin's legacy {{tends to}} raise more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers. Was he a chancer who lived beyond his means and ruined his father and wife? He tended to fall out with former {{associates}} including Shelley's widow and Trelawney. His writings on Byron and Shelley are often imprecise. Shelley's fame grew throughout the 19th century and his legacy became an obsession for Medwin as for others in the Pisan circle. Medwin was opportunistic and disregarded the feelings of many former friends, but he remains {{the main source of}} information on Shelley's childhood. His Conversations of Lord Byron is now seen generally as vivid and essentially a true picture of the man.|$|E
25|$|A {{mental health}} care {{navigator}} is an individual who assists patients and families to find appropriate {{mental health care}}givers, facilities and services. Individuals who are care navigators are often also trained therapists and doctors. The need for mental health care navigators arises from the fragmentation of the mental health industry, which can often leave those in need with more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers. Care navigators work closely with patients through discussion and collaboration to provide information on options and referrals to healthcare professionals, facilities, and organizations specializing in the patients’ needs. The difference between other mental health professionals and a care navigator is that a care navigator provides information and directs a patient to the best help rather than offering diagnosis, prescription of medications or treatment.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Kenneth Nguyen from The Age commented [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist', {{is perhaps}} the most complex, confronting installment thus far of a series that prides itself on being complex and confronting." [...] The reporter went on to praise the [...] "expertly scripted" [...] reveal and thought Diane Ruggiero's [...] "command of the tightrope high-school milieu seems pretty much spot-on. It is Ruggiero's resolution of the mystery, however, that will keep fans talking. Like the best resolutions, I suppose, it raises more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answers." ...|$|E
5000|$|If a {{distribution}} network’s category performance ratio {{is greater than}} 1, then the outlets comprising that network perform comparatively better in selling the category in <b>question</b> <b>than</b> in selling other categories, relative to the market as a whole.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, young gentleman, {{you are in}} {{a better}} {{position}} to answer that <b>question</b> <b>than</b> I am," [...] replied the doctor, who knew of Anthony's cruel conduct to his mother and had reproached him with it, not once but on several occasions.|$|R
5|$|Thought {{processes}} are noncommutative: A person {{asked a question}} (A) and then a question (B) may give different answers to each <b>question</b> <b>than</b> a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.|$|R
500|$|Other {{critics were}} more mixed or {{negative}}, with many criticizing the negative reveal {{of the feminist}} Lilith House. Keith McDuffee of AOL TV thought that the episode raised more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered: such as [...] " [...] seem to accept that several rapes were faked, and then Veronica seems to just leave without that question being answered," [...] arguing that the abrupt ending to the scene constituted an out-of-character moment (she should have acted more negatively). In addition, he criticized Bell's performance, commenting [...] "Speaking of Veronica, she seemed like she was on something tonight. Just outright acting silly-odd, dancing around with some pretty lame jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} in Madrid, and Clarke's love of theatrics, raised awkward {{questions about his}} sexuality. His arrest was somewhat hushed up at the time, which may have raised more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it prevented. There {{is no indication that}} Clarke was homosexual. He was involved in two bad relationships with women. In 1922 he met a Slavic woman called Nina in Wiesbaden, but she disappeared after Clarke smuggled currency to her friend in Bulgaria. Then in the late 1920s a woman in Sussex, who [...] "meant everything in the world" [...] to him, refused an offer of marriage. He often claimed to hate children and never married. Despite this Clarke was known for having beautiful female acquaintances, to whom his friends referred as [...] "Dudley's Duchesses".|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{noted that}} the episode's {{creation}} [...] "was {{the culmination of a}} lot of ideas. Generally, when we pitch stories to the staff everyone comments on them, and Darin Morgan called this the kitchen sink episode, because it had so much in it, he didn't know how we would pull it off. But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered. The episode tried to make similar cliffhangers as the previous season finale, with revelations such as Mulder's father being part of the conspiracy and later killed to [...] "prove anything could happen in [...] The X-Files".|$|E
6000|$|... "Whoever it was, I hope {{we shall}} {{meet him at}} the Picnic!" [...] said Lady Muriel. [...] "It's a far more {{interesting}} <b>question</b> <b>than</b> 'Isn't this a picturesque ruin?' Aren't those autumn-tints lovely?' I shall have to answer those two questions ten times, at least, this afternoon!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] replied Roland, willing {{rather to}} evade this <b>question</b> <b>than</b> {{to answer it}} directly, for the {{prudence}} of being silent with respect to Lord Seyton's adventure immediately struck him, [...] "I have been in Edinburgh scarce an hour, and {{that for the first}} time in my life." ...|$|R
50|$|Eigenvector: Eigenvector {{centrality}} is {{a measure}} of the influence of a node in a network. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node in <b>question</b> <b>than</b> equal connections to low-scoring nodes.|$|R
500|$|American singer-songwriter Johnny Nash {{created a}} cover of [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] for his {{eleventh}} studio album, I Can See Clearly Now (1972). It was first used as the B-side to his previous single, [...] "There Are More <b>Questions</b> <b>Than</b> Answers", which was also released in 1972, and was produced by Nash. Rita Marley, Bob's wife, was upset that JAD Records lent the track for Nash to cover, as the label [...] "wanted to make a star out of Johnny Nash, not of Bob Marley". Additionally, Steve Sullivan (author of Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Volume 1) incorrectly claimed that Marley was commissioned to write [...] "Guava Jelly" [...] solely for Nash. However, Sullivan also writes {{that the success of}} Nash's version allotted Marley enough money to start his own record label, which he had always wanted to do. The label was eventually created and became known as Tuff Gong.|$|E
500|$|The {{discovery}} launched {{several new}} rounds of conjecture, and ultimately raised more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> it answered. Initial statements by investigators and scientific consultants were {{founded on the}} assumption that the bundled bills washed freely into the Columbia River from one of its many connecting tributaries. An Army Corps of Engineers hydrologist noted that the bills had disintegrated in a [...] "rounded" [...] fashion and were matted together, indicating that they had been deposited by river action, as opposed to having been deliberately buried. That conclusion, if correct, supported the opinion that Cooper had not landed near Lake Merwin nor any tributary of the Lewis River, which feeds into the Columbia well downstream from Tina Bar. It also lent credence to supplemental speculation (see Later developments above) that placed the drop zone near the Washougal River, which merges with the Columbia upstream from the discovery site.|$|E
500|$|... "Flesh and Stone" [...] has {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Daniel Martin gave the episode a positive review on The Guardian guardian.co.uk, {{saying that it}} [...] "can lay credible claim to being the greatest episode of Doctor Who there has ever been". He went on to declare: [...] "It's just ridiculously good— so much that there's scarcely any point in picking out moments because there was an iconic sequence every couple of seconds." [...] In particular he praised Father Octavian's death scene, noting how [...] "despair creeps over Matt Smith's face as he realises {{he is going to}} have to leave him to die; Octavian's final speech weeps with honour and elegance". IGN's Matt Wales gave the episode a 10 out of 10 rating, saying it was [...] "packed with huge, iconic moments" [...] and stated, [...] "by the end of it, we were left with more <b>questions</b> <b>than</b> answers and a far better sense of Moffat's meticulous planning".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--not very; oh yes, I'm well--" [...] She {{had begun}} {{to move forward with}} the last question, and he found himself walking with her. [...] "Did she--has Miss Swan come back with you?" [...] he asked, looking her in the eyes with more <b>question</b> <b>than</b> he had put into his words.|$|R
60|$|The {{author has}} often been asked {{if there were any}} {{foundation}} in real life for the delineation of the principal character in this book. He can give no clearer answer to the <b>question</b> <b>than</b> by laying before his readers a simple statement of the facts connected with its original publication.|$|R
60|$|No {{sooner had}} {{she asked herself}} the <b>question</b> <b>than</b> herself she {{answered}} it, and an icy hand seemed to close about her heart. It was Marius who was dead. They had lied to her. Marius's was the body they had borne to Condillac--those men in the livery of her stepson.|$|R
