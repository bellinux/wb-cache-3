We introduce a necessary and fair criterion for quantum error correction (QEC), which must be achieved in the development of these <b>quantum</b> <b>processors</b> before their sizes are sufficiently big to consider the well-known QEC threshold. We apply this criterion to benchmark the ongoing effort in implementing QEC with topological color codes using trapped-ion <b>quantum</b> <b>processors</b> and, more importantly, to guide the future hardware developments that shall be required in order to demonstrate beneficial QEC with small topological quantum codes. In doing so, we present a thorough description of a realistic trapped-ion toolbox for QEC, and a physically-motivated error model that goes beyond standard simplifications in the QEC literature. Our large-scale numerical analysis shows that two-species trapped-ion crystals in high-optical aperture segmented traps, with the improvements hereby described, are a very promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computation...|$|R

There has been growing interest in photonic implementations of <b>quantum</b> <b>processors</b> as they offer relatively long coherence lengths, precise state manipulation, and efficient measurement. In this thesis, we first present experimental techniques to generate on-chip, photonic <b>quantum</b> <b>processors</b> and then discuss protocols for fast and secure quantum communication. In particular, we describe how -to combine the outputs of multiple stochastic single-photon sources using a photonic integrated circuit to generate an efficient source of single photons. We then show designs for silicon-based <b>quantum</b> photonic <b>processors</b> that can be programmed to implement a large class of existing quantum algorithms {{and can lead to}} quicker testing of new algorithms than was previously possible. We will then present the integration of large numbers of high-efficiency, low-timing jitter single-photon detectors onto a silicon photonic integrated circuit. To conclude, we will present a quantum key distribution protocol that uses the robust temporal degree of freedom of entangled photons to enable fast, secure key exchange, as well as experimental results for implementing key distribution protocols using silicon photonic integrated circuits. by Jacob Mower.

40|$|Machine {{learning}} {{techniques have}} led to broad adoption of a statistical model of computing. The statistical distributions natively available on <b>quantum</b> <b>processors</b> are a superset of those available classically. Harnessing this attribute {{has the potential to}} accelerate or otherwise improve machine learning relative to purely classical performance. A key challenge toward that goal is learning to hybridize classical computing resources and traditional learning techniques with the emerging capabilities of general purpose <b>quantum</b> <b>processors.</b> Here, we demonstrate such hybridization by training a 19 -qubit gate model processor to solve a clustering problem, a foundational challenge in unsupervised learning. We use the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in conjunction with a gradient-free Bayesian optimization to train the quantum machine. This quantum/classical hybrid algorithm shows robustness to realistic noise, and we find evidence that classical optimization can be used to train around both coherent and incoherent imperfections.

40|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>processors</b> {{promise a}} {{paradigm}} shift in high-performance computing which needs to be assessed by accurate benchmarking measures. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for variational quantum algorithm (VQA), recently proposed as a heuristic algorithm for small-scale <b>quantum</b> <b>processors.</b> In VQA, a classical optimization algorithm guides the quantum dynamics of the processor to yield the best solution for a given problem. A complete assessment of scalability and competitiveness of VQA should take into account both the quality {{and the time of}} dynamics optimization. The method of optimal stopping, employed here, provides such an assessment by explicitly including time as a cost factor. Here we showcase this measure for benchmarking VQA as a solver for some quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. Moreover we show that a better choice for the cost function of the classical routine can significantly improve the performance of the VQA algorithm and even improving it's scaling properties.
