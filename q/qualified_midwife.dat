Despite the evidence that prequalifying IPE will modify attitudes and provide knowledge and skills for collaboration, this evidence tells us little about whether these new skills and attitudes can be applied and sustained in professional practice. The aim of this research project was to explore how midwifery students who participate in pre-qualification interprofessional education apply their learning to the context of professional practice, and what elements facilitate this application.

40|$|After {{completing}} a three year midwifery degree course at university newly qualified midwives {{are expected to}} function fully as autonomous and accountable practitioners. This interpretive phenomenological investigation explored the lived experiences of twelve participants throughout their first twelve months post registration. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews at three points in time: the point of registration, four and twelve months post registration. Analysis and interpretation of these data were achieved using van Manen's methodological structure combined with an interpretive phenomenological approach. The findings revealed two final interpretive themes that described the meaning of 'becoming a midwife'. These were 'Fairy tale midwifery: fact or fiction' and 'Submissive empowerment: {{between a rock and}} a hard place'. The first incorporated the two super-ordinate themes false promises and reality shock; the second incorporated four super-ordinate themes beyond competence, part of the club, self doubt and struggling. This study has contributed to existing knowledge by way of highlighting the 'crisis of reality shock' that these newly qualified midwives experience surrounding the change of responsibility upon qualification. When participants experience the 'real' world as a newly <b>qualified</b> <b>midwife,</b> they may have to undertake work that previously they did not want to do and could opt out of as a student. The newly qualified midwives did not perceive themselves to have autonomy and by virtue, responsibility. Lack of autonomy and the ability to undertake decisions can lead to high levels of anxiety in the newly <b>qualified</b> <b>midwife.</b> Despite this, they prefer to work on the delivery suite where they have instant access to support and advice compared to being on their own in what they perceive to be a chaotic community setting. It may be that transition is an emotional challenge and like birth, the reality is that preparation might help, but that the 'reality' can only be experienced.

Our findings show that individuals treated by qualified midwives at birth and in the first month of life have lower all-cause mortality between ages 15 and 39 and lower mortality from cardiovascular diseases and diabetes between ages 40 and 80, compared to individuals delivered by traditional midwives. The effects are larger for individuals originating from more affluent families.

During the first four postpartum days the LATCH Instrument was used to measure position and attachment of the baby on the breast; the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measured nipple pain, and tho Nipple Trauma Severity Index (NTSI) was developed to measure nipple trauma.

40|$|Objective: to {{determine}} whether postnatal 'hands off' care by midwives on positioning and attachment of the newborn baby improves breast-feeding duration. Design: mothers were randomised at the first postnatal feed to receive either care by a midwife trained in the experimental protocol or by a control midwife undertaking routine care. Setting: eight wards in four English Midlands hospitals. Participants: 370 primiparous mothers with term babies who intended to breast feed, and could sit {{out of bed to}} do so. Interventions: experimental protocol of verbal-only advice on positioning and attachment, delivered at the first postnatal ward feed compared with routine care by a <b>qualified</b> <b>midwife.</b> Main outcome measures: duration of breast feeding up to 17 weeks as assessed by diaries and interviews with mothers and protocol adherence from self-completed checklist by the midwife. The mothers' self-reported experience of care and support before, during and after delivery were assessed at 6 weeks, and feeding outcomes and employment status at 17 weeks. Findings: experimental group mothers more often held the baby across their lap and received 'hands off advice', but fewer babies in the experimental than control groups attached and fed: 59 (106 / 180) vs. 67 (118 / 175), p = 0. 1. No significant differences were found in the numbers of mothers breast feeding at 6 or 17 weeks in the experimental and control groups (stopped exclusive breast feeding: 76 (130 / 172) vs. 77 (126 / 163) at 6 weeks; 96 (167 / 174) vs. 96 (161 / 168) at 17 weeks; odds ratio 1. 02, 95 CI 0. 77 to 1. 22; p = 0. 8; stopped any breast feeding: 35 (61 / 172) vs. 32 (53 / 167) at 6 weeks; 63 (109 / 173) vs. 60 (101 / 167) at 17 weeks; odds ratio 1. 10, 0. 84 to 1. 45; p = 0. 5). There {{were no significant differences in}} the incidence of problems with breast feeding and care experienced by mothers before or during hospitalisation (other than at the first postnatal ward feed), nor after discharge home. Conclusions: no significant beneficial effect was found on breast-feeding duration of the verbal- only advice on positioning and attachment, perhaps because aspects of the intervention are already within routine UK practice. Other care practices at subsequent feeds may negate benefits of care at earlier feeds. 'Hands off' care at the first feed may be less important to subsequent feeding than achieving a first feed under supervision in the postnatal ward. Implications for practice: midwives can be trained in a 4 -hr workshop to achieve improved knowledge of 'hands off' positioning and attachment care, and these can be translated into clinical practice. Future studies should differentiate the elements of the care that are effective in achieving postnatal feeds, and apply this advice consistently at successive feeds...|$|E
