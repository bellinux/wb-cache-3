Lewis. The photoelectric effect was observed upon shining light of particular wavelengths on certain materials, such as metals, which caused electrons to be ejected from those materials only if the light <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> was greater than the work function of the metal's surface.|$|E

This prohibition against more than one electron occupying the same <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> state became known as the Pauli exclusion principle. The physical mechanism to explain the fourth parameter, which had two distinct possible values, was provided by the Dutch physicists Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck. [...] In 1925, they suggested that an electron, in addition to the angular momentum of its orbit, possesses an intrinsic angular momentum and magnetic dipole moment. This is analogous to the rotation of the Earth on its axis as it orbits the Sun. The intrinsic angular momentum became known as spin, and explained the previously mysterious splitting of spectral lines observed with a high-resolution spectrograph; this phenomenon is known as fine structure splitting.|$|E

Specifically, the error in the energies is small compared to the typical spacing of the <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> levels.

2500|$|The {{possibility}} of an [...] "island of stability" [...] was first proposed by Glenn T. Seaborg in the late 1960s. The hypothesis {{is based upon the}} nuclear shell model, which implies that the atomic nucleus is built up in [...] "shells" [...] {{in a manner similar to}} the structure of the much larger electron shells in atoms. In both cases, shells are just groups of <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> levels that are relatively close to each other. Energy levels from quantum states in two different shells will be separated by a relatively large energy gap, so when the number of neutrons and protons completely fills the energy levels of a given shell in the nucleus, the binding energy per nucleon will reach a local maximum and thus that particular configuration will have a longer lifetime than nearby nuclides that do not possess filled shells.|$|E
2500|$|Although the equipartition theorem makes {{accurate}} predictions {{in certain}} conditions, it is inaccurate when quantum effects are significant, {{such as at}} low temperatures. [...] When the thermal energy kBT is smaller than the <b>quantum</b> <b>energy</b> spacing in a particular degree of freedom, the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition. Such a degree of freedom {{is said to be}} [...] "frozen out" [...] when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing. For example, the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out, rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition. Such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new, more subtle, scientific model was required. Along with other evidence, equipartition's failure to model black-body radiation—also known as the ultraviolet catastrophe—led Max Planck to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object, which emit light, were quantized, a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory.|$|E
