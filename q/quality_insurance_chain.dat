Uloga je poslodavstva najznačajnija, što nije ništa novo i autor smatra da je važno neprekidno je naglašavati. Focusing on <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> {{is one of}} the way of {{permanent}} orientation to rationalization of working procedures in each firm. That makes real presumption for creating competitive advantage as strategic determinant. <b>Quality</b> <b>insurance</b> is not free of charge, but it is the cheapest if taking a long-term view. As a matter of fact <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> is multidimensional process which stresses, along to working procedures discipline, sociological influence which strategically contributes to harmonization of relations of employees in a firm. Thus <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> discreetly influences achievement of personal authority of each of the employees in relation to other employees.

With the advent of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), food safety, and identity preservation, this is even more challenging today.

In addition, {{there are a}} several approaches for mechanical design and further installation practice, as well for <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> activities. While American standards fully cover all related activities (ASCE M 79, AWWA M 11, AWWA C 206), there is luck of specific and consolidated support in European regulation. It seems that major welding <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> activities are covered by EN 12732 (which is a standard for gas supply systems) and by EN 10224 for base material (for steel water tubes). In addition, it seems that some major European companies, involved in penstock design and manufacture have been developed their own practices and regulations. Particularly, for designers it is of special concern, how to define appropriate methods and amount of non-destructive testing, especially while considering long (over 5 km) and large diameter penstocks (over 2, 5 m), as well as relatively high working pressures (over 10 barg). For such design condition, and in accordance to EN 12732, it is a quite reasonable to widen and straighten non-destructive testing, but consequently fabricators are facing significant fabrication costs. Therefore, this paper should outline some basic approaches and comparison of welding <b>quality</b> <b>insurance,</b> related to design and manufacture of welded steel penstocks, as well as suggestion for methods and amount of non-destructive testing related to design inputs...|$|R

The focuses of this research were: a) how the process of <b>quality</b> education <b>insurance</b> was applied; b) how the human resources were managed; c) what the products achieved; d) the obstacles in applying the management. This research used qualitative approach and applied observation as the main method in collecting data. It was also supported with interviews and documentation. Based on the approach, the subject of this research were: headmaster, teachers and staff, and heads of sections. The data were analyzed using qualitative analysis, which included data collection, data reduction, display of data, and conclusion. Research findings are: a) the preparation stages of quality {{management in}} MII Sambas consists of planning, organizing, supporting, supervising, advising, and evaluating. This stages were applied by buttom-up method; b) job description was made to support optimal performance of each position; c) education service was focused on the process; d) the position of leaders were based on performance rather than seniority; e) the salary received by teachers and staff refers to the system of civil servant salary; f) some achievements of this institution are: second rank of Healthy School Championship, third rank of national quality school, ISO 9001 sertificate in 2008 on management, and other sertificates as a qualified education institution from Religious Affairs Ministry. Besides the progress that have been achieved, there are still some differences in understanding wholistically the concept of <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> of education.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> in {{radiotherapy}} in {{the frame}} of highly complex technical process as Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) needs independent control of the delivered dose to the patient. Actually, up to now, most of the radiotherapy treatments rely only on computed dosimetry through a rather complicated series of linked simulation tool. This dosimetry approach requires also qualified treatment means based on cautious <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> procedures. However, erroneous parameters could be difficult to detect and systematical errors could happen leading to radiotherapy accidents. In this context, in vivo dosimetry has a critical role of final control of the delivered dose. As many beam incidences and ports are used for any photontherapy treatment, external control could be very tedious and time consuming. Therefore, innovations are needed for in vivo dosimetry to provide ergonomic and efficient tools for these controls. This paper presents a review of technologies and products {{that can be used for}} in vivo dosimetry. It proposes also a reflection on the concepts to develop future devices suitable for this purpose. The technical means with their physical principles are reviewed, the clinical experiences demonstrating the feasibility of new techniques are then summarized and finally, the early clinical use and its impact on clinical practice is review...|$|R

However, this has not been the case historically, and in the early 19th century it was recognized that some markets, such as those in Asia, preferred cheaper products to those of quality.Most discussions of quality refer to a finished part, wherever it is in the process. Inspection, which is what <b>quality</b> <b>insurance</b> usually means, is historical, since the work is done. The best way to think about quality is in process control.

The early studies can be classed to the direct application of advanced continuous control strategies, such as adaptive control and feed-forward control, to deal with the inherent process nonlinear and time-varying characteristics. These control strategies does not make use of the repetitive nature of batch process. Recently, two-dimensional (2 D) control strategy has been developed for batch processes control. It is an integration of iterative learning control and feed-back control to handle the repetitive uncertainty and non-repetitive uncertainty, respectively. Both simulation and experimental test results to injection molding, a typical batch process, have shown the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. © 2012 ICROS...|$|R
