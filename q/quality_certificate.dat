2500|$|A water <b>quality</b> <b>certificate</b> is a {{prerequisite}} for a twenty-year renewal by the NRC. On April 3, 2010, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ruled that Indian Point violates the federal Clean Water Act, because [...] "the power plant’s water-intake system kills nearly a billion aquatic organisms a year, including the shortnose sturgeon, an endangered species." [...] The state is demanding that Entergy constructs new closed-cycle cooling towers at a cost of over $1 billion, a decision that will effectively close the plant for nearly a year. Regulators denied Entergy's request to install fish screens that they said would improve fish mortality more than new cooling towers. Anti-nuclear groups and environmentalists have in the past tried to close the plant, which is in a more densely populated area than any of the 66 other nuclear plant sites in the US. Opposition to the plant increased after the September 2001 terror attacks, when one of the hijacked jets flew close to the plant {{on its way to the}} World Trade Center. Public worries also increased after the 2011 Japanese Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and after a report highlighting the Indian Point plant’s proximity to the Ramapo Fault.|$|E

40|$|Services suffer to a {{great extent}} from {{information}} asymmetries because their attributes are more difficult to grasp in advance. Within services, the tourism industry is an especially notable and interesting case. Akerlof [Akerlof, G. The market for 'lemons': Quality uncertainty and the market mechanism. Quarterly Journal of Economics 1970; 84 (3) : 488 - 500. ] suggests the applicability of information asymmetries and counteracting institutions to hotel chains. To reduce these asymmetries different strategies have been proposed. Among them, <b>quality</b> <b>certificates</b> have {{become one of the most}} popular tools. However, two questions arise: one, are <b>quality</b> <b>certificates</b> effective tools to reduce information asymmetries in the tourism industry, with its inherent uncertainty? and two, are all types of existing <b>quality</b> <b>certificates</b> equally effective? Thus, the objectives of this study include analyzing the market value variation of a hotel chain due to quality certification, and to test the effect by type of award. The method builds from the event study technique and regression analysis. The results show that the stock market reacts positively to certificates, thus implying that quality certification can be a useful tool for reducing information asymmetry; however, this positive reaction is not equal for all kinds of certificates, the ISO 9000 shows the highest impact.

Recently, German politics decided to make another big step forward backing up the role of Renewables (RE) in announcing the Renewable Heat Law (EEWG = Erneuerbare Energien Wärme Gesetz). The combination of standards and <b>quality</b> <b>certificates</b> together with this new law and policies, like the market incentive program, causes side effects. For the further development of innovative products and materials this may have strong influence. This is especially true, if innovative products are not covered by the recent standards and therefore {{do not have access to}} subsidies. A qualitative empirical study was carried out focusing on the technological decision makers. The aim was to analyze the structure of decisions regarding technological innovation under the boundary conditions of changing policies, diffe rent <b>quality</b> <b>certificates</b> and a fast growing market of solar thermal products...|$|R

5000|$|The last {{remaining}} FERC requirement {{for a new}} Alcoa Yadkin Project license is a Section 401 water <b>quality</b> <b>certificate,</b> and recent opposition to Alcoa's relicensing has centered around it. In November 2007, the NC Division of Water Quality (DWQ) issued APGI a Section 401 water <b>quality</b> <b>certificate</b> for the Yadkin Project. The certificate was later withdrawn due {{to the failure of}} DWQ to publish a required public notice. APGI reapplied for a water <b>quality</b> <b>certificate,</b> which DWQ issued on May 9, 2009. [...] In part, the certificate required APGI to make upgrades which would improve dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the dam releases. Some upgrades have been made at the Narrows dam, although the complete upgrade program won't be completed until after the issuance of a license. Stanly County filed a legal appeal of the certificate and a court granted a stay of its execution. [...] In October 2010, as hearings on the appeal took place, the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources reduced the amount of a surety bond required by the 401 water <b>quality</b> <b>certificate</b> from $240 million to $80 million, the amount APGI states will be required to make improvements required in the certificate.|$|E
