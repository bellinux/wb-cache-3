50|$|Although not {{observable}} in {{brittle materials}} (for instance glass at room temperature), shear bands or, more generally, ‘localized deformations’ usually develop within {{a broad range}} of ductile materials (alloys, metals, granular materials, plastics, polymers, and soils) and even in <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> (concrete, ice, rock, and some ceramics).The relevance of the shear banding phenomena is that they precede failure, since extreme deformations occurring within shear bands lead to intense damage and fracture. Therefore, the formation of shear bands {{is the key to the}} understanding of failure in ductile materials, a research topic of great importance for the design of new materials and for the exploiting of existing materials in extreme conditions. As a consequence, localization of deformation has been the focus of an intense research activity since the middle of the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Concrete may be {{referred}} to as a brittle material. This is because concrete's behaviour under loading is completely different from that of ductile materials like steel. But actually concrete differs from ideal brittle materials in many aspects. In modern fracture mechanics concrete is considered as a quasi-brittle material. <b>Quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> possess considerable hardness which is similar to ceramic hardness, so often it is called ceramic hardness. The reason for ceramic hardness can be explained on the basis of subcritical cracking that happens during loading of concrete. Subcritical cracking in concrete which precedes ultimate failure, results in nonlinear StressStrain response and Rcurve behaviour. So concrete obtains hardness from subcritical failure.Also concrete has a heterogeneous structure due to uneven composition of ingredients in it. This also complicates the analysis of concrete by producing misleading results.|$|E

Damage-induced anisotropy is one significant character of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> coupled with nonlinearity and strain softening.

These two kinds of components, orientational and volumetric ones, are abstracted based on pair-functional potentials and the Cauchy–Born rule. Moreover, macroscopic damage of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> can be reflected by stiffness changing of orientational components, which represent grouped atomic bonds along discrete directions.

40|$|The {{displacement}} field in <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>material</b> is localized into narrow fracture zones {{during the process}} of decohesion. The numerical modelling of the physically propagating displacement discontinuities is considered to be inherently difficult. In this paper, the introduction of continuous discontinuities into the finite element formulation is based on the extended finite element method (X-FEM). This paper extends the theory by further incorporating arbitrary discontinuities in the approximation and presenting numerical procedures to handle several fields of discontinuities. The discontinuous approximation is accomplished by usage of basis functions of very limited support; only non-zero in the elements containing the crack. Moreover, the introduction of discontinuities in a continuum is discussed and a robust numerical procedure is proposed. Further, the mechanical behaviour of cracks in a <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>material</b> largely governs the overall mechanical response of the material, and the implementation of a cohesive crack model based on anisotropic damage coupled to plasticity is emphasized. Numerical examples for both static and dynamic, transient, loading show that the proposed X-FEM format in combination with the cohesive crack model has a good performance and leads to an efficient implementation. Finally, the proposed forward method for propagation of cracks and introduction of new ones is robust and stable. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|International audienceComprehension and {{quantification}} of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> behavior requires complex experiments when {{focusing on}} cyclic or multi-axial loadings. As an alternative, virtual testing, {{which can be}} computed using lattice discrete elements models (LDEM), is particularly interesting. LDEM already provide a physical description of the <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> behavior, but further attention has {{to be paid to}} numerical integration. LDEM are explicitly integrated, such integration has been proven in the literature to be accurate when cracking is involved, by means of efficient schemes such as the ``Saw-tooth'' algorithm. In order to extend the range of application of LDEM to more complex loading paths, such as compressive or cyclic loadings, involving contact and friction mechanisms, qualitativeness as well as quantitativeness of explicit integration has to be assessed anew. We hereby propose an implicit quasi-static integration scheme for LDEM based on specific non-linearities encountered in <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials,</b> namely contact and fracture, to circumvent expected stability and accuracy issues. Efficiency of both schemes is investigated by means of simulations of a uniaxial cyclic test and a compression test...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of underground structures and transportation facilities under various external loadings and environments {{is critical for}} human safety as well as environmental protection. Since <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> such as concrete and rock are commonly used for underground construction, the constitutive modeling of these engineering materials, including post-limit behaviors, {{is one of the}} most important aspects in safety assessment. From experimental, theoretical, and computational points of view, this report considers the constitutive modeling of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> in general and concentrates on concrete in particular.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{experimental and}} numerical investigations on the fracture properties of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials,</b> including mortar, concrete and graphite. Fracture toughness {{in terms of}} the critical stress intensity factor K_IC and fracture energy G_F of the materials were determined through three-point bending tests on centre-notched beams. Furthermore, full-field displacement of the beams subjected to bend was obtained using Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) technique. In order to verify the accuracy of the displacement data measured using the ESPI technique and to obtain reliable deformation information, the displacement and strain errors induced by the rigid-body motions of the specimen were quantified. This study found that the displacement errors were negligible whereas the strain errors were notable and must be eliminated. The influence of different rigid-body motions was analyzed. It was found that the out-of-plane movement of the specimen was critical and affected considerably the accuracy of strain data. Thus the experimental setup was improved accordingly to eliminate the influence of critical rigid-body motions. <b>Quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> have a finite stress region near the crack tip, known as the fracture process zone (FPZ). The materials exhibit nonlinear fracture behaviour in the FPZ. The cohesive crack model (CCM) is widely used to characterize the nonlinear fracture behaviour of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials.</b> According to the CCM, all the nonlinear behaviours in the FPZ can be represented by a cohesive crack, and the crack propagation is controlled by the relationship between the cohesive stress and crack opening, namely, the tension softening curve (TSC). Thus an accurate estimation of the TSC is essential. In order to determine the TSC of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials,</b> an incremental displacement collocation method (IDCM) was originally developed in this study. In the IDCM, the deformation data measured by the ESPI sensor was analyzed to obtain the crack opening displacement (COD) of the notched specimens. The experimental COD profiles together with the CCM were then integrated into a finite element model to simulate the nonlinear fracture response of the specimen. By minimizing the difference between the computed and measured displacements at selected collocation points, the cohesive stress corresponding to certain crack opening was determined. The entire TSC was constructed in a step-by-step manner following the loading steps. The IDCM was first applied to estimate the TSC of mortar. By using the estimated TSC, the displacements of the specimen under certain loading levels were computed. By comparing the computed displacements with the experimental data, the reliability of the IDCM and the accuracy of the estimated TSC were verified. The application of the IDCM was further extended to the determination of the TSCs of concrete and graphite. The parameters used to define the shape of the TSC of the materials were determined using regression analysis. The applicability of those parameters was verified by comparing the TSCs estimated in the present study with those derived by other researchers. Recommendations were put forward to choose appropriate tensile properties of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> in the numerical simulations. Furthermore, by using the ESPI technique, fracture phenomena of <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> were observed and reported. Such records can greatly enhance the understanding of crack initiation, growth and arrest in <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials,</b> and lead to improvements to the existing fracture models. published_or_final_versionCivil EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|AbstractConditions for {{discontinuous}} bifurcation in {{limit states}} of selective non-local thermodynamically consistent gradient theory for <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> like concrete are evaluated {{by means of}} both geometrical and analytical procedures. This constitutive formulation includes two internal lengths, one related to the strain gradient field that considers the degradation of the continuum {{in the vicinity of}} the considered material point. The other characteristic length takes into account the material degradation in the form of energy release in the cracks during failure process evolution. The variation from ductile to brittle failure in <b>quasi-brittle</b> <b>materials</b> is accomplished by means of the pressure dependent formulation of both characteristic lengths as described by Vrech and Etse (2009). In this paper the formulation of the localization ellipse for constitutive theories based on gradient plasticity and fracture energy plasticity is proposed as well as the explicit solutions for brittle failure conditions in the form of discontinuous bifurcation. The geometrical, analytical and numerical analysis of discontinuous bifurcation condition in this paper are comparatively evaluated in different stress states and loading conditions.

The integral formulation of the problem employs the electrostatic fundamental solution and thus both surface and volume integrals due to inertia and inelasticity are created. Consequently the discrimination involves both the surface and the interior of the body.
