5|$|Thomas Aquinas {{argued that}} {{statements}} about God are analogous to human experience. An analogous term is partly univocal (has only one meaning) and partly equivocal (has {{more than one}} potential meaning) because an analogy {{is in some ways}} the same and in some ways different from the subject. He proposed that those godly qualities which resemble human <b>qualities</b> <b>are</b> described analogously, with reference to human terms; for example, when God is described as good, {{it does not mean that}} God is good in human terms, but that human goodness is used as a reference to describe God's goodness.|$|E
5|$|Looking at {{symbolism}} in religion, Stace {{states that}} {{there are two types of}} predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former <b>qualities</b> <b>are</b> justified by an appeal to a hierarchy of being, and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the numen and qualities found in the natural world.|$|E
5|$|In 1593 and 1594, {{when the}} theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare {{published}} two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion {{that result from}} uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in {{the first edition of}} the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine <b>qualities</b> <b>are</b> marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful turtle dove. In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.|$|E

5|$|As per Tulsidas, the Nirguna Brahman (quality-less impersonal absolute) and Saguna Brahman (personal God with <b>qualities)</b> <b>are</b> {{one and the}} same. Both, Saguna (qualified Brahman) and Aguna (or Nirguna - {{unqualified}} Brahman) are Akath (unspeakable), Agaadh (unfathomable), Anaadi (without beginning, {{in existence}} since eternity) and Anupa (without parallel) (अगुन सगुन दुइ ब्रह्म सरूपा। अकथ अगाध अनादि अनूपा॥). It is the devotion (Bhakti) of the devotee that forces the Nirguna Brahman which is quality-less, formless, invisible and unborn, to become Saguna Brahman with qualities. Tulsidas gives the example of water, snow and hail to explain this – the substance is the same in all three, but the same formless water solidifies to become hail or a mountain of snow – {{both of which have}} a form. Tulsidas also gives the simile of a lake – the Nirguna Brahman is like the lake with just water, while the Saguna Brahman is a lake resplendent with blooming lotuses. In the Uttar Kand of Ramcharitmanas, Tulsidas describes in detail a debate between Kakbhushundi and Lomasa about whether God is Nirguna (as argued by Lomasa adhering to monism) or Saguna (as argued by Kakbhushundi adhering to dualism). Kakbhushundi repeatedly refutes all the arguments of Lomasa, to the point when Lomasa becomes angry and curses Kakbhushundi to be a crow. Lomasa repents later when Kakbhushundi happily accepts the curse but refuses to give up the Bhakti of Rama, the Saguna Brahman. Though Tulsidas holds both aspects of God to be equal, he favours the qualified Saguna aspect and the devotees of the highest category in the Ramcharitmanas repeatedly ask for the qualified Saguna aspect of Rama to dwell in their mind. Some authors contend from a few couplets in Ramcharitmanas and Vinay Patrika that Tulsidas has vigorously contradicted the denial of Avatar by Kabir. In several of his works, Kabir had said that the actual Rama is not the son of Dasharatha. In the Balkand of Ramcharitmanas, Shiva tells Parvati – those who say that the Rama whom the Vedas sing of and whom the sages contemplate on is different from the Rama of Raghu's race are possessed by the devil of delusion and do not know the difference between truth and falsehood. However, such allusions are based on interpretations of the text and do not hold much water when considered in the context of Ramcharitmanas. Tulsidas, in none of his works, has ever mentioned Kabir.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{models of}} quality {{differentiation}} {{showed that the}} qualities, of differentiated products, were lowered below efficient levels. Recently, <b>qualities</b> <b>were</b> shown to be enhanced, not degraded, in some cases. This paper presents a complete characterization of quality choices under vertical product differentiation by incorporating and refining assumptions on consumer preferences and production technology. This paper shows {{that the decision to}} distort quality depends on where the firm's competition <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> located: <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> degraded below (enhanced above) the efficient level when the reservation (or competition) <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> lower (higher) than efficient <b>qualities</b> which <b>are</b> the levels of quality observed in a competitive market (i. e. where marginal willingness to pay equals marginal cost). If the reservation <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> between the two efficient <b>qualities,</b> there <b>is</b> no <b>quality</b> distortion. In competitive markets, the reservation <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> the <b>quality</b> of a substitute good offered by competitors, and thus <b>quality</b> distortion <b>is</b> always present if a multi-product firm competes only at the fringes of its product range. If the competition is in the middle, the firm loses any leverage to distort quality and increase profits. Introducing many levels of <b>quality</b> may <b>be</b> motivated by the desire to fill the gaps in the quality spectrum to maximize control over the quality space. This paper confirms the assertion that the quality distortion occurs at the quality level whose per unit profit margin is lower. However, the claim that a discriminating monopolist tends to enlarge the spectrum of <b>qualities</b> <b>is</b> shown to be valid only if we evaluate the firm's choices apart from the reservation quality or a substitute good. It is proved that the monopolist's quality choices always lie within th [...] ...|$|R
