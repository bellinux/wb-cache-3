25|$|Justice Brennan's opinion did {{not reach}} any of the <b>questions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>limitations</b> of {{sovereign}} immunity, or waiver thereof, that were considered by both the Court and the other dissents. Instead, Brennan argued that the Eleventh Amendment does not immunize states from being sued by their citizens at all. His position {{is that there is}} no question of what the purported immunity covers, or whether it can be waived, because there is no immunity. He notes that the Eleventh Amendment, by its language, only bars suits against a state by citizens of other states. This leaves common law sovereign immunity, which Brennan asserts was surrendered by the states at the time they agreed to join into the United States.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess user {{satisfaction}} with complete dentures made and delivered in 2010 {{by the public}} health care network of a city {{in the south of}} Santa Catarina. METHODS: This cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study used the Oral Health Impact Profile - 14 questionnaire to collect data. The questionnaire contains 14 <b>questions</b> <b>on</b> functional <b>limitation,</b> psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, physical pain, and disability. The survey was done in a city in the south of Santa Catarina. The participants were chosen randomly and kept anonymous. The sample consisted of 247 complete dentures made by the public health network of the city in 2010 for patients aged more than 50 years. RESULTS: Based on the social and psychological questions, the upper complete denture have a small effect on the patient's quality of life, while the lower complete denture causes stress, self-consciousness, physical pain, and mastication problems. Therefore, the most severe problems were caused by lower complete dentures. CONCLUSION: Denture follow-up protocols should be created to minimize the damages they cause to patients' health and to reduce treatment loss...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{transient}} nanometric domains known as lipid rafts has brought interest to reassess {{the validity of}} the Singer-Nicholson model of a fluid bilayer for cell membranes. However, this new view is still insufficient to explain the cellular control of surface lipid diversity or membrane deformability. During the past decade, the hypothesis that some lipids form large (submicrometric/mesoscale vs nanometric rafts) and stable (>min vs s) membrane domains has emerged, largely based on indirect methods. Morphological evidence for stable submicrometric lipid domains, well-accepted for artificial and highly specialized biological membranes, was further reported for a variety of living cells from prokaryotes to yeast and mammalian cells. However, results remained <b>questioned</b> based <b>on</b> <b>limitations</b> of available fluorescent tools, use of poor lipid fixatives, and imaging artifacts due to non-resolved membrane projections. In this review, we will discuss recent evidence generated using powerful and innovative approaches such as lipid-specific toxin fragments that support the existence of submicrometric domains. We will integrate documented mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of these domains, and provide a perspective on their relevance on membrane deformability and regulation of membrane protein distribution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While {{surveys in}} high-income {{countries}} show that women generally have poorer self-reported health than men, much less {{is known about}} gender differences in {{other regions of the}} world. Such data can be used to examine the determinants of sex differences. Methods We analysed data on respondents 18  years and over from the World Health Surveys 2002 – 04 in 59 countries, which included multiple measures of self-reported health, eight domains of functioning and presumptive diagnoses of chronic conditions. The age-standardized female excess fraction was computed for all indicators and analysed for five regional groups of countries. Multivariate regression models were used to examine the association between country gaps in self-reported health between the sexes with societal and other background characteristics. Results Women reported significantly poorer health than men on all self-reported health indicators. The excess fraction was 15  % for the health score based on the eight domains, 28  % for “poor” or “very poor” self-rated health <b>on</b> the single <b>question,</b> and 26  % for “severe” or “extreme” <b>on</b> a single <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>limitations.</b> The excess female reporting of poorer health occurred at all ages, but was smaller at ages 60 and over. The female excess was observed in all regions, and was smallest in the European high-income countries. Women more frequently reported problems in specific health domains, with the excess fraction ranging from 25  % for vision to 35  % for mobility, pain and sleep, and with considerable variation between regions. Angina, arthritis and depression had female excess fractions of 33, 32 and 42  % respectively. Higher female prevalence of the presumptive diagnoses was observed in all regional country groups. The main factors affecting the size of the gender gap in self-reported health were the female-male gaps in the prevalence of chronic conditions, especially arthritis and depression and gender characteristics of the society. Conclusions Large female-male differences in self-reported health and functioning, equivalent to a decade of growing older, consistently occurred in all regions of the world, irrespective of differences in mortality levels or societal factors. The multi-country study suggests that a mix of biological factors and societal gender inequalities are major contributing factors to gender gap in self-reported measures of health...|$|R
40|$|Self {{organization}} {{has long been}} a matter of immense interest and research in sociology, anthropology, physics and many other fields. Though the principles of self organization can be inducted from almost all walks of human, plant and animal lives (Charlotte K. Hemelrijk, 2002) it is most evident in ant and termites colonies. Self {{organization has}} been used to explain the formation of cities, software, brain cells and many natural phenomena in human societies. Though the principle is used to explain other phenomena, the concept itself is continuously evolving. Application of the theory into human affairs has been a less explored area. However, there has been some seminal works on understanding organisations through the idea of self-organisation. Seel (2001, 2003) is foremost amongst them. His work serves as the basic framework of this paper. Seel has identified many factors that are necessary conditions for building self-organised entities. However, Seel’s framework is incomplete, as the effect of physical environment on the formation and functioning of self organised teams has not been considered. This paper attempts to incorporate environmental effects on self-organizing teams. The paper also raises <b>questions</b> <b>on</b> the <b>limitation</b> regarding lack o...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn-line {{holography}} is a 3 D {{imaging technique}} {{which has been}} used for many years, especially in experimental fluid mechanics for the 3 D localization and sizing of micro-particles from the acquisition of a single 2 D image (hologram). This technique is easily usable in an industrial environment thanks to its simple setup. We have recently presented an algorithm of hologram analysis based on an ``inverse problem'' approach. This method find the best model which can explain the hologram and this is realized iteratively by removing at each step the contribution of the detected particle. This method can overcome some limitations of classical approach: like the enlargement of the accessible studied field. Nevertheless, some <b>questions</b> remain <b>on</b> the <b>limitations</b> of the method. We propose in this paper an analysis of the evolution of the signal to noise ratio to clarify the limitations like the size of the studied field, the effect of the cleaning of already detected particles during the process and the influence of the noise generated by the other particles...|$|R
40|$|Though {{there has}} been some debate over the {{practical}} efficacy of using binary lotteries for controlling risk preferences in experimental environments, the question of its theoretical validity within the contexts it is often used, namely multi-stage multi-agent settings, has not been addressed. Whilst the original proof of its validity featured a single-agent single-stage context, its practical use has seen a wide range of implementations. Practitioners have implicitly assumed that whenever the setting and form of implementation they have chosen deviates from the original single-agent single-period proof, it remains theoretically valid. There has been virtually no debate in the practitioner literature on the theoretical validity of binary lotteries in a more general context, or on whether the form of implementation matters. The current article addresses these <b>questions,</b> establishes <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> validity and suggests some design principles for future implementation of binary lotteries for the purpose of controlling risk preferences...|$|R
40|$|Among {{its many}} advantages, the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) {{includes}} several <b>questions</b> <b>on</b> health, functional <b>limitations,</b> employment, {{and participation in}} federal disability and other cash and in-kind assistance programs. It has therefore become the basis for several recent studies {{of people with disabilities}} that have focused, for example, on employment trends, changes in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and program participation (Burkhauser, Houtenville, and Wittenburg 2003; Kruse and Schur 2003; Hotchkiss 2003; Acemoglu and Angrist 2001; McNeil 2000; DeLeire 2000). This paper discusses the utility of the SIPP in disability analyses, including a summary of descriptive statistics on people with disabilities from multiple SIPP panels, including the most recent SIPP panel (2001). It is part of a series of papers for the Cornell Statistics Rehabilitation Research and Training Center (Cornell Stats RRTC). The findings provide insights into the various health, employment, income, and program participation outcomes that may be associated with different definitions of disability and illustrates the potential for using SIPP data in further disability analyses. Similar to the findings in the other user guide papers, our descriptive findings highlight the differences in the demographic composition and outcomes across disability definitions, underscoring the importance of carefully selecting an appropriate disability conceptualization in generating disability statistics...|$|R

Therefore, the censuses which {{have in the past}} collected data on health (such as the UK, Belgium, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) restrict the <b>questions</b> <b>on</b> health to a very small number, mainly focused on disability. For example, the Belgian 2001 census contained seven <b>questions,</b> one <b>on</b> subjective health, three on disability due to chronic disease and three on informal care for the disabled. On a worldwide basis, an effort has been made since 2001 to collect internationally comparable disability data through the UN’s Washington Group on Disability Statistics.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} if {{the happy}} life expectancy in older adults differs according to sex and functional limitations. METHODS Life expectancy was estimated by Chiang method, and happy life expectancy was estimated by Sullivan method, combining mortality data with {{the prevalence of}} happiness. The <b>questions</b> <b>on</b> happiness and <b>limitations</b> came from a health survey, which interviewed 1, 514 non-institutionalized older adults {{living in the city}} of Campinas, SP, Southeastern Brazil. The happy life expectancy was estimated by sex, age, and functional <b>limitations.</b> Based <b>on</b> the variance and standard error of the happy life expectancy, we estimated 95 % confidence intervals, which allowed us to compare the statistical differences of the number of happy years lived among men and women. RESULTS Differences by sex in happy life expectancy were significant at ages 60, 65, and 70. In absolute terms, women live more years happily. But, in relative terms, older men could expect to live proportionally more years with happiness. Happy life expectancy decreased significantly with increasing age in both men and women. Among older people living without functional limitation, differences by sex were statistically significant in all age groups, except at age 80. In the group with limitations, no significant differences by sex were found. Significant differences between the group without and with functional limitations were seen in both men and women. CONCLUSIONS Older men could expect to live a greater proportion of their lives happily in comparison to same-aged women, but women show more years with happiness than men. Functional limitations {{have a significant impact on}} happy life expectancy for both sexes...|$|R

40|$|Background: In Zimbabwe, {{a recent}} {{increase}} in the volume of research on recurrent non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) has revealed that adolescents are commonly affected. This is alarming to health professionals and parents and calls for serious primary preventative strategies to be developed and implemented forthwith. Early identification initiatives should be prioritised in order to curtail the condition and its progression. In an attempt to be proactive in minimising the prevalence of recurrent NSLBP, {{this study was conducted}} to evaluate the content validity and test-retest reliability of a survey questionnaire with the aim of proffering a valid and reliable questionnaire which can be used in non-clinical settings to identify adolescents with recurrent NSLBP in Harare, Zimbabwe and determine the possible factors associated with the condition. Methods: The study was conducted in two parts. The first part assessed content validity of the questionnaire using four experts derived from academia and clinical practice. The second part evaluated the reliability of the questionnaire among 125 high school-children aged between 13 and 19 years in a test-retest study. Results: Twenty-six (26) out of thirty questions in the questionnaire had an Item Content Validity index of 1. 00, demonstrating complete agreement among content experts. Overall, the Scale Content Validity Index for the questionnaire was 0. 97. Item completion for the reliability study was satisfactory. The questionnaire items had kappa values ranging from 0. 17 (slight agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). High levels of reliability were found for the <b>questions</b> <b>on</b> school bag use (k= 0. 94), sports participation (k= 0. 97), and lifetime prevalence (k= 0. 89). Conclusion: Excellent content validity and slight to perfect test-retest reliability was found for the Low Back Pain (LBP) questionnaire. These results are comparable to findings of other studies evaluating the psychometric properties of LBP questionnaires. Cognisant of the limitations of the study, {{the results of this study}} suggest that the LBP questionnaire could be used in local studies investigating LBP among adolescents although <b>questions</b> enquiring <b>on</b> functional <b>limitations</b> and sciatica may need further consideration...|$|R
