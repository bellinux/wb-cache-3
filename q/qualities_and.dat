40|$|Introduction Both <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> {{sustainability}} {{are frequently}} used and positively loaded words. On the overall level most people {{agree that we}} should both have <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability in the processes we are working with. Logically there should be synergies in improving <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability but there could also be conflicts. When assessing how well our processes are performing, it becomes more complicated to find a consensus since there are many and partly conflicting views and definitions on what <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability mean. What we cannot measure, we cannot improve and what we cannot define we cannot measure.   Purpose This paper reviews definitions for <b>quality,</b> sustainability <b>and</b> sustainable development {{with the purpose of}} highlighting synergies. Definitions and measurement principles combing <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability are proposed. Methodology/Approach <b>Quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability are discussed and some working definitions are proposed. Garvin’s (1984) five approaches to define quality are applied on the working definitions for <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability. The approaches are reviewed and exemplified with some products to test the feasibility of the approach. The development of <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability is studied based on a chosen change process. The resulting categorisation of quality, sustainability, quality development, sustainability development and sustainability development are reviewed for identifying synergies.   Findings Findings indicate that there are more of synergies than differences and {{that it is possible to}} define an operational definition combining <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability that can be used for assessing and improving performance. Implications The results provide help for an operationalization of combined <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability performance. Originality/Value of paper The paper proposes a practical interpretation of how to work with <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> sustainability development...|$|R

5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in the shade.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Macedonian painted artwork {{includes}} frescoes and murals, {{but also}} decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still {{exist on the}} bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these subjects are at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.|$|E
