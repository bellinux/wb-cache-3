40|$|Abstract–Rivers shape landscapes by {{responding}} {{to a range of}} external forces including climate and climate change. This paper examines the general role that <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climates</b> play in river channel form and process and how rivers in New Mexico have responded specifically to Pleistocene and Holocene climatic changes. The impact of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climates</b> on New Mexican streams is cast in the context of how channel form and process has evolved through the Phanerozoic and in light of a large and growing data set for measurable changes in channel form and watershed hydrology over human time scales. Changes in channel form and process are commonly equivocal; there is no single unique response that follows from a given change in climate. Nevertheless, geomorphologists have developed process-response models that limit the range of expected responses and help guide an interpretation of how <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climates</b> ultimately have shaped the New Mexican landscape. Long-term landscape evolution trends like the rate of valley incision and human-scale trends like the arroyo incision-aggradation cycle are discussed in the context of <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climates.</b> The general conclusion is that climate change through the Quaternary has had a major impact on pacing the rate of valley incision and defining the geomorphic thresholds that control arroyo incision, but that other factors, including tectonics and humans, also contribute. Climate and climate change remains, however, {{the most important factor in}} river form and process over Quaternary time scales...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} latest details from an {{on-going}} {{investigation of the}} Early Pleistocene buried river terrace sequence of the Gediz River ∼ 40  km upstream of the Alaşehir graben in the Kula volcanic province, Western Turkey. Using clast lithology to characterise sediment provenance, we demonstrate that the buried Early Pleistocene terrace sequence of the palaeo-Gediz is overlain by the deposits of two carbonate-rich, northerly-derived, tributary systems. The surface form of these carbonate-rich deposits suggests deposition on alluvial fans, an interpretation supported by limited palaeocurrent data and upwards-coarsening sequences, suggesting fan progradation. It is argued that the formation and preservation of the palaeo-Gediz terrace sequence is intimately related to fan deposition, fan head entrenchment and fan progradation. Terrace formation {{is the result of}} incision in the main Gediz valley, a response to long-term uplift, during periods of lower sediment supply. Under low sediment supply conditions inferred fan head entrenchment is associated with fan toe progradation. This progradation would have led to the burial of the newly formed terrace of the Gediz. Subsequent higher sediment supply conditions would have led to renewed fan deposition. The direct coupling of the fan system with the main Gediz River during these periods would also result in deposition within the trunk river. The primary control of sediment supply is considered here to reflect changing vegetation cover, a function of changing <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climates.</b> These inferred controls suggest that the Gediz Early Pleistocene terrace sequence is an uplift-driven, climate-controlled system...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1983 <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climates</b> of the Middle East were {{investigated}} by reevaluating previous data and by analyzing pollen in radiocarbon-dated sediments. For comparison, assemblages of modern pollen {{were obtained from}} desert regions. Chenopodiaceae and Plantago pollen is high in surface samples from Kuwait and S. Iraq. In Jordan pollen of herbaceous dicots is more important probably due to warmer winters which allow growth during the rainy season. In the Rub'al-Khali of Saudi Arabia assemblages are most often dominated by the pollen of Calligonum or Cyperus conglomeratus, characteristic sand-dune plants. In each region low Gramineae pollen reflects the inability of most Gramineae to thrive in regions of severe summer drought. Artemisia, which requires higher precipitation, is also unrepresented. Ecology of the modern vegetation {{was used to assess}} pollen fluctuations since 25, 000 B. P. The ratio of Chenopodiaceae to Artemisia pollen (C/A) was used to identify moisture trends. Similar C/A curves of pollen diagrams suggest that moisture trends were regional 25, 000 to 9000 B. P. with a moist glacial period followed by strong fluctuations after 16, 000 B. P. The forest trees of each subregion are shown to be adapted to different climates, explaining their differing responses to similar climatic changes. In the north, glacial-period tree growth was probably curtailed by lack of summer precipitation, while in Iran heavy snow may have been responsible. After 16, 000 - 14, 000 B. P. aridity would have become a factor, preventing the spread of forests at most sites until after 9000 B. P., when summer precipitation apparently was initiated. Peat deposits which formed about 8000 B. P. in the northern Arabo-Persian Gulf region were high in Gramineae and low in Chenopodiaceae pollen, indicating summer precipitation. Lacustrine sediments of similar age from the Rub'al-Khali, dominated by Chenopodiaceae but relatively high in Gramineae, also indicate summer precipitation. Long-distance pollen types in Pleistocene sediments of the Rub'al-Khali suggest strengthened northwesterly winds during that time...|$|R

Nevertheless there are no valuable evidences of glacial erosion, even in high Libanon where the snow cover was permanent, and large landslides have been, and are up to now, active on the slopes, in relationship with lithology faults, humidity.

50|$|After {{this period}} of filling in, came a period of {{isostatic}} deepening. The weight of the recent deposits bore down on the sediments below, {{at the same time}} as erosion decreased and the mountains began to grow. At the same time, the drainage basin that had basically been an inland sea began to pour out its waters through the River Genil and the Infiernos de Loja. The river and its tributaries were carved out, and after the <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climate</b> crisis, river terraces formed. The River Genil has two well-defined terraces. The deepening of the Depression of Granada at the foot of the Sierra Nevada led to the formation of a flooded area between Santa Fe and Granada. The Quaternary also produced a diapiric uprising of a mass of gypsum clay to the height of the town of Láchar, which made area from Láchar to Granada more easily flooded, and broke the original depression into two units the Depression of Granada and the Pasillo or Depression of Loja.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{strontium}} and neodymium {{isotopic signature}} of aeolian mineral particles archived in polar ice cores provides {{constraints on the}} geographic provenance of dust and paleo-atmospheric circulation patterns. Data from different ice cores drilled in {{the centre of the}} East Antarctic plateau such as EPICA-Dome C (EDC, 75 060 S; 123 210 E) and Vostok (78 280 S, 106 480 E) suggested a uniform geographic provenance for dust during Pleistocene glacial ages, likely from southern South America (SSA). In this work the existing dust isotopic data from EDC have been integrated with new data from Marine Isotopic Stage (MIS) 14 (about 536 ka before 1950 AD) and in parallel some first results are shown for the new TALDICE ice core which was drilled {{on the edge of the}} East Antarctic Plateau (Talos Dome, 72 480 S, 159 060 E) on the opposite side with respect to SSA. Interestingly, the isotopic composition of TALDICE glacial dust is remarkably similar to that obtained from glacial dust from sites located in the East Antarctic interior. Overall, the glacial dust isotopic field obtained from six East Antarctic ice cores matches well South American data obtained from target areas. In this respect, it was recently suggested that dust exported long-range from South America originates from Patagonia and from the Puna-Altiplano plateau. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the isotopic composition of dust from an ice core drilled on the Illimani glacier (Bolivia, 16 370 S, 67 460 W; 6350 m a. s. l.) in order to obtain information on the isotopic composition of regional mineral aerosol uplifted from the Altiplano area and likely transported over a long distance. Altogether, ice core and source data strongly suggest that the westerly circulation pattern allowed efficient transfer of dust from South America to the East Antarctic plateau under cold <b>Quaternary</b> <b>climates.</b> Isotopic data support the hypothesis of a possible mixing of dust from Patagonia and from the Puna-Altiplano plateau. Interestingly, high glacial dust inputs to Antarctica are characterized by less radiogenic Nd values, an issue suggesting that enhanced dust production in Patagonia was associated with the activation of a secondary source. Still, Patagonia was the most important supplier for dust to central East Antarctica during Quaternary glaciation...|$|R

50|$|During the <b>Quaternary,</b> global <b>climate</b> {{experienced}} a recurring pattern of ice-sheet growth and decay. The length of Late Quaternary cycles varied between 80,000 and 120,000 years, {{with an average}} recurrence interval of about 100,000 years. The typical Late Quaternary glacial cycle was asymmetric having a long cooling interval that was characterized by an oscillating buildup of ice sheets to maximum volume. The long cooling interval was then followed by a relatively short warming period. During this warming period, called a termination, huge Northern hemisphere ice sheets melted away; sea level rose about 120 m; and interglacial climate emerged across the planet in a few thousand years. In case of the termination of the last glacial cycle, the retreat of continental ice sheets in the Northern hemisphere began about 20,000 calendar years ago. By about 7,000 calendar years ago, a small ice cap on Baffin Island {{was all that was}} left of the great Laurentide Ice Sheet that had once covered northern North America.

40|$|A strong oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ) {{currently}} exists {{along the}} California margin {{because of a}} combination of high surface-water productivity and poor intermediate-water ventilation. However, the strength of this OMZ may have been sensitive to late Quaternary ocean-circulation and productivity changes along the margin. Although sediment-lamination strength has been used to trace ocean-oxygenation changes in the past, oxygen levels on the open margin are not sufficiently low for laminations to form. In these regions, benthic foraminifera are highly sensitive monitors of OMZ strength, and their fossil assemblages can be used to reconstruct past fluctuations.
