Even after his 1839 retirement, Eckfeldt {{continued}} {{to perform the duties}} of chief coiner; his death in 1852 caused his replacement, Franklin Peale, to seek an assistant.|$|E

5|$|Borah {{considered}} challenging Hoover for renomination in 1932, but {{concluded the}} president's {{control over the}} party machinery, especially in the South, could not be overcome. Borah disagreed with the platform of the 1932 Republican National Convention over Prohibition; after the party passed a vague compromise plank and renominated Hoover, Borah made a major address on June 30, gaining nationwide attention by attacking his party's platform for forty minutes. Between then and November, he rarely mentioned Hoover's name publicly, though he said late in the campaign that he would vote for the president. He made speeches discussing issues, not candidates, and did nothing to aid Hoover's doomed campaign against Franklin D. Roosevelt. When some Idahoans demanded that he support Hoover on pain of being opposed for renomination for Senate in 1936, Borah responded that he regretted if his <b>quarter</b> <b>century</b> in the Senate had left them with the impression he might be moved by such an ultimatum.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} on 30 November 1976 {{he continued to}} work, both at the Museum and at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, where his home at 17 High Park Road, Kew Gardens, Richmond (see image), gave him access to the herbarium and library, a short bicycle trip away. Indeed, 35% of his total publications appeared in the <b>quarter</b> <b>century</b> of {{his retirement}}. He was commissioned to write {{a history of the}} Museum for its centenary (1981), although he did so with some difficulty, due to deadlines and budget constraints. The task, which took three years, was made more difficult for him by the Museum's decision to censor his critical comments. He continued his association with the Lindley Library all his life, being an active committee member and regularly attended RHS flower shows even after he was barely able to walk.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{writes that}} McKinley's low rating is undeserved, {{and that he}} should be ranked just after the great presidents such as Washington and Lincoln. He pointed to McKinley's success at {{building}} an electoral coalition that kept the Republicans mostly in power for a generation. Phillips believes that part of McKinley's legacy is the men he included in his administration, who dominated the Republican Party for a <b>quarter</b> <b>century</b> after his death. These officials included Cortelyou, who served in three Cabinet positions under Roosevelt, and Dawes, who became vice president under Coolidge. Other McKinley appointees who later became major figures include Day, who Roosevelt elevated to the Supreme Court where he remained nearly twenty years, and William Howard Taft, whom McKinley had made Governor-General of the Philippines and who succeeded Roosevelt as president.|$|E

5|$|The {{silver dollar}} {{had never been}} a popular coin, {{circulating}} little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The Peace dollar, the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the <b>quarter</b> <b>century</b> after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of silver certificates. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.|$|E
