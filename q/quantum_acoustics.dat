40|$|The {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} quantum devices incorporating mechanical resonators {{has opened up}} new frontiers {{in the study of}} quantum mechanics at a macroscopic level. It has recently been shown that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can be piezoelectrically coupled to superconducting qubits, and confined in high-quality Fabry-Perot cavities in the quantum regime. Here we present measurements of a device in which a superconducting qubit is coupled to a SAW cavity, realising a surface acoustic version of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We use measurements of the AC Stark shift between the two systems to determine the coupling strength, which is in agreement with a theoretical model. This quantum acoustodynamics architecture may be used to develop new <b>quantum</b> <b>acoustic</b> devices in which quantum information is stored in trapped on-chip acoustic wavepackets, and manipulated in ways that are impossible with purely electromagnetic signals, due to the 105 times slower mechanical waves.

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} <b>quantum</b> <b>acoustics</b> explores interactions between acoustic waves and artificial atoms and their applications in quantum information processing. In this experimental study, we demonstrate the coupling between a {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) and an electron spin in diamond {{by taking advantage of}} the strong strain coupling of the excited states of a nitrogen vacancy center while avoiding the short lifetime of these states. The SAW-spin coupling takes place through a Λ-type three-level system where two ground spin states couple to a common excited state through a phonon-assisted as well as a direct dipole optical transition. Both coherent population trapping and optically driven spin transitions have been realized. The coherent population trapping demonstrates the coupling between a SAW and an electron spin coherence through a dark state. The optically driven spin transitions, which resemble the sideband transitions in a trapped-ion system, can enable the quantum control of both spin and mechanical degrees of freedom and potentially a trapped-ion-like solid-state system for applications in quantum computing.

40|$|This paper aims at {{identifying}} and analyzing {{the influence of}} high-frequency, high-intensity ultrasonic radiation at the interface between immiscible (different types of oils and aqueous solutions) and miscible (different types of oil and solvent) fluids. An extensive set of Hele-Shaw type experiments were performed for several viscosity ratios, and interfacial tension. Fractal analysis techniques were applied to quantify the degree of fingering and branching. This provided a rough assessment {{of the degree of}} perturbation generated at the interface when the capillary forces along with the viscous forces are effective. Miscible Hele-Shaw experiments were also presented to isolate the effect of viscous forces. We found that ultrasound acts to stabilize the interfacial front, and that such effect is most pronounced at low viscosity ratios.

40|$|Surface phonon {{cavities}} {{that are}} homogenous in both mechanical and dielectric properties are reported. The cavities are {{formed by the}} placement of a defect of a single domain within periodic domain inversion of single crystal piezoelectric lithium niobate that exhibits surface phononic bandgap through the phonon-polariton coupling. Surface cavity resonances are observed within the bandgap, which manifest in entrapment of phonon-polariton within the defect. In addition to demonstrating that the observed resonances are non-radiative and decoupled to bulk radiation, which is critical for high Q cavities, it is also shown the possibility to tune the surface cavity resonance spectra simply by varying the defect width. Such an ability to excite surface cavity resonance that is non-radiative with simultaneous localization of the electric field together with {{the advantage of a}} cavity that is physically formed from a completely monolithic and uniform material offers unique opportunities for widespread applications for example in actuation, detection, and phonon lasing that can be fully integrated with other physical systems such as <b>quantum</b> <b>acoustics,</b> photonics, and microfluidics...|$|E
40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can interact with superconducting qubits at the quantum level. SAW resonators in the GHz frequency range have also {{been found to have}} low loss at temperatures compatible with superconducting quantum circuits. These advances open up new possibilities to use the phonon degree of freedom to carry quantum information. In this paper, we give a description of the basic SAW components needed to develop quantum circuits, where propagating or localized SAW-phonons are used both to study basic physics and to manipulate quantum information. Using phonons instead of photons offers new possibilities which make these <b>quantum</b> <b>acoustic</b> circuits very interesting.

Superconducting microwave circuits have proven to be a powerful platform for the realisation of such quantum devices, both in cavity optomechanics$^{ 3, 4 }$, and circuit quantum electro-dynamics (QED) $^{ 5, 6 }$. While most experiments to date have involved localised nanomechanical resonators, it has recently been shown that propagating surface acoustic waves (SAWs) can be piezoelectrically coupled to superconducting qubits$^{ 7, 8 }$, and confined in high-quality Fabry-Perot cavities up to microwave frequencies in the quantum regime$^{ 9 }$, indicating the possibility of realising coherent exchange of quantum information between the two systems.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{acoustics}} is of immense industrial and scientific importance.

40|$|Controlling and {{manipulating}} <b>quanta</b> of coherent <b>acoustic</b> vibrations - phonons - in {{integrated circuits}} has recently drawn {{a lot of}} attention, since phonons can function as unique links between radiofrequency and optical signals, allow access to quantum regimes and offer advanced signal processing capabilities. Recent approaches based on optomechanical resonators have achieved impressive quality factors allowing for storage of optical signals. However, so far these techniques have been limited in bandwidth and are incompatible with multi-wavelength operation. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a coherent buffer in an integrated planar optical waveguide by transferring the optical information coherently to an acoustic hypersound wave. Optical information is extracted using the reverse process. These hypersound phonons have similar wavelengths as the optical photons but travel at 5 -orders of magnitude lower velocity.

40|$|Using {{the action}} {{principle}} we first review how linear density perturbations (sound waves) in an Eulerian fluid obey a relativistic equation: the d'Alembert equation. This analogy between propagation {{of sound and}} that of a massless scalar field in a Lorentzian metric also applies to non-homogeneous flows. In these cases, sound waves effectively propagate in a curved four-dimensional ''acoustic'' metric whose properties {{are determined by the}} flow. Using this analogy, we consider regular flows which become supersonic, and show that the acoustic metric behaves like that of a black hole. The analogy is so good that, when considering <b>quantum</b> mechanics, <b>acoustic</b> black holes should produce a thermal flux of Hawking phonons. We then focus on two interesting questions related to Hawking radiation which are not fully understood in the context of gravitational black holes {{due to the lack of}} a theory of quantum gravity. The first concerns the calculation of the modifications of Hawking radiation which are induced by dispersive effects at short distances, i. e., approaching the atomic scale when considering sound. We generalize existing treatments and calculate the modifications caused by the propagation near the black hole horizon. The second question concerns backreaction effects. We return to the Eulerian action, compute second order effects, and show that the backreaction of sound waves on the fluid's flow can be expressed in terms of their stress-energy tensor. Using this result in the context of Hawking radiation, we compute the secular effect on the background flow. Comment: 60 pages, 6 figures. Review submitted to "La Rivista del Nuovo Cimento...|$|R
40|$|Common intuition {{in physics}} {{is based on}} the concept of {{orthogonal}} eigenmodes. Those are well de- fined solutions of Hermitian equations used to describe many physical situations, from <b>quantum</b> mechanics to <b>acoustics.</b> A large variety of non-Hermitian problems, including gravitational waves close to black holes or leaky electromagnetic cavities require the use of bi-orthogonal eigenbasis. Physical consequences of non-Hermiticity challenge our physical understanding. However, the usual need to compensate for energy losses made the few successful attempts to probe non-Hermiticity extremely complicated. We show that this issue can be overcome considering localized plasmonic systems. Indeed, since the non-Hermiticity in these systems does not stem from from temporal invariance breaking but from spatial symmetry breaking, its consequences can be observed more easily. We report on the theoretical and experimental evidence of non-Hermiticity induced strong coupling between surface plasmon modes of different orders within silver nano-crosses. The sym- metry conditions for triggering this counter-intuitive self-hybridization phenomenon are provided. Similarly, observable effects are expected to be observed in any system subtending bi-orthogonal eigenmodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of exit times is computed for a Brownian particle in spherically symmetric two- dimensional domains (disks, angular sectors, annuli) and in rectangles that contain an exit on their boundary. The governing partial differential equation of Helmholtz type with mixed Dirichlet- Neumann boundary conditions is solved analytically. We propose both an exact solution {{relying on a}} matrix inversion, and an approximate explicit solution. The approximate solution is shown to be exact for an exit of vanishing size and to be accurate even for large exits. For angular sectors, we also derive exact explicit formulas for the moments of the exit time. For annuli and rectangles, the approximate expression of the mean exit time is shown to be very accurate even for large exits. The analysis is also extended to biased diffusion. Since the Helmholtz equation with mixed boundary conditions is encountered in microfluidics, heat propagation, <b>quantum</b> billiards, and <b>acoustics,</b> the developed method can find numerous applications beyond exit processes.
