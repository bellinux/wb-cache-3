40|$|This {{analysis}} {{assesses the}} amendment to Norway’s Companies Act, {{in light of}} the 10 -year anniversary of the mandate of female representation on corporate boards. First, I discuss the implementation of the <b>quota,</b> <b>Section</b> 6 - 11 a. Second, I compare three statistical studies that analyze the effects of the quota on corporate profitability, overall firm performance, and the changing dynamics of the managerial positions. Finally, I evaluate the various avenues to fully achieving diversity, such as the successes and failures of a quota-type system and possible initiatives that governments and companies can enact to achieve gender-balance in the workplace. While some hypothesize that the quota negatively affects overall firm capability and value, the statistical data on the effects of the legislation is not dispositive. Ultimately, it {{is in the best interest}} of corporations to learn from Norway’s example in implementing mandatory female representation, and to explore other avenues to achieving diversity...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{consider}} a range of consumer-oriented subsidy instruments, including general subsidies, and tax exemptions as well as targeted <b>quotas.</b> <b>Section</b> II discusses the distribution, or incidence of the subsidy expenditures for all these instruments. It focuses primarily on food as {{the means by which}} the subsidy is delivered, although the section concludes with a brief comparison of food subsidies with energy subsidies. The following section asks whether food subsidies actually achieve the nutritional, and stabilization goals that they are often claimed to achieve. Some of the administrative concerns about market interventions that policymakers must consider, are discussed in Section IV. These administrative concerns, as well as their effects on beneficiaries, point to possibilities for program reform, which are discussed in the final section.

40|$|On July 22, 2005, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) {{published}} a Policy Directive with {{guidelines for the}} preparation of a FONSI. In addition, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations at 40 CFR 1508. 27 state the significance of an action should be analyzed {{both in terms of}} “context” and “intensity. ” The significance of this action is analyzed based on the NAO 216 - 6 criteria, the Policy Directive from NMFS, and CEQ’s context and intensity criteria. These include: 1) Can the proposed action reasonably be expected to jeopardize the sustainability of any target species that may be affected by the action? Response: No. The action would potentially change the distribution of fishing activity, but not the total catch allowed. With or without the emergency rule, NMFS would determine the number of days for the recreational red snapper fishing to keep harvest within the <b>quota.</b> (<b>Sections</b> 2 and 4. 2) 2) Can the proposed action reasonably be expected to jeopardize the sustainability of any non-target species? Response: No. The action is not likely to jeopardize the sustainability of any non-target species...|$|R
40|$|This Master's thesis {{deals with}} the theme of tax mix. The main goal is {{analysis}} of the Czech Republic tax mix development and its comparison to the EU member states during the years 1995 [...] 2010. The first theoretical part {{is focused on the}} basic tax terms, which are related to the theme of the tax mix. These include tax, tax system, tax reform and tax <b>quota.</b> The following <b>section</b> reflects the structure and development of the Czech tax mix and the major reforms of the Czech tax system until 2010. The third part focuses on a comparison of the tax mix and its development with the EU member states. First, the proportions of specific taxes in tax mixes of the EU member states are compared and then the development of the Czech tax mix is compared {{to the development of the}} EU member states average tax mix. In conclusion, there are complete comparisons and predictions expressed in the development of the tax mix of the Czech Republic...|$|R
40|$|Non-tariff {{barriers}} (NTBs) {{present a}} growing threat to a liberal world-trading system and slow the reallocation of production of mature industries from developed to developing countries. Among NTBs, voluntary export restraints (VERs) are proliferating and constitute a major element of the"new protectionism". It has been repeatedly observed that export markets {{which are not}} currently part of the VER agreement often follow suit and enter into a VER agreement. Exporting countries may then wish to prepare themselves for this eventuality by actively promoting export diversification towards non-restricted countries as a precautionary measure against future restrictions. Section II of this paper briefly describes how export diversification is typically achieved. In Section III, a simple model is set up that analyzes {{the implications of the}} two tier <b>quota</b> allocation rule. <b>Section</b> IV briefly examines alternative instruments and motivations for achieving export diversification. Implications are also drawn for policy actions by nonrestricted countries and the suggestion made that the recent increase in anti-dumping cases may be linked to this two-tier quota allocation practice.

40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} two major shifts in global trading and industrialisation patterns. The first is the rise of China (with the South East Asian region in tow) as the dominant force reshaping the competitive dynamics between developing and developed countries as well as within the developing world itself. The second is exemplified in the rapid rise of a clothing industry sector, with a concomitant impact on wage employment, in some sub-Saharan African countries (amongst which Madagascar has been prominent), {{as a direct result}} of the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) of 2000. However, the end of the Multifibre Arrangement and the massive impact of China on the global dispersion of clothing production have threatened to substantially disrupt these processes. Despite the plethora of warnings, there is very little empirical analysis of the real changes taking place as a result of the changed global environment. Based on international trade data and field research undertaken in Madagascar, this article aims to analyze the clothing industry's current dynamics in Madagascar, given the impact of AGOA and the end of apparel <b>quotas.</b> The first <b>section</b> situates the clothing industry in Madagascar within the changing global environment. The second section provides an analysis of the competitiveness dynamics and global linkages operating in Madagascar based on primary research through firm level interviews undertaken in Madagascar in 2005. The article concludes by assessing the policy implications in the post-MFA world...|$|R
40|$|Environmental damages due to {{emissions}} {{of the criteria}} air pollutants {{vary according to the}} location of the source. The environmental economics literature recognizes this heterogeneity and it has provided criteria for e ¢ cient regulation in the presence of such variability. However, without information regarding source-speci 8 ̆ 5 c damages, designing policies that equate the marginal damages of pollution control with marginal costs is not possible. Hence, missing information has prohibited the implementation of e ¢ cient pollution policy in an environment of heterogeneous damages. Recognizing the need for information on marginal damages, this paper uses an integrated assessment model to estimate a spatially comprehensive set of location-speci 8 ̆ 5 c environmental damages due {{to emissions}} of the criteria air pollutants. These location-speci 8 ̆ 5 c damage es-timates are a critical piece of information for regulators; they are the missing information necessary for regulators to move federal air pollution policy beyond cost minimization toward e ¢ ciency. This paper shows how a regulator can use our source-speci 8 ̆ 5 c marginal damage estimates to design policy that maximizes net bene ts of any abatement <b>quota.</b> The empirical <b>section</b> of the paper examines the statistical distribution of the damage estimates for sulfur dioxide and 8 ̆ 5 ne particulates and it plots the marginal bene 8 ̆ 5 t of abatement function for sulfur dioxide for a number of sources. Finally, in a series of policy experiments, we 8 ̆ 5 nd that a system of tradable permits that uses 8 ̆ 5 rm-speci 8 ̆ 5 c permit prices is likely to generate substantial bene 8 ̆ 5 ts to society in an environment where the marginal damages vary by location of the emission source. ...|$|R
40|$|A revised draft Cancun ministerial {{text was}} {{circulated}} on 24 August by the Chair of the WTO General Council, Carlos Pérez del Castillo. Based {{to a large}} extent on the US- EC paper circulated on 13 August (see below), the revised text provides the WTO countries with a framework for establishing modalities in agriculture with respect to the three pillars (market access, domestic support and export competition). For each pillar, the revised text incorporates a number of special and differential treatment (S&D) provisions that were absent in the first draft. In terms of domestic support, the document (viz. Annex A, sections 1. 6 and 1. 7) proposes S&D provisions including: applying lower reductions of trade-distorting domestic support and longer implementation periods (cf. Article 6. 2. of the Agriculture Agreement); exempting developing countries from the requirement to reduce their de minimis levels. As far as the market access pillar is concerned, the Chair recognises that 'developing countries shall have additional flexibility [!;] to designate Special Products' with smaller tariff reductions and no new commitments on Tariff Rates <b>Quotas</b> (cf. <b>section</b> 2. 6). For developing countries, the tariffs reduction would be based either on a three-band Uruguay Round approach or a blend of the Uruguay Round and Swiss formulas, without a zero duty category. The draft text proposes that these Special Products should be determined under certain conditions but these are not elaborated. With regard to the agricultural safeguard mechanism for developing countries, the Chair also says that it would be 'subject to conditions and for products to be determined'. The Chair emphasizes that members would also 'take account of the importance of preferential access for developing countries'. With respect to export competition, the Chair takes up the US-EC proposal to remove export subsidies on some products 'of particular interest for developing countries'. In terms of S&D provisions, developing countries would have the right to exempt certain transport and marketing subsidies from export subsidy reduction (Article 9. 4 of the Agriculture Agreement) until all export subsidies have been phased out by all Members. Furthermore, the text mentions that appropriate provision in favour of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Net Importing Developing Countries (NFIDCs). Other substantial issues are also mentioned in this draft text: recognition of the importance of trade preferences; the sectoral initiative on cotton; the issue of long-term decline and sharp fluctuations in the price of commodities. The Chair also indicates a list of 'issues of interest but not agreed' as introduced by the US-EC proposal including the Green Box criteria, the safeguard measure for developed countries, the implementation periods, the peace clause and non-trade concerns. Comment: In terms of reactions to the draft text, some developing countries (except the Cairns Group) recognise that some progress has been made even if additional S&D provisions are still needed. The EC along with Japan criticise the text saying it goes too far and does not adequately recognise non-trade concerns and the diversity of agriculture. Critics from the Cairns group emphasise that the text does not include the definite elimination of export subsidies or reductions on domestic support by product. Last but not least, the US along with the EC are claiming that less generous level of S&D provisions should apply for advanced developing countries, especially the major net food exporters (including Thailand and India). Even if the revised Cancun ministerial text goes further than the framework given in the US-EC proposal - especially putting the emphasis on the importance of S&D for developing countries - there are still blanks to fill in especially regarding the level of future undertakings (including schedules and figures). A revised draft Cancun ministerial text was [...] ...|$|R
