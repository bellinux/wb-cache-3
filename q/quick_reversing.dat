Optimalisation of these processes in AO combined transport terminal is presented on the project in contexture on road transport vehicles. Application of GPS is signefied in combined transport providing that all transport units will be followed this way. It is necessary to unify the systems for following in combined transport not only in national standard but also international. To communication between the two relatively separately working systems must be used unified standards. Telematics contribution to dispraise of expenses and escalation efficiency by optimal operational, transport and logistics process control also in combined transport.

5000|$|Company {{officers}} {{became aware}} of the rumours through reports of an altercation between a high-caste sepoy and a low-caste labourer at Dum Dum. The labourer had taunted the sepoy that by biting the cartridge, he had himself lost caste, although at this time such cartridges had been issued only at Meerut and not at Dum Dum. [...] There had been rumours that the British sought to destroy the religions of the Indian people, and forcing the native soldiers to break their sacred code would have certainly added to this rumour, as it apparently did.

40|$|Potential {{trade-offs}} between learning {{speed and}} memory-related performance could be {{important factors in}} the evolution of learning. Here, we test whether rapid learning interferes with the acquisition of new information using a reversal learning paradigm. Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) were trained to associate yellow with a floral reward. Subsequently the association between colour and reward was reversed, meaning bees then had to learn to visit blue flowers. We demonstrate that individuals that were fast to learn yellow as a predictor of reward were also <b>quick</b> to <b>reverse</b> this association. Furthermore, overnight memory retention tests suggest that faster learning individuals are also better at retaining previously learned information. There is also an effect of relatedness: colonies whose workers were fast to learn the association between yellow and reward also reversed this association rapidly. These results are inconsistent with a trade-off between learning speed and the reversal of a previously made association. On the contrary, they suggest that differences in learning performance and cognitive (behavioural) flexibility could reflect more general differences in colony learning ability. Hence, this study provides additional evidence to support the idea that rapid learning and behavioural flexibility have adaptive value...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Numerous tudies on the {{aerodynamics}} {{of insect}} wing flapping {{were carried out}} on different approaches of flight investigations, model experiments, and numerical simulations, but the theoretical modeling remains to be explored. In the present paper, an analytic approach is presented to model the flow interactions of wing flapping in air for small insects with the surrounding flow fields being highly unsteady and highly viscous. The model of wing flapping is a 2 -D flat plate, which makes plunging and pitching oscillations as well as <b>quick</b> rotations <b>reversing</b> its positions of {{leading and trailing edges}}, respectively, during stroke reversals. It contains three simplified aerodynamic assumptions: (i) unsteady potential flow; (ii) discrete vortices shed from both leading and trailing edges of the wing; (iii) Kutta conditions applied at both edges. Then the problem is reduced to the solution of the unsteady Laplace equation, by using distributed singularities, i. e., sources/sinks, and vortices in the field. To validate the present physical model and analytic method proposed via benchmark examples, two elemental motions in wing flapping and a case of whole flapping cycles are analyzed, and the predicted results agree well with available xperimental nd numerical data. This verifies that the present analytical approach may give qualitatively correct and quantitatively reasonable results. Furthermore, the total fluid-dynamic force in the present method can be decomposed into three parts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In tractors, during {{front end}} loader, dozer, dry and wet {{puddling}} applications {{there will be}} higher frequency of operation of clutch because of increased need of <b>quick</b> forward and <b>reverse</b> transmissions. This leads to the slippage of dry clutch because of the usage of coil type clutch where there is reduction in clamp load within minimum hours of time because of inability of the coil springs to withstand high temperature. This would result in excessive scoring marks in pressure plate and flywheel, and glazing of friction material, effecting in slip of the clutch leading to replacement of dry clutch assembly as a whole. In this experimental work, it is proposed to modify the design and replace the coil springs used in the dry clutch with belleville spring which {{has the ability to}} withstand high temperature leading to enhanced clutch life in high torque applications of the tractor.

2500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the polls closed at 4:00pm on April 9, 2000, major news {{networks}} rushed to announce that Toledo had garnered more votes than Fujimori. These announcements were based on projections from Peru's top polling firms, which base their numbers on exit polls. The prominent pollsters quickly modified projections based on samples of actual vote counts from selected polling places, {{better known as the}} [...] "quick count". Shortly after receiving news of Toledo's encouraging performance in the initial stage of the vote count, supporters gathered in the streets around Toledo's hotel room. An enthusiastic Toledo walked out onto the balcony of his room wearing a red headband, reminiscent of ancient Inca warriors. He optimistically speculated that a first round victory might be within his grasp but still urged his supporters to wait for the results of the quick count. The second wave of <b>quick</b> count results <b>reversed</b> earlier projections, projecting a round one Fujimori plurality and possible majority. Fujimori had a projected lead of 48.73% to 41.03% later that evening. Fujimori was closing in on the 50% mark which would give him a victory in the first round, with no runoff necessary.|$|R
40|$|Two {{facets of}} paleomagnetism are {{discussed}} {{as part of}} this study; the use of paleomagnetic records to improve our understanding of magnetic field reversals, and the use of paleosecular variation in volcanology studies. ^ A detailed volcanic record of the Matuyama-Brunhes (MBR) reversal (780 ka) suggests that the reversing magnetic field remains dipolar throughout the transition. This record, taken from the Tatara-San Pedro Volcanic Complex located in the Andean region (36 ∘S, 71 ∘W) of central Chile, is recorded in 29 andesite flows. The record is exceptionally well constrained temporally and geochemically as well as paleomagnetically. The lavas record a <b>quick</b> change from <b>reversed</b> polarity to a period of transitional stability, with virtual geomagnetic poles (VGP) forming a cluster centered in Australia, followed by a quick swing to normal polarity. The Chilean data demonstrate that the dipole assumes an intermediate subequatorial position before completing the transition. VGP data from the four other available MBR lava records are largely coincident with the Chilean grouping and further strengthen the suggestion of a dipolar Matuyama-Brunhes reversal field geometry. ^ The integration of paleomagnetism with geochemistry offers volcanologists an efficient and independent correlation tool for studying geochemical trends and growth morphology in volcanic centers. The Tatara-San Pedro Volcanic Complex, a Quaternary arc volcanic center in the Chilean Andes (Singer et al., in press), serves as an excellent model of complex stratocone evolution and lends itself well to a demonstration of this technique. Three fundamental relationships between paleomagnetic and geochemical data are demonstrated within the TSPVC: an absolute correlation, a paleomagnetic dependent correlation, and a geochemical dependent correlation. These correlations provide a degree of temporal insight into the rates of magma productivity that would be difficult to gain through conventional radiometric dating techniques. ...|$|R
5000|$|In June 1942, the {{operational}} IAR fighter {{forces on the}} eastern front, combined into the Flotilla 2 Vânătoare consisted of Grupul 8 Vânătoare, commanded by Cdr. Lt Col E. Pirvulescu, and included Escadrila 41, Escadrila 42 and Escadrila 60 with 12 IAR 80As each. During the Battle of Stalingrad, on 12 September, Grupul 8 Vânătoare IAR 80Bs (along with Grupul 7 Vânătoare’s Bf 109s) claimed to have shot down seven Yaks but they lost two IARs.Grupul 8 moved {{at the end of}} September, to Karpovka, joining Grupul 7, equipped with Bf 109s. On 12 and 13 December, Grupul 6 used its IAR 81s to support the German counterattack by the Panzergruppe Hoth of the Heeresgruppe Don, from Kotelnikovo towards Stalingrad.In the summer of 1943 the FARR's IAR-80s were transferred to Romania for air defense duties, where they were used in combat against the USAAF. USAAF attacks were directed at the oil refineries installation around Ploieşti, in particular. On 1 August 1943 the IAR 80 faced the Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber for the first time. There were 178 B-24s from 9th USAAF, part of the Operation Tidal Wave. The IAR 80Bs of Escadrila 61 and 62 of Grupul 6 Vânătoare, as well as IAR 80Cs from the newly formed Escadrila 45 of Grupul 4 Vânătoare, together with the Bf 109Gs from Esc. 53 and Bf 110s from the Romanian night fighter squadron, dived on the low-flying, four-engined bombers, belonging to five USAAF bomber groups (the 44th, 93rd, 98th, 376th and 389th). The Americans lost - in combat or on the way back - 51 bombers. Only 89 reached their bases, of which only 31 were serviceable for a mission the next day. The Romanian pilots claimed 25 certain and probable victories for just two losses, one IAR 80 B and one Bf 110C. According to Romanian statistics, IARs and Messerschmitts were confirmed as having shot down ten B-24s, with two probables.On 10 June 1944, IAR 80s took part in a major air battle when the USAAF attacked Ploieşti with 36 P-38 Lightnings of the 82nd Fighter Group carrying one bomb each, escorted by 39 Lightnings of the 1st and 82 FGs. The IAR 81Cs from Grupul 6, as well as the German fighters from I./JG 53 and 2./JG 77, intercepted the large American formation. Romanian pilot Dan Vizanty, commander of Grupul 6, recalled later: [...] "Our Lightning attack came as a complete surprise to the Americans. Our attack was so quick that not one of the 100 (sic) American aircraft managed to fire a single shot at our aircraft parked on the ground. Everything happened between ground level and about 2,000 m, and was total confusion. I was excited and proud of my [...] "mills", the IAR 80s, which, thanks to their extraordinary agility, remained victorious in the air. I saw their crazy dives, <b>quick</b> rolls, <b>reverse</b> turns and inverted flying, always with just brief burst of fire to save ammunition. It was an incredible sight, but also a drama for the Lightning pilots, who, at this low altitude, were inferior to the ever-present, nimble IAR 80s".|$|R
