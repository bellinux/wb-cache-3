5|$|As {{a result}} of these collaborations, Rock Steady touches on many musical styles, {{focusing}} on electropop, dancehall, and new wave. The band attempted to capture the vibe of Jamaican dancehall music, and experimented with writing songs without its standard instrumentation. Singer Gwen Stefani wrote her lyrics <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> comparison to previous records, and dealt with topics ranging from partying to ruminations on her relationship with Gavin Rossdale.|$|E
5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> a catastrophic explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E

5|$|In August 1513, James IV of Scotland invaded England {{with a large}} army; {{equipped}} with modern artillery, he took the border castles of Norham and Wark, and then moved south against Etal Castle. Etal surrendered <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> the hope of avoiding being pillaged by James' army, but nonetheless {{it was at least}} partially slighted - deliberately damaged to prevent it being used as a defence.|$|E
5|$|Kaspersky's company grew <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> {{the late}} 1990s. From 1998 to 2000, its annual revenue grew 280 percent and by 2000 almost {{sixty percent of}} {{revenues}} were international. By 2000, it had a staff of 65 people, up from 13 shortly after its foundation. The antivirus product was renamed to Kaspersky Antivirus in 2000, after an American company started using the product's original name, which wasn't trademarked.|$|E

Simultaneously with its public release, Paxata announced an $8 million funding round led by Accel Partners. Adoption of the software grew <b>quickly.</b> <b>In</b> March 2014, In-Q-Tel acquired {{an interest in the}} startup.|$|E
5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate {{in response to}} changes in the environment), as it develops very <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> the lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps. Scientists hypothesize that this plasticity is due to warm conditions and more light exposure, which affects larval development. Abundant food resources are also thought to play a part in quickened development.|$|E
5|$|The well-bred palfrey, {{which could}} equal a destrier in price, was popular with nobles and highly ranked knights for riding, hunting and {{ceremonial}} use. Ambling was a desirable trait in a palfrey, as the smooth gait allowed the rider to cover long distances <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> relative comfort.|$|E

5|$|When the allele {{frequency}} is very small, drift can also overpower selection even in large populations. For example, while disadvantageous mutations are usually eliminated <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> large populations, new advantageous mutations {{are almost as}} vulnerable to loss through genetic drift as are neutral mutations. Not until the {{allele frequency}} for the advantageous mutation reaches a certain threshold will genetic drift have no effect.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium metal tarnishes {{slowly in}} air. Finely {{dispersed}} ytterbium readily oxidizes in air and under oxygen. Mixtures of powdered ytterbium with polytetrafluoroethylene or hexachloroethane burn with a luminous emerald-green flame. Ytterbium reacts with hydrogen to form various non-stoichiometric hydrides. Ytterbium dissolves slowly in water, but <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> acids, liberating hydrogen gas.|$|E

5|$|After Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff {{and a short}} return, Tennessee's offense {{started from}} its 31-yard line. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech was {{followed}} by a five-yard first-down run by Hardesty. Tennessee attempted to move its offense <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> order to maximize the chances of closing Virginia Tech's lead by scoring fast. Crompton completed an 18-yard pass, advancing the Volunteers into Tech territory, but he was sacked by the Tech defense and Tennessee committed a five-yard false start penalty, forcing the Volunteers to punt. The kick rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and Gothenburg {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing a wartime blackout exercise.|$|E

5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more <b>quickly.</b> <b>In</b> these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E
5|$|As Upper Canada's administrator, Brock made {{a series}} of changes to prepare for war. He amended the militia act to allow use of all {{available}} volunteers and ordered enhanced training of these raw recruits, despite opposition from the provincial legislature. He continued strengthening and reinforcing defences. Brock also began seeking out First Nations leaders, such as the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, to build alliances with him against the Americans in the event of war. Although the conventional wisdom of the day was that Canada would fall <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> the event of an invasion, Brock pursued these strategies to give the colony a fighting chance.|$|E
5|$|As in most Sonic series games, the Chaos Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more <b>quickly</b> <b>in</b> levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an explosion that destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
