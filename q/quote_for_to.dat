The survey results reported here extend some earlier results reported in a previous Review article by Murray and Powell. The data indicate that, despite the dominance of the U. S. dollar in world trade and as an international standard of value, use of the U. S. dollar in Canada is very limited. The vast majority of Canadian firms price their products and keep their financial statements in Canadian dollars, and very few workers in Canada have their salaries paid in a foreign currency. The Canadian dollar is still strongly preferred for most pricing and financial-reporting activities in Canada, and there is very little evidence of "dollarization. "...|$|R

In the other hand, the same source might be another confirmation of the medical reputation of Gundeshapur as Susa may represent the whole local region which included Gundeshapur (as they were administratively linked).

40|$|Thesis (MSc) [...] Stellenbosch UniversityENGLISH ABSTRACT : In this thesis, {{we first}} review the {{traditional}} pre-credit crunch approach that considers a single curve to consistently price all instruments. We review the theoretical pricing framework and introduce pricing formulas for plain vanilla interest rate derivatives. We then review the curve construction methodologies (bootstrapping and global methods) {{to build an}} interest rate curve using the instruments described previously as inputs. Second, we extend this work in the modern post-credit framework. Third, we review the calibration of the SABR model. Finally we present applications that use interest rate curves and SABR model: stripping implied volatilities, transforming the market observed smile (given <b>quotes</b> <b>for</b> standard tenors) <b>to</b> non-standard tenors (or inversely) and calibrating the market volatility smile coherently with the new market evidences.
