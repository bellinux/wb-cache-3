50|$|On August 27, the MLUA {{requested}} arbitration {{from the}} American Arbitration Association, but both leagues turned it down. The MLUA {{then returned to}} U.S. District Court three days later, in hopes of obtaining an injunction against the leagues' acceptances of the resignations. Instead of the <b>quick</b> <b>ruling</b> the union was seeking, judge Curtis Joyner desired negotiations between the sides, which he oversaw. On September 1, the parties agreed on a severance package, which confirmed {{the loss of the}} 22 umpires' jobs. The MLUA pledged not to strike in the agreement.|$|E
5000|$|ODOT has not {{sought to}} {{redirect}} semitrailers off the former I-40 stretch of deteriorating overpasses. ODOT Director Gary Ridley said the current I-40 will [...] "absolutely" [...] survive through 2012, the completion {{date for the}} realignment, adding, [...] "If we felt there was anything wrong that would cause us concern, we would close it, and we wouldn't think twice about it." [...] However, in a filing with STB, Ridley urged a <b>quick</b> <b>ruling</b> because [...] "new serious issues including cracks in fracture critical members are constantly being discovered and repaired. The condition and obsolescence of the existing bridges constitutes serious concern for the Department." [...] Other highway connections, running east and west, include I-240 and I-44.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, Fleer sued Topps {{over its}} {{exclusive}} baseball rights. After five years {{a federal judge}} ruled that Topps illegally obtained Major League Baseball Players Association rights. Donruss and Fleer negotiated deals with Major League Baseball and by late 1980 Donruss had acquired the rights to produce baseball cards. Its first baseball card set was produced and ready {{in time for the}} 1981 season. In August of that year, an appellate court overturned the judge's <b>ruling.</b> <b>Quick</b> to react, Fleer's lawyers found a loophole in Topps' contract that stated it had exclusive rights to sell baseball cards with gum or candy. So, Fleer started distributing its baseball cards with stickers, and Donruss started distributing its cards with puzzle pieces.|$|R
5000|$|Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez urged European and Latin American governments on January 11, 2008 to stop {{branding}} Colombia's guerrillas as terrorists, a {{day after}} welcoming two hostages released by the rebels. [...] "I am asking the governments (across Latin America) to take the FARC-EP and ELN (National Liberation Army) off their lists of global terrorist groups", Chávez told the National Assembly. His plea was futile: Colombian President Álvaro Uribe was <b>quick</b> to respond, <b>ruling</b> out {{any change in the}} FARC-EP's or ELN's status. Álvaro Uribe later issued a statement saying the insurgents are indeed terrorists who fund their operations with cocaine smuggling, recruit children and plant land mines in their effort to topple a democratically elected government.|$|R
