Harriet was the {{daughter}} of Benjamin Chew, the chief justice of Pennsylvania, and her sister married John Eager Howard who had served in the Senate with Charles Carroll of Carrollton. Charles Jr. was an alcoholic who reportedly consumed up to two <b>quarts</b> <b>of</b> brandy a day. This led to erratic behavior that resulted in his separation from Harriet.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between the engine block and the exhaust manifold are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four <b>quarts</b> <b>of</b> oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} 19, Garrick, who {{had been}} educated at Lichfield Grammar School, {{enrolled}} in Samuel Johnson's Edial Hall School. Garrick showed an enthusiasm for the theatre very early on and he appeared in a school production around {{this time in the}} role of Sergeant Kite in George Farquhar's The Recruiting Officer. After Johnson's school was closed, he and Garrick, now friends, travelled to London together to seek their fortunes. Upon his arrival in 1737, Garrick and his brother became partners in a wine business with operations in both London and Lichfield with David taking the London operation. The business did not flourish, possibly due to Garrick's distraction by amateur theatricals. Playwright Samuel Foote remarked that he had known Garrick to have only three <b>quarts</b> <b>of</b> vinegar in his cellar and still calling himself a wine merchant.|$|E

2500|$|In the New Testament, {{the gospels}} {{refer to the}} denarius as a day's wage for a common laborer (Matthew 20:2, John [...] 12:5). In the Book of Revelation, during the Third Seal: Black Horse, a choinix (or quart) of wheat and three <b>quarts</b> <b>of</b> barley were each valued at one denarius. Bible scholar Robert H. Mounce says {{the price of the}} wheat and barley as {{described}} in the vision appears to be ten to twelve times their normal cost in ancient times. Revelation describes a condition where basic goods are sold at greatly inflated prices. Thus, the black horse rider depicts times of deep scarcity or famine but not of starvation. The English word [...] "quart" [...] translates choinix. Apparently, a choinix of wheat was the daily ration of one adult. Thus, in the conditions pictured by Revelation 6 the normal income for a working-class family would buy enough food for only one person. The less costly barley would feed three people for one day's wages.|$|E
