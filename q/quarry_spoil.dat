50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century much of this industry had declined and by the 1960s, what remained was a legacy of uncapped mineshafts, derelict buildings, abandoned <b>quarries,</b> <b>spoil</b> heaps and pit mounds. The development of Telford and thoughtful landscaping has removed or hidden many of these scars. However, throughout the area of South Telford there remains a wealth of heritage sites. These include the canals, railways, mines, ironworks, houses and fine buildings associated with the area's industrial past. Many of these heritage sites are easily missed by the casual walker and their contributions to the rich history of the area are less well known.|$|R

40|$|Mining of {{minerals}} that have {{significant impact on}} landscape and landscape functions affects 1 % of the land surface worldwide. In the Czech Republic the extent of mining sites {{is estimated to be}} more than 800 km 2 and according to the state legislation the land affected by mining should be reclaimed. There are several approaches to land restoration, which are shortly reviewed in this article, from pure technical approach to one adopting natural processes. The review shows increasing appeal of scientist and conservationist to use natural processes e. g. natural or directed succession as an alternative method of post-mining sites or industrial deposits restoration due to growing evidence of conservational value of such sites in human dominated landscapes. The natural processes used for land restoration are often argued to be slow therefore the rate of spontaneous vegetation succession was assessed in stone <b>quarries</b> and on <b>spoil</b> heaps using a sequence of panchromatic aerial images.

50|$|Hyllestad quernstone {{quarries}} in {{the county}} of Sogn og Fjordane represent the oldest {{and one of the}} largest production areas for quernstones and millstones in Norway with approx. 400 quarries identified. The natural condition for the quernstone and millstone production in the area is the rock type garnet mica schist. The quarries are located from the shoreline up until approx. 200 m above sea level, but a majority is situated less than one kilometer from the sea and closest harbor. The quarries are well preserved, visible {{and most of them are}} easily accessible. In the Viking period and the Middle Ages, quernstones were shaped and carved directly from the bedrock, and in several of the quarries unfinished quernstones and millstones are still attached to the rock. The large scale production has since Viking times led to severe changes of the landscape. <b>Quarries</b> and <b>spoil</b> heaps are so densely situated that the original topography is not visible anymore. Two harbors are also identified. Here, large amounts of quern and millstones as well as ballast stones are located on the sea bed, testifying to the activity of loading and unloading that once took place here. From the 1600s, the production in Hyllestad started to decrease. In Early Modern period a new technology came into use in the quarries - the use of gunpowder. This production lasted until 1930. Thus, the quernstone quarries in Hyllestad represent an approx. 1200 years old history.|$|R
6000|$|... § 10. Of {{the picturesque}} aspects which {{this mode of}} {{cleavage}} produces in the mountains, and in the stones of the foreground, we shall have to speak presently; {{with regard to the}} uses of the materials it is only necessary to note farther that these slaty rocks are of course, by their wilful way of breaking, rendered unfit for sculpture, and for nearly all purposes of art; the properties which render them convenient for the peasant in building his cottage, making them unavailable for the architecture of more elaborate edifices. One very great advantage is thus secured for the scenery they compose, namely, that it is rarely broken by quarries. A single <b>quarry</b> will often <b>spoil</b> a whole Alpine landscape; the effect of the lovely bay of the Lago Maggiore, for instance, in which lie the Borromean Islands, is, in great part, destroyed by the scar caused by a quarry of pink granite on its western shore; and the valley of Chamouni itself has lost some of its loveliest rock scenery in consequence of the unfortunate discovery that the boulders which had fallen from its higher pinnacles, and were lying in massy heaps among its pines, were available for stone lintels and door-posts in the building of its new inns. But the slaty crystallines, though sometimes containing valuable mines, are hardly ever quarried for stone; and the scenes they compose retain, in general, little disturbed by man, their aspect of melancholy power, or simple and noble peace. The color of their own mass, when freshly broken, is nearly {{the same as that of}} the compact crystallines; but it is far more varied by veins and zones of included minerals, and contains usually more iron, which gives a rich brown or golden color to their exposed sides, so that the coloring of these rocks is the most glowing to be found in the mountain world. They form also soil for vegetation more quickly, and of a more fruitful kind than the granites, and appear, on the whole, intended to unite every character of grandeur and of beauty, and to constitute the loveliest as well as the noblest scenes which the earth ever unfolds to the eyes of men.|$|R

Description: Location: Along {{the eastern side}} of the road running due south from Aphrodisias, on the far side of the river along the first ridge above the valley floor, 5 km south of Aphrodisias. Elevation 745 masl. Modern quarry is plainly visible from Aphrodisias, since modern {{quarrying}} has scarred the hillside. Quarries are in the same marble-rich zone as those at Hançam, Çamarası, Ören, and Nargedik. ** Number and dimensions of quarries: Six pit quarries, four small and two medium sized (Quarries 1 – 2), both of which have been expanded by modern working. ** Geological age, grain size, and color: Mesozoic. Medium to coarse grained. White with thin gray intervals. Small zones of fine-grained tan marble, breccias filled with fractures of red calcite cements, clasts of white and gray marbles, and metabauxite clasts. ** Modern quarrying: Extensive throughout. ** Joints and quality of marble: Extensively fractured at surface; relatively poor at top, but quality improves at lower levels. Largest joint spacing is 2. 10 m (measured on back face of Quarry 2). ** Quarry organization and evidence for extraction: Faces of Quarries 1 and 2 are weathered in manner of other ancient quarries and preserve no evidence of ancient working, which is limited to one side of a large modern waste block bearing ancient pick- and point-chisel marks. Roman quarriers followed a long natural northwest/southeast joint. Quarries 4 – 6 may have yielded no more than five or six medium-sized blocks each, as numerous joints are present. Main slipway leads from Quarry 2 to the modern road, then continues to the southeast. From Quarry 2, a second slipway leads southward to Quarry 1 on the west side. A third slipway leads east from <b>Quarry</b> 1 past <b>spoil</b> heaps and <b>Quarries</b> 4 – 6. ** Blocks: A small column fragment and broken mortar are abandoned ** in <b>spoil</b> heaps of <b>Quarry</b> 3.
