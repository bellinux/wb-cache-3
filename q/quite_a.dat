5|$|Burnell built {{extensively}} at Acton Burnell Castle, {{and large}} parts of his house have survived. It was substantially different in plan from the older hall-style houses, which had the private quarters {{at the back of}} a large hall.

The house was not <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> castle, but it was designed to have some defensive capability.
