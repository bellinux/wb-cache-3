5|$|The goal of elucidating {{pathophysiology}} {{has also}} led to increased interest in the association between risk-SNPs and the gene expression of nearby genes, the so-called expression <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> loci (eQTL) studies. The reason is that GWAS studies identify risk-SNPs, but not risk-genes, and specification of genes is one step closer towards actionable drug targets. As a result, major GWA studies by 2011 typically included extensive eQTL analysis. One of the strongest eQTL effects observed for a GWA-identified risk SNP is the SORT1 locus. Functional follow up studies of this locus using small interfering RNA and gene knock-out mice have {{shed light on the}} metabolism of low-density lipoproteins, which have important clinical implications for cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the DNA sequence at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E
40|$|<b>Quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> are {{phenotypic}} {{traits that}} are determined, jointly with the environment, by many genes of small effect. Most of the directly observable individual characteristics are <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits.</b> Differences in <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> can give valuable signals on existence of separate stock components. Compared to neutral genetic markers, <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> {{are more sensitive}} to population structure and may suggest differences where neutral genetic markers fail to show any. However, <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> may also show differences where demographic separation is weak.

40|$|Effects of {{maternal}} genotypes for eight enzyme loci on seven <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> in 41 half-sib families were determined. Heritability {{estimates for the}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> were highly significant and ranged from 0. 57 to 0. 86. Only six of 112 comparisons (56 comparisons {{for each of the}} genotypes and 56 for homozygous versus heterozygous contrasts) were statistically significant (P < 0. 05). None of these significant comparisons could be associated with either a particular allele or a particular genotype. No heterotic effects were observed when the homozygous genotypes were compared with the heterozygous ones. Because the <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> are highly correlated, a discriminant function analysis was performed to obtain the two most important canonical variates that accounted for 75 % {{of the variance in the}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits.</b> There were no significant associations among enzyme loci and the two canonical variates. I conclude that, in this study, enzyme genotypic differences do not influence the <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> to a major extent...|$|R

To that end, a spatial autocorrelation {{approach is developed}} based on pairwise correlation coefficients between individuals and using sib families. Statistical properties of the proposed statistics are investigated with numerical simulations. Our results show that most <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> have a significant spatial structure for their genetic component. On average, allozyme markers and the genetic component of <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> have similar patterns of spatial autocorrelation {{that are consistent with}} a neutral model of isolation by distance.

25|$|In {{classical}} genetics, if genes A and B are mutated, {{and each}} mutation by itself produces a unique phenotype {{but the two}} mutations together show the same phenotype as the gene A mutation, then gene A is epistatic and gene B is hypostatic. For example, the gene for total baldness is epistatic to the gene for brown hair. In this sense, epistasis can be contrasted with genetic dominance, which is an interaction between alleles at the same gene locus. As the study of genetics developed, and {{with the advent of}} molecular biology, epistasis started to be studied in relation to <b>Quantitative</b> <b>Trait</b> Loci (QTL) and polygenic inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{economic}} traits are controlled by genes with small but cumulative effects. Although the potential of DH populations in quantitative genetics has been understood for some time, it was the advent of molecular marker maps that provided the impetus for their use in identifying loci controlling quantitative traits. As the <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> loci (QTL) effects are small and highly influenced by environmental factors, accurate phenotyping with replicated trials is needed. This is possible with doubled haploidy organisms because of their true breeding nature and because they can conveniently be produced in large numbers. Using DH populations, 130 quantitative traits have been mapped in nine crop species. In total, 56 DH populations were used for QTL detection.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} within-population variability {{and degree}} of population differentiation for neutral genetic markers (RAPDS) and eight <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> in Central American populations of the endangered tree, Cedrela odorata. Whilst population genetic diversity for neutral markers (Shannon index) and <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> (heritability, coefficient of additive genetic variation) were uncorrelated, both marker types revealed strong differentiation between populations from the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica {{and the rest of}} the species 2 ̆ 7 distribution. The degree of interpopulation differentiation was higher for RAPD markers (F-ST 0. 67 for the sampled Mesoamerican range) than for <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> (Q(ST) = 0. 30). Hence, the divergence in <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> was lower than could have been achieved by genetic drift alone, suggesting that balancing selection for similar phenotypes in different populations of this species. Nevertheless, a comparison of pair-wise estimates of population differentiation in neutral genetic markers and <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> revealed a strong positive correlation (r = 0. 66) suggesting that, for C. odorata, neutral marker divergence could be used as a surrogate for adaptive gene divergence for conservation planning.

40|$|A {{central issue}} in {{evolutionary}} quantitative genetics {{is to understand}} how genetic variation for <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> is maintained in natural populations. Estimates of genetic variation and of genetic correlations and pleiotropy among multiple traits, inbreeding depression, mutation rates for fitness and <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> and of the strength and nature of selection are all required to evaluate theoretical models of the maintenance of genetic variation. Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that a substantial fraction of segregating variation for fitness-related traits in Drosophila is due to rare deleterious alleles maintained by mutation–selection balance, with a smaller but significant fraction attributable to intermediate frequency alleles maintained by alleles with antagonistic pleiotropic effects, and late-age-specific effects. However, the nature of segregating variation for traits under stabilizing selection is less clear and requires more detailed knowledge of the loci, mutation rates, allelic effects and frequencies of molecular polymorphisms affecting variation in suites of pleiotropically connected traits. Recent studies in D. melanogaster have revealed unexpectedly complex genetic architectures of many <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits,</b> {{with large numbers of}} pleiotropic genes and alleles with sex-, environment- and genetic background-specific effects. Future genome wide association analyses of many <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> on a common panel of fully sequenced Drosophila strains will provide much needed empirical data on the molecular genetic basis of <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits...</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 2010, a study {{identified}} 51 {{regions of}} the dog genome that were associated with phenotypic variation among breeds in 57 traits studied, which included body, cranial, dental, and long bone shape and size. There were 3 <b>quantitative</b> <b>trait</b> loci that explained most of the phenotypic variation. Indicators of recent selection were shown {{by many of the}} 51 genomic regions that were [...] associated with traits that define a breed, which include body size, coat characteristics, and ear floppiness. [...] Geneticists have identified more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability. Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed the correlation between the timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with the timing of their domestication. Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs. Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.|$|E

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that population stratification {{can result in}} spurious association findings in genetic case-control studies. However, very few studies have addressed similar issues for mapping <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits.</b> Since <b>quantitative</b> phenotypes are often precursors of clinical end-point traits and carry more information on within-genotype trait variability, {{it has been argued}} that studying these <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> may be a more powerful strategy to map genes than the binary clinical end-points. Thus, it is of interest to evaluate the adverse effects of population stratification on the analyses of <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits.</b> The popular statistical tests of association for <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> using population level data are ANOVA, linear regression with an additive allelic effect and Kruskal-Wallis. We have theoretically studied the marginal effects of genetic heterogeneity and phenotypic heterogeneity as well as their joint effects on the false positive rate of the three tests mentioned above. We have carried out extensive simulations under different genetic models and probability distributions of <b>quantitative</b> <b>traits</b> to assess the rate of false positives in the presence of population stratification.

This selection causes local adaptation, but high gene flow is still expected to be present along the cline.|$|E
