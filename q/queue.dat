As the <b>queue</b> moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes more ominous. Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning set design for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded pieces of equipment, crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with bullet holes. The <b>queue</b> then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger loading area is modeled on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{different combinations}} of <b>queuing</b> methods {{and their impact on}} the VoIP traffic delay within the network. In our experiment we combined three of the most useful <b>queuing</b> methods where we put to-gether priority <b>queuing</b> (PQ) with class-based weighted fair <b>queuing</b> (CBWFQ), custom <b>queuing</b> (CQ) with CBWFQ and weighted fair <b>queuing</b> (WFQ) with CBWFQ. Each hybrid method is compared with the basic method. For example, the PQ-CBWFQ method is compared with the priority <b>queuing</b> method, and so on. All the hybrid <b>queuing</b> disciplines are tested using an OPNET Modeler simulation tool. Our intention is to show the reader, how <b>queuing</b> combinations affect VoIP traffic quality, especially, with regard to Ethernet delay and jitter. Using results of our research-based simulations, we prove usefulness of our combination concept for Ethernet delay decreasing. Ethernet delay was rapidly decreased by using the WFQ-CBWFQ <b>queuing</b> combination. Though such combination (WFQ-CBWFQ) most strongly affects the jitter delay, and it is still within the set limits. Using the proposed <b>queuing</b> combination, it is possible to minimize the Ethernet delay for IP-based time-sensitive applications, includ-ing VoIP...|$|R
