25|$|The {{new ideas}} and discoveries were publicized {{throughout}} Europe by {{the large number of}} book publishers in Paris. Between 1720 and 1780, the number of books about science and art doubled, while the number of books about religion dropped to just one-tenth of the total. Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert published their Encyclopedie in seventeen volumes between 1751 and 1766. It provided intellectuals across Europe with a high <b>quality</b> <b>survey</b> of human knowledge. Scientists came to Paris from across Europe and from the United States to share ideas; Benjamin Franklin came in 1766 to meet with Voltaire and to talk about his experiments with electricity.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, Paris was {{the center}} of an {{explosion}} of philosophic and scientific activity known as the Age of Enlightenment.

The Montgolfier Brothers launched the first manned flight in a hot-air balloon on 21 November 1783, from the Château de la Muette, near the Bois de Boulogne. Paris was the financial capital of France and continental Europe, the primary European center of book publishing, fashion, and the manufacture of fine furniture and luxury goods. Parisian bankers funded new inventions, theatres, gardens, and works of art. The successful Parisian playwright Pierre de Beaumarchais, the author of The Barber of Seville, helped fund the American Revolution.|$|E

40|$|Poor quality {{medicines}} and medical products jeopardize national, regional and global attempts to improve access to effective treatment and health care. Both poor quality manufacture and deliberate falsification of medicines are widespread and many examples have been highlighted globally. Ethically designed surveys {{are essential for}} an in-depth understanding of this phenomenon to ensure corrective actions. Objectives: In this paper we identify and discuss the main ethical challenges related to the conduct of surveys and make {{suggestions on how to}} address them. Methods: Most evidence-based information regarding medicine <b>quality</b> derives from <b>surveys.</b> However, existing research ethical guidelines do not provide specific guidance for medicine <b>quality</b> <b>surveys.</b> Hence, those conducting surveys are often left wondering how to judge what counts as best practice.

40|$|Nutrient {{transfers}} {{from the}} land to rivers {{have the potential to}} cause persistent eutrophic impacts at low flows even though the transfers may constitute a minor percentage of total annual fluxes. In rural catchments, the contribution from agricultural soils during storm events can be particularly large and untangling the relative contributions from multiple sources that vary in time and space is especially problematic. In this study, the potential for domestic septic tank system pollution during low flows was investigated in 3 small catchments (3 to 5 km 2) using an integrated series of methods. These included septic system surveys, continuous (10 min) total phosphorus (TP) monitoring at the outlet of each catchment, repeated low-flow water <b>quality</b> <b>surveys</b> in sub-catchments upstream of the catchment outlets and single day river-walk water <b>quality</b> <b>surveys.</b> A series of faecal matter and grey-water fingerprinting techniques were also employed. These included determining sterol ratios in stream sediments, monitoring the presence of proteins, E. coli and enterococci bacterial signatures and boron. The total density and density of poorly maintained septic systems mirrored the magnitude of frequent TP concentrations in the catchments although this relationship was less apparent in the nested sub-catchments. The exception was possibly related to the simple hydraulics in one particular catchment and indicated temporary effluent attenuation in the other catchments. Repeated low-flow and river-walk water <b>quality</b> <b>surveys</b> highlighted discrete areas and reaches where stepped changes in nutrient concentration occurred. Bio-chemical fingerprinting showed that between 7...|$|R

The theories that has been used to analyze the empirical data is SOC - sence of coherence, stigma and empowerment. The result shows that the meaning of daily activity is to create and maintain social contacts, feeling important and needed by others and an opportunity to feel “normal” and like everybody else. Furthermore, the results show that the possibility of self-determination, the fellowship with personal and other participants and to have tasks with moderate severity are necessary questions to ask in <b>quality</b> <b>surveys.</b> Another result shows that the respondents are aware that the absence of salary differs a regular job from work in a daily activity center. ...|$|R
