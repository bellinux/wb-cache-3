40|$|We {{propose a}} modulus based zero-forcing (MZF) {{detection}} for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) channels. Traditionally, a ZF detector nulls out all interferences from other layers when detecting a current layer, which can yield suboptimal detection-performance {{due to the}} noise-enhancement issue. In many communication systems, finite alphabets such as M <b>quadrature-amplitude-modulation</b> (QAM) are widely used, which comprises √(M) pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) symbols for the real and imaginary parts.

40|$|High {{coherence}} lasers {{are essential}} {{in a wide}} range of applications, however, such performance is normally associated with large laser cavities, because increasing energy storage reduces quantum phase noise and also renders the laser frequency less sensitive to cavity vibration. This basic scaling rule is at odds with an emerging set of optical systems that place focus on compact (optimally integrable) sources of high coherence light. These include phase-coherent optical communication using <b>quadrature-amplitude-modulation,</b> and also record-low phase noise microwave sources based upon optical comb techniques. In this work, the first, chip-based Brillouin laser is demonstrated. It features high-efficiency and single-line operation with the smallest recorded Schawlow-Townes frequency noise for any chip-based laser.

40|$|Abstract: By {{developing}} a low-noise frequency synthesizer at 2 GHz and applying {{a pair of}} doublers, {{it is possible to}} achieve low-phase-noise outputs past 8 GHz for digital microwave radios. Frequency synthesizers are vital components in communications systems, {{with a wide range of}} frequencies required for applications ranging from low-cost cellular telephones to millimeter-wave radios. Digital microwave radios (DMRs) have their own sets of demanding requirements for frequency synthesizers, since they typically rely on advanced digital modulation such as <b>quadrature-amplitude-modulation</b> (QAM) and quadrature-phase-shiftkeying (QPSK) formats. Fortunately, the authors have developed a frequency synthesizer from 7. 6 to 8. 6 GHz ideally suited for digital microwave radios that rely on QAM and QPSK modulation formats. The design strategy for synthesizer is outlined here, along with measurements using a commercial spectrum analyzer, showing how the source can deliver signals with low phase noise even close to the carrier. Frequency synthesizers are frequently used in wireless communication applications. For example, they can be used in transmitting high-definition TV (HDTV) over a wide frequenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{efficient}} use of Hybrid Automatic-Repeat-reQuest (Hybrid-ARQ) in wireless communication has attracted {{a considerable amount of}} research. In this thesis, the use and implementation of turbo codes as the Forward Error Correction (FEC) code for Hybrid-ARQ is investigated. The major accomplishments of the research include both the analysis and implementation of turbo Hybrid-ARQ. The thesis begins by obtaining a tractable bound for the performance of turbo codes with M-ary <b>Quadrature-Amplitude-Modulation</b> (M-ary QAM). The research considers the design problem of turbo coded Hybrid-ARQ optimized for AWGN and fading channels. The design problem of turbo Hybrid-ARQ in wideband channels is considered and an optimization strategy is proposed based on Orthogonal-Frequency-Division- Multiplexing (OFDM). The research also presents a novel rate scalable encoder structure that optimal selects a disparate but optimal pair of component codes given the channel conditions. A second part of the thesis considers the implementation of turbo Hybrid-ARQ in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) systems. A design for a single architecture for Type-I and Type-II turbo Hybrid-ARQ is suggested in addition to approaches for improving performance of the Soft-Output-Viterbi-Algorithm(SOVA) decoder core. The research also proposes a SOVA decoder architecture that exploits reliability information to select between the SOVA and bi-directional SOVA...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim of this work is to study data transmission over a microwave digital mobile radio channel at 900 MHz, where the channel is subjected to multipath fading. Besides the fading, the other impairments assumed here are additive noise, co-channel interference and adjacent channel interference. Two modulation techniques are investigated in this work, namely <b>Quadrature-Amplitude-Modulation</b> (QAM) and Quadrature-Phase-Shift- Keying (QPSK). The channel is characterised digitally, assuming multipath Rayleigh fading {{in the presence of}} noise. The detection process studied here are near-maximum likelihood schemes: non-linear equalisation methods are also considered in detail. The thesis is also concerned with carrier synchronisation and channel estimation under conditions of Rayleigh fading. Since the carrier syncn,honisation is a most important requirement in mobile radio, a Digital Phase Locked Loop (DPLL) technique has been designed and investigated {{in the form of a}} feedback digital synchronisation system. Two types of channel estimation technique, namely feedforward and feedback estimators, are also investigated in this work. The feedback estimator is modified by the addition of a digital control system, in order to reduce its delay, and to cope with rapidly fading signals. Successful carrier synchronisation is demonstrated by the use of space diversity. The study was completed using models of the component parts of the system, and by the use of extensive computer simulations to analyse the system under various operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Precoded spatial {{multiplexing}} {{systems with}} rate-limited feedback {{have been studied}} recently based on various precoder selection criteria. Instead of those based on indirect performance indicators, we in this paper propose a new criterion directly based on the exact bit error rate (BER) that is applicable to systems with linear receivers and rectangular/square <b>quadrature-amplitude-modulation</b> constellations. The BER criterion outperforms any other alternative in terms of optimizing the BER performance for an uncoded system with linear receivers. We then develop a precoder codebook construction method based on the generalized Lloyd algorithm from the vector quantization literature. This construction is not directly based on the BER criterion. Hence, it is suboptimal in the BER sense. However, relative to those currently available, our newfound codebooks improve considerably various minimum distances between any pair of codewords of the codebook. Finally, we analyze the BER-optimal precoder in the asymptotic case with infinite-rate feedback that amounts to perfect channel knowledge at the transmitter. The infinite-rate optimal precoder based on the BER criterion is drastically different from the counterparts with other criteria, and it leads to a benchmark performance for finite-rate precoded spatial multiplexing systems. We observe from numerical results that the BER performance of finite-rate feedback with suboptimal codebooks approaches quickly the benchmark performance of infinite-rate feedback. This suggests that i) the number of feedback bits in practical systems need not be large and ii) the room for performance improvement via further codebook optimization shrinks quickly as the codebook size increases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We study a carrier-synchronization {{scheme for}} co-herent optical {{communications}} {{that uses a}} feedforward archi-tecture that can be implemented in digital hardware without a phase-locked loop. We derive the equations for maximum a posteriori joint detection of the transmitted symbols and the car-rier phase. The result is a multidimensional optimization problem that we approximate with a two-stage iterative algorithm: The first stage is a symbol-by-symbol soft detector of the carrier phase, and the second stage is a hard-decision phase estimator that uses prior and subsequent soft-phase decisions to obtain a minimum mean-square-error phase estimate by exploiting the temporal cor-relation in the phase-noise process. The received symbols are then derotated by the hard-decision phase estimates, and maximum-likelihood sequence detection of the symbols follows. As each com-ponent in the carrier-recovery unit can be separately optimized, the resulting system is highly flexible. We show that the optimum hard-decision phase estimator is a linear filter whose impulse re-sponse consists of a causal and an anticausal exponential sequence, which we can truncate and implement as an finite-impulse-response filter. We derive equations for the phase-error variance and the system bit-error ratio (BER). Our results show that 4, 8, and 16 <b>quadrature-amplitude-modulation</b> (QAM) transmis-sions at 1 dB above sensitivity for BER = 10 − 3 is possible with laser beat linewidths of ∆νTb = 1. 3 × 10 − 4, 1. 3 × 10 − 4, and 1. 5 × 10 − 5 when a decision-directed soft-decision phase estima-tor is employed.
