2500|$|Just {{north of}} the Milne Townsite lies a minor felsic {{volcanic}} vent exposed along the Milne-Sherman Road.

Exposed near a minor felsic lava dome is a fine grained, quartz-phyric felsic rock that may represent a rhyolite lava flow. An igneous body, interpreted to be a subvolcanic intrusion, is exposed approximately [...] to the northwest and might have formed during the same magmatic event as the felsic dome. Exposed along the Sherman Mine railroad west of the former Milne sawmill lumber yard is a porphyritic body composed of quartz-feldspar.

40|$|Four {{economic}} porphyry Cu-Au deposits {{occur at}} Northparkes, New South Wales: Endeavour 22 (E 22),E 26, E 27 and E 48. Mineralisation is centred on thin, pipe-like Late Ordovician to Early Silurian <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> complexes. Nine intrusive phases have been recognised, {{with a common}} sequence of emplacement recognised in all deposits. Pre-mineralisation intrusions include coarsegrained, equigranular monzodiorite and equigranular to weakly porphyritic biotite-quartz monzonite (U-Pb SHRIMP age 444. 2 plus or minus 4. 7 Ma). Three variably felsic <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> phases comprise the mineralised intrusive complexes: (i) volumetrically minor early and late mineralisation biotite-phyric <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> dykes; (ii) abundant synmineralisation K-feldspar-phyric <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> intrusions; and (iii) less abundant syn- to late mineralisation augite-biotite K-feldspar-phyric <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> intrusions. Post-mineralisation basaltic trachyandesite dykes and augitephyric monzonite porphyry dykes are also present (U-Pb SHRIMP age 436. 7 plus or minus 3. 3 Ma), as are younger mafic dykes. The regional volcanic and intrusive rocks define systematic geochemical trends consistent with high-temperature magmatic fractionation of basaltic trachyandesite through trachyte. However, the trace-element compositions and REE patterns of the mineralising intrusions cannot be explained by crystal fractionation alone {{because there is a}} return to more mafic compositions in the waning stages of intrusive activity. The intrusive complexes are interpreted to have formed due to the emplacement of mafic alkaline melts into the base of a crystallising, zoned, monzodiorite to monzonite magma chamber. Shallow crustal fault ruptures above the magma chamber probably caused instantaneous depressurisation and simultaneous egress of <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> and exsolved aqueous fluid into dilatant zones. Localised fracturing and additional volatile exsolution from the quartz monzonite melt is thought to have {{led to the formation of}} the <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> complexes and associated Cu-Au-bearing stockwork veins and related orthoclase alteration. Volatile-rich aqueous fluid partitioned LREE preferentially to MREE and HREE resulting in the development of distinctive U-shaped REE patterns of the ore-related intrusions...|$|R

40|$|The Cadia district, {{located in}} the eastern Lachlan fold belt of New South Wales, Australia, {{comprises}} four gold-copper porphyry deposits (Ridgeway, Cadia Quarry, Cadia Hill, and Cadia East) and two related ironcopper- gold skarn deposits (Big Cadia and Little Cadia). These deposits formed along a northwest-striking, arctransverse structural corridor within the intraoceanic Macquarie arc. This arc is composed of a belt of Early Ordovician to Early Silurian mafic to intermediate volcanic, volcaniclastic, and intrusive rocks of calc-alkalic to alkalic composition. The Cadia porphyry deposits are temporally and genetically associated with composite intrusive complexes of alkalic monzodiorite to quartz monzonite. U-Pb dating of igneous minerals from the intrusions and Re-Os dating of hydrothermal molybdenite from the deposits has revealed the presence of two temporally discrete events of magmatism and related porphyrystyle mineralization in the Cadia district. The monzonitic intrusive complex related to mineralization at Ridgeway and a <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> stock that lies immediately southwest of the Cadia Quarry deposit are early Late Ordovician (456 - 454 Ma). In contrast, the <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> stock that hosts the Cadia Quarry and Cadia Hill orebodies and an intermineral <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> dike at Cadia East are Early Silurian (438 Ma). Re-Os molybdenite ages determined for quartz-sulfide veins within the early Late Ordovician <b>quartz</b> monzonite <b>porphyry</b> confirm multiple episodes of mineralization associated with the Cadia Quarry deposit, suggesting a complex history between 460 and 450 Ma. At Cadia Hill, Cadia Quarry, and Cadia East, a widespread event of porphyry gold-copper mineralization is recorded at about 443 to 441 Ma, based on three Re-Os molybdenite ages from sheeted quartz sulfide veins. Similar ages for magmatic zircon from the host intrusions support a link between dated intrusions and mineralization. These new ages are in general agreement with the ages of other porphyry gold-copper and related epithermal deposits of the Eastern Lachlan fold belt and help to constrain {{the relationship between the}} Cadia region and the evolution of the Lachlan fold belt. It is notable that the high-grade Ridgeway deposit is up to 18 m. y. older than any alkalic porphyry deposit yet discovered in the Macquarie arc, a feature that may be important for continued exploration success in this region...|$|R
