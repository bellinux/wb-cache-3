5|$|The Type 42 destroyers (also {{known as}} the Sheffield class) were made in three batches; Cardiff {{was built in the}} first. She cost over £30million, which was double her {{original}} <b>quoted</b> <b>price.</b> Her keel was laid down on 6 November 1972, at Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering Ltd in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. The build was interrupted by a labour shortage at Vickers. To solve this problem, she was towed to Swan Hunter Hawthorn Leslie yard in Hebburn, Tyne and Wear and completed there.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress {{also made it}} difficult to build the Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the Senate would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the <b>quoted</b> <b>price</b> of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, but the final cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} all railway contracts, {{the price was}} {{calculated}} by multiplying the quantity of each type of work required by the <b>quoted</b> <b>price</b> and summing up the individual amounts. If the survey was altered to require more excavation, the government paid for the extra at the schedule rate. The unstable nature of the terrain in the second section meant that the slopes of cuttings and banks had to be reduced. As Robb had to remove {{five times as much}} material as originally estimated for cuttings and tunnels, he was eventually paid £880,406. He claimed a further £262,311, but only received £20,807 of this after arbitration. With rails and other costs, the second section cost the Queensland Government £1,007,857; the most expensive line in Queensland.|$|E
25|$|The {{air force}} withdrew entirely form {{the airport in}} 1959, which spurred discussions between the {{involved}} parties regarding the ownership of the airport. A settlement was reached in 1960, where the municipalities of Sem and Tønsberg bought the airport for NOK1 million from the state. The following year they sold it for NOK850,000 to Thor Solberg Aviation, {{on the condition that}} the company continue to operate the airport. The first Norwegian championship in radio-controlled aircraft was held at Jarlsberg in 1962. Thor Solberg retained operations at the airport until 1967. The company then attempted to sell the airport, first to Øyvind Skauenfeldt in 1969, then to Sem and Tønsberg Municipalities in 1970 and then to Skauenfeldt again in 1972, but neither were interested in paying the <b>quoted</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is no unified or {{centrally}} cleared {{market for}} the majority of trades, and there is very little cross-border regulation. Due to the over-the-counter (OTC) nature of currency markets, there are rather a number of interconnected marketplaces, where different currencies instruments are traded. This implies {{that there is not a}} single exchange rate but rather a number of different rates (prices), depending on what bank or market maker is trading, and where it is. In practice, the rates are quite close due to arbitrage. Due to London's dominance in the market, a particular currency's <b>quoted</b> <b>price</b> is usually the London market price. Major trading exchanges include Electronic Broking Services (EBS) and Thomson Reuters Dealing, while major banks also offer trading systems. A joint venture of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, called Fxmarketspace opened in 2007 and aspired but failed to the role of a central market clearing mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|Level 2 {{instruments}} {{require more}} involvement in valuing than Level 1 instruments. Level 2 “inputs are inputs other than <b>quoted</b> <b>prices</b> included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, {{either directly or}} indirectly.” For example, an interest rate swap uses known, public data, such as interest rates and the contract terms {{can be used to}} calculate a value of the interest rate swap. The instrument can be valued indirectly using observable data. Another example would be using <b>quoted</b> <b>prices</b> for similar assets or liabilities in active markets.|$|R

2500|$|Foreign {{exchange}} is traded in an over-the-counter market where brokers/dealers negotiate directly with one another, {{so there is}} no central exchange or clearing house. The biggest geographic trading center is the United Kingdom, primarily London. According to TheCityUK, [...] it is estimated that London increased its share of global turnover in traditional transactions from 34.6% in April 2007 to 36.7% in April 2010. Due to London's dominance in the market, a particular currency's <b>quoted</b> <b>price</b> is usually the London market price. For instance, when the International Monetary Fund calculates the value of its special drawing rights every day, they use the London market prices at noon that day.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{clustering}} pattern in trade and <b>quote</b> <b>prices</b> on the electronic limit order {{book of the}} Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK). Earlier research into clustering focuses on transaction prices only. We study clustering on <b>quote</b> <b>prices</b> over a maximum of five queues on the limit order book. We observe abnormally high frequency of even and integer prices in trade and <b>quote</b> <b>prices</b> for all tick size groups on the SEHK. The deeper quotes display stronger clustering than the best quotes, indicating that the farther away the quotes are from the best queue, the less information they carry. Our analysis further reveals that an extremely fine tick size itself works as a binding constraint to hinder price resolution process. We also find that short sale prohibition imposed on the majority of stocks listed on the SEHK causes a significant bias in clustering towards the ask side of the limit order book. This implies that a short sale prohibition impairs efficient price discovery in the market. Key words: electronic limit-order book, price clustering, short sale restrictions, asymmetry in price clusterin...|$|R
