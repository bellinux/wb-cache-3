2500|$|The gold-leaf {{electroscope}} {{was one of}} the [...] instruments used {{to indicate}} electric charge. It is still used for science demonstrations but has been superseded in most applications by electronic measuring instruments. The instrument consists of two thin leaves of gold foil suspended from an electrode. [...] When the electrode is charged by induction or by contact, the leaves acquire similar electric charges and repel each other due to the Coulomb force. Their separation is a direct indication of the net charge stored on them. On the glass opposite the leaves, pieces of tin foil may be pasted, so that when the leaves diverge fully they may discharge into the ground. [...] The leaves may be enclosed in a glass envelope to protect them from drafts, and the envelope may be evacuated to minimize charge leakage. A further cause of charge leakage is ionizing radiation, so to prevent this, the electrometer must be surrounded by lead shielding. [...] This principle has been used to detect ionizing radiation, as seen in the <b>quartz</b> <b>fibre</b> <b>electrometer</b> and Kearny fallout meter.|$|E

In 1895 he published a measurement of the gravitational constant G that improved upon the accuracy achieved by Cavendish.

40|$|Poly(2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) chains {{were grown}} from near-monodisperse 13 µm {{diameter}} <b>quartz</b> <b>fibres</b> using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) {{at ambient temperature}} in 1 : 1 methanol–water at 20 °C. A covalently-bound siloxane-based ATRP initiator provided a sufficiently high grafting density to obtain polymer brushes from this model substrate. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the PMPC brush coverage on this model fibre substrate is both thick and uniform, since the Si signals due to the underlying quartz are obscured. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on selected PMPC-coated <b>quartz</b> <b>fibres</b> indicates a monotonic increase in PMPC brush thickness and reasonably good agreement was obtained with ellipsometry data, which was obtained indirectly for the corresponding PMPC brushes grown in situ from planar silicon wafers placed in the same reaction vessel as the <b>quartz</b> <b>fibres.</b> The dimensions of the thickest PMPC brush grown from the fibres could also be estimated by scanning electron microscopy. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed a linear increase in the ester carbonyl band intensity for increasing target brush thickness, as expected. Rutherford back-scattering spectrometry (RBS) analyses also reported brush thicknesses that correlated linearly with this ester carbonyl band, but this technique appears to underestimate brush dimensions relative to TGA and ellipsometry. This is presumably due to in situ beam damage during RBS analysis. Friction force microscopy studies were conducted for both PMPC-coated and bare fibres immersed in water. Compared to the bare fibres, {{the presence of the}} PMPC chains led to a reduction in the relative frictional coefficient by more than an order of magnitude.

40|$|An in-situ {{derivatization}} {{thermal desorption}} method followed by gas chromatography and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (IDTD-GC-TOFMS) {{was developed for}} determination of polar organic compounds. Hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of compounds such as anhydrous sugars, alcohols and phenols, fatty acids and resin acids are targets of the derivatization procedure. Derivatization is based on silylation with N-Methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) during the step of thermal desorption. The high temperature of 300 &deg;C during desorption is utilized for the in-situ derivatization on the collection substrate (<b>quartz</b> <b>fibre</b> filters) accelerating the reaction rate. Thereby, the analysis time is as short as without derivatization. At first the filter surface is dampened with derivatization reagent before insertion of the sample into the thermal desorption unit. To ensure ongoing derivatization during thermal desorption the carrier gas is saturated with MSTFA until the desorption procedure is finished. The method introduced here was compared with direct thermal desorption gas chromatography time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (DTD-GC-TOFMS) and with solvent extraction (SE) procedures followed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.

Study Design: Ninety single-rooted human premolars were endodontically treated and standardized post-spaces were prepared. Fibre posts were cemented with different luting agents: total-etch (Nexus NX 3, Duo-Link, and RelyX ARC) and self-adhesive resin cements (Maxcem Elite, BisCem, and RelyX Unicem). Three post/dentin sections (coronal, middle and apical) were obtained from each specimen, and push-out bond strength test was performed in each section at a cross-head speed of 0. 5 mm/min. Data was analyzed with two-factor and one-way analysis of variance and a post-hoc Tukey test at a significance level of p < 0. 05. Results: Cement type, canal region, and their interaction significantly influenced bond strength. Significantly higher bond strength values were observed in the apical region of self-adhesive cements. Only Duo-Link and RelyX ARC cements resulted in homogeneous bond strengths. Conclusions: Cementation of <b>quartz</b> <b>fibre</b> posts using self-adhesive cements provided higher push-out bond strengths especially in the apical region, while total-etch cements resulted in more uniform bond strengths in different regions of the root canal. © Medicina Oral...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and application of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to investigate interfacial photoelectrochemical processes occurring at supported TiO sub 2 surfaces. The new SECM approach, involving both amperometric and potentiometric electrodes, was used to monitor interfacial photoprocesses with high spatial resolution. A new in situ photoelectrochemical approach to chemical actinometry has been developed and used to determine the light flux through a <b>quartz</b> <b>fibre</b> employed in the SECM system. In this system an ultramicroelectrode (UME) probe is positioned with high precision at a known distance close to a TiO sub 2 -coated fibre and used to detect reactants or products of the ongoing photodegradation process. The microelectrochemical actinometry approach was developed using the well-known liquid phase potassium ferrioxalate actinometer. The approach involved recording the steady-state current for Fe(lll) reduction at an SECM tip positioned close to the fibre. A step function in the light flux (off-on) was then applied and the resulting chronoamperometric behaviour due to the reduction of Fe(lll) at the UME was recorded as a function of tip-fibre separation distance. A theoretical model has been developed to simulate experimental current-time profiles, which allowed the light flux through the <b>quartz</b> <b>fibre</b> to be quantified. An experimental approach to investigating the photoelectrochemical reduction of oxygen at UV-illuminated TiO sub 2 surfaces, in aqueous aerated and oxygenated electrolyte solutions, in the absence and presence of hole scavengers, has been developed.

40|$|International audienceU-Pb and Th-Pb dating of {{monazite}} from hydrothermal quartz veins ("alpine veins") {{from the}} Lauzière massif (North Belledonne) together with Ar / Ar ages of adularias {{from the same}} veins constrain {{the age of the}} last tectono-metamorphic events that affected the External Crystalline Massifs (ECM). Ages obtained are surprisingly young. The study of the structural context of the veins combined with our chronological data, allow us to propose a tectonic scenario of the northern ECM for the 15 - 5 Ma period which was poorly documented so far. The quartz veins are of two types: - (i) the oldest are poorly mineralized (chlorite and epidote), flat-lying veins. The <b>quartz</b> <b>fibres</b> (= extension direction) are near vertical and seem to be associated with a subvertical dissolution schistosity superimposed upon an early alpine deformation underlined by "mini-biotite". They bear a sub-horizontal stretching lineation. - (ii) the youngest veins are very rich in various minerals (anatase, rutile, phénacite, meneghinite, beryl, synchysite, [...] ). They are almost vertical. Their "en echelon" geometry as well as the horizontal attitude of their <b>quartz</b> <b>fibres</b> show a dextral strike-slip regime. Two groups of Th-Pb ages have been obtained: 11 to 10 Ma and 7 to 5 Ma. They were obtained from the most recent veins (vertical veins) sampled in different areas of the massif. The ca. 10 Ma ages are related to veins in the Lauzière granite and its metamorphic country-rocks at about 2 km from the eastern contact of the massif, while the ages of ca. 5 Ma correspond to veins occurring in mylonites along this contact. Adularias provided Ar / Ar ages at ca. 7 Ma. By contrast, a monazite from a vein of the Pelvoux massif (Plan du Lac) yielded a Th-Pb age of 17. 6 Ma but in a different structural setting. Except fission track ages, there are very little ages of this range published in the recent literature on the Alps. The latter concern always gold mineralized veins (NE Mont Blanc and SW Lepontine dome). The last compressive tectonic regime dated between 15 and 12 Ma is coeval with (i) the late "Roselend thrust" event, which is recorded in the Mont Blanc by shear-zones with vertical lineation, (ii) the last movements in the basal mylonites of the Swiss Nappes, (iii) the horizontal Alpine veins from the Mont Blanc and Belledonne massifs (with vertical <b>quartz</b> <b>fibres)</b> which are similar to the early veins of the Lauzière. On the contrary, the vertical veins of the Lauzière, dated between 11 and 5 Ma, correspond to a dextral strike slip regime. This suggests that most of the strike-slip tectonics along the ECM took place during two stages (ca. 10 Ma and ca. 7 - 5 Ma) and not only at 18 Ma as had been proposed previously. Our ages are consistent with the late Miocene-Pliocene overlap of the Digne thrust to the South and to part of the normal movement along the Simplon fault to the North. Thus, all the external crystalline massifs were tectonically active during the late Miocene. This suggests that tectonic events in the external alpine belt may have contributed to some extent to the geodynamical causes of the Messinian crisis...|$|R
40|$|The work {{conducted}} {{in this thesis}} had the following objectives: (1) to develop improved methods for a better discrimination between organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) using the thermal-optical transmission (TOT) technique; (2) to deploy improved collection procedures for carbonaceous aerosols, whereby the sampling artifacts are better controlled or can be corrected for; (3) to perform detailed carbonaceous aerosol characterisation studies in Belgium and at urban and forested sites throughout Europe and (4) in the Brazilian Amazon basin, the tropical Atlantic Ocean, and at Amsterdam Island in the Indian Ocean. With regard to objective (1), the OC/EC split in three different temperature programs was examined for samples from widely different origins. This study confirmed that the OC/EC split in TOT depends upon the temperature program used, particularly {{that in the first}} phase of the analysis (in pure He). As to objective (2), a denuded sampling setup (with upstream of the filter holder with two <b>quartz</b> <b>fibre</b> filters a denuder for volatile organic compounds and oxidising inorganic gases) and the tandem filter method (with two <b>quartz</b> <b>fibre</b> filters in series without denuder) were used in parallel for low-volume PM 2. 5 collections in several campaigns since 2002. It was found that subtracting the back filter OC from the front filter OC yields “artifact-free” particulate OC data. With regard to objective (3), the median PM 2. 5 EC concentrations at our various sites in Europe ranged from 0. 07 μg/m 3 in the 2007 campaign at Hyytiälä, Finland, to 3. 3 μg/m 3 during the 2002 campaign at a kerbside site in Budapest. There was a general increasing trend for EC levels from forested sites, to urban sites, and to kerbside sites, reflecting the increasing impact of local anthropogenic emissions, especially those from traffic. For OC, however, there was no clear spatial trend. As to objective (4), the OC and EC data from a 2006 oceanic cruise in the northern hemisphere contrasted substantially with those found for Amsterdam Island. At the latter site, EC was below the detection limit (of 10 ng/m 3) and total OC was around a factor of 4 lower than during the northern hemisphere cruise...|$|R
40|$|A new in situ {{electrochemical}} actinometry {{method has}} been developed and {{used to determine the}} light flux through a <b>quartz</b> <b>fibre,</b> employed in a scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) system developed to study the kinetics of interfacial photochemical processes. In this system an ultramicroelectrode (UME) probe is positioned with high precision at a known distance close {{to the end of the}} fibre, through which light is guided, and used to detect reactants or products of the ongoing photochemical process. The microelectrochemical actinometer was developed using the well-known liquid phase potassium ferrioxalate actinometer. The approach involved recording the steady-state current for Fe(III) reduction at a 25 mum diameter disc-shaped ultramicroelectrode (UME) positioned close to the fibre. A step function in the light flux through the fibre (off-on) was then applied which led to a depletion in the local Fe(III) concentration. The resulting chronoamperometric behaviour at the UME, as a consequence of the solution photochemical process, was measured. A theoretical model {{has been developed}} to simulate experimental current-time profiles, which enabled measurements of the light flux initiating the photoprocess...|$|R
