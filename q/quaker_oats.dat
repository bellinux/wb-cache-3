5|$|The storyline {{was written}} by former Star Trek writer D.C. Fontana, while the script was created by John Meredyth Lucas. A promotional cereal {{competition}} was run in conjunction with <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats,</b> the first for the license in the United States. Despite this promotion, the game was cancelled with estimates placing it at only 5% completion. The cast of The Original Series had already recorded their voices. Lead engineer Thom Robertson later explained the studio had underestimated {{the cost of the}} game and the difficulties in filming the clay models.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of Sunkist v. Sunkist and <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> Co. v. General Mills, the court created a long-standing {{precedent}} in their decision {{making it possible for}} different companies to use the same brand and product name as long as they produced dissimilar products. In another case, the court set a short-lived precedent allowing companies to artificially raise prices in local markets if the purpose was to artificially lower prices in another market to remain competitive. After Minton joined the U.S. Supreme Court, the decision was appealed to that body; Minton recused himself from the case, which the court decided to overturn. In another decision, Minton was in the majority that ruled under the Sherman Antitrust Act that the New York Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company was a monopoly, ordering the company to break up its grocery business. Minton was also in the majority in several cases filed to enforce decisions made by the National Labor Relations Board, usually to end worker strikes.|$|E
5|$|With {{the effects}} of the late-2000s {{recession}} reducing breakfast traffic to the stores, Burger King announced that it was making the first wholesale changes to its breakfast line-up in many years. In early 2010, Burger King tested a new group of breakfast products under its new BK Brunch product line; a reintroduced English muffin sandwich, a sandwich featuring ciabatta bread, a pair of breakfast bowls, and a non-alcoholic mimosa. In September, a slightly modified variation of the menu was taken national during one of the largest menu expansions in the company's history. Chief Marketing Officer Mike Kappitt said breakfast produced 12 percent of the company's income, but that was only half of what McDonald's made. Part of the expansion was a major advertising campaign that encouraged people to change their minds about skipping breakfast at a time of high unemployment. 3G Capital has continued the expansion of the breakfast program with the introduction of <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> Company oatmeal to its menu in late 2011. Oatmeal {{has been shown to be}} a popular addition to breakfast menus industry-wide due to its low cost, ease in preparation and perception as a healthy, whole-grain option. Analysts from industry analytic firm Technomic stated that it was a good move for Burger King to add a winning product to its menu, but that it should have tried to be more creative by adding other, similar products such as grits.|$|E
25|$|The {{divestments}} concluding in 1997 {{were followed}} by multiple large-scale acquisitions, as PepsiCo began to extend its operations beyond soft drinks and snack foods into other lines of foods and beverages. PepsiCo purchased the orange juice company Tropicana Products in 1998, and merged with <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> Company in 2001, adding with it the Gatorade sports drink line and other <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> brands such as Chewy Granola Bars and Aunt Jemima, among others.|$|E

He received commercial interest from <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> but declined the company's initial offer.|$|E
25|$|Peterborough {{would also}} see {{extensive}} industrial growth {{as the city}} {{was one of the}} first places in the country to begin generating hydro electrical power (even before the plants at Niagara Falls). Companies like Edison General Electric Company (later Canadian General Electric) and America Cereal Company (later to become <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats,</b> and in 2001 PepsiCo, Inc.), opened to take advantage of this new cheap resource.|$|E

25|$|No {{longer the}} {{dominant}} local industry, manufacturing {{is still one}} of the key sectors along with food processing, automotive supplies, electronics, aerospace and life sciences/biotechnology. General Electric (since 1892) and <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> maintain large operations in Peterborough, as well, the city is also a 'bedroom' community for workers commuting to Oshawa and East Toronto. The Peterborough Regional Health Centre is the largest employer, with about 2,000 employees.

25|$|Railroads made {{industry}} possible. Before 1870, Iowa contained some manufacturing {{firms in}} river towns. Most new industry {{were based on}} food processing or farm machinery. In Cedar Rapids, John and Robert Stuart, along with their cousin, George Douglas, started an oats processing plant. In time, this firm took the name <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats.</b> Meat packing plants also appeared in the 1870s {{in different parts of}} the state: Sinclair Meat Packing opened in Cedar Rapids, Booge and Company started in Sioux City, and John Morrell & Company set up operations in Ottumwa.|$|E
25|$|The {{book was}} first {{made into a}} feature film as a musical, titled Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971), {{directed}} by Mel Stuart, produced by David L. Wolper, and starring Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, character actor Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, and Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket. The film had an estimated budget of $2.9million but grossed only $4million and was considered a box-office disappointment. Exponential home video and DVD sales, as well as repeated television airings, resulted in the film's subsequently becoming a cult classic. Concurrently with the 1971 film, the <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> Company introduced a line of candies whose marketing uses the book's characters and imagery.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, the {{multinational}} {{food and beverage}} company PepsiCo acquired Gatorade's parent company, the <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> Company, for $13 billion in order to add Gatorade to its portfolio of brands. PepsiCo had also recently developed All Sport, which it divested of shortly following the Quaker acquisition to satisfy antitrust regulations. Worldwide development of Gatorade continued into the 2000s, including expansion into India in 2004, and the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2008. As of 2010, Gatorade products were made available for sale in more than 80 countries.

In 1990, Gatorade introduced Gatorade Light, a lower-calorie version sweetened with saccharin. International expansion came {{at the cost of}} $20 million in 1996 alone; however the resulting efforts produced worldwide sales of $283 million in more than 45 countries during the same year. In 1997, distribution of Gatorade in an additional 10 countries prompted an 18.7 percent growth in annual sales.|$|E
25|$|The New York {{advertising}} agency J. Walter Thompson, now JWT, arranged sponsorship by the <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats</b> Company of the Survival one-hour The World of the Beaver {{and took a}} more general interest in Survivalâ€™s output.

In partnership with JWT, Survival Anglia set up a New York office, {{and became the first}} UK television series to form its own American company. Two JWT executives, Jack Ball and Farlan Myers, were appointed to the SAL board. JWT also provided writers to adapt Survival shows for American audiences - Frank Gannon, Ken Thoren and Jim de Kay - while leading Hollywood actors were routinely engaged for the commentaries.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{served as}} a Naval Aviator during World War II and the Korean War. Unlike many other major league players, he did not spend all of his war-time playing on service teams. Williams had been {{classified}} 3-A by Selective Service prior to the war, a dependency deferment because he was his mother's sole means of financial support. When his classification was changed to 1-A following the American entry into World War II, Williams appealed to his local draft board. The draft board ruled that his draft status {{should not have been}} changed. He made a public statement that once he had built up his mother's trust fund, he intended to enlist. Even so, criticism in the media, including withdrawal of an endorsement contract by <b>Quaker</b> <b>Oats,</b> resulted in his enlistment in the U.S. Navy Reserve on May 22, 1942.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{was born}} on January 7, 1881, in Tillsonburg, Ontario, a town named for his {{great-grandfather}} George. His grandfather, Edwin Delevan Tillson, was the builder {{of what is now}} the Annandale National Historic Site. As a child, Harrison was considered a troublemaker. On one occasion he locked his grandmother in her bedroom and on another became a local newspaper sensation after his attempt to travel to Cuba was discovered.

Soon after, he moved to New York City to join the United States Army Engineers and serve as part of the peacekeeping force in the Philippines after the defeat of Spain in 1898, and for a brief period to help put down the Boxer Rebellion in China. Mostly involved in the running of labor gangs building supply roads to remote areas, Harrison was involved in only one firefight. However, when his maternal grandfather, Edwin [...] "E.D."
