5|$|Jonathan Ke <b>Quan</b> as Short Round: Indy's eleven-year-old Chinese sidekick, {{who drives}} the 1936 Auburn Boat Tail Speedster which allows Indy to escape {{during the opening}} sequence. <b>Quan</b> was chosen {{as part of a}} casting call in Los Angeles. Around 6000 actors auditioned {{worldwide}} for the part: <b>Quan</b> was cast after his brother auditioned for the role. Spielberg liked his personality, so he and Ford improvised the scene where Short Round accuses Indy of cheating during a card game. He was credited by his birthname, Ke Huy <b>Quan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mortal Kombat X sees Shinnok and <b>Quan</b> Chi {{enacting}} their plan, leading {{an army of}} undead revenants {{of those}} that were killed in Shao Kahn's invasion against the realms. A team of warriors led by Raiden, Johnny Cage, and Sonya Blade oppose Shinnok, and in the ensuing battle, Shinnok is imprisoned, <b>Quan</b> Chi escapes, and various warriors are resurrected and freed from Shinnok's thrall. Twenty-five years later, <b>Quan</b> Chi resurfaces and allies himself with the insect-like D'Vorah in manipulating events that lead to Shinnok's release. Though <b>Quan</b> Chi is killed by a vengeful Scorpion in the process, Shinnok resumes his assault against the realms. After a grueling, protracted battle, Shinnok is defeated by Cassandra Cage representing {{the next generation of}} Earthrealm's warriors. With both <b>Quan</b> Chi and Shinnok gone, the undead revenants of Liu Kang and Kitana assume control of the Netherrealm and Lord Raiden now protects the Earthrealm not defensively but offensively {{with the help of the}} remaining revenants.|$|E

5|$|In , {{the evil}} sorcerers <b>Quan</b> Chi and Shang Tsung join forces {{to conquer the}} realms. By , after several fights, the sorcerers emerge victorious having killed most of Earthrealms' warriors until Raiden steps forth to oppose them. The Dragon King Onaga, who had been freed by Reptile {{at the end of}} Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance, had deceived Shujinko into searching for six pieces of Kamidogu, the source of Onaga's power. Onaga then confronted the {{alliance}} of Raiden, Shang Tsung, and <b>Quan</b> Chi and thus obtained <b>Quan</b> Chi's amulet, the final piece of his power. Only a few warriors remained to combat against the Dragon King and his forces. Shujinko eventually triumphed over the Dragon King and removed his threat to the Mortal Kombat universe.|$|E

Lê Văn Duyệt High School in Saigon was named after him.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Red Cliffs, {{otherwise}} known as the Battle of Chibi, was a decisive battle fought {{at the end of}} the Han dynasty, about twelve years prior to the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history. It was fought in the winter of AD 208/9 between the allied forces of the southern warlords Liu Bei and Sun <b>Quan</b> and the numerically superior forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao. Liu Bei and Sun <b>Quan</b> successfully frustrated Cao Cao's effort to conquer the land south of the Yangtze River and reunite the territory of the Eastern Han dynasty. The allied victory at Red Cliffs ensured the survival of Liu Bei and Sun <b>Quan,</b> gave them control of the Yangtze , and provided a line of defence that was the basis for the later creation of the two southern states of Shu Han and Eastern Wu. The battle has been called the largest naval battle in history in terms of numbers involved.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} martial arts traditions, {{particularly}} the ones falling {{under the category}} of Neijia (like T'ai Chi Ch'uan, Bagua Zhang and Xing Yi <b>Quan)</b> embody Taoist principles to a significant extent, and some practitioners consider their art a means of practising Taoism.|$|E

5|$|According to interviews, the {{characters}} {{were chosen for}} their popularity, and for parallels between them from both universes. Boon has said that some of {{the characters}}' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been toned down to make them balanced within Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic. Boon revealed that two new characters were developed as downloadable content, <b>Quan</b> Chi from Mortal Kombat and Harley Quinn from DC comics but had been discarded. He had also hinted earlier at the prospect of Kung Lao and Doomsday being downloadable characters.|$|E
5|$|After Cao's {{defeat at}} the naval Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 AD, China was divided into three spheres of influence, with Cao Cao {{dominating}} the north, Sun <b>Quan</b> (182–252 AD) dominating the south, and Liu Bei (161–223 AD) dominating the west. Cao Cao died in March 220 AD. By December his son Cao Pi (187–226 AD) had Emperor Xian relinquish the throne to him and is known posthumously as Emperor Wen of Wei. This formally ended the Han dynasty and initiated an age of conflict between three states: Cao Wei, Eastern Wu, and Shu Han.|$|E

5|$|During {{the rainy}} night of 2 January 1968, six men {{dressed in black}} uniforms were seen outside the {{defensive}} wire of the main base by members of a listening post. After failing {{to respond to a}} challenge, they were fired upon and five were killed outright while the sixth, although wounded, escaped. This event prompted Cushman to reinforce Lownds {{with the rest of the}} 2nd Battalion, 26th Marines. This marked the first time that all three battalions of the 26th Marine Regiment had operated together in combat since the invasion of Iwo Jima during the Second World War. To cover a defilade near the Rao <b>Quan</b> River, four companies from 2/26 were immediately sent out to occupy Hill 558, with another manning Hill 861A.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long {{handled the}} {{northern}} and southern regions of Vietnam cautiously, not wanting them to be jarred by rapid centralization after centuries of national division. Tonkin, with the administrative seat of its imperial military protector (<b>quan</b> tổng trấn) at Hanoi, had thirteen provinces (tổng trấn Bắc Thành), and in the Red River Delta, the old officials of the Le administration continued in office. In the south, Saigon was the capital of the four provinces of Cochinchina (tổng trấn Nam Hà), as well as the seat of the military protector. The citadels in the respective cities directly administered their military defense zones. This system allowed Gia Long to reward his leading supporters with highly powerful positions, giving them almost total autonomy in ordinary administrative and legal matters. This system persisted until 183132, when his son Minh Mạng centralized the national government.|$|E
5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: <b>Quan</b> Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Triple Gate (Tam <b>Quan)</b> is {{accessible}} by both pedestrians and vehicles. Two-wheeled vehicles and pedestrians use {{the left and}} right wings respectively, and cars, buses, and trucks can use the central wing. The three gates represent emptiness, impermanence and middle-view. It is decorated with sculptures and engravings of lotuses, lanterns and swastikas, all prominent symbols in Buddhism. On the left hand side of the grounds, there is a Bodhi tree, a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha. The tree is located in a concrete lotus, and around it are eight samsara-wheel-shaped signs that represent the Noble Eightfold Path. Signs with text explain each of the eight paths.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} theories concerning when the text was completed and concerning {{the identity of}} the author or authors, but archeological recoveries show The Art of War had taken roughly its current form by at least the early Han. Because it is impossible to prove definitively when the Art of War was completed before this date, the differing theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely resolved. Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as Li <b>Quan</b> and Du Mu.|$|E
5|$|Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm is a Buddhist {{temple in}} Ho Chi Minh City, {{the largest city}} in Vietnam. It was founded in 1965 and is the spiritual birthplace of the khất sĩ {{tradition}} of Vietnamese Buddhism that attempts to recreate the original tradition of the Buddhist sangha by walking barefoot and begging for alms. The temple is located at 7 Nguyễn Trung Trực Street, in Bình Thạnh District. It {{is known for its}} weekly Bát <b>Quan</b> Trai Giới (Eight Precept Ritual) retreat, which is staged more frequently than at other institutions in the city, and has a reputation among its followers for rigour and discipline. The attendees of the temple are typically over 40 years of age and are overwhelmingly female.|$|E
5|$|At around 6:50 am on 5 April, the Viet Cong 5th Division {{moved across}} the Cambodian border to stage the main attack on Lộc Ninh. The Viet Cong assault opened with a heavy barrage of artillery, rocket and mortar fire {{targeting}} {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment and the Lộc Ninh district compound. The Viet Cong simultaneously mounted other attacks throughout the ARVN 5th Infantry Division's areas of operations in Lai Khê and <b>Quần</b> Lợi. There was also indirect fire on South Vietnamese positions in Phước Long Province, mainly targeting Phước Vinh, Sông Bé, and Bo Duc. Following the artillery barrage, Viet Cong infantry, supported by about 25 tanks, attacked Lộc Ninh from the west. In the initial assault, they tried to overrun the South Vietnamese regimental compound located {{at the south end of}} the airstrip. Despite the ferocity of the onslaught, South Vietnamese soldiers held their ground and fought desperately to hold the enemy at bay; South Vietnamese artillerymen lowered the muzzles of their 105mm howitzers and fired directly at enemy infantry formations moving through the rubber trees.|$|E
5|$|By February 1864, Admiral Bonard had {{accumulated}} sufficient reinforcements to attack and seize Định's main strongholds in the Tan Hoa and Gò Công areas. He inflicted heavy casualties on the partisans and {{forced them to}} retreat in disarray. Định reorganised his troops and procured more firearms from the local Chinese in order to resume his guerrilla campaign. He attempted to widen his support base by distributing leaflets {{as far as the}} regional centres of Saigon and Mỹ Tho, calling on nghĩa <b>quân</b> from other provinces to join the common struggle. By this time, the French were able to keep Định and the other resistance leaders constantly on the move, aided by a growing network of local informants. In 1863, a famine had broken out, and resistance forces were increasingly unable to find food. With the court providing no practical support, the French gradually wore down the partisans. Định retreated into the marshes of Bien Hoa, where he attempted to reorganise his forces.|$|E
5|$|In the east, the Chinese {{military}} campaigns {{were less}} successful than elsewhere. Like the emperors of the Sui dynasty before him, Taizong established a military campaign in 644 against {{the kingdom of}} Goguryeo in the Goguryeo-Tang War; however, this led to its withdrawal in the first campaign because they failed to overcome the successful defense led by General Yeon Gaesomun. Allying with the Korean Silla Kingdom, the Chinese fought against Baekje and their Yamato Japanese allies in the Battle of Baekgang in August 663, a decisive Tang–Silla victory. The Tang dynasty navy had several different ship types at its disposal to engage in naval warfare, these ships described by Li <b>Quan</b> in his Taipai Yinjing (Canon of the White and Gloomy Planet of War) of 759. The Battle of Baekgang was actually a restoration movement by remnant forces of Baekje, since their kingdom was toppled in 660 by a joint Tang–Silla invasion, led by Chinese general Su Dingfang and Korean general Kim Yushin (595–673). In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645. With joint attacks by Silla and Tang armies under commander Li Shiji (594–669), the Kingdom of Goguryeo was destroyed by 668.|$|E
5|$|Inoculation, {{treatment}} of smallpox: Joseph Needham states that {{a case of}} inoculation for smallpox may have existed in the late 10th century during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), yet they rely on a book Zhongdou xinfa (種痘心法) written in 1808 by Zhu Yiliang for this evidence. Wan <b>Quan</b> (1499–1582) wrote the first clear reference to smallpox inoculation in his Douzhen xinfa (痘疹心法) of 1549. The process of inoculation was also vividly described by Yu Chang in his Yuyi cao (寓意草), or Notes on My Judgment published in 1643, and Zhang Yan in his Zhongdou xinshu (種痘新書), or New book on smallpox inoculation in 1741. As written by Yu Tianchi in his Shadou jijie (痧痘集解) of 1727, {{which was based on}} Wang Zhangren's Douzhen jinjing lu (痘疹金鏡錄) of 1579, the technique of inoculation to avoid smallpox was not widespread in China until the reign of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567– 1572) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).|$|E
5|$|Liu Bei {{proceeds}} to {{campaign in the}} southlands {{to get rid of}} Wu's threat, as Wu had backed a Nanman rebellion by King Meng Huo. In Nanzhong, he systematically defeated Meng Huo for a total of seven times, as Zhuge Liang cleverly resisted the Nanman armor troops and also pacified the poison marshes. After taking down Meng Huo, Shu proceeded to capture Fan Castle from Wei's Cao Ren, and also defeated Wu reinforcements under Lu Meng and traitors under Mi Fang and Fu Shiren. The final battle with Wu was at the Battle of Yi Ling, where Liu Bei braved a Wu fire attack and defeated (if Wu falls first, kills) Sun Jian and his officers. If Wei has been defeated before Wu, Liu Bei {{proceeds to}} attack Jianye, and sees through Sun Jian's body double trickery and kills Sun Jian, Sun Ce, Sun <b>Quan,</b> and Sun Shangxiang.|$|E
5|$|Skye {{tries to}} defend them both, {{but when the}} team finds {{evidence}} that Lydon was paid substantially for the information, she turns on him and cooperates with the agents. The team tracks the buyer, Raina, to a Project Centipede facility in Hong Kong, where they are draining Chan's fire-resistant platelets against his will, to use as stabilizers for the extremis serum within their super-soldiers. Chan, angry with this betrayal and with S.H.I.E.L.D. for constricting him, attacks both. He kills, among others, <b>Quan</b> and the Centipede head doctor Debbie. Realizing that Chan can't be reasoned with, Coulson and May inject him with a large dose of extremis, causing him to explode. Lydon, convinced that what he did is harming people, helps by using his hacking skills to direct the blast through the ventilation and out {{the top of the}} building, while the others escape to safety.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{was stopped}} {{on their first}} drive due to an {{unsuccessful}} fourth down conversion. Baylor's first possession ended when UT's Michael Huff intercepted a pass from Baylor's Terrance Park. Longhorn Jamaal Charles scored a touchdown on the drive but the kick was blocked, giving Texas the only first-quarter score and a 6–0 lead. Texas extended {{the lead in the}} secondquarter with rushing touchdowns from Henry Melton, Jamaal Charles, and Ramonce Taylor. Taylor made two more touchdowns in the thirdquarter and <b>Quan</b> Cosby caught a touchdown pass from Young. In the fourth quarter, Taylor scored his fourthtouchdown and backup quarterback Matt Nordgren scored on an odd play where he was hit and fumbled while scrambling for the goal line but the ball traveled forward at about the same speed he was running and bounced right back up into his hands. Texas won the 2005game 62–0 making it the only shutout of the 2005season for the Longhorns.|$|E
5|$|The thirdquarter {{started with}} {{promising}} drives by both teams, each ending {{when the ball}} was intercepted. Brandon Foster ran the Longhorns' interception back to the A eight-yard line and Texas scored a touchdown on the next play to pull the Longhorns within sevenpoints. The Aggies drove to the Texas 34yard line, but the drive stalled out and Texas took over on downs as the fourth-down attempt failed. Colt McCoy fumbled a few plays later to give the ball back to Texas A Fiveplays later, Stephen McGee scampered {{into the end zone}} for a five-yard touchdown to put the Aggies up 24–10. The Longhorns took little time to answer with a touchdown of their own. <b>Quan</b> Cosby returned the following kickoff 91yards for a touchdown to pull Texas within seven once again. The next drive started on the Aggie 49-yard line, courtesy of a 42-yard kickoff return by E.J. Shankle. The quarter ended on a seven-yard pass to Mike Goodson.|$|E
