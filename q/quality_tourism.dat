40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University of BedfordshireTourism destinations need to continuously improve in quality to succeed, if not to survive. To improve quality, current levels need to be measured to identify areas requiring improvement. However, no adequate technique for measuring the <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination has yet been developed. More importantly, tourists' understanding {{of the meaning of}} the term 'quality of a tourism destination' has not been investigated; a pre-requisite step for developing a technique for measuring the <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination. This thesis aims to ascertain the attributes and dimensions of <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination and to specify implications {{for the development of a}} technique for measuring its quality. To achieve this aim, a qualitative research approach is employed in the first stage of the thesis. The findings from this stage are used to inform the ensuing, mainly quantitative phase. The main results are summarised here. Firstly, seventy-five attributes and twelve dimensions of <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination were revealed in the qualitative phase of the study. Secondly, in the quantitative stage, an analysis of mean score values revealed that tourists strongly associated all seventy-five attributes and twelve dimensions with the <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination. Thirdly, it was established that the twelve dimensions of <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination differ in either breadth or scope from both service quality dimensions widely used in <b>tourism</b> and product <b>quality</b> dimensions from the quality management field. This thesis suggests that the <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination can best be defined as 'conformance to tourist requirements'. The main hypothesis; that there are significant differences in interpretations of the meaning of 'quality of a tourism destination' within groups oftourists, is rejected. Finally, the thesis ascertains that a tool for measuring the <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination can be developed based on the findings of the thesis. Such a tool, though predominantly quantitative, should include open-ended questions. This would allow changing tourist needs to be captured periodically and the results used to update the tool for measuring the <b>quality</b> of a <b>tourism</b> destination...|$|R

40|$|In {{the ever}} more {{competitive}} nature-based tourism market, service providers must maintain every edge to remain competitive. Owing to the customer-oriented service endeavours, tourism enterprises, either private or public, {{need to improve}} their service offerings so as to retain or improve their market share. To help service providers identify their strengths and weaknesses, the most widely accepted measurement scale for service quality is the SERVQUAL instrument. One of the criticisms levelled against the SERVQUAL scale is its inappropriateness as a generic measure for all service settings. Empirical research as to the dimensionality of service quality within a professional service environment, in particular, tourism sector, is scant and this study, therefore, is aimed to extend the line of research in service quality measurement. Based on data gathered from 320 tourists, the study brought to light four interpretable service <b>quality</b> dimensions for <b>tourism</b> services: Assurance, Tangibility, Responsiveness and Reliability. The overall <b>quality</b> of <b>tourism</b> services as provided by the Kashmir Valley to its tourists is slightly satisfactory.
