6000|$|It is a misfortune for all honest critics, {{that hardly}} any quality {{of art is}} {{independently}} to be praised, and {{without reference to the}} motive from which it resulted, and the place in which it appears; so that no principle can be simply enforced but it shall seem to countenance a vice; while the work of <b>qualification</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanation</b> both weakens the force of what is said, and is not perhaps always likely to be with patience received: so also those who desire to misunderstand or to oppose have it always in their power to become obtuse listeners or specious opponents. Thus I hardly dare insist upon the virtue of completion, lest I should be supposed a defender of Wouvermans or Gerard Dow; neither can I adequately praise the power of Tintoret, without fearing to be thought adverse to Holbein or Perugino. The fact is, that both finish and impetuosity, specific minuteness, or large abstraction, may be the signs of passion, or of its reverse; may result from affection or indifference, intellect or dulness. Some men finish from intense love of the beautiful in the smallest parts of what they do; others in pure incapability of comprehending anything but parts; others to show their dexterity with the brush, and prove expenditure of time. Some are impetuous and bold in their handling, from having great thoughts to express which are independent of detail; others because they have bad taste or have been badly taught; others from vanity, and others from indolence. (Compare Vol. II. Chap. IX. ยง 8.) Now both the finish and incompletion are right where they are the signs of passion or of thought, and both are wrong, and I think the finish the more contemptible of the two, when they cease to be so. The modern Italians will paint every leaf of a laurel or rose-bush without the slightest feeling of their beauty or character; and without showing one spark of intellect or affection from beginning to end. Anything is better than this; and yet the very highest schools do the same thing, or nearly so, but with totally different motives and perceptions, and the result is divine. On the whole, I conceive that the extremes of good and evil lie with the finishers, and that whatever glorious power we may admit in men like Tintoret, whatever attractiveness of method to Rubens, Rembrandt, or, though in far less degree, our own Reynolds, still the thoroughly great men are those who have done everything thoroughly, and who, in a word, have never despised anything, however small, of God's making. And this is the chief fault of our English landscapists, that they have not the intense all-observing penetration of well-balanced mind; they have not, except in one or two instances, anything of that feeling which Wordsworth shows in the following lines:-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics have disputed Rand's {{interpretation}} of the term. Libertarian feminist writer Sharon Presley described Rand's use of 'selfishness' as [...] "perversely idiosyncratic" [...] and contrary to the dictionary meaning of the term, Rand's claims to the contrary notwithstanding. Presley believes {{the use of the}} term has caused Rand's arguments to be frequently mischaracterized. Philosophy professor Max Hocutt dismissed the phrase 'the virtue of selfishness' as [...] "rhetorical excess", saying that [...] "without <b>qualification</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanation,</b> it is too paradoxical to merit serious discussion". In contrast, philosophers Douglas J. Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen described Rand's response to the question of why she uses the term as [...] "neither antagonistic nor defensive, but rather profound." [...] Philosopher Chris Matthew Sciabarra said it is [...] "debatable" [...] whether Rand accurately described the meaning of the term, but argued that Rand's philosophical position required altering the conventional meanings of some terms in order to express her views without inventing entirely new words. Philosophy professor Stephen Hicks wrote in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy that Rand's [...] "provocative title" [...] was matched by [...] "an equally provocative thesis about ethics".|$|E
40|$|Digital TV {{switchover}} in Australia {{was completed}} on 10 December 2013. This article evaluates the country's transition to digital TV, focusing {{especially on the}} financial costs and revenues for central government. It begins by setting digital switchover in Australia into international context, summarizing the goals and the process and identifying similarities and differences with the roll-outs in other countries. It then analyses in detail the spending programmes the federal government implemented to support the transition and the revenue raised by selling vacated spectrum, providing the first public assessment of the net impact for government. This analysis finds that the whole policy so far {{has resulted in a}} net cost to government of A$ 333 million in 2014 - 2015 prices. This is a striking conclusion, given the substantial net benefit that was so confidently anticipated during early digital TV policy development in the 1990 s, but it needs <b>qualification</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanation.</b> Finally, the article draws some lessons for future ex ante analyses of spectrum clearance and other communications infrastructure projects. ...|$|E

Additional literature is motivated by the possibility that distributive concerns should amend the internalization prescription. It is demonstrated, however, that simple first-best rules - unmodified for labor supply distortion or distribution - are correct in a natural, basic formulation of the problem. Specifically, setting all commodity taxes equal to marginal harms (and subsidies equal to marginal benefits) can generate a Pareto improvement. Likewise, a marginal reform {{in the direction of the}} first-best can yield a Pareto improvement. <b>Qualifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>explanations</b> for differences from previous work are also presented...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{structure and}} change in unemployment in Indonesia from the 1970 s through to 1996 The analysis focuses on high unemployment rates among urban youth, set {{in the context of}} similar problems experienced in other developing countries. It also deals with some of the conceptual and measurement issues. It is concluded that high youth unemployment is partly a queuing phenomenon among middle class families, related to processes of job search and wage structure. But rates of under-utilisation are also high among children of poorer households in the working age papulation Over time, the paper finds considerable stability in the structure of unemployment, with some tendency for overall rates to increase Some rises in unemplnyment were experienced by youth with either low educational status or tertiary <b>qualifications,</b> <b>and</b> by women <b>Explanations</b> include increased minimum wages and a slowdown in manufacturing activity, although changing definations have also played a part. ...|$|R

The complaints included 24 allegations of inaccuracy or partiality of which three were fully or partially upheld. The BBC Trust's editorial standards committee found that Bowen's radio piece [...] "had stated his professional view without <b>qualification</b> or <b>explanation,</b> <b>and</b> {{that the lack of}} precision in his language had rendered the statement inaccurate". They opined that the online article should have explained the existence of alternative views and that it breached the rules of impartiality. However, the report did not accuse Bowen of bias.
