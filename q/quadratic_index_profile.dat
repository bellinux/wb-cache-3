We obtain that {{the evolution of}} the vortex part depends only upon the parameters a_x, a_y, b_x, and b_y of the ray transformation matrix, and that isotropic systems with the same ratio b/a produce the same change of the vortex part of the orbital angular momentum.

40|$|Selection {{of dairy}} cows for {{economic}} merit requires {{the use of}} a model for genetic merit that involves the cross-product of the genetic values for milk and milk fat percentage. A linear and a <b>quadratic</b> <b>index</b> are described as procedures for selection of cows, the linear index being b 1 pm + b 2 pt and the <b>quadratic</b> <b>index</b> being b 1 pm + b 2 pt + b 2 pm 2 + b 4 pt 2 + b 5 pmpt where pm and pt are the phenotypic deviations for milk and milk fat percentage, respectively, and the b 2 Ì† 7 s are selection index weights. These indices are compared to one another and to other possible selection procedures in terms of the expected genetic progress in economic merit that would result from their use. Predicted gains are maximum for the <b>quadratic</b> <b>index.</b> Relative to these gains, the gains from the linear index are nearly equivalent, while those from a restricted index and a simplified form of the <b>quadratic</b> <b>index</b> are somewhat less, the extent of the decrease depending on the means for milk and milk fat percentage. Gains in economic merit from selection for milk are only slightly less than those from the <b>quadratic</b> <b>index</b> at all but very high mean levels of milk production. Selection for milk thus appears to be a reasonable selection procedure to improve economic merit, except at high mean levels of milk production.

40|$|Abstract There are {{selection}} methods {{available that}} allow the optimisation of genetic contributions of selection candidates for maximising the rate of genetic gain while restricting the rate of inbreeding. These methods imply selection on <b>quadratic</b> <b>indices</b> as the selection merit of a particular individual is a quadratic function of its estimated breeding value. This study provides deterministic predictions of genetic gain from selection on <b>quadratic</b> <b>indices</b> for a given set of resources (the number of candidates), heritability, and target rate of inbreeding. The rate of gain was obtained {{as a function of}} the accuracy of the Mendelian sampling term at the time of convergence of long-term contributions of selected candidates and the theoretical ideal rate of gain for a given rate of inbreeding after an exact allocation of long-term contributions to Mendelian sampling terms. The expected benefits from <b>quadratic</b> <b>indices</b> over traditional linear indices (i. e. truncation selection), both using BLUP breeding values, were quantified. The results clearly indicate higher gains from quadratic optimisation than from truncation selection. With constant rate of inbreeding and number of candidates, the benefits were generally largest for intermediate heritabilities but evident over the entire range. The advantage of <b>quadratic</b> <b>indices</b> was not highly sensitive to the rate of inbreeding for the constraints considered. </p...|$|R
40|$|Procedures for {{selecting}} sires are compared {{in terms of}} making maximum genetic progress in economic merit. A <b>quadratic</b> <b>index,</b> a simplified form of the <b>quadratic</b> <b>index</b> and a linear index to evaluate economic merit, and a restricted index to improve milk as much as possible while holding milk fat percentage constant, all result in nearly equal expected genetic progress in economic merit. Selection for milk production results in less expected genetic progress in economic merit, the extent of the decrease depending on the economic value of milk production at a given base test and on the test differential. Evaluation of sires for economic merit depends on the economic values and on the means of milk production and test. The simplified form of the <b>quadratic</b> <b>index</b> appears to be a useful index, since sire economic merit index values can be calculated for any mean levels of milk production and test and for any economic values, once index values for milk and test have been found...|$|R
