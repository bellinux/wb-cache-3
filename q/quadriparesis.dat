50|$|DeSanctis-Cacchione {{syndrome}} {{is an extremely}} rare disorder characterized by the skin and eye symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) occurring in association with microcephaly, progressive mental retardation, retarded growth and sexual development, deafness, choreoathetosis, ataxia and <b>quadriparesis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Primary hyperaldosteronism can be mimicked by Liddle syndrome, and by {{ingestion}} of licorice and other foods containing glycyrrhizin. In one case report, hypertension and <b>quadriparesis</b> resulted from intoxication with a non-alcoholic pastis (an anise-flavored aperitif containing glycyrrhizinic acid).|$|E
50|$|BFP {{appears to}} be a {{symmetrical}} polymicrogyria that extends anteriorly from the frontal poles to the posterior precentral gyrus, and inferiorly to the frontal operculum. Patients who had polymicrogyria distribution similar to this also experienced similar symptoms including delayed motor and language developments, spastic hemiparesis or <b>quadriparesis,</b> and forms of mild mental retardation.|$|E
50|$|The {{characteristic}} {{features of}} 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I include speech delay, delayed development of both mental and motor skills (psychomotor delay), {{elevated levels of}} acid in the blood and tissues (metabolic acidosis), abnormal muscle tone (dystonia), and spasms and weakness affecting the arms and legs (spastic <b>quadriparesis).</b> Fewer than 20 cases of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I have been reported.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{features}} include paraparesis or <b>quadriparesis</b> (depending {{on the level}} of the injury) and impaired pain and temperature sensation. Complete motor paralysis below the level of the lesion due to interruption of the corticospinal tract, and loss of pain and temperature sensation at and below the level of the lesion. Proprioception and vibratory sensation is preserved, {{as it is in the}} dorsal side of the spinal cord.|$|E
50|$|The {{more severe}} forms of {{encephalopathy}} are usually fatal. This disorder {{consists of a}} spectrum of defects, malformations and associated abnormalities. Disability {{is based upon the}} degree in which the brain is affected. Moderate to severe defects may cause mental retardation, spastic <b>quadriparesis,</b> athetoid movements, endocrine disorders, epilepsy and other serious conditions; mild brain defects may only cause learning or behavior problems with few motor impairments.|$|E
50|$|Tetraplegia, {{also known}} as quadriplegia, is {{paralysis}} caused by illness or injury that results in the partial or total loss of use of all four limbs and torso; paraplegia is similar but {{does not affect the}} arms. The loss is usually sensory and motor, which means that both sensation and control are lost. Tetraparesis or <b>quadriparesis,</b> on the other hand, means muscle weakness affecting all four limbs. It may be flaccid or spastic.|$|E

50|$|Mutations in {{this gene}} cause biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease (BBGD); a {{recessive}} disorder manifested in childhood that progresses to chronic encephalopathy, dystonia, <b>quadriparesis,</b> and death if untreated. Patients with BBGD have bilateral necrosis {{in the head}} of the caudate nucleus and in the putamen. Administration of high doses of biotin in the early progression of the disorder eliminates pathological symptoms while delayed treatment results in residual paraparesis, mild mental retardation, or dystonia. Administration of thiamine is ineffective in the treatment of this disorder. Experiments have failed to show that this protein can transport biotin. Mutations in this gene also cause a Wernicke's-like encephalopathy.|$|E
5000|$|CNS {{symptoms}} {{begin with}} {{mild cognitive impairment}} and slowed reactions, and in a very severe form often progress to unconsciousness. [...] Patients may present with neuropathic pain early in the infection. Eventually severe infection will lead to ascending weakness, <b>quadriparesis,</b> areflexia, respiratory failure, and muscle atrophy, and will lead to death if not treated. Occasionally patients present with cranial nerve palsies, usually in nerves 7 and 8, and rarely larvae will enter ocular structures. [...] Even with treatment, damage to the CNS may be permanent and result {{in a variety of}} negative outcomes depending on the location of the infection, and the patient may suffer chronic pain as a result of infection.|$|E
50|$|Usually the {{cerebellum}} {{and brain}} stem are formed normally, although {{in some cases}} the cerebellum may also be absent. An infant with hydranencephaly may appear normal at birth or may have some distortion of the skull and upper facial features due to fluid pressure inside the skull. The infant's head size and spontaneous reflexes such as sucking, swallowing, crying, and moving the arms and legs may all seem normal, depending on the severity of the condition. However, after a few weeks the infant sometimes becomes irritable and has increased muscle tone (hypertonia). After several months of life, seizures and hydrocephalus may develop, if they did not exist at birth. Other symptoms may include visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, spastic <b>quadriparesis</b> (paralysis), and intellectual deficits.|$|E
50|$|Schizencephaly can be {{distinguished}} from porencephaly {{by the fact that}} in schizencephaly the fluid-filled component, if present, is entirely lined by heterotopic grey matter while a porencephalic cyst is lined mostly by white matter. Individuals with clefts in both hemispheres, or bilateral clefts, are often developmentally delayed and have delayed speech and language skills and corticospinal dysfunction. Individuals with smaller, unilateral clefts (clefts in one hemisphere) may be weak or paralyzed {{on one side of the}} body and may have average or near-average intelligence. Patients with schizencephaly may also have varying degrees of microcephaly, Intellectual disability, hemiparesis (weakness or paralysis affecting one side of the body), or <b>quadriparesis</b> (weakness or paralysis affecting all four extremities), and may have reduced muscle tone (hypotonia). Most patients have seizures, and some may have hydrocephalus.|$|E
5000|$|Though traditionally, the {{prognosis}} is considered poor, a good functional recovery is possible. All patients {{at risk of}} developing refeeding syndrome should have their electrolytes closely monitored, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, glucose and phosphate. Recent data indicate that {{the prognosis}} of critically ill patients may even be better than what is generally considered, despite severe initial clinical manifestations and a tendency by the intensivists to underestimate a possible favorable evolution.While some patients die, most survive and of the survivors, approximately one-third recover; one-third are disabled but are able to live independently; one-third are severely disabled. [...] Permanent disabilities range from minor tremors and ataxia to signs of severe brain damage, such as spastic <b>quadriparesis</b> and locked-in syndrome. Some improvements may be seen {{over the course of}} the first several months after the condition stabilizes.|$|E
50|$|BGP is {{most severe}} in the perisylvian regions, but {{occurs in a}} {{generalised}} distribution. Associated factors include a reduced volume of white matter and ventriculomegaly. BGP tends to show excessively folded and fused gyri of an abnormally thin cerebral cortex, and an absence of the normal six-layered structure. The abnormally thin cortex is a key factor that distinguishes this form of polymicrogyria from the others, which are characterized by an abnormally thick cortex. Most of the patients have cognitive and motor delay, spastic hemi- or <b>quadriparesis,</b> and seizures in varying degrees. The seizures also vary at age of onset, type, and severity. There have been pseudobulbar signs reported with BGP, which are also seen in patients suffering from BPP. This association leads {{to the belief that}} there is overlap between patients suffering from BGP and patients suffering from grade 1 BPP.|$|E

The authors experienced an atypical case of scapulothoracic bursitis with shoulder and periscapular pain after <b>quadriparesis.</b> This case implies that muscular atrophy around the scapula and chest wall from <b>quadriparesis</b> may {{contribute to the development of}} scapulothoracic bursitis with shoulder and periscapular pain. In addition, clinician should be alert to it as a possible cause when a patient with <b>quadriparesis</b> complains of shoulder and periscapular pain and consider proper diagnostic options such as ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging...|$|E

40|$|Dengue is {{the most}} {{important}} mosquito-borne, arboviral infection found in tropical and sub-tropical climates. Clinical presentation varies from a severe flu-like illness to a potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue has been regarded as a nonneurotropic virus. However, there are reports describing neurological involvements in dengue virus infection. The neurological involvement in dengue virus infection includes encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. The neurological spectrum of dengue patients has been limited because of small number of case reports, paucity of imaging, and neurophysiologic studies. There are only a few isolated case reports and case series documenting acute pure motor <b>quadriparesis</b> in dengue fever. We report acute pure motor reversible <b>quadriparesis</b> due to hypokalemia. Clinicians in the endemic area should be aware of such association of acute pure motor reversible <b>quadriparesis</b> with dengue feve...|$|E

40|$|Our {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} of extremely low gestational age newborns evaluated {{the association of}} neonatal head ultrasound abnormalities with cerebral palsy at age 2 years. Cranial ultrasounds in 1053 infants were read with respect to intraventricular hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, and echolucency, by multiple sonologists. Standardized neurological examinations classified cerebral palsy, and functional impairment was assessed. Forty-four percent with ventriculomegaly and 52 % with echolucency developed cerebral palsy. Compared with no ultrasound abnormalities, children with echolucency were 24 {{times more likely to}} have <b>quadriparesis</b> and 29 {{times more likely to have}} hemiparesis. Children with ventriculomegaly were 17 times more likely to have <b>quadriparesis</b> or hemiparesis. Forty-three percent of children with cerebral palsy had normal head ultrasound. Focal white matter damage (echolucency) and diffuse damage (late ventriculomegaly) are associated with a high probability of cerebral palsy, especially <b>quadriparesis.</b> Nearly half the cerebral palsy identified at 2 years is not preceded by a neonatal brain ultrasound abnormality.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Eleven {{patients}} with documented Mor-quio’s syndrome who had dysplasia of the odontoid process and resulting atlanto-axial instability were re-viewed. They {{were found to}} be at risk for acute traumatic <b>quadriparesis,</b> chronic myelopathy of a var-iable and often rapid rate of progression, and sudden death by respiratory arrest. The evidence suggests that early prophylactic posterior cervical fusion is indicated for {{patients with}} this malformation and that once <b>quadriparesis</b> is established, recovery of function is limited. Patients with Morquio’s syndrome have often been noted to have paralysis attributable to compression of the spinal cord. Spastic quadriplegia and respiratory paralysis are common in the late stages of the disease. It is not un...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} an unusual retinal manifestation of dengue fever in an endemic region. Case Report: A 35 year old male presenting with acute onset decreased vision {{in his right}} eye, {{was found to have}} a massive retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED) extending up to the vascular arcades. He had been diagnosed with acute hypokalemic <b>quadriparesis</b> in dengue fever in the preceding week, which had resolved following treatment. The patient was managed conservatively. At three months follow up, there was spontaneous flattening of the PEDs with improvement in visual acuity. Conclusion: Dengue fever complicated by acute hypokalemic <b>quadriparesis</b> can be associated with PED, which can be large. The condition resolves spontaneously and bears a good prognosis...|$|E
