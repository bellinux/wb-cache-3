If a by-election is not called promptly upon a parliamentary seat falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E

25|$|To {{explore a}} male {{strategic}} point of view, proponents of FCC make a simple model of alternative strategies. Female A uses cosmetics {{as part of}} her ritual coalition whenever one of them menstruates; Female B and all her female neighbors use no cosmetics. Male A is prepared to work/invest to gain access; Male B tries a philanderer strategy, moving to the next cycling fertile female, neglecting the previous partner once she is pregnant. Very quickly, Male A will end up working/doing bride-service for Female A's coalition, since he has no competition from Male B. Male A gains regular fitness as a result. Male B will pair up with Female B, but is then liable to abandon her if he finds a new cycling female. She then has little support during pregnancy/breastfeeding. The <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> whether Male B gains sufficient fitness via a roving strategy of picking up cycling, non-cosmetic females. If Male A is not able to compete with Male B in terms of dominance, he is better off choosing the cosmetic females. Because Female B and her non-cosmetic female neighbors get the attentions, but no reliable investment, from Male B, they discourage any investment from the likes of Male A. Once costs of encephalization begin to bite and cooperative strategies are needed to support offspring, how many females will be choosing philanderers in preference to investors? Those females {{are not likely to be}} ancestors of large-brained hominins like ourselves or the Neanderthals.|$|E

In the lands we occupy, the Jewish <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> dealt with {{by the end of the}} year."

500|$|The Doctor, {{aware of}} his {{imminent}} death at the fixed point of time on 22 April 2011 at Lake Silencio in Utah, attempts {{to track down the}} Silence to learn why he must die. He encounters the Teselecta shapeshifting robot and its miniaturised crew who are currently posing as {{one of the members of}} the Silence; they offer him any help within their power as he faces his death. Through them, the Doctor is led to the living head of Dorium Maldovar, one of the Doctor's allies taken by the Order of the Headless Monks ("A Good Man Goes to War"). Dorium reveals that the Silence are dedicated to averting the Doctor's future, warning him [...] "On the fields of Trenzalore, at the fall of the Eleventh, when no living creature can speak falsely or fail to answer a <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> asked—one that must never be answered. And Silence must fall when the question is asked." [...] ("The Time of the Doctor") The Doctor continues to refuse to go to Lake Silencio until he discovers his old friend Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart has died, at which point he accepts his fate. To avoid crossing his own time stream, he gives the Teselecta crew four invitations to Lake Silencio for Amy and Rory, River Song, Canton Everett Delaware III, and a younger version of himself.|$|E

2500|$|Recursion {{theory in}} {{mathematical}} logic has traditionally focused on relative computability, a generalization of Turing computability defined using oracle Turing machines, introduced by Turing(1939). [...] An oracle Turing machine is a hypothetical device which, {{in addition to}} performing {{the actions of a}} regular Turing machine, is able to ask questions of an oracle, which is a particular set of natural numbers. [...] The oracle machine may only ask questions of the form [...] "Is n in the oracle set?". Each <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> immediately answered correctly, even if the oracle set is not computable. Thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a Turing machine without an oracle cannot.|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 1 has the {{traditional}} {{characteristics of a}} Shakespearean sonnet—three quatrains and a couplet written in iambic pentameter with an ABAB CDCD EFEF GG rhyme scheme. Many of Shakespeare's sonnets also reflect the two-part structure of the Italian Petrarchan Sonnet. In this type of sonnet (though not in Sonnet 1) [...] "the first eight lines are logically or metaphorically set against the last six [...] an octave-generalization {{will be followed by}} a particular sestet-application, an octave <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> followed by a sestet answer or at least a quatrain answer before the summarizing couplet". Shakespeare does employ this type of sonnet but also mixes it with a bit of his own inventiveness. It is through the [...] "character of the speaker, the only voice that Shakespeare allows us to hear" [...] the inventiveness of his story.|$|E
2500|$|This sonnet's form, {{like many}} other of Shakespeare's sonnets, uses the two-part {{structure}} of a typical Petrarchan sonnet in which, [...] "eight lines are logically or metaphorically set against the last six [...] an octave-generalization {{will be followed by}} a particular sestet-application, an octave <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> followed by a sestet answer or at least a quatrain answer before the summarizing couplet". In Sonnet 124 the volta occurs in the eleventh and twelfth line, though arguable there could be two voltas in this sonnet—as {{there are at least two}} times in the poem where a new phrase of ideas is put forth. The first quatrain describes what the speakers' love would be like if it was simply a result of circumstance. There is then a change in thought as the second quatrain begins to attack the fickle state of the world in which the speaker and addressee reside where there is a lack of enduring resolve found wanting in politics, love, and fashion. The third quatrain continues with the description of the heretical society in which they live, but then presents the idea that the speaker's love [...] "alone stands" [...] against time, which is then supported by the appeal to witnesses in the ending couplet.|$|E
2500|$|In Zamir v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (1980), the House of Lords {{held that}} whether a case {{is in the}} [...] "precedent fact" [...] {{category}} depends on the [...] "nature and process of decision" [...] conferred on the public authority by the legislation. If there is [...] "room for appreciation, even for discretion" [...] because, for example, the authority is required to consider numerous statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines, as well as evidence of doubtful accuracy or veracity, then the decision in <b>question</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> regarded as unsuitable for review by the court. In such cases, the court is limited to assessing whether there was evidence on which the authority, acting reasonably, could have reached a decision. Subsequently, the House of Lords clarified the Zamir principle in Khera v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; Khawaja v. Secretary of State for the Home Department ("Khawaja", 1983). It expressed the view that where the exercise of a power by a public authority infringes a person's liberty, the court will generally regard the matter as falling within the [...] "precedent fact" [...] category even though the court might encounter difficulties in determining whether the authority has committed an error concerning such a fact. [...] "If Parliament intends to exclude effective judicial review of the exercise of a power in restraint of liberty, it must make its meaning crystal clear." ...|$|E
