2500|$|Body part as object {{errors are}} defined {{as the use of}} BPO pantomimes in place of the IO pantomimes {{dominant}} in typical adult individuals. It has been debated whether the existence of BPO errors {{can be used as a}} measure for aphasia or brain damage. In the studies conducted by Mercaitis [...] and Ohnemus, normal adult subjects occasionally used BPO pantomimes, suggesting these errors are not restricted to children and those with brain damage. In addition, more BPO errors are made by older adults around 70 years of age and adults with lower education. The gesture itself also plays a role of the labelling performance, affected by the complexity and conventionality of the movement and the familiarity of the item. There exists a great deal of variability among similar aged children’s aptitude in using IO pantomimes, some excelling while a proportion continue to use BPO pantomimes frequently. No age range seems to exist in which children apply and understand BPO pantomimes exclusively. These extraneous variables should therefore be considered when using BPO errors as a measure. Some studies do not account for these factors, which may explain conflicting results between them. A concern in testing for apraxia and BPO errors is the use of qualitative judgments in place of <b>quantifiable</b> <b>data.</b> Many assessments of apraxia have been published, however few are considered to be clinically appropriate. Numerous evaluations focus on a single deficit, take long periods of time, and do not include psychometric characteristics. Future studies will be needed to further investigate the relationship between BPO errors, brain damage or aphasia, and the measurement and/or diagnostic potential.|$|E

However, while {{this model is}} easy to state in the abstract, {{our understanding of the}} concrete business environment—how many orders, of what kind, from which customers, for how much—is poor at best. This situation is unsurprising since such sellers typically operate under questionable legal footing, with “ground truth ” data rarely available to the public. However, absent <b>quantifiable</b> empirical <b>data,</b> “guesstimates ” operate unchecked and can distort both policy making and our choice of appropriate interventions.

40|$|Pre-tertiary {{education}} in Australia, while historically a state responsibility, is being increasingly impacted on by federal initiatives {{that seek to}} influence curriculum content and emphases.

The biofilm extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) determines biofilm structure and allows bacteria in biofilms to adapt to changes in mechanical loads such as fluid shear. However, EPS components are difficult to visualize microscopically because of their low density and molecular complexity. Here, we tested potassium permanganate, KMnO 4, for use as a non-specific EPS contrast enhancing stain using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in reflectance mode. We demonstrate that KMnO 4 reacted with EPS components of various strains of Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus, yielding brown MnO 2 precipitate deposition on the EPS, which was <b>quantifiable</b> using <b>data</b> from the laser reflection detector. Furthermore, the MnO 2 signal could be quantified in combination with fluorescent nucleic acid staining. COMSTAT image analysis indicated that KMnO 4 staining increased the estimated biovolume over that determined by nucleic acid staining alone for all strains tested, and revealed non-eDNA EPS networks in P. aeruginosa biofilm. In vitro and in vivo testing indicated that KMnO 4 reacted with poly-N-acetylglucosamine and Pseudomonas Pel polysaccharide, but not did not react strongly with DNA or alginate. KMnO 4 staining may have application as a research tool, and for diagnostic potential for biofilms in clinical samples. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of metabolic principles are evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to humans. Caenorhabditis elegans has widely accelerated {{the discovery of}} new genes important to maintain organismic metabolic homeostasis. Various methods exist to assess the metabolic state in worms, yet they often require large animal numbers and tend to be performed as bulk analyses of whole worm homogenates, thereby largely precluding a detailed studies of metabolic changes in specific worm tissues. Here, we have adapted well-established histochemical methods for the use on C. elegans fresh frozen sections and demonstrate their validity for analyses of morphological and metabolic changes on tissue level in wild type and various mutant strains. We show how the worm presents on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections and demonstrate their usefulness in monitoring and the identification of morphological abnormalities. In addition, we demonstrate how Oil-Red-O staining on frozen worm cross-sections permits quantification of lipid storage, avoiding the artifact-prone fixation and permeabilization procedures of traditional whole-mount protocols. We also adjusted standard enzymatic stains for respiratory chain subunits (NADH, SDH, and COX) to monitor metabolic states of various C. elegans tissues. In summary, the protocols presented here provide technical guidance to obtain robust, reproducible and <b>quantifiable</b> tissue-specific <b>data</b> on worm morphology as well as carbohydrate, lipid and mitochondrial energy metabolism that cannot be obtained through traditional biochemical bulk analyses of worm homogenates.
