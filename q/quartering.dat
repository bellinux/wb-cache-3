5|$|In the 1st United States Congress, {{following}} the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills {{of rights and}} English sources such as the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against <b>quartering</b> troops in private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed {{in the way in}} which peace and war were distinguished (including the possibility of a situation, such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize <b>quartering.</b> However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.|$|E

2500|$|To {{explain the}} process, {{consider}} {{one third of}} one <b>quarter.</b> Using {{the example of a}} cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a <b>quarter,</b> and four <b>quarters</b> make up a whole, twelve of these small, equal slices make up a whole. Therefore, a third of a <b>quarter</b> is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a <b>quarter</b> is one twelfth, two thirds of a <b>quarter</b> is two twelfth. [...] The second fraction, three <b>quarters,</b> is three times as large as one <b>quarter,</b> so two thirds of three <b>quarters</b> is three times as large as two thirds of one <b>quarter.</b> Thus two thirds times three <b>quarters</b> is six twelfths.|$|R

5|$|The Incas {{arranged}} their empire {{to demonstrate}} their cosmology. The capital, Cusco, was at {{the centre of the}} empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre. These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four suyus, which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the Andes. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this <b>quartering</b> with the appearance of the Milky Way in the night sky. In one season it will bisect the sky and in another bisect it in a perpendicular fashion.|$|E
5|$|The {{story behind}} the episode was {{inspired}} by several wars and occupations in the past, including the <b>Quartering</b> Acts and the Iraq War.

In addition, Moore's writing of the episode was nominated for an Emmy and a Writers Guild of America award.|$|E
5|$|Hopton {{arrived on}} 27 November, given by King Charles 1,580 horse, but only around 2,000 conscripted {{infantry}} and 500 troops {{recently returned from}} fighting in Munster, Ireland. Hopton had been ordered in late September to make secure Dorset, Wiltshire and Hampshire, and to push {{as far as possible}} toward London. Toward this end, Hopton spread his men across Hampshire County, <b>quartering</b> them for the winter at Winchester, Alresford, Petersfield and Alton. He did so to alleviate the burden on any one town, and because winter was approaching quickly. However, this left his army vulnerable. Hopton placed Crawford in charge of Alton, and on 1 December Crawford began to fortify the small town as quickly as he could. Crawford had at his disposal one cavalry regiment and one infantry regiment, though his exact number of men is unknown; it was likely around 1,000.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate lipid composition of teat canal keratin when different conditions of bacterial colonization and <b>quarter</b> inflammation were present. In Experiment 1, 11 multiparous cows with subclinical mastitis (bacteria present but no visible inflammation) {{in at least one}} <b>quarter</b> were selected for study. <b>Quarters</b> that were sampled and found negative for bacterial growth were classified as control. In Experiment 2, 10 multiparous cows with clinical mastitis in one or more <b>quarters</b> were selected. Milk samples from inflamed <b>quarters</b> were cultured to identify mastitis pathogens; these <b>quarters</b> were classified as clinical; all other <b>quarters</b> were classified as control. Teat canal keratin was collected from all <b>quarters</b> just before an a. m. milking, samples were weighed and lipid determinations were conducted by TLC. Keratin from subclinical <b>quarters</b> compared with keratin from control <b>quarters</b> did not differ in either neutral lipid or fatty acid composition. Total lipid was significantly higher in keratin from teats of clinical <b>quarters</b> than in keratin from control <b>quarters</b> (27. 8 vs. 21. 5 -mu-g/mg). Neutral lipid composition of keratin was similar between teats from clinical <b>quarters</b> and teats from control <b>quarters.</b> In Experiment 2, <b>quarter</b> foremilk samples were also obtained to determine lipid composition.

5|$|Royal emblems {{depicting}} lions {{were first}} {{used by the}} Norman dynasty, later a formal and consistent English heraldry system emerged {{at the end of}} the 12th century. The earliest surviving representation of an escutcheon, or shield, displaying three lions is that on the Great Seal of King Richard I (1189-1199), which initially displayed one or two lions rampant, but in 1198 was permanently altered to depict three lions passant, perhaps representing Richard I's principal three positions as King of the English, Duke of the Normans, and Duke of the Aquitanians. In 1340, Edward III laid claim to the throne of France, and thus adopted the Royal arms of France which he quartered with his paternal arms, the Royal Arms of England. Significantly he placed the French arms in the 1st and 4th quarters of greatest honour, signifying the feudal superiority of France over England (The King of France was the feudal overlord of the Duke of Aquitaine). This <b>quartering</b> was adjusted, abandoned and restored intermittently throughout the Middle Ages as the relationship between England and France changed. When the French king altered his arms from semée of fleur-de-lys, to only three, the English <b>quartering</b> eventually followed suit. After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland entered a personal union, the arms of England and Scotland were marshalled (combined) in what has now become the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. It appears in a similar capacity to represent England in the Arms of Canada and on the Queen's Personal Canadian Flag. The coat of three lions continues to represent England on several coins of the pound sterling, forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (although with altered tinctures) and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Warwick's {{coat of arms}} {{was unusually}} complex for the period, with seven {{different}} quarterings. The first quarter consists of {{the arms of his}} father-in-law, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, who bore his arms with an escutcheon of De Clare <b>quartering</b> Despenser (the arms of his wife Isabel le Despenser), which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter. The second quarter showed the arms of the Montacutes (quartered with the Monthermer arms). The third quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced by a label for Lancaster to signify descent from Warwick's father, the Earl of Salisbury, who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife, Lady Joan Beaufort, daughter of the Duke of Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{barn owl}} hunts by flying slowly, <b>quartering</b> {{the ground and}} {{hovering}} over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, {{and this is the}} main means of prey location in the oil palm plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often cached at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.|$|E
