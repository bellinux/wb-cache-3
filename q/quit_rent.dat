5|$|In 1774, the {{government}} of Prince Edward Island passed the <b>Quit</b> <b>Rent</b> Act 1774 to force the proprietors to pay their dues to maintain civil infrastructure on the island. However, many proprietors continued to simply not pay their quitrent. In 1781, {{the government}}, led by Governor Walter Patterson, compulsorily acquired {{approximately half of the}} island using a process known as escheat. That same year, the government held a public auction to sell off the land that had been compulsorily acquired. However, following a concerted effort by the proprietors to get the Colonial Office to reverse the action, the Crown overturned the sales conducted at the auction in 1783. The proprietors requested that Governor Patterson be removed from his office, and the Colonial Office did so in 1786.|$|E
6000|$|From {{the son of}} Sir Francis in 1279 Simon the Draper {{obtained}} the Manor of Otterbourne for 600 merks, and a <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> {{of a pair of}} gilt spurs valued at six pence! Simon seems to have assumed the gilt spurs himself, for he next appears as [...] "Sir Simon de Wynton." [...] Indeed it seems that knighthood might be conferred on the possessors of a certain amount of land. Wynton in two more generations has lengthened into Wynchester, when, in 1379, the manor is leased to Hugh Croans, merchant, and Isabella his wife for their lives, paying after the first twenty-five years 100 pounds per annum. And two years later William de Winchester conveyed the manor over to Hugh Croans or Crans.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is little}} doubt, from their outline, that {{once there was}} an entrenched camp of the Romans on this ground, but nothing is known thereof. Merantune, as our Saxon {{ancestors}} called it, first is heard of when in 755 Cynewolf, King of Wessex, was murdered there by his kinsman Cyneheard, who was in his turn killed by the Thanes of the victim. With this savage story it first appears, but no more is known of its fate except that it became {{the property of the}} Bishops of Winchester, some say by the grant of Cynegyls, the first Christian King of Wessex, others by a later gift. It was then a manor, to which Hurstleigh, the woodland, was only an appendage; and the curious old manorial rights and customs plainly go back to these ancient prae-Norman times. To go through all the thirty customs would be impossible, but {{it is worth noting that}} the tenure of the lands descended by right to the youngest son in a family instead of the eldest. Such [...] "cradle fiefs" [...] exist in other parts of England, and in Switzerland, on the principle that the elder ones go out into the world while their father is vigorous, but the youngest is the stay of his old age. The rents were at first paid in kind or in labour, with a heriot, namely, the most valuable animal in stock on a death, but these became latterly commuted for <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> and fines. The trees were carefully guarded. Only one good timber tree on each holding in the life- time of a tenant might be cut by the Lord of the Manor, and the tenants themselves might only cut old rotten trees! But this is as much as you will wish to hear of these old customs, which prove that the Norman feudal system was kept out of this Episcopal manor. It was not even mentioned in Domesday Book, near as it was to Winchester. There it lay, peacefully on its island of chalk down, shut in by the well-preserved trees, till Stephen's brother, Bishop Henry de Blois, of Winchester, bethought him of turning the old Roman Camp into a fortified castle. The three Norman kings had wisely hindered the building of castles, but these sprung up like mushrooms under the feeble rule of Stephen.|$|E

50|$|The dispute {{came to a}} {{breaking}} point in September 1745 when the East Jersey proprietors began to evict a settler only six months after a house fire in Newark completely destroyed the original deed, which was the only evidence of the purchase. During that period, William Livingston {{who was one of}} the few landed aristocrats joined the settlers against the proprietors. Livingston owned land around today's south western corner of the Township of Livingston. His land, like other settlers, was levied with <b>quit</b> <b>rents</b> in the amount 40 shillings per acre. He defended many settlers who were jailed for refusing to pay the <b>quit</b> <b>rents.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{governments have}} now {{abolished}} the <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> system and relieved {{those with a}} nominal <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> obligation from the requirement to pay it, replacing quit rents with a uniform system of land tax. However, in other countries, such as Malaysia, <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> remains an important means of raising revenue from landowners.|$|E
50|$|The <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> {{system was}} used {{frequently}} by colonial {{governments in the}} British Empire. Many land grants in colonial America in the 17th and 18th centuries carried <b>quit</b> <b>rent.</b> Quit rents went on {{to be used in}} British colonies, protectorates, etc. in Asia and elsewhere in the 19th and 20th centuries. For example, in British North Borneo, Proclamation IX of 1902 made it a legal requirement for natives who claimed to own cultivated lands to take out separate land titles for themselves, charged at $2.00 per title with owners made to pay annual <b>quit</b> <b>rent.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The colonial {{government}} first attempted {{to address the}} [...] "land question" [...] by enacting the <b>Quit</b> <b>Rent</b> Act in 1774 in order to force the absentee landowners to pay <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> to help fund local administration and infrastructure. When Governor Walter Patterson attempted in 1771 to seize the properties of owners who had not paid their rents, the Crown removed Patterson from office and overturned his actions.|$|E

50|$|From 1 April 1923, {{as regards}} the Irish Free State, Irish land {{revenues}} have been collected and administered by the Irish government.

The estates handed over mostly comprised foreshore.|$|R
50|$|Under feudal law, {{the payment}} of <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> (Latin Quietus Redditus, pl. Redditus Quieti) freed the tenant of a holding from the {{obligation}} to perform such other services as were obligatory under feudal tenure, or freed the occupier of the land from the burden of having others use their own distinct rights that affected the land (e.g. hunting rights which would have hindered farming). Thus it was a payment for distinct rights that were connected with the full enjoyment of the land but not parcelled up in the ownership of the land. Formally it {{was a sort of}} buy-back rather than a tax. A tax can be varied by the taxer; and if not paid there are penalties that can be varied by the taxer without formal limit. In contrast the only sanction for not paying a feudal <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> was that the alternative burdens would return. This imposed a ceiling on how much could be demanded in payment of a <b>quit</b> <b>rent.</b> Where the sanctions for non-compliance are limited in this way, a <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> is a rent in form and name, and not a tax; where they are not so limited, a <b>quit</b> <b>rent</b> is a rent only in form and name, being rather a tax. The latter is the usual case today, as the former was in earlier times.|$|E

50|$|By Norwood's own account, Berkeley {{provided}} him with money to purchase the office of Treasurer of Virginia and, in May 1650, he went to Holland to do that. Although the King Charles II was in Scotland following the Treaty of Breda, he apparently granted a patent appointing Norwood as Escheator, Treasurer and Receiver of <b>Quit</b> <b>Rents</b> in Virginia. That closes Norwood's account of his purpose to seek (his) fortune in Virginia {{and it is not}} clear whether he ever returned there. The tension between Virginia and the Parliament in England culminating in the surrender of the colony on 12 March 1652 (but not ending then) probably precluded that, at least until the re-election of Sir William Berkeley in 1660. However, after the Restoration (if not before) Norwood continued to receive the benefit of the <b>quit</b> <b>rents</b> for some years, an income difficult to estimate because of the collection difficulties, but several hundred pounds each year until 1669, and a smaller amount thereafter. Moryson acted as his agent (and, in effect, as Treasurer of Virginia).|$|R
50|$|He came to Nova Scotia from England {{around or}} shortly before 1760 as Receiver-General for <b>quit</b> <b>rents</b> for the {{province}} {{and served in}} that post until 1774.

5000|$|The attempt of the Mayhews {{to create}} a {{hereditary}} aristocracy on the Vineyard met with increasing opposition {{as more and more}} colonists arrived.
