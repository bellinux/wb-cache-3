5|$|The American <b>Quarter</b> Pony Association {{was begun}} in 1964 with {{the ideals of}} a {{registry}} which would register small horses and ponies of western type, whose breeding could be unknown but which were desirable for breeding purposes. Crossbred and purebred animals are eligible for registration, as are animals registered with other registries that meet the entry requirements. In 1975, the National <b>Quarter</b> Pony Association was begun to preserve the smaller, stockier type <b>Quarter</b> Horse when breeding trends were leaning towards taller, leaner animals. The AQPA now registers horses in several foreign countries, {{as well as all}} US states and Canadian provinces. The International <b>Quarter</b> Pony Association, begun in the 1970s, also registers <b>Quarter</b> Ponies, and is a worldwide association for ponies of <b>Quarter</b> Horse type. The <b>Quarter</b> Pony Association is an association affiliated with the International <b>Quarter</b> Pony Association, with the goal of promoting the <b>Quarter</b> Pony. In 2005, the IQPA and the QPA became one organization, with the IQPA acting as the registry and the QPA as the membership branch. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 <b>Quarter</b> Ponies registered with all registering organizations. Registries say that registrations of adult animals outnumber those for foals every year, as many owners wait until the pony is old enough to be shown under saddle before registering them.|$|E

5|$|Although a close {{game was}} predicted, {{the game was}} the exact opposite, as the Wolverines finally {{displayed}} the long sought offensive firepower from a Rich Rodriguez offense.

5|$|Although {{formally}} {{separate from}} Greek Orthodox and Latin (Catholic) Christians, the Armenians consider their <b>quarter</b> {{to be part}} of the Christian <b>Quarter.</b> The three Christian patriarchates of Jerusalem and the government of Armenia have publicly expressed their opposition to any political division of the two quarters. The central reasons for the existence of a separate Armenian <b>Quarter</b> is the miaphysitism and distinct language and culture of the Armenians, who, unlike the majority of Christians in Jerusalem (also in Israel and Palestine), are neither Arab nor Palestinian. However, for all intents and purposes, the Armenians living in the Armenian <b>Quarter</b> are considered Palestinians by Israel and the United Nations (UN).
