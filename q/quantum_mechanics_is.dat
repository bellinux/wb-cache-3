5|$|A {{key element}} of <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>is</b> Heisenberg's {{uncertainty}} principle, which forbids the simultaneous measurement of the position and momentum of a particle along the same direction. Remarkably, the uncertainty principle for charged, material particles requires the quantization of light into photons, and even the frequency dependence of the photon's energy and momentum.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. <b>Quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>is</b> needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point being so close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|The algebra of observables in <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>is</b> {{naturally}} an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, {{according to}} Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. Von Neumann began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by von Neumann and his contemporaries are {{now known as}} von Neumann algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition {{of a kind of}} operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one hand made no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in particular that underlies much of the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract harmonic analysis and representation theory.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{existence}} of antiparticles leads {{to the conclusion that}} relativistic <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>is</b> not enough for a more accurate and complete theory of particle interactions.

25|$|Interpretations where <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>is</b> said to {{describe}} an observer's {{knowledge of the}} world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking.

25|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} has {{had enormous}} success in explaining {{many of the}} features of our universe. <b>Quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>is</b> often the only theory that can reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and others).

25|$|Classical physics draws a {{distinction}} between particles and waves. It also relies on continuity and determinism in natural phenomena. In the early twentieth century, newly discovered atomic and subatomic phenomena seemed to defy those conceptions. In 1925–1926, quantum mechanics was invented as a mathematical formalism that accurately describes the experiments, yet appears to reject those classical conceptions. Instead, it posits that probability, and discontinuity, are fundamental in the physical world. Classical physics also relies on causality. The standing of causality for <b>quantum</b> <b>mechanics</b> <b>is</b> disputed.|$|E
25|$|In addition, general {{relativity}} {{is inconsistent with}} quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the wave–particle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There {{is a great deal}} of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both {{general relativity}} and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently.
