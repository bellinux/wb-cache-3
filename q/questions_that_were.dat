25|$|The Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Empire were {{political}} {{institutions in the}} ancient Roman Empire. During {{the reign of the}} second Roman Emperor, Tiberius, the powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies (the comitia) were transferred to the Senate. The neutering of the assemblies had become inevitable because the electors were, in general, ignorant as to the merits of the important <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> laid before them, and often willing to sell their votes to the highest bidder. After the founding of the Roman Empire, the People of Rome continued to organize by Centuries and by Tribes, but by this point, these divisions had lost most of their relevance.|$|E
25|$|A {{change in}} market {{conditions}} {{also contributed to}} Borland's fall from prominence. In the 1980s, companies had few people who understood the growing personal computer phenomenon, and so most technical people were given free rein to purchase whatever software they thought they needed. Borland had {{done an excellent job}} marketing to those with a highly technical bent. By the mid-1990s, however, companies were beginning to ask what the return was on the investment they had made in this loosely controlled PC software buying spree. Company executives were starting to ask <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> hard for technically minded staff to answer, and so corporate standards began to be created. This required new kinds of marketing and support materials from software vendors, but Borland remained focused on the technical side of its products.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, he {{said that}} brandishing a weapon was {{sufficient}} to stop an attack 95% of the time. Other researchers criticized his methodology. A study in Public Opinion Quarterly said that his sample size of 1,015 respondents was {{too small for the}} study to be accurate and that the majority of similar studies suggest a value between 70 and 80 percent. According to Lott, Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz's 1994 estimate rises to 92 percent when brandishing and warning shots are added together. Lott said that the lower rates found by others was at least in part due to the different <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> asked. The other surveys all asked people to recall events over the previous five years, while Lott had only asked people about events that had occurred during just the previous year. Lott used the higher estimate because it accounted for his claim of media bias. The survey questions have also been made available for years to anyone who would have liked to replicate the survey themselves.|$|E

25|$|The STS-134 crew {{installed}} the AMS-2 on flight day 4. AMS-2 was lifted out of Endeavours payload bay using the Canadarm, operated by Drew Feustel and Roberto Vittori. It was handed off to Canadarm2, which was operated by Greg Chamitoff and Greg Johnson, and {{was installed in}} its final location on the S3 truss segment at 09:46 UTC. Immediately after the installation, crews on the ground began activating the experiment. The installation of the AMS-2 marked {{the completion of the}} US Orbital Segment of the International Space Station. Later in the day, Greg Chamitoff, Drew Feustel and Mike Fincke prepared the Extravehicular Mobility Units (EMU) that Chamitoff and Feustel would wear during their spacewalk on flight day 5. The trio was also assisted by commander Mark Kelly in preparing the tools required for the Extravehicular Activity (EVA). While this was going on, Expedition 27 crew members Paolo Nespoli, Cady Coleman and Ron Garan assisted the rest of the STS-134 crew in completing transfers to and from Endeavour. Late in the crew day, the two crews performed an EVA procedures review. After the review, Chamitoff and Feustel camped out in the Quest Airlock overnight, in preparation for the mission's first spacewalk. The campout was done with the airlock's air pressure reduced, so as to purge nitrogen bubbles from the astronauts' blood and thus prevent decompression sickness. Members of both crews also conducted two in-flight interviews with media on the ground, including PBS NewsHour, National Public Radio, Associated Press, Reuters and Fox News. The crew also answered <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> relayed up to them by Miles O'Brien for Google.|$|E
25|$|During the Geonic period (650–1250 CE), the Babylonian {{schools were}} the chief centers of Jewish learning; the Geonim, {{the heads of}} these schools, were {{recognized}} as the highest authorities in Jewish law. Despite difficulties that hampered the irregular communications of the period, Jews who lived even in most distant countries sent their inquiries concerning religion and law to these officials in Babylonia. It was common for Jews outside of Babylon to ask to be sent {{a section of the}} Talmud along with “its explanation” or to ask the scholars in Babylon to settle Jewish arguments for which they could not find any precedent. The length of responsa from this period can span from less than a sentence to a large book. Many of the responsa are still being studied today in the Cairo Genizah. In the yeshiva during this time period, students and scholars would discuss these halakhic questions during kallah and then the head of the yeshiva would announce his decision and the leaders in the yeshiva would sign it. Another type of responsa were those that were more time-sensitive, so the gaon usually responded to them right away and with many different sections in order to answer multiple <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> posed. Later Geonim also referred to the responsa and commentaries of earlier Geonim when writing responsa. In the latter centuries of the geonic period, {{from the middle of the}} tenth to the middle of the eleventh, their supremacy suffered, as the study of the Talmud received care in other lands. The inhabitants of these regions gradually began to submit their questions to the heads of the schools of their own countries. Eventually they virtually ceased sending their questions to Babylonian Geonim, so that during this period responsa of eminent rabbis of other lands appeared side by side with geonic rulings.|$|E
500|$|Historian Richard Hofstadter deemed Dunne through Dooley [...] "one of [...] shrewdest commentators". Louis Filler {{wrote in}} 1954 that [...] "any lively {{mention of the}} Progressive Era is bound to evoke {{recollections}} of Dooley, usually {{in the form of}} one of his aphorisms". Dunne is closely associated with that era, and worked with several of the muckrakers during {{the first decade of the}} 20th century. Scholars have not agreed on the extent to which Dunne through Dooley influenced the era: Ellis believed that the Dooley columns paved the way for public acceptance of the realistic writing of the muckrakers, but Filler disagreed, noting that Dunne's was one of many voices calling for reform in the 1890s. Journalism professor John M. Harrison argued that though Dunne's progressivism, of a non-Marxist sort, placed him at odds with others who urged change, [...] "he was as effective as any writer of his time in keeping before the public mind those issues and <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> the moving forces in the Progressive movement".|$|E

Another commercial lead-out featured Winstead's parents, on her answering machine, reading that day's [...] "Final Jeopardy!" [...] question and answer. In each show, Kilborn would conduct celebrity interviews, ending with a segment called [...] "Five Questions" [...] in which the guest was made to answer a series of <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> typically a combination of obscure fact and subjective opinion. These are highlighted in a 1998 book titled The Daily Show: Five Questions, which contains transcripts of Kilborn's best interviews. Each episode concluded with a segment called [...] "Your Moment of Zen" [...] that showed random video clips of humorous and sometimes morbid interest such as visitors at a Chinese zoo feeding baby chickens to the alligators. Originally the show was recorded without a studio audience, featuring only the laughter of its own off-camera staff members. A studio audience was incorporated into the show for its second season, and has remained since.|$|E
500|$|Reiss {{concluded}} that Sexual Preference [...] "has value for suggesting directions and the likely worth of ideas", but that given its shortcomings {{there was no}} way in which its authors could definitively resolve the issues they explored, despite their claim to [...] "once and for all" [...] discredit some theoretical ideas about homosexuality. Reiss wrote that Bell et al. asked <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> [...] "vague" [...] and [...] "open-ended", had an [...] "arbitrary and rigid conception" [...] of what could be done with their data and lacked [...] "theoretical development" [...] in its handling, and deliberately minimized the importance of the predictor variables they used to test psychoanalytic and other theories. He found their conclusion that sexual orientation has a biological basis unconvincing. DeLamater wrote that Sexual Preference benefited from Bell et al.′s [...] "eclectic theoretical basis", which drew from the psychodynamic model, social learning theory, sociological models that emphasize the importance of peer relationships, and labeling theory. However, while he accepted Bell et al.′s claim that their study was methodologically superior to prior work on homosexuals, he still found it problematic for many reasons and hesitated to endorse its conclusions. In his view, the path analysis involved [...] "arbitrary classification and sequencing of variables".|$|E
500|$|In {{evoking the}} English countryside, the poem {{belongs to the}} picturesque {{tradition}} found in John Dyer's Grongar Hill (1726), and {{the long line of}} topographical imitations it inspired. However, it diverges from this tradition in focusing on the death of a poet. Much of the poem deals with <b>questions</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> linked to Gray's own life; during the poem's composition, he was confronted with the death of others and questioned his own mortality. Although universal in its statements on life and death, the poem was grounded in Gray's feelings about his own life, and served as an epitaph for himself. As such, it falls within an old poetic tradition of poets contemplating their legacy. The poem, as an elegy, also serves to lament the death of others, including West, though at a remove. This {{is not to say that}} Gray's poem was like others of the graveyard school of poetry; instead, Gray tried to avoid a description that would evoke the horror common to other poems in the elegiac tradition. This is compounded further by the narrator trying to avoid an emotional response to death, by relying on rhetorical questions and discussing what his surroundings lack. Nevertheless, the sense of kinship with Robert Blair's [...] "The Grave" [...] was so generally recognised that Gray's Elegy was added to several editions of Blair's poem between 1761-1808, after which other works began to be included as well.|$|E
