Microfiche. xii, 131 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmWe {{investigate}} the low frequency temperature fluctuations, with time scales of months to years, {{in the upper}} 400 m of the Central North Pacific by analyzing the TRANSPAC temperature data collected {{as a part of}} the North Pacific Experiment and the temperature data at ocean weather stations. The low frequency temperature fluctuations consist of large scale, <b>quasi</b> <b>homogeneous,</b> fluctuations with space scales comparable to the size of the North Pacific basin and smaller scale, wave-like, fluctuations with length scales of a few hundred kilometers. In the upper 100 m of the ocean the temperature fluctuation is predominantly a seasonal variation, the amplitude of which decreases with depth with a typical e-folding depth of 50 m. The non-seasonal temperature anomaly field has a two layer structure; the temperature anomalies in the surface layer, down to about 100 m, have time scales of 2 to 3 years, and those in the lower layer, deeper than 150 m, have time scales of 4 to 7 years and penetrate down to a few hundred meters. More than half of the wave-like temperature fluctuations at the annual frequency consist of a random field of first order baroclinic Rossby waves travelling in a NW direction with wave lengths of about 300 km and phase speeds of about 1 cm/sec. Both the <b>quasi</b> <b>homogeneous</b> and wave-like parts of the low frequency temperature fluctuations in the western part of the North Pacific Current area are much stronger than those in the eastern part. Along the Subarctic (42 °N) and Subtropical (32 °N) Fronts the wave-like temperature fluctuations propagate with phase speeds of about 10 cm/sec, and they reverse their direction of propagation with an annual cycle.

40|$|International audienceLower hybrid solitary {{structures}} {{have been}} observed by sounding rockets in the auroral ionosphere {{for over a decade}} and a half. Surprisingly, few laboratory experiments have attempted to reproduce this interesting phenomena. Recently, Rosenberg and Gekelman [2001] investigated the interaction between fluctuations near the lower hybrid resonance and field-aligned density striations using the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. The laboratory measurements of electromagnetic fluctuations localized in a plasma density gradient are new and interesting. This experiment represents another in a series of laboratory investigations that use predictions of the cold <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plasma</b> dispersion to interpret observations of lower hybrid fluctuations interacting with a zero-order plasma density gradient [Bamber et al., 1994, 1995; Rosenberg and Gekelman, 1998]. This experiment is also the first attempt to directly compare laboratory phase velocity estimates with interferometric electric field measurements of lower hybrid solitary structures by the AMICIST, TOPAZ III and PHAZE II sounding rockets [Pinçon et al., 1997; Schuck et al., 1998; Bonnell et al., 1998]. This paper compares the laboratory and space measurements and concludes that they represent completely different phenomena. Furthermore, significant discrepancies between the predictions of the cold <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plasma</b> dispersion relation and the laboratory observations are presented. We speculate that these discrepancies arise because plasma density gradients, essential to description of the laboratory experiment, are neglected in the cold <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plasma</b> dispersion relation. lower hybrid solitary structures: A comparison between space observations, a laboratory experiment, and the cold <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plasma</b> dispersion relation...|$|R

40|$|Consideration {{is given}} to the {{solution}} of the highly exothermic fixed bed catalytic reactor problem taking into account heat and mass transfer resistances inside the catalyst pellets and across the external fluid film as well as radial temperature and oonoentration gradients in the fluid phase. Comparison of the model with the simpler <b>quasi</b> <b>homogeneous</b> repreaenation is made. In the region where the <b>quasi</b> <b>homogeneous</b> case predicts temperature "run-away", the added refinements assume some importance. Very significant; differences in behaviour are predicted. Indeed no temperature "run-away" is apparent. Inolucling simply a film mass and heat transfer resistance is no guarantee that temperature "run-away" will not be predicted. In fact, it is the particle diffusive resistance whioh is the main factor limiting the temperature effects. Since the region of temperature "run-away" is often in the practical range it is essential to use a more detailed model for design such as the one described here, especially if optimal operating conditions are being sought. Even on large digital computers, the computation time is excessively long if the sets of differential equations are solved simultaneously. By examining the intrapartiole equations in detail for a practical range of physical properties and operating conditions, it is shown that they may be reduced, to a lumped parameter form. While still retaining the characteristics of the general problem, the lumped parameter approximation can be solved in a substantially shorter time, thus taking its use in optimization and control studies feasible. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the ion acoustic (IA) wave in plasmas containing ions and electrons {{with the same}} temperature is of minor importance due to strong damping of the wave by hot resonant ions. In this work it will be shown that the IA wave is susceptible to excitation even in plasmas with hot ions when both an electromagnetic transverse wave and a background density gradient {{are present in the}} plasma, and in addition the wave is in fact unstable (i. e., growing) in the case of permeating <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plasmas.</b> The multi-component fluid theory is used to describe the IA wave susceptibility for excitation in inhomogeneous plasmas and its coupling with electromagnetic waves. The growing IA wave in permeating <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plasmas</b> is described by the kinetic theory. In plasmas with density and temperature gradients the IA wave is effectively coupled with the electromagnetic waves. In comparison to ordinary IA wave in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>plasma,</b> the Landau damping of the present wave is much smaller, and to demonstrate this effect a simple but accurate fluid model is presented for the Landau damping. In the case of permeating plasmas, a kinetic mechanism for the current-less IA wave instability is presented, with a very low threshold for excitation as compared with ordinary electron-current-driven kinetic instability. Such growing IA waves can effectively heat plasma in the upper solar atmosphere by a stochastic heating mechanism presented in the work.

The first class of invariants which we study are the isolated singularities, called 0 -stable singularities because they are the 0 -dimensional singularities. First, we give a formula to compute the number of An points which appear in any stable deformation of a <b>quasi</b> <b>homogeneous</b> co-rank one map germ from (ℂn+ 1, 0) to (ℂn, 0) with n = 2, 3. To get such a formula, we apply the Hilbert's syzygy theorem to determine the graded free resolution given by the syzygy modules of the associated iterated Jacobian ideal. Then we show how to obtain the other 0 -stable singularities, these isolated singularities are formed by multiple points and here we use the relation among them and the Fitting ideals of the discriminant. For n = 2, there exists only the germ of double points set and for n = 3 there are the triple points, named points A 1, 1, 1 and the normal crossing between a germ of a cuspidal edge and a germ of a plane, named A 2, 1. For n = 3, there appear also the one-dimensional singularities, which are of two types: germs of cuspidal edges or germs of double points curves. For these singularities, we show how to compute the polar multiplicities and also the local Euler obstruction at the origin in terms of the weights and degrees. © 2013 Pushpa Publishing House...|$|R
