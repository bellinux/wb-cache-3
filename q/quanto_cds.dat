40|$|We {{present a}} new model for pricing <b>quanto</b> <b>CDS</b> where the FX could be {{strongly}} dependent on the credit reference. The model assumes lognormal hazard rate and deterministic FX local volatility where the FX spot can jump at time of default of the credit reference. We present the model, the calibration algorithm, and the <b>quanto</b> <b>CDS</b> pricing. ...|$|E
40|$|Euro redenomination risk is {{the risk}} that a euro asset will be redenominated into a devalued legacy currency. We propose a time-varying, {{country-specific}} market perception of intra-euro area redenomination risk measure, defined as the <b>quanto</b> <b>CDS</b> of a member country relative to the <b>quanto</b> <b>CDS</b> of a benchmark member country. Focusing on Italy, Spain and France and using Germany as benchmark, we show that the redenomination risk shocks, defined as the unexplained component of the market perception of redenomination risk orthogonal to exchange rate, global, regional and liquidity risks, significantly affect sovereign yield spreads, with Italy and Spain being the countries most adversely affected, followed by France. Finally, foreign redenomination risk shocks spill over and above local redenomination risk shocks, corroborating {{the fact that this}} risk is systemic...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new model for pricing <b>Quanto</b> <b>CDS</b> and risky bonds. The model {{operates}} with four stochastic factors, namely: hazard rate, foreign exchange rate, domestic interest rate, and foreign interest rate, and also allows for jumps-at-default in the FX and foreign interest rates. Corresponding systems of PDEs are derived similar to how this is done in Bielecki at al., 2005. A localized version of the RBF partition of unity method is used to solve these 4 D PDEs. The results of our numerical experiments presented in the paper qualitatively explain the discrepancies observed in the marked values of CDS spreads traded in domestic and foreign economies.
