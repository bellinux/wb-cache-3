60|$|The {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> specific <b>heat</b> {{originated in}} the eighteenth century. It means that the same mass of a body, under the same circumstances, always <b>requires</b> the same <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> to raise it to a given temperature, but that equal masses of different bodies require different quantities. Ultimately, {{it was found that}} the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to raise equal masses of the more perfect gases, through equal ranges of temperature, were inversely proportional to their combining weights. Thus a definite relation was established between the hypothetical units and <b>heat.</b> The phenomena <b>of</b> electrolytic decomposition showed that there was a like close relation between these units and electricity. The <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> electricity generated by the combination of any two units is sufficient to separate any other two which are susceptible of such decomposition. The phenomena of isomorphism showed a relation between the units and crystalline forms; certain units are thus able to replace others in a crystalline body without altering its form, and others are not.|$|R

40|$|Early season maize is {{harvested}} {{with high}} moisture content {{that makes it}} impossible to store. The sale of early season maize in green form is uneconomical to the farmer. Experience had shown that farmers could hardly make the cost of production from their sales. Also, grain losses are high when maize is harvested green. To minimize grain losses and thereby increase value and the profit margin of the farmer, a grain dryer is necessary for wet grains. Therefore, this paper presents the design and development of a batch in-bin maize grain dryer. Some properties of maize such as moisture content and bulk density were determined to get information required for design of the dryer. The dimension of drying chamber, amount of moisture to be removed in a batch, quantity of air required to effect drying, volume of air required to effect drying, blower capacity, <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to effect drying and actual heat used to effect drying were all designed for. A maize dryer was developed with a batch size of 100 kg of threshed wet maize. The dryer can be used in laboratory for experimental purpose {{as well as on the}} farm for commercial purposes. The dryer can be used to measure drying rates of maize at different initial moisture contents, drying air temperatures, drying air velocities and grain beds. The effects of different drying temperature, air velocity, loading and agitating speed on the quality of dried maize can be investigated with the dryer. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} greenhouse environment was developed to ascertain the annual savings in heating expenditure achieved by thermal screens. Thirteen materials with thermal screening potential were investigated. Each material was modelled within glass, Agphane, and twin skin Agphane covered greenhouses, 300 m 2 and 1000 m 2 in floor area, heated with diesel, coal, electricity, natural gas, or L. P. G., to set points of 15 °C and 20 °C, in Auckland and Christchurch. The model consisted of two phases. Phase 1 was a steady state model of the greenhouse environment based {{on a series of}} energy and mass balances. The temperatures within the greenhouse and the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>heat</b> <b>required</b> to hold the house at a specified set point were predicted by solving these balances simultaneously. This process enabled the average U-value for each greenhouse to be estimated. In Phase 2 of the model the annual heat load for combinations of each house size and type, cover, screen, set point, and location were estimated using average U-values from Phase 1 and meterological data indicative of Auckland and Christchurch. Using current fuel prices, annual heat loads were converted into annual heating expenditures. Using annual heating expenditure, screen life expectancy, and screen installation cost an economic analysis was conducted using internal rate of return as a measure of thermal screen feasibility. In terms of savings in heating expenditure, Black Polythene, Infrane, and Clear Polythene recorded the highest internal rate of return. It was decided that before a formal recommendation could be made further research was required to evaluate screens as summer shading or photoperiod control devices and to consider the practical problems associated with some of the screens. It was shown that returns from thermal screening were greater in Christchurch than Auckland, greater at a 20 °C set point than at a 15 °C set point, greater for a 1000 m 2 house than a 300 m 2 house, greatest with diesel heating in Auckland, and greatest with diesel and L.
