5000|$|This {{series is}} {{encompassed}} in five volumes and covers the actual events that Miyu {{is given a}} glimpse of {{at the end of}} volume 10 of the original series. The Western Shinma, led by Pazusu, and supported by Carlua (his daughter), Lemunia (Lemures' younger brother), and a powerful young Shinma called Cait Sith. The Western Shinma succeed in kidnapping Larva, purging Miyu's blood from him, and sealing his memory of his time with her. This results in a showdown where Larva kills Miyu, although he is not entirely certain why he feels bothered by this. In actuality, Miyu is not quite dead as her spirit survives through her blood that was passed from Yui's mom into Yui in utero (see Vampire Princess Yui below). Yui is then drawn to Miyu's realm to help her be reborn. In the meantime, it's discovered that the [...] "rescue mission" [...] was all a ploy by Cait Sith to reach Japan and retrieve a short sword in which his mother's spirit is sealed. It is revealed not only was his mother sealed by the Watcher before Miyu, Cait Sith (both are members of a nearly extinct clan called the <b>Quarl)</b> was actually responsible for putting the idea of challenging the Eastern Shinma into Lemures' and Larva's heads originally. As Cait Sith succeeds in resurrecting the queen (though not without a catch and mortally wounding Pazusu), the race is on to get Yui safely to the spot of Miyu's rebirth. With the help of the second tier Eastern Shinma and Lemunia, she succeeds and Miyu is brought back to life. After unsealing Larva's memories and reestablishing the blood bond, Miyu and the remaining Western Shinma join forces to defeat the <b>Quarl</b> and destroy the Queen. Afterward, Pazusu asks Larva to kill him so he doesn't die of his wounds and Carlua makes one last attempt to wrest Larva away from Miyu by threatening to kill him. Miyu calls her bluff and Carlua retreats, thanks to the newly freed Lemures. He explains as they leave that during Miyu's time being dead, many stray Shinma (including himself) took advantage of her absence to escape the Darkness once more. The series ends with Miyu and Larva heading off to start rounding these escapees up again.|$|E
5000|$|As World War II ends in Europe, Stars and Stripes {{journalist}} Charles Wills (Van Johnson) is on {{the streets}} of Paris, covering the celebrations. He is suddenly grabbed by a beautiful woman, who kisses him and disappears. Charles follows the crowd to Café Dhingo and meets another pretty woman named Marion Ellswirth (Donna Reed). The mutual attraction is instant and she invites him to join her father's celebration {{of the end of the}} war in Europe. Charles, Marion and her persistent French suitor Claude Matine (George Dolenz) arrive at the Ellswirth household, and we find that the woman who had kissed Charles is Marion's younger sister Helen (Elizabeth Taylor). Their father, James Ellswirth (Walter Pidgeon), had survived World War I and promptly joined the Lost Generation. Unlike most drifters, he never grew out of it; raising his two daughters to desire such a lifestyle. Helen takes after her father and uses her beauty to sustain a life of luxury even though they are flat broke. Marion goes the other way and looks for serious-minded and conventional young men such as Claude, an aspiring prosecutor, and Charles, the future novelist. [...] Charles and Helen fall in love and start dating. After Helen recovers from a near-death case of pneumonia, they get married and settle in Paris. James good-naturedly joins the happy family of Charles, with Helen eventually having a daughter Vickie (Sandy Descher). Marion, having lost Charles to Helen, agrees to marry Claude. Charles struggles to make ends meet with his meagre salary, unsuccessfully works on his novels and looks after Vickie. [...] At about this time, the barren oil fields in Texas James had bought years before finally begin to produce. Charles, to whom James had given the oil fields as a dowry, quits his job, and Helen and James begin to host parties instead of going to them. Sudden wealth changes Helen, who becomes more responsible, while Charles parties his wealth away after quitting his newspaper job and having all his novels rejected by publishers. They also each start to pursue other interests: Helen flirts with handsome tennis player Paul Lane (Roger Moore), while Charles competes in a local Paris-to-Monte Carlo race with professional divorcee Lorraine <b>Quarl</b> (Eva Gabor). [...] After the race Charles returns to Paris, only to find Helen sitting in Café Dhingo with Paul. A fight breaks out between Paul and Charles, and an angry Charles goes home first and puts the chain on the door, preventing it from being opened all the way. When Helen comes home and tries to enter she can't. She calls out to him, but Charles is in a drunken stupor on the staircase and we hear the bottle drop from his hands as Helen calls. Helen ends up having to walk all the way to her sister's in the snow and rain. She catches pneumonia again and dies. [...] Marion petitions for and gets full custody of Vickie, while Charles returns home to America. A few years later, having straightened himself out, published a book, and stopped boozing, Charles returns to Paris, hoping his reform will persuade Marion to give Vickie back to him. Charles tells Marion that he only has one drink a day now. Marion refuses, still feeling resentful towards Charles having fallen for Helen instead of her, and for him being responsible for Helen's death. Seeing that Charles and Vickie belong together, Claude steps in and tells Marion that she is punishing Charles for his not realizing that Marion loved him, but marrying Helen instead, and the penalty for it is taking away the only thing he had left---his own daughter. Claude asks Marion to accept him and wanting their own child out of love and not out of defeat (as a result of Charles allowing Helen to die). Marion goes into Café Dhingo (on whose main wall is a big picture of Helen) to look for Charles (who is gazing at the painting) and tells him that Helen would not have wanted him to be alone. Outside the cafe, Claude is with Vickie. The child runs to Charles and Charles and the child walk off together as the movie ends.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{measurements}} are presented of the turbulent flow field, gas species concentrations and temperature field in a non-premixed methane swirl flame. Attention {{is given to}} the effect of the <b>quarl</b> geometry on the flame structure and emission characteristics due to its importance in gas turbine and industrial burner applications. Two different quarls were fitted to the burner exit, one a straight <b>quarl</b> and the other a diverging <b>quarl</b> of 15 ° half cone angle. Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) was applied to obtain the three components of the instantaneous velocity on a vertical plane immediately downstream of the <b>quarl</b> exit. Temperature and gaseous species measurements were made both inside and downstream of the quarls, using a fine wire thermocouple and sampling probe, respectively. This work provides experimental verification by complementary techniques. The results showed that although the main flame structures were governed by the swirl motion imparted to the air stream, the <b>quarl</b> geometry, fuel loading and air loading also had a significant effect on the flow pattern, turbulence intensity, mixture formation, temperature distribution, emissions and flame stabilization. Particularly, {{in the case of the}} straight <b>quarl</b> flame, the flow pattern leads to strong, rapid mixing and reduces the residence time for NO formation within the internal recirculation zone (IRZ). However, for the diverging <b>quarl</b> flames, the recirculation zone is shifted radially outward, and the turbulent interaction between the central fuel jet and the internal recirculation zone IRZ induces another small vortex between these two flow features. Less mixing near the diverging <b>quarl</b> exit is observed, with a higher concentration of NO and CO in the post-combustion zone. The instantaneous flow field for both flames showed the existence of small scale vortical structure near the shear layers which were not apparent in the time averaged flow field. These structures, along with high levels of turbulence present in the shear layer, result in the enhancement of the mixing, especially with straight <b>quarl.</b> This article outlines results that yield deeper insight into the combustion of swirling flames stabilized within the <b>quarl</b> and to establish an experimental data base for modelers...|$|E
40|$|Laser based {{investigations}} {{were performed}} on a prototype 4 th generation DLE (dry low emission) burner under atmospheric pressure conditions to {{study the effects of}} changing burner geometry on the flame. In a full burner configuration, a divergent conical section termed the <b>Quarl</b> is located after the burner exit for expanding the flow area and holding the flame. The planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) of OH radicals together with the flame chemiluminescence imaging were employed to study the flame characteristics under the conditions with and without <b>Quarl</b> using CH 4 as fuel to understand the influence of <b>Quarl</b> on the flame. When there is no <b>Quarl,</b> the flame has more freedom to expand at the burner exit and with an increase in the global equivalence ratio (φ), the width of the flame increases and the total extension of the flame shortens. For all the global φ considered here, the total extension of the flame is shorter under the condition without <b>Quarl</b> in comparison to the one with <b>Quarl.</b> For a richer global φ(φ≥ 0. 46) the outer recirculation zones (ORZs) are not observed under the condition with <b>Quarl,</b> but are observed without <b>Quarl</b> along with the inner recirculation zone. Without <b>Quarl</b> conditions, equivalence ratios (φ) of the concentrically arranged three sections of the burner: an outer Main section, an intermediate section (Pilot) and a central pilot body or pre-chamber combustor, termed the RPL (Rich-Pilot-Lean) sections were altered.

At a richer global φ, the ORZ is observed along with the inner recirculation zone of the flame. Otherwise, with an increase in global φ, the changes in the flame shape, in the flame fluctuation and in the flame stabilization position follow similar trends as for increasing the Pilot φ and the RPL φ Additionally, combustion emissions were obtained to observe the effects on NOX level for different operating conditions with and without <b>Quarl...</b>|$|E

The time-averaged flow field shows a unique flow pattern at the <b>quarl</b> exit, where two recirculation vortices are formed; a strong recirculation zone formed far from the <b>quarl</b> exit and a larger recirculation zone extending inside the <b>quarl.</b> However, the instantaneous images show that, the flow pattern near the <b>quarl</b> exit plays {{a vital role in}} the spatial location and structure of the reaction zone. In the low fuel jet velocity flame, a pair of vortical structures, located precisely at the corners of the <b>quarl</b> exit, cause the flame to roll up into the central region of low speed flow, where the flame sheet then tracks the axial velocity fluctuations. The vorticity field reveals a vortical structure surrounding the reaction zones, which reside on a layer of low compressive strain adjacent to that vortical structure. In the high fuel jet velocity flame, initially a laminar flame sheet resides at the inner shear layer of the main jet, along the interface between incoming fresh gas and high temperature recirculating gas. Further downstream, vortex breakdown alters the flame sheet path toward the central flame region. The lower reaction zones show good correlation to the regions of maximum vorticity and track the regions of low compressive strain associated with the inner shear layer of the jet flow.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) An {{experimental}} and theoretical {{study of the}} flow, mixing and ignition inside the divergent <b>quarl</b> of high swirl double-concentric jets is presented. The study considered two jets with the ratios of primary to secondary diameter at the nozzle that were characteristic of burner geometries for pulverized bituminous and brown coals. A nineth scale isothermal model burner was constructed and extensive measurements taken of the velocity field and the boundary of the central recirculation zone, defined as the zero axial velocity line. The {{size and shape of}} the recirculation zone were determined for a range of primary and secondary swirl numbers and momentum flux rations. A secondary recirculation vortex was formed inside the divergent <b>quarl</b> when the primary flow was no swirled. Primary swirl (cocurrent with the secondary) removed the vortex, significantly increasing the recirculated mass flow {{and the size of the}} recirculation zone. A finite-difference mathematical model was then used to examine the stability of the secondary vortex under combustion conditions and investigate the behaviours of the recirculation zone for different nozzle geometries. Combustion was shown to have only a small influence on the secondary vortex and the recirculation zone. Mixing behaviour and turbulence characteristics were examined in detail for two flow configurations found for the brown coal burner geometry - one having a secondary vortex and one at lower swirl which did not. A heating technique was developed to simulate the constant temperature back flow within the recirculation zone during combustion. The mixing characteristics of the primary, secondary and recirculation species were determined by heating each stream and measuring the resulting temperature field. A mathematical diffusion model was then developed to calculate the turbulent eddy diffusivity distribution for the two flow configurations. A modified four-position hot wire anenometer technique was used to measure the Reynolds stress components. Calculation of the turbulent viscosity components indicated that in the two flows, turbulence was highly non-isotropic. Viscosity component μ zz was found to be dominant and components μZ zθ and μ θθ were of the same order of magnitude as μ zz at high swirl. Components μ rθ and μ rr were negligible in both flows. The turbulent Schmidt Number was found to vary from 0. 2 to 7. 0. A mathematical combustion model was also developed to predict coal heating and ignition behaviour inside the divergent <b>quarl</b> of an industrial brown coal swirl burner on which measurements were available. Isothermal turbulent diffusivity data was scaled to represent diffusion in the full size burner and to enable comparison of predicted gas temperature profiles and the location of ignition. Calculations showed that ignition was established inside the <b>quarl</b> and the residence time within the <b>quarl</b> was important in determining the extent of coal particle combustion. A weight loss of 53. 6 % occurred adjacent to the divergent <b>quarl</b> in the secondary vortex flow configuration (mean residence time 0. 112 secs.) compared to a weight loss of 32. 6 % (0. 064 secs.) without the vortex present. A mean turbulent eddy diffusivity was found to be adequate in predicting heating and ignition characteristics. Energy supplied by turbulent diffusion from the central recirculation zone was shown to be significant in determining gas and coal particle heating within and downstream of the divergent <b>quarl.</b> Combustion energy release was found to be of secondary importance. It is concluded however that ignition within the <b>quarl</b> is necessary to maintain the thermal stability of the recirculation zone...|$|E

40|$|Lean {{premixed}} dry low emission (DLE) combustion {{system in}} a gas turbine engine is a globally accepted concept to reduce pollutant emissions and to improve combustion efficiency. This study is focused on an industrial downscaled prototype burner (4 th Generation Dry Low Emission Burner for SGT- 750 designed and manufactured by Siemens Industrial Turbo machinery AB), which has been tested extensively at atmospheric conditions. To enhance the operability and alleviate flame dynamics behavior, multiple fuel and air circuits (i. e. Rich-Pilot-Lean (RPL), Pilot and Main) are engaged in the burner. Primarily, present study evaluates the RPL-Pilot interaction effect on the main combustion zone. A highly swirled flow from the burner exit produces a central recirculation zones (CRZ) to recirculate the hot vitiated gas for sustaining the combustion process. The main flame is stabilized in the inner shear layer (ISL), which {{is found in the}} diverging section (named as <b>Quarl).</b> The total power of the burner was varied between 70 - 140 kW and the fuel used for the experiment was 99. 5 % pure methane. A short length quartz liner was used for the experiment and the residence time of the combustor is 9 ms. At the liner exit, emission sampling (CO, NOx) has been conducted using a water-cooled emission probe. Optical measurements were permitted, as the <b>Quarl</b> and combustor liner were optically accessible. Planar laser-induced fluorescence of OH molecule (OH-PLIF) and natural chemiluminescence measurements were conducted to visualize the flame characteristics and its response by changing the RPL and Pilot fuel splits. A comprehensive study was performed by varying the RPL residence time to investigate the main flame stabilization and pollutant formation of the burner. Higher RPL residence time exhibits NOx benefits {{but at the same time}} flame instability was increased. Pilot fuel percentage modification demonstrate negative impact on NOx formation due to the limited mixing of fuel and air. With the increase of Pilot fuel split, CO emission decreases, which is advantageous for increasing the LBO margin. The study has identified a number of critical situations where the flame was stabilized without any RPL and Pilot combustion. Apart from the experimental results, a simple reactor network model has been applied for predicting NOx emission. Different kinetic mechanisms were assessed and the prediction results are compared to experimental results.

Foundation for modifications to the baseline burner was placed by a theoretical analysis of the processes and demands, which directs the LPP burner operation. Numerical simulations were performed to establish the flow field of the existing burner and to evaluate principles for possible modifications. Based on the analysis proposal and the restrictions put by the existing hardware, a number of modifications were proposed. Modifications adapted to the burner included the introduction of a central body, a diffusion type gas pilot at the central lance tip, a quarl-diffuser burner outlet and the application of new main- and pilot liquid fuel injectors. To serve as a basis for the evaluation of the liquid fuel performance of the modified burner the liquid fuel injector’s isothermal spray characteristics were evaluated using PDA and water spray visualisation. The fuel injectors and the modifications flame stability and operation range for gaseous and liquid fuel operation at atmospheric conditions were evaluated in comparison to the existing baseline burner. Introduction of the geometrical changes to the baseline burner with the central body and <b>quarl</b> outlet has changed the internal aerodynamics of the burner so that at atmospheric operation the introduced modifications were able to suppress the pressure oscillations over the load range, and to decrease the Lean Blow Off limit (LBO) by a factor 1. 5 for the gaseous fuel operation. By positioning the central body end at the beginning of the diffuser <b>quarl</b> the firm attachment of the forward stagnation point and the recirculation zone to the central body was achieved for the liquid fuel operation. This supplied a stable aerodynamics to the flame. Introduction of the liquid fuel spray inside the swirl generator, slightly downstream half the height of the swirl generator gave a good balance between the radial transport of the spray to provide an even distribution of the burner cross section, while reducing the risk of droplets impacting on the swirl generator vanes and burner wall. The liquid fuel operation with the new injection nozzle positioned in the central body have proven to be able to supply a stable main flame operation from a normalised flame temperature 30 % below the design flame temperature. NOx emissions performance was found to be more or less solely dependent on the positioning of the spray within the swirl generator in contrast to the injection at the swirler/mixing tube transitio...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} global energy scenario, gas turbine can provide {{delicate}} {{balance between the}} booming worlds energy requirement and a pollutant free sustainable society. Cleaner combustion of fuel (particular natural gas), efficient, reliable, low maintenance and cost effective operation of gas turbine attracted scientific community to push the limit further (high efficiency and zero emission gas turbine). Gas turbine combustion process is complex by nature as it interacts with turbulence, chemical kinetics and thermodynamics. The combined effect directly affects the component life and cost. To gain deeper understanding and develop new eco-friendly combustion technology, continuous effort has been made from last couple of decades. In the present doctoral thesis, a downscaled prototype dry low emission technology burner was extensively investigated experimentally. The thesis also aims to compare the experimental results with numerical calculations using commercial simulation tools. The main priority of the research work {{was to understand the}} flame stabilization, flame anchoring physics, the burner operational limits and emission performance. The gas turbine burner hardware was assembled with three distinct fuel and sir supply units. Along the centerline, a primary combustion zone, the RPL (Rich-Pilot-Lean) was placed. A Pilot and Main stage was placed radially outward direction from the centerline. A secondary combustion (the main flame) zone was produced downstream of the burner throat. The primary and secondary flames were stabilized by the swirling motion of the flow. Vortex breakdown and recirculation zones assisted the steady combustion process. Several conventional measurement techniques were employed for temperature and emission (Carbon monoxide, Nitrogen oxides and unburned hydrocarbons) measurement. The experimental work in this thesis also included sophisticated optical measurement. A visually accessible liner (combustor region with diverging <b>Quarl</b> section) allowed optical access of the secondary flame region to analyze and record the flame characteristics. Line of sight Chemiluminescence (of hydroxyl radical), two dimensional hydroxyls radical planar laser induced fluorescence and particle image velocimetry diagnostic techniques were applied to investigate the secondary combustion (flame front and flow). All the experiments were conducted at atmospheric condition without any fuel heating. Chemical kinetic calculations were performed using CHEMKIN software for comparing the emission results. Steady and un-steady three dimensional computational fluid dynamic studies were conducted using ANSYS FLUENT. The RPL combustion produced a hot gas stream and provided radicals in to the secondary combustion zone (in the vicinity of forward recirculation zone). Initially, a dedicated experiment was conducted to explore the operability of the RPL combustor (primary zone) by varying the equivalence ratios and co-flow air properties. Results suggested that a slight rich operation could produce maximum radicals (Carbon monoxide, hydroxyls, oxygen and hydrogen radicals) from the RPL without affecting nitrogen oxides emission. The main flame (secondary combustion zone) stabilization process indicated that the secondary flame was stabilized around the inner shear layer (where the incoming reactant stream and recirculated hot gas stream interacted with each other) and near the liner wall (reactant stream impinged the liner wall). The lean and rich operability limits were identified from the full burner experiments. A sharp increase of carbon monoxide concentration was noticed in the proximity of lean blowout equivalence ratio (~ 0. 40). Low frequency high amplitude flame pulsation was also observed at this operating point. Flame instability and flash back tendency was observed at higher stoichiometry (~ 0. 62). The Pilot and RPL stage combustion influenced the full burner flame and emission characteristics. Interaction between Pilot stages were investigated and results suggested that rich Pilot operation was helpful for stabilizing the main flame at very lean stoichiometric combustion with an emission penalty (Nitrogen oxides concentration was increased). Lean RPL operation showed emission benefits but flame instability was increased; therefore, burner operation window was compressed. Two dimensional hydroxyls radical planar laser induced fluorescence diagnostics identified the main reaction zone (captured the super-equilibrium hydroxyl concentration) and post flame region (where relaxed hydroxyl radicals were noticed in less concentration). The maximum heat release zones were identified by the Chemiluminescence imaging. An investigation of combustor geometrical modification (aerodynamic variation) and its effect on flame characteristic was accomplished removing diverging <b>Quarl</b> geometry and replacing square liner with a circular cross section. The <b>Quarl</b> combustor arrangement demonstrated better combustion stability and wider operating window. Without <b>Quarl,</b> a third flame was observed from the outer recirculation zone. Outer recirculation zone flame intermittency and coupling with inner (central recirculation zone) flame structure produced high level of combustion dynamics issues. High hydrogen fuel (up to 50 % hydrogen by volume was mixed with methane) mixtures were introduced in the prototype burner. High hydrogen concentration aided a lean flame (100 K blowout benefit with 50 % hydrogen addition) operation without blowout. In addition, flow field diagnostics were carried out using two dimensional particle image velocimetry. The key flow structures (central and outer recirculation zones, shear layer, high speed swirl annular jet and vortical structures) were identified. The velocity measurement and radical concentration imaging explained the local wrinkling and dynamics of the flame structure. A preliminary effort was demonstrated to model the full burner with numerical three dimensional calculations. Different combustion (laminar flamelet and flamelet generated manifold) and turbulence model (Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes, Scale adaptive simulation and large eddy simulation) were implemented in ANSYS FLUENT computation. Numerical calculation added value to the experimental results by providing a detail understanding of scalar and vector fields, especially from the locations, where optical diagnostic was not possible. The computed flame structure and flow futures were compared with the experimental results. A simplified reactor based modelling was also formulated based on computational simulation results. The aim was to investigate simulation techniques conceptually that could possibly be applied in coming studies to obtain a better numerical modeling and validation activities of turbulent gas turbine combustion design and development...|$|E
40|$|In a {{very recent}} study [1] the Renormalisation Group (RNG) {{turbulence}} model {{was used to}} obtain flow predictions in a strongly swirling <b>quarl</b> burner, and was found to perform well in predicting certain features that are not well captured using less sophisticated models of turbulence. The implication is that the RNG approach should provide an economical and reliable tool for the prediction of swirling flows in combustor and furnace geometries commonly encountered in technological applications. To test this hypothesis the present work considers flow in a model furnace for which experimental data is available [2]. The essential features of the flow which differentiate it from the previous study [1] are that the annular air jet entry is relatively narrow and the base wall of the cylindrical furnace is at 90 degrees to the inlet pipe. For swirl numbers of order 1 the resulting flow is highly complex with significant inner and outer recirculation regions. The RNG and standard k-epsilon models are used to model the flow for both swirling and non-swirling entry jets and the results compared with experimental data [2]. Near wall viscous effects are accounted for in both models via the standard wall function formulation [3]. For the RNG model, additional computations with grid placement extending well inside the near wall viscous-affected sublayer are performed {{in order to assess}} the low Reynolds number capabilities of the model...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} leading to improve burner design, small and semi-industrial scale {{experiments}} {{play an important}} role providing detailed diagnostics to guide the burner concept evaluation. A methodology of scaling of natural gas flames was developed at IFRF over the last ten years. The methodology was derived using a comprehensive set of experiments, which cover the thermal input span from 0. 030 MW to 12 MW with intermediate scales of 0. 3 MW, 1. 3 MW and 4 MW. These experiments were carried out within the SCALING- 400 project. In the present paper the data from the SCALING 400 study concerning the staged NOX flames are analysed. A quite substantial NOX emission reduction is observed in the highly staged flames. The staged fuel jets immerge into hot combustion products. The mixing of the fuel gas with the combustion air takes place after the original fuel jet has been diluted with combustion products. Scaling rules of staged-low NOX flames should aim to reach these conditions. To achieve similarity in the flow pattern the general conclusions are: · The staged fuel-to-central-air momentum ratio must be maintained; · The staged Natural Gas (NG) jet momentum and Re must be high enough; · The effect of the furnace confinement is secondary for confinement ratio larger than 3 (the ratio between the furnace diameter and the <b>quarl</b> outlet diameter); · The geometrical burner similarity should be maintained; · The heat extraction in the furnace should be similar...|$|E
40|$|A Precessing Jet (PJ) burner {{has been}} {{developed}} which enhances large scale turbulence {{by means of a}} naturally occurring fluid-mechanical phenomenon. A highly stable gas flame is produced without air swirl, <b>quarl</b> or a bluff body stabiliser. The resulting natural gas flame is lower in temperature and is more luminous than flames from many conventional burners so that it reduces NO x emissions while achieving almost total burnout of combustibles. The high luminosity indicates potential for increased fuel utilisation efficiency in process industries where radiation heat transfer is important. For one configuration of the PJ burner firing natural gas in an 18 MW industrial cement kiln, NO x emissions are shown to be reduced by 75 % with a simultaneous reduction in CO when compared with the original turbulent jet burner. Photographs of these flames show that the PJ burner produces a more rapidly spreading and more luminous flame. For another configuration, firing natural gas in a 25 kW laboratory furnace, the radiation spectra of the flame produced by the PJ burner are compared with a high quality commercial swirl burner. The mean radiation intensity produced by the PJ burner is some twenty times that of the commercial burner in the visible spectrum and the normalised fluctuating intensity is about 50 %, some five times that of the commercial burner in the visible range. Good potential for flame detectability is therefore apparent. Mean intensity is shown to increase by a factor of three with the addition of swirl to the air. G. J. Nathan, R. E. Luxto...|$|E
40|$|This thesis evaluates a {{variable}} blockage low-swirl injector operated on digester gas in a simulated boiler environment {{to understand how}} such a device can impact combustion performance as fuel composition varies. California, like many other states, is requiring a reduction in emissions from primary sources of electricity generation. As emission regulations become stricter, novel strategies for achieving the reductions required are required. The current energy policy in California specifically promotes the use of renewable and carbon neutral fuels such as digester gas. The future generations of burners must be fuel flexible {{in order to meet}} these emission laws while providing continual operation. To address this, {{a variable}} geometry low-swirl injector was developed and its emissions and stability performance assessed using a variety of diagnostics. It was found that a fiber optic probe, integrated into the injector head, was able to provide a reliable measure of emissions and stability. One key result from the optical probe is that the recorded radiation emitted by the reaction corresponding to the lean blow off limits of any composition of digester gas remains constant, implying it could serve as a robust stability sensor with minimal signal processing. Evaluating the role of the variable geometry found that (1) variable center blockage in a low-swirl injector has no effect on the lean blow off limits, (2) as the center blockage becomes less restrictive the NOx emissions will increase, and (3) incorporation of a <b>quarl</b> expansion rather than a sudden expansion increased the lean blow off limits and gave a 50 % reduction in NOx emissions. Utilizing a low-swirl injector with high blockage in the central flow, high swirl number, can reduce the NOx emissions across the range of lean operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Two conﬁned lean non-premixed swirl-stabilized ﬂame typologies were {{investigated}} {{in order to}} achieve detailed information on the thermal and aerodynamic ﬁeld in the close vicinity of the burner throat and provide correlation with the exhaust emissions. Previous ﬁnding indicated the generation of a partially premixed ﬂame with radial fuel injection and a purely diﬀusive ﬂame with co-axial injection in a swirling coﬂow. In the present work, the experimental study is reported which has been conducted on a straight exit laboratory burner with no <b>quarl</b> cone, fuelled by natural gas and air, and ﬁred vertically upwards with the ﬂame stabilized at the end of two concentric pipes with the annulus supplying swirled air and the central pipe delivering the fuel. Two fuel injection typologies, co-axial and radial (i. e., transverse), leading to diﬀerent mixing mechanisms, have been characterized through diﬀerent techniques: particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) for a comprehensive analysis of the velocity ﬁeld, still photography for the detection of ﬂame front and main visible features, and thermocouples for the temperature distribution. Isothermal ﬂow conditions have been included in the experimental investigation to provide a basic picture of the ﬂow ﬁeld and to comprehend the modiﬁcations induced by the combustion process. The results indicated that, although the global mixing process and the main ﬂame structure are governed by the swirl motion imparted to the air stream, the two diﬀerent fuel injection methodologies play an important role on mixture formation and ﬂame stabilization in the primary mixing zone. Particularly, it has been found that, in case of axial injection, the turbulent interaction between the central fuel jet and the backﬂow generated by the swirl can induce an intermittent fuel penetration in the recirculated hot products and the formation of a central sooting luminous plume, a phenomenon totally absent in the case of radial injection...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} model for isothermal axisymmetric turbulent flow in a <b>quarl</b> burner {{is set up}} using the CFD package FLUENT, and numerical solutions obtained from the model are compared with available experimental data. A standard k-e model and and {{two versions of the}} RNG k-e model are used to model the turbulence. One of the aims of the computational study is to investigate whether the RNG based k-e turbulence models are capable of yielding improved flow predictions compared with the standard k-e turbulence model. A difficulty is that the flow considered here features a confined vortex breakdown which can be highly sensitive to flow behaviour both upstream and downstream of the breakdown zone. Nevertheless, the relatively simple confining geometry allows us to undertake a systematic study so that both grid-independent and domain-independent results can be reported. The systematic study includes a detailed investigation of the effects of upstream and downstream conditions on the predictions, in addition to grid refinement and other tests to ensure that numerical error is not significant. Another important aim is to determine to what extent the turbulence model predictions can provide us with new insights into the physics of confined vortex breakdown flows. To this end, the computations are discussed in detail with reference to known vortex breakdown phenomena and existing theories. A major conclusion {{is that one of the}} RNG k-e models investigated here is able to correctly capture the complex forward flow region inside the recirculating breakdown zone. This apparently pathological result is in stark contrast to the findings of previous studies, most of which have concluded that either algebraic or differential Reynolds stress modelling is needed to correctly predict the observed flow features. Arguments are given as to why an isotropic eddy-viscosity turbulence model may well be able to capture the complex flow structure within the recirculating zone for this flow setup. With regard to the flow physics, a major finding is that the results obtained here are more consistent with the view that confined vortex breakdown is a type of axisymmetric boundary layer separation, rather than a manifestation of a subcritical flow state...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{effect of}} {{combustion}} pollutant emission {{on the environment}} and increasing petroleum prices are driving development of design methodologies for clean and efficient industrial combustion technologies. The design optimization methodology employs numerical algorithms to find the optimal solution of a design problem by converting it into a multivariate minimization problem. This is done by defining a vector of design parameters that specifies the design configuration, and an objective function that quantifies the performance of the design, usually so the optimal design outcome minimizes the objective function. A numerical algorithm is then employed to find the design parameters that minimize the objective function; these parameters thus specify the optimal design. However this technique is used in several other fields of research, its application to industrial combustion is fairly new. In the present study, a statistical optimization method called response surface methodology is connected to a CFD solver to find the highest combustion efficiency by changing the inlet air swirl number and burner <b>quarl</b> angle in a furnace. OpenFOAM is used to model the steady-state combustion of natural gas in the 300 KW BERL combustor. The main barrier to applying optimization in the design of industrial combustion equipment is the substantial computational effort needed to carry out the CFD simulation every time the objective function needs to be evaluated. This is intensified by the stiffness of the coupled governing partial differential equations, which can cause instability and divergent simulations. The present study addresses both of these issues by initializing the flow field for each objective function evaluation with the numerical results of the previously converged point. This modification dramatically reduced computation time. The combustion of diesel spray in the GenTex 50 M process heater is investigated in the next part of this thesis. Experimental and numerical studies were carried out for both the cold spray and the diesel combustion where the numerical results satisfactorily predicted the observations. The simulation results show that, when carrying out a parametric design of a liquid fuel-fired combustor it is necessary to consider the effect of design parameters on the spray aerodynamic characteristics and size distribution, the air/spray interactions, {{and the size of the}} recirculation zones...|$|E
40|$|In {{the process}} of coal {{cleaning}} operations, {{a significant amount of}} coal is washed away as waste into the ponds. Clearly, such a large quantity of dumped coal fines has a detrimental effect on the environment. This investigation presents in innovative approach to recover and utilize waste coal fines from the preparation plant effluent streams and tailing ponds. Due to the large moisture content of the recovered coal fines, this study is focused on the utilization of coal fines in the coal-water slurry fuel (CWSF). The CWSF consists of 53. 3 % weight solids with a viscosity of less than 500 centipoise and 80 - 90 % of solids passing 200 mesh. The 53. 3 % weight solids constitute a blend of 15 % effluent recovered coal fines and 85 % clean coal. It is the authors premise that a blend of plant coal and recovered waste coal fines can be used to produce a coal-water slurry fuel with the desired combustion characteristics required by the industry. In order to evaluate these characteristics the coal-water slurry fuel is fired in a test furnace at three firing rates (834, 330 Btu/hr, 669, 488 Btu/hr and 508, 215 Btu/hr) with three different burner settings for each firing rate. Combustion tests were conducted to determine the range of secondary air swirl required to maintain a stable combustion flame. Results obtained during the flame stability testing show no significant effect of swirl settings on Nox, SO 2 and CO 2 for three combustion tests (834, 330 Btu/hr, 669, 488 Btu/hr, 508 215 Btu/hr). At each of the two higher firing rates, combustion was relatively complete regardless of swirl settings, therefore, burner settings may be adjusted to provide a visually stable flame without concern for higher carbon in ash as a function of burner settings. The parameters affecting flame stability are mainly coal particle size, volatile matter, ash content and excess air. Tests conducted at three different locations (top, Middle, Bottom) revealed that the gaseous concentrations such as Nox, SO 2 and CO 2 were a function of residence time for each of the firing rates. Effect of swirl settings on Nox for three firing rates were investigated. It was found that the variation of Nox concentrations with respect to the change in swirl numbers was significant. But, the variation of Nox Concentration with respect to firing rates was found to be consistent with the increase in firing rates. The flame stability was accessed by the visual observation of the flame with relation to the burner <b>quarl...</b>|$|E
40|$|Problems of {{combustion}} instability {{and the need}} for wider range in firing rates have drawn attention to the need for more fundamental knowledge of the performance and the characteristics of pressure-jet atomized oil flames. A secondary problem is the complication and inconvenience of measurements on full scale equipment. In the present study various operational conditions for a typical modern burner with a pressure-jet atomizer and a swirled air supply were investigated. The variables chosen were fuel rate and spray angle. Data obtained consisted of gas composition, velocity and temperature measurements. The development of a laboratory unit was considered desirable to provide a means of facilitating measurements on flames of this type and a rig was constructed which consisted of a suitable combustion box and 3 / 10 ths scale burner. It was shown that the matching of the spray angle to the air register aerodynamics affected the flame characteristics very markedly, Regions of high unburnt fuel occurred due to fuel penetration and poor mixing outside and downstream of {{the main part of the}} flame. The effect of widening the spray angle which usually occurs with wide range types of pressure-jet atomizers at the lower fuel rates was shown to be particularly unsatisfactory, and to effect the black smoke limit. The general course of mixing and the progress of combustion through the flame was deduced from calculation from the gas composition results. The distribution and effects of recirculation were shown from the velocity measurements. These were related to data for simple jets. In particular, it was deduced that internal recirculation in the core was largely responsible for flame stabilization. Theoretically derived scaling criteria were investigated by comparing full scale and model results. These showed that reasonable comparisons were possible between the two, with flames scaled either on the basis of similarity in velocity and relative momentum between spray and air, or on similarity in residence times in the flame. The former was thought probably to be better, Cold flow measurements were made, and showed differences in the size of the central recirculation core between hot and cold but not in the peak velocity to peak velocity diameter early in the flame. Combustion oscillation measurements on a marine boiler produced data which suggested strongly that these were of the "non-acoustic" type. None of the theories so far suggested appear to - ii - account with much accuracy for the observed data. In the course of experimental work various special Instruments for flow measurement were developed. It was concluded that the choice of spray distribution to suit a particular aerodynamic pattern was vital to the optimum performance of the burner. In all the cases investigated this was found to be to some extent imperfect. It is considered that decided improvements could be made to the air distribution in burners of this type. The following possibilities are suggested solutions, the use of a higher degree of swirl and a confining <b>quarl,</b> upstream air injection or the use of multiple oil nozzles and by avoiding devices where the spray angle varies widely over the operating range...|$|E
