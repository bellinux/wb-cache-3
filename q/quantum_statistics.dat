25|$|This {{state of}} matter was first {{predicted}} by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein in 1924–25. Bose first sent a paper to Einstein on the <b>quantum</b> <b>statistics</b> of light quanta (now called photons). Einstein was impressed, translated the paper from English to German and submitted it for Bose to the Zeitschrift für Physik, which published it. Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to material particles (or matter) in two other papers.|$|E
25|$|Bose's {{interpretation}} {{is now called}} Bose–Einstein statistics. This result derived by Bose laid the foundation of <b>quantum</b> <b>statistics,</b> and especially the revolutionary new philosophical conception of the indistinguishability of particles, as acknowledged by Einstein and Dirac. When Einstein met Bose face-to-face, he asked him whether he had been aware that he had invented {{a new type of}} statistics, and he very candidly said that no, he wasn't that familiar with Boltzmann's statistics and didn't realize that he was doing the calculations differently. He was equally candid with anyone who asked.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, the polylogarithm (also {{known as}} Jonquière's {{function}}, for Alfred Jonquière) {{is a special}} function Lis(z) of order s and argument z. Only for special values of s does the polylogarithm reduce to an elementary function such as the natural logarithm or rational functions. In <b>quantum</b> <b>statistics,</b> the polylogarithm function appears as the closed form of integrals of the Fermi–Dirac distribution and the Bose–Einstein distribution, and {{is also known as}} the Fermi–Dirac integral or the Bose–Einstein integral. In quantum electrodynamics, polylogarithms of positive integer order arise in the calculation of processes represented by higher-order Feynman diagrams.|$|E

25|$|In <b>quantum</b> <b>{{statistics}},</b> Bose–Einstein statistics (or more colloquially B–E statistics) {{is one of}} {{two possible}} ways in which a collection of non-interacting indistinguishable particles may occupy a set of available discrete energy states, at thermodynamic equilibrium. The aggregation of particles in the same state, which is a characteristic of particles obeying Bose–Einstein statistics, accounts for the cohesive streaming of laser light and the frictionless creeping of superfluid helium. The theory of this behaviour was developed (1924–25) by Satyendra Nath Bose, who recognized that a collection of identical and indistinguishable particles can be distributed in this way. The idea was later adopted and extended by Albert Einstein in collaboration with Bose.|$|E
25|$|Satyendra Nath Bose, {{along with}} Saha, {{presented}} several papers in theoretical physics and pure mathematics from 1918 onwards. In 1924, {{while working as}} a Reader (Professor without a chair) at the Physics Department of the University of Dhaka, Bose wrote a paper deriving Planck's quantum radiation law without any reference to classical physics by using a novel way of counting states with identical particles. This paper was seminal in creating the very important field of <b>quantum</b> <b>statistics.</b> Though not accepted at once for publication, he sent the article directly to Albert Einstein in Germany. Einstein, recognising the importance of the paper, translated it into German himself and submitted it on Bose's behalf to the prestigious Zeitschrift für Physik. As a result of this recognition, Bose was able to work for two years in European X-ray and crystallography laboratories, during which he worked with Louis de Broglie, Marie Curie, and Einstein.|$|E

[...] (The Einstein manuscript, once believed to be lost, {{was found in a}} library at Leiden University in 2005.). Einstein then extended Bose's ideas to matter in two other papers. The result of their efforts is the concept of a Bose gas, governed by Bose–Einstein statistics, which describes the statistical distribution of identical particles with integer spin, now called bosons. Bosons, which include the photon as well as atoms such as helium-4 (4He), are allowed to share a quantum state. Einstein proposed that cooling bosonic atoms to a very low temperature would cause them to fall (or [...] "condense") into the lowest accessible quantum state, resulting in a new form of matter.|$|E
