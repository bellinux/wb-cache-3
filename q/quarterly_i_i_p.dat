40|$|Mathematics {{presents}} a stumbling block to many students, particularly those majoring in scientific fields, business administration, or elementary education. Improvement {{of student achievement}} in mathematics at the lower division college level is needed. Seven instructional methods were investigated in terms of student achievement: programmed instruction (<b>P.</b> <b>I.),</b> individualized instruction (<b>I.</b> <b>I.),</b> computer based instruction (CBI), laboratory and discovery methods (Lab), television (TV), audio-tutorial (A-T), and tutoring. The research questions were: (1) What is the relative effectiveness of the innovative instructional methods as measured by student achievement and compared to the traditional lecture method? (2) What is the relative effectiveness of the innovative instructional methods on students of differing ability and course levels. (3) What is the effectiveness of combinations of the innovative instructional methods? A meta-analytical approach was used. Studies comparing an innovative method to the lecture or to another innovative method were located, and the summary data in each were used to calculate an "effect size" [...] a standardized measure {{of the effectiveness of}} the innovative method [...] to which statistical procedures were applied. The meta-analysis found that (1) Relative to the lecture method, six of the innovative methods produced a positive effect on student achievement. The ranking of the methods in order of decreasing effectiveness was: tutoring, CAI, A-T, <b>I.</b> <b>I.,</b> <b>P.</b> <b>I.,</b> Lab, TV. (2) The most effective methods by level of course were: (a) Precalculus level: CAI, A-T, and tutoring; (b) Calculus level: tutoring, <b>I.</b> <b>I.,</b> <b>P.</b> <b>I.,</b> and A-T; (c) Foundations of Mathematics (elementary education majors) : P.

Therefore, determining rice cultivars with high resistance to SRBSDV and RRSV is necessary.

Using these coordinates we study the triple collision in the spatial problem introducing the nonrotating triple collision manifold and studing its topology Let q <b>i,</b> <b>p</b> <b>i,</b> <b>i</b> = 1; 2; 3 the coordinates and momenta respectively of three particles in some 3 -dimensional inertial frame. We can write the Hamiltonian H as follows (1) H = 2 m <b>i</b> <b>p</b> <b>i</b> Γ where m <b>i,</b> <b>i</b> = 1; 2; 3 are the three masses. The corresponding hamiltonian equations are (2) q <b>i</b> = <b>p</b> <b>i</b> <b>p</b> <b>i</b> = Γ m <b>i</b> m j (q <b>i</b> Γ q j) j q <b>i</b> Γ q j j m <b>i</b> m k (q <b>i</b> Γ q k) j q <b>i</b> Γ q k j where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time, t. In the equation above and throughout this paper the other equations can be obtained interchanging the subindex (i; j; k) over the cyclic permutations of (1, 2, 3). Now, we introduce new variables q <b>i,</b> <b>i</b> = 1; 2; 3 and ! q ? defined by (3) q <b>i</b> = q j Γ q k and ! q ?= m <b>i</b> q <b>i</b> where M = m 1 +m 2 +m 3. We have to note that q <b>i</b> are not independent variables because they satisfy the relation q 1 + q 2 + q 3 = 0. Their conjugate momenta <b>p</b> <b>i,</b> <b>i</b> = 1; 2; 3 and ! p ? are introduced by the relation (see [3]) (4) <b>p</b> <b>i</b> = j + <b>p</b> k + ! p ? : Substituing (3) and (4) into (1) we obtain a new Hamiltonian (5) H = 2 jk <b>i</b> + 1 2 M ! p ? j p k Γ X m j m k where all the summations run over the cyclic permutations of (1; 2; 3), and ij = m <b>i</b> m j =(m <b>i</b> +m j). Our goal is {{to obtain a}} global regularization of the three body problem, so we must remove the terms m j m k in t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{experimental}} work {{has demonstrated that}} the use of an atomic beam apparatus in the measurement of absolute f-value is a valuable method from which reliable experimental results can be obtained. Changes and improvements were made in the apparatus, increasing its sensitivity and reliability; these modifications are described. A discussion of the validity of certain assumptions in the atomic beam theory is presented. A discussion is also presented of checks made on the reliability of the experimental measurements. Absolute f-value measurements were made on the stronger resonance lines of Cr <b>I,</b> Ga <b>I,</b> In <b>I,</b> Tl <b>I,</b> <b>Pd</b> <b>I,</b> and Sn <b>I.</b> The results of these measurements are presented and compared with those of other investigators. Suggestions are made for improvements in the atomic beam apparatus. These improvements would increase the number of elements whose absolute f-values could be measured by this method. </p...|$|R

The first stage of the programme’s implementation was carried out over a two year period (2011 - 2012) in 10 Italian cities. As its name implies, the <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> aims to prevent out-of-home placement and to respond to problems linked to child neglect in view of all children’s right to quality care. The activities provided by the <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>I.</b> were continuously monitored using a pre- and post-test design incorporating both quantitative and qualitative approaches (questionnaire and documentation analysis). This manuscript outlines the results of that experience and goes on to draw implications for future policy and practice. The results underline the importance of multidimensional assessments and interventions, the usefulness of shared tools to activate shared and multi-professional decision-making and the potentially valuable contribution of families and children to service planning...|$|R
