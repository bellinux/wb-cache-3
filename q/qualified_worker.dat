40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{existence}} and the scale of education externalities in the unemployment durations suffered by workers in the UK. First, we develop a theoretical model. Using a matching framework we show that {{a rise in the}} average level of education of a labour market will affect unemployment durations in two different ways. It will increase the firms' expected profits per vacancy opened, since firms expect to be matched with a more <b>qualified</b> <b>worker,</b> rising job creation and reducing unemployment durations. We call this the Composition or External effect. But, since more qualified workers are more efficient in the process of job search, it will also rise the competition amongst workers for opened vacancies, increasing unemployment durations. We name this the Competition effect. In the most skilled segments of the labour market the composition effect will dominate the competition effect, while in the least skilled segments the opposite will be true. Then, we test these theoretical results empirically using data from the UK Labour Force Survey for the 17 UK regions over the period 1992 Q 1 - 99 Q 4. We find that a 1 % rise in the average level of education reduces unemployment durations of individuals from skilled occupations by 2. 9 % on average, while it rises the unemployment durations of individuals from unskilled occupations by 1. 9 % on average. This effect is robust to different measures of education, to controlling for unobserved heterogeneity and to different parameterisations of the hazard function. ...|$|E

40|$|Assuming {{that the}} cost of {{education}} of an engineer in 1963 in Poland amounted to about 670 000 zł in current prices, the question is being put forward how much time is needed for such a <b>qualified</b> <b>worker</b> to pay back to the community this sum of money. It seems to be reasonable to believe that rate of repayment is depending on the way an engineer is being employed. As there exists a lack of accurate figures on this matter, the author is trying to apply some sort of model analysis and is approaching the problem from both, productivity and salary points of view. At first he starts with the rate of growth of the national income that is assumed {{to be the result of}} a labour productivity of all the employed engineers only, but their productivity may result in the above mentioned rate of growth from 25 % to 100 %. Then the average salary in 1963 gives him an opportunity to suppose that the so called,,value for the community" adequate to the Marxian surplus value) may swing from 25 % to 150 % respectively. In this way he is geting a relatively wide gap, which seems to include all the engineers no matter where and how they are employed. The above mentioned gap constitutes at the same time a proper answer to his basic question. As a result, the author comes to the conclusion, that approximately 5 — 15 years are needed for an engineer to repay to the community the education expenses (the so called unproduced value included) and 3, 5 — 10 years — if the latter element is being excluded.

This study, of the teaching and learning processes in supervision, is essentially illuminative in nature and purpose. It is a qualitative study from the perspectives of supervisors and students. It presents same illustrative experiences which can not be adequately explained using the traditional model of supervision. Following a review which shows the roots of this model in American supervision literature, the research problem is defined. The research task is seen to be the generation of descriptions and interpretations of teaching and learning in supervision which are meaningful to the participants themselves. After reviewing same research into how adults learn, data gathered by a 'range of methods are presented as illustrative case exanples, which point to the iDportanoe of the oonoept. ians which the supervisors am students have of the learning process as a factor in explaining the pattems of interaction seen in the supervisory :relatiooship.

40|$|Sandia is {{developing}} a Personnel and Material Tracking System (PAMTRAK) which uses {{a variety of techniques}} to monitor material inside a vault in real-time. It can detect material movement using video cameras inside the vault or motion sensors attached to the material. It also contains two prototype attribute monitoring systems that continuously measure material weight, temperature or movement. A site can use any of these alone or together to extend physical inventory intervals. PAMTRAK can reduce the cost of storing material by reducing inventory frequency and radiation exposure to workers. Analysis at Savannah River in 1992 estimated that installing PAMTRAK in the 7 active and future vaults at that site would save $ 1, 073, 000 per year by reducing inventory frequency from monthly to yearly. Performing similar calculations now, assuming lower radiation exposure limits of 700 m Rem per year, new inventory reduction guidelines allowing a baseline interval of 6 months, and an achieved inventory interval of 3 years, results in an estimated average savings of $ 400, 000 per year. PAMTRAK, since it is real-time, can detect theft or diversion soon enough to give the guard force a chance of recovering the material and apprehending the perpetrator. In performing an inventory a site typically checks {{only a fraction of the}} material using random, statistical sampling, while PAMTRAK monitors all material in the vault. In addition to static environments such as vaults, PAMTRAK can be used to protect material in active work areas. Several of the sensor types can ignore activity around material but still report alarms if the material is moved or handled. PAMTRAK includes a personnel tracking capability that allows a site to monitor and restrict personnel movements. It can exclude workers from designated areas unless they have explicit permission to be there. It can also enforce the 2 -person rule by requiring a worker to be accompanied by at least one other <b>qualified</b> <b>worker...</b>|$|E

30|$|Before {{proceeding}} to {{a presentation of}} study findings on the potential consequences of overeducation, it is worth remembering that the measured probability or incidence of overqualification also depends on the decision to accept a job (Cutillo and Di Pietro 2006; Di Pietro and Urwin 2006). If jobseekers have trouble finding a well-qualified job, they face the choice of accepting a more poorly qualified job or a prolongation of unemployment. Albrecht and Vroman (2002) developed a theoretical model that shows that the likelihood of well <b>qualified</b> <b>workers</b> rejecting less <b>qualified</b> jobs in favour of unemployment depends both on the productivity differential (and hence the wage differential) between qualified and unqualified jobs and on the supply of <b>qualified</b> <b>workers.</b> According to this model, {{in the presence of}} a large wage differential, good unemployment benefits and a relative scarcity of highly <b>qualified</b> <b>workers,</b> well <b>qualified</b> individuals are more likely to be unemployed than poorly qualified individuals with identical formal qualifications. Failing to address the fact that a person can choose to refuse a job they would be overqualified for would result in a biased estimation of the factors that influence overeducation in such a case.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{demonstrate}} {{how important the}} existence of a pool of qualified workers within the local labour market is for the process of job creation and the location of economic activity. In chapter 1 the basic theoretical model is developed. Using a matching model it is shown that Job Creation will be higher if firms have a larger pool of qualified workers from which to fill their vacancies, since their expected profits per vacancy opened will be greater. At the same time, individuals have a higher incentive to invest in education if job creation is higher. The interaction between these two forces generates a pecuniary externality in the labour market. In chapter 2, we extend the theoretical model by considering two regions and the possibility of migration. In equilibrium, areas where the pool of qualified workers is larger attract more jobs and skilled workers. Job Creation will be higher in such areas since firms located there are able to find a more <b>qualified</b> <b>worker</b> with greater ease. At the same time, given the sunk cost of moving, only the most skilled workers will find migration to these areas worthwhile. The interaction between these two forces generates a pecuniary externality that encourages concentration of economic activity in areas with a larger pool of qualified workers. In chapter 3 we estimate the effect of the pecuniary education externality on the process of matching in the UK regional labour market in the 1990 s. We find a significant effect of the average level of education in a region on the conditional probability of finding a job in that region using a duration model. This effect is positive for skilled occupations and negative for unskilled ones. Finally, in Chapter 4 we estimate the effect of the education externality on the individual decision to stay-on in education. We find that the share of the region's working age population with degree has a positive and significant effect on the education decisions of sixteen and eighteen year-olds, while the share with high vocational has a similar effect for seventeen year-olds...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} a type of employment contract on starting wage and short-term wage growth. I estimate the differences in starting wage and wage growth patterns between temporary and permanent workers by using a dataset from the Netherlands. The data contain new graduates from post-secondary schools in the Netherlands. As in the continental European countries, the use of temporary employment is common in the Netherlands, especially among young workers. Those who just graduate from school have less experience in the labor market. It is rather difficult for an employer to find a <b>qualified</b> <b>worker.</b> Because of high firing costs for a permanent worker, an employer has to bear more costs if employing an under-qualified worker. To avoid this, an employer engages in a more intensive search processes when hiring a worker on a permanent worker, which increase search costs. If such costs are passed on to a permanent worker, the starting wage is expected to be lower for a permanent worker than a temporary worker. The empirical comparisons of the starting wage shows evidence of a lower starting wage, but this is not robust to differences in estimation structure. The comparison of the wage growth between the two types of contract shows that wage growth is more suppressed for a temporary worker than for a permanent worker. Since the observations are those who have little job experience, training upon employment is important. As a matter of fact, almost all relevant observations receive training at the beginning, regardless of type of contract. Employers could recoup the costs of training by suppressing the wage growth relative to underlying productivity growth. An employer suppresses wage growth more for a temporary worker than a permanent worker as the shorter employment period of a temporary worker leaves the employer with less time to recoup the costs. The empirical results confirm this hypothesis, and these findings are robust. The empirical strategy in this paper takes into consideration the fact that the type of contract is presumably determined endogenously even after controlling for observable individual characteristics. The empirical results indeed indicate that this selectivity issue is necessary to be considered. ...|$|E
40|$|The Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, NFPA 70 E, and {{relevant}} OSHA electrical safety standards evolved {{to address the}} hazards of 60 -Hz power that are faced primarily by electricians, linemen, and others performing facility and utility work. This leaves a substantial gap {{in the management of}} electrical hazards in Research and Development (R&D) and specialized high voltage and high power equipment. Examples include lasers, accelerators, capacitor banks, electroplating systems, induction and dielectric heating systems, etc. Although all such systems are fed by 50 / 60 Hz alternating current (ac) power, we find substantial use of direct current (dc) electrical energy, and the use of capacitors, inductors, batteries, and radiofrequency (RF) power. The electrical hazards of these forms of electricity and their systems are different than for 50160 Hz power. Over the past 10 years there has been an effort to develop a method of classifying all of the electrical hazards found in all types of R&D and utilization equipment. Examples of the variation of these hazards from NFPA 70 E include (a) high voltage can be harmless, if the available current is sufficiently low, (b) low voltage can be harmful if the available current/power is high, (c) high voltage capacitor hazards are unique and include severe reflex action, affects on the heart, and tissue damage, and (d) arc flash hazard analysis for dc and capacitor systems are not provided in existing standards. This work has led to a comprehensive electrical hazard classification system that is based on various research conducted over the past 100 years, on analysis of such systems in R&D, and on decades of experience. Initially, national electrical safety codes required the <b>qualified</b> <b>worker</b> only to know the source voltage to determine the shock hazard. Later, as arc flash hazards were understood, the fault current and clearing time were needed. These items are still insufficient to fully characterize all types of electrical hazards. The new comprehensive electrical hazard classification system uses a combination of voltage, shock current available, fault current available, power, energy, and waveform to classify all forms of electrical hazards. Based on this electrical hazard classification system, many new tools have been developed, including (a) work controls for these hazards, (b) better selection of PPE for R&D work, (c) improved training, and (d) a new Severity Ranking Tool that is used to rank electrical accidents and incidents with various forms of electrical energy...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Population {{monitoring}} and screening of {{blood pressure is}} an important part of any population health strategy. <b>Qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> are expensive and often unavailable for screening. Non-health workers with electronic blood pressure monitors are increasingly used in community-based research. This approach is unvalidated. In a poor, urban community we compared blood pressure measurements taken by non-health workers using electronic devices against <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> using mercury sphygmomanometers. Method: Fifty-six adult volunteers participated in the research. Data were collected by five <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers,</b> and six non-health workers. Participants were randomly allocated to have their blood pressure measured on four consecutive occasions by alternating a <b>qualified</b> health <b>worker</b> with a non-health worker. Descriptive statistics and graphs, and mixed effects linear models to account for the repeated measurement were used in the analysis. Results: Blood pressure readings by non-health workers were more reliable than those taken by <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers.</b> There was no significant difference between the readings taken by <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> and those taken by non-health workers for systolic blood pressure. Non-health workers were, on average, 5 &#x 2013; 7 mmHg lower in their measures of blood pressure than the <b>qualified</b> health <b>workers</b> (95 %HPD: &#x 2212; 2. 9 to &#x 2212; 10. 0) for diastolic blood pressure.
