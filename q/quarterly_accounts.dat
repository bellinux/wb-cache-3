This study examines investors’ response towards the occurrence of the deviation. Data is based on 792 listed companies of Bursa Malaysia in 2012. The results of the OLS regression show that the companies without earnings deviation have significantly higher earnings response coefficient than companies experiencing earnings deviation. It is also found that understated quarterly earnings companies have higher earnings response coefficient than overstated companies. Results imply that investors place higher reliability on the <b>quarterly</b> <b>accounts</b> produced by companies without earnings deviation. Higher reliability is placed on the understated quarterly earnings companies as compared to overstated companies. Findings suggest that investors do value the occurrence and types of earnings deviation. Therefore, steps should be taken to overcome the occurrence of deviation. ...|$|E

40|$|Short-term analysts use many {{tools to}} {{forecast}} economic activity. Among these tools, estimating and, then, simulating univariate models is very common. Most {{of the time}} the series used for the variable of interest {{as well as for the}} regressors are last available releases. Except for the latter observation, data have thus usually been revised many times since they were first published. Using data as close as possible to the reality seems quite natural. From this point of view, last published data are the best candidates. However this study proves that models based on these series are not the most accurate when one aims at predicting the first published data (and not the definitive one published years after). It can be the case when the predictive accuracy is evaluated considering the forecast errors calculated in comparison to the first released values. In such a case, it is more efficient, under certain assumptions, to perform models based exclusively on the series of first published data (first results series also called "real time" data) instead of last available series. The interest of this approach is firstly theoretically assessed considering the framework of the French <b>quarterly</b> <b>accounts</b> and secondly empirically validated by comparing the results of both methods (series of last available results compared to series of first results) to forecast GDP growth in real time. It turns out that to forecast the first published value of GDP quarterly growth, using the series of the first results as the variable of interest improves significantly the quality of forecasts. <b>quarterly</b> <b>accounts,</b> forecasts, GDP, real time...|$|E

Our estimates show clear evidence of incomplete pass-through: a unit increase in NIBOR leads to an approximately 0. 8 increase in bank rates. On the other hand, the difference between banks' loan and deposit rates is independent of NIBOR. Our findings are consistent with the view that banks face a downward-sloping demand curve for loans and an upward-sloping supply curve for customer deposits. interest rates; NIBOR; pass-through; funding costs; bank panel data; dynamic factor model...|$|E

This paper presents a quarterly indicator based on the changes in industrial entrepreneurs expectations as regards annual investment. This indicator derives from the estimation of the successive adaptations of entrepreneurs investment plans as times goes by, depending on the evolutions of short-term macroeconomic activity; it proves to be strongly correlated with the fluctuations of the entrepreneurs investment growth rate (as is measured in the French <b>Quarterly</b> <b>Accounts).</b> Moreover, the indicator is available about three months ahead with respect to the first results release of the quarterly national accounts. The probability distributions of changes in expectations are not gaussian (due to heavy tails and strong concentrations near zero).

Working with coherence analysis in an efficient way is normally a work-intensive task consisting mainly of collecting data from different sources and comparing them in a structured manner.

40|$|Mesange is {{a medium-size}} {{quarterly}} macro-econometric {{model of the}} French economy (about 500 equations, three sectors). The model describes short-term Keynesian dynamics and its long-term equilibrium is driven by supply-side determinants. Its reestimation on {{data from the national}} accounts base 2000 with fixed-base volumes is presented in a recent working paper (Klein and Simon, 2010). This first version of the model has been optimized for simulation use. Other applications of the Mesange model (short-term forecasting, analyses of the past) required its adaptation to the published data from the <b>quarterly</b> <b>accounts</b> with chained-linked volumes, as well as the integration of the recent crisis episode. A second version of the Mesange model has, therefore, been developed for this purpose. This version is presented in this working paper. First, the problems raised for macroeconomic modelling by national accounts with chained-linked volumes are explained and the solutions chosen to adapt the model to these new conventions are discussed. The applications of the version of the model with chained-linked volumes are, then, explained and illustrated with examples. Last, the main reestimated equations are detailed. The differences with respect to the version of the model with fixed-base volumes are commented. They stem from estimations based on non-identical data, but also from the different uses made of the two versions of Mesange and the resulting various needs and constraints that have conditioned the methodological choices that have been made. As for the version of the model with chained-linked volumes, priority has been given {{to the quality of the}} adjustment to the data rather than to the underlying theoretical framework.

40|$|The paper {{starts with}} {{examining}} the standard concept of government expenditure multiplier and finds {{that in a}} model of open economy with government revenues and expenditures the multiplier definition is incorrect {{in so far as}} the import intensity component relates total imports to GDP, whereas part of imports serves as inputs in exported output. Therefore the value of imports should be related to the value of final output, which is the sum of domestic absorption and exports. Since for most countries final output is significantly larger than GDP, the value of the multiplier is correspondingly larger. Moreover, the paper argues that, the import intensity of exports being as a rule larger than that of domestic absorption, the import intensity of the latter - which is the import intensity relevant for the government expenditure multiplier - is lower than that of final output, which again raises the value of the multiplier. Next the value of the government expenditure multiplier in Poland in 2006 - 2008 is estimated on the basis of statistics of non-financial <b>quarterly</b> <b>accounts</b> by institutional sectors. The variations in the value of multiplier are found to depend heavily on changes in import intensity of domestic absorption. The value of the multiplier ranges between 1. 59 and 1. 70 if, {{in order to reduce the}} impact of seasonal fluctuations, it is calculated on a quarterly basis, for four consecutive quarters, and between 1. 62 and 1. 86 if, in order to make the calculations more suitable for economic forecasting, the quarterly coefficients year on year are used. Both sets of multiplier values are slightly higher than those assumed in other countries (1. 5 - 1. 6) which may be explained by the rather high import intensity of Polish exports. macroeconomics, principle of effective demand, fiscal multiplier, stabilization policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{high levels}} reached by world {{oil prices and}} fuel prices in mid 2008 have raised notable {{concerns}} {{about the risk of}} future significant drops in household purchasing power. In the framework of a national strategy to reduce CO 2 emissions, a tax reform on fossil fuels is also being studied. In this context, this paper aims to identify the categories of households that are most exposed to an energy-price increase and to assess the sensitivity of household consumption to changes in fuel prices and (to a lesser extent) in household energy prices. First, we estimate price elasticities using time series data from the French <b>quarterly</b> <b>accounts.</b> We, then, carry out a microeconomic analysis, which enables us to take the heterogeneity of consumer behaviour into account and {{to assess the impact of}} a price increase depending on the categories of households. We use individual consumption data from the 2006 "Consumer expenditure survey. The low price variability between households, which constitutes the main limitation of cross-section data, is circumvented by constructing personalised price indices for each surveyed household, following the Ruiz and Trannoy (2008) methodology. The estimated average price elasticities of demand to fuel prices derived from the time series data are significant, around 0. 2 in the short run and 0. 4 in the long run. The price elasticity estimates resulting from the micro approach are included in the range 0. 7 - 1. 0. The microeconomic analysis also shows that the households using their personal vehicles to go to work are less sensitive to higher fuel prices that those who do not use their cars for that purpose. Conversely, the difference in sensitivity between the least and most wealthy households appears to be quite low.
