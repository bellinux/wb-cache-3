Because of its bitter taste, <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> are commercialized without their coat for human consumption. Quinoa coats are {{surfactant}} sub-products of the quinoa food industry, which have been only characterized to contain triterpene saponins. We postulated that this coat should also contain antioxidant molecules as part of the defense system of the <b>quinoa</b> <b>seed.</b> We found that a <b>quinoa</b> <b>seed</b> coats hydroalcoholic <b>extract,</b> displayed thiol compounds in addition to polyphenols, recognized antioxidants. Accordingly, it inhibited microsomal lipid peroxidation and the loss of microsomal thiol content, both oxidative phenomena promoted by Cu 2 +/ascorbate. Microsomal glutathione S-transferase (GST) is inhibited by reducing agents, which decrease the content of catalytically active disulfide-linked dimers. The effects of this quinoa extract on microsomal GST are consistent with it displaying disulfide reducing properties. The occurrence of thiol compounds in this quinoa extract is discussed in terms of the potential of their antioxidant properties...|$|R

CqTI presented active against commercial bovine trypsin and chymotrypsin and had a specific activity of 5, 033. 00 (TIU/mg), which was purified to 333. 5 -fold. The extent of purification was determined by SDS-PAGE. CqTI had an apparent molecular weight of approximately 12 KDa and two bands in reduced conditions as determined by Tricine-SDS-PAGE. MALDI-TOF showed two peaks in 4, 246. 5 and 7, 908. 18 m/z. CqTI presented high levels of essential amino acids.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the influence of extraction pH on heat-induced aggregation, gelation and microstructure of suspensions of protein isolates extracted from quinoa (Chenopodium <b>quinoa</b> Willd). <b>Quinoa</b> <b>seed</b> protein was <b>extracted</b> by alkaline treatment at various pH values (pH 8 (E 8), 9 (E 9), 10 (E 10) and 11 (E 11)), followed by acid precipitation. The obtained protein isolates were freeze dried. The protein isolates E 8 and E 9 resulted in a lower protein yield as well as less protein denaturation. These isolates also had a higher protein purity, more protein bands at higher molecular weights, and a higher protein solubility in the pH range of 3 - 4. 5, compared to the isolates E 10 and E 11. Heating the 10 % w/w protein isolate suspensions E 8 and E 9 led to increased aggregation, and semi-solid gels with a dense microstructure were formed. The isolate suspensions E 10 and E 11, on the other hand, aggregated less, did not form self-supporting gels and had loose particle arrangements. We conclude that extraction pH plays an important role in determining the functionality of quinoa protein isolates. </p...|$|R
40|$|Seeds {{with colored}} testa (seed coat) contain high {{concentrations}} of polyphenolic compounds that exhibit high levels of antioxidant activity. Common processing procedures, such as cooking and baking, decrease the levels of these bioactive compounds and consequently, overall antioxidant activity. Here, the effects of baking and cooking processes were examined on total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and ferric-reducing ability of plasma antioxidant activity (FRAP AA) of red and yellow <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds.</b> Our results indicate that red <b>quinoa</b> <b>seed</b> contains {{significantly higher levels of}} TPC, TFC and FRAP AA than yellow <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds.</b> In addition, cooked and baked <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> retain most of their TPC, TFC and FRAP AA in the final product. Thus, red <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> processed by these two methods might be considered a functional food, in addition to its traditional role of providing dietary proteins. Due to their high antioxidant activity, red <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> might also contribute significantly to the management and/or prevention of degenerative diseases associated with free radical damage...|$|R

40|$|<b>Quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> (Chenopodium <b>quinoa)</b> {{are usually}} {{reported}} {{as a good}} source of minerals; however, information about in vitro bioacessibility is scarce. The aim {{of the present study was}} to estimate the minerals bioaccessibility of <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> using different cooking processes: raw, steamed and boiled. The digestion of samples were performed using the harmonized static “in vitro” digestion protocol method (IVD) 1, with a minor modification concerning the oral phase enzymatic composition (bacterial α-amylase). The copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), sodium (Na) and potassium (K) contents were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Raw <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> presented the highest bioaccessibility values for Mn, K, P (100 %) and the lowest for Ca (19 %). After cooking process the highest values of bioaccessibility were observed for Ca (100 % in boiled and 74 % in steamed) and Cu (90 % in boiled and 78 % in steamed). Mn showed the highest decrease in bioacessibility when comparing raw and cooked samples (100 % and 20 % in raw and cooked samples, respectively). Zn presented bioaccessibility values near 40 % for raw, boiled and steamed samples. The boiling process was the procedure that allowed to obtain the highest mineral bioaccessibility values for all the assayed minerals.

40|$|This chapter brings {{together}} {{knowledge of the}} germination and storage behaviour of <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> in relation to three general aspects: germination response to different factors and in situations of stress; tolerance to pre-harvest sprouting and dormancy control; and the dynamics of ageing and potential longevity of <b>seeds</b> in storage. <b>Quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> demonstrate the capacity to germinate at temperatures around zero degrees and show tolerance to brief exposure to freezing in some cases. In general, accessions from saline and arid zones are more tolerant to water stress and salinity, {{as a result of}} their adaptation. Nonetheless, the distinctiveness of the ionic and osmotic components of salinity has revealed diverse responses and levels of tolerance in accessions of different origins. Pre-harvest sprouting limits the expansion of quinoa cultivation to humid regions. The study of the germination behaviour in accessions with dormancy made it possible to determine the effect of different factors: environmental (temperature and photoperiod), hormonal (ABA and GA 3) and structural (coat thickness), on the level of dormancy of <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> during development, ripening and storage. <b>Quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> have the capacity to tolerate water loss and maintain viability, recovering vital functions when rehydrated. The kinetics of the reactions of deterioration leading to a loss in viability are largely determined by the degree of water mobility in multilayers. The reactions of deterioration include lipid peroxidation and the formation of compounds from the Maillard reaction. There are references to the differences in storage tolerance for different cultivars, although these are inconclusive in terms of the link between longevity and the characteristics of the regions of origin.

40|$|Chenopodium <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> {{have high}} protein content. The {{nutritional}} value of quinoa is superior compared with traditional cereals. Its {{essential amino acid}} composition is considered next to the ideal, and its quality matches that of milk proteins. In this study, the seed storage proteins from Chenopodium quinoa were extracted, fractionated, partially purified, and characterized. The structural characterization was performed by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional electrophoresis, and it confirmed the presence of proteins of molecular weight of 30 and 7 kDa, probably corresponding to lectins and trypsin inhibitors, respectively. The functional characterization of these proteins evidenced their activity as antinutritional factors due to their in vitro digestibility. Quinoa proteins have an excellent amino acid composition with many essential amino acids.

The results confirmed the existence of, at least, two AK isoenzymes, one inhibited by lysine and the other inhibited by threonine, the latter being predominant in <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds.</b> HSDH activity was also shown to be partially inhibited by threonine, whereas some of the activity was resistant to the inhibitory effect, indicating the presence of two isoenzymes, one resistant and another sensitive to threonine inhibition. Only one DHDPS isoenzyme highly sensitive to lysine inhibition was detected. The results suggest that the high concentration of lysine observed in <b>quinoa</b> <b>seeds</b> is possibly due to a combined effect of increased lysine, synthesis and accumulation in the soluble form and/or as protein lysine. Nitrogen assimilation was also investigated and based on nitrate content, nitrate reductase activity, amino acid distribution and ureide content, the leaves were identified as the predominant site of nitrate reduction in this plant species. The amino acid profile analysis in leaves and roots also indicated an important role of soluble glutamine as a nitrogen transporting compound. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

Leaf extract was more efficient in scavenging radicals (IC 50 2. 70 μg/ml) than <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> (IC 50 8. 18 μg/ml). Similarly, leaf extract inhibited S. mutans isolates to higher extent than <b>seed</b> <b>extract.</b> A marked radical scavenging and anticaries activity of leaf and <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> of A. indica was observed in this study. Leaf extract was more efficient in scavenging DPPH radicals and inhibiting the S. mutans isolates. The high phenolic and flavonoid content of leaf extract might be attributed to higher radical scavenging and antibacterial activity...|$|R

40|$|Polyphenol-rich grape <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> (0. 1 w/w%) was {{incorporated}} in liposomes (1 w/w% soy lecithin) by high pressure homogenization (22, 500 psi) and coated with chitosan (0. 1 w/w%). Primary liposomes and chitosan-coated secondary liposomes containing grape <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> showed good physical stability during 98 days of storage. Most of the polyphenols were {{incorporated in the}} shell of the liposomes (85. 4 %), whereas only 7. 6 % of the polyphenols of grape <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> were located {{in the interior of}} the liposomes. Coating with chitosan did not change the polyphenol content in the liposomes (86. 6 %). The uncoated liposomes without grape <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> were highly prone to lipid oxidation. The cationic chitosan coating, however, improved the oxidative stability to some extent, due to its ability to repel pro-oxidant metals. Encapsulated grape <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> showed high antioxidant activity in both primary and secondary liposomes, which may be attributed to its polyphenol content. In conclusion, the best chemical stability of liposomes can be achieved using a combination of grape <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> and chitosan...|$|R

However, independent studies have shown the efficacy of grapefruit <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> as an antimicrobial is not demonstrated. Although citrus <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> is claimed to be a highly effective plant-based preservative by some natural personal care manufacturers, studies asserted that the universal antimicrobial benefits associated with GSE are merely from the presence of synthetic preservatives. Natural GSE has no antimicrobial properties. Newer studies found many commercial grapefruit <b>seed</b> <b>extracts</b> contaminated with synthetic preservatives. In a 2007 study the main synthetic antimicrobial agent identified in commercial GSE samples was benzethonium chloride. In a 2008 study synthetic disinfectants such as benzethonium or benzalkonium chloride were identified in most of the commercial GSE products. In a 2008 study suspected counterfeit products were determined to contain benzethonium chloride in grapefruit <b>seed</b> <b>extract</b> samples.|$|R
