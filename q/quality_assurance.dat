5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, <b>quality</b> <b>assurance</b> (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to <b>quality</b> <b>assurance.</b> During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game during this phase, translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} association between corporate social responsibility (CSR) assurance and firm value. This study contributes {{to the understanding of}} the economic benefits inherent in CSR assurance by investigating the incremental value added to firms by assurance. This study also explores CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>quality</b> in both Australia and New Zealand, two countries that are rarely examined. The research adopts a signalling theory view of CSR assurance, where assurance acts as a signal of disclosure quality. The <b>quality</b> of <b>assurance</b> statements has been examined using a content analysis approach. Content analysis generates quality scores that enable quantitative analysis of the effects of CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>quality</b> on firm value. The results show that CSR assurance is value-relevant, but <b>assurance</b> <b>quality</b> is not. Results remained true even after controlling for CSR performance, country and industry effects. The current study also finds that CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>quality</b> is lower when produced by an accountant, and that better governance mechanisms increase <b>assurance</b> statement <b>quality.</b> In addition to the CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>quality</b> score, scholars associate several other attributes with <b>assurance</b> <b>quality.</b> These attributes include the level of assurance and the type of assurance provider. The level of assurance and the type of assurance provider constitute signals about CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>quality.</b> These attributes are also examined to determine their effect on firm value. The results do not show any significant effect of CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>quality</b> on firm value, either from the overall <b>assurance</b> <b>quality</b> score or from the attributes of quality. This research has implications for companies, standard setters and assurance providers. Companies may benefit from adopting CSR <b>assurance.</b> Since the <b>quality</b> of <b>assurance</b> does not communicate any effective signal, it may be important for companies, standard setters and assurance providers to collaborate to improve assurance standards to achieve higher quality, in order to minimise the possibility of falsified signalling through substandard reporting and poor <b>assurance</b> <b>quality.</b> There are many opportunities for future research on the economic benefits of CSR assurance. Future research should look into conducting a longitudinal study on CSR <b>assurance</b> <b>quality.</b> Future research should also examine the effect of <b>assurance</b> and its <b>quality</b> on firm value at different points of time and with various types of CSR disclosure...|$|R

40|$|There is {{increasing}} pressure from animal rights organizations (AROs) on restaurant chains, food retailers, and meat processors to implement more stringent farm animal welfare (FAW) requirements for their suppliers. In the United States, AROs have recently initiated successful ballots {{to phase out}} confinement practices in several states. In Canada AROs have been pressuring {{both public and private}} sector stakeholders to improve FAW. Are FAW issues, however, paramount in the minds of Canadian consumers? Is the demand for more stringent FAW protocols primarily determined by a subset of consumers with very strong preferences or does it signal a more fundamental underlying change in consumer and societal preferences? Given the credence nature of FAW, who do consumers trust (i. e., government vs. private industry vs. independent third parties) in the market place for the provision of FAW <b>quality</b> <b>assurances?</b> What are the determinants of trust in these organizations for providing accurate information about animal welfare? In order to answer these questions, a stated preference consumer survey encompassing FAW issues specific to the Canadian pork sector was tested on two samples of consumers in summer 2008, namely: a general population sample (GPS) across Canada and a sample of AROs members. Consumers participated in a purchase experiment where they had to chose between pork chops characterized by combinations of different levels of FAW attributes (i. e., housing system, gestation stalls, and use of antibiotics), quality verifying organization, and price. Multinomial Logit and Latent Class Logit Models were used to analyse the survey data. Surprisingly, “outdoor system” does not seem to resonate well with Canadians, as both the GPS {{and the members of the}} AROs discounted this attribute. As expected, the AROs members have much stronger preferences for the other FAW attributes than have consumers in the GPS. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity exists within consumer preferences. Five classes of consumers were identified in the GPS with respect to their preferences for FAW. At one end of the spectrum are the “FAW sensitive” consumers (12. 3 %) that have higher willingness-to-pay (WTP) for FAW, while at the other end of the spectrum “Price Conscious” consumers (18. 3 %) do not exhibit any WTP for FAW. The other three classes (69. 4 %) comprise respondents with mixed perceptions regarding FAW. Government and Third Party verification of FAW <b>quality</b> <b>assurances</b> had the strongest influence on consumers’ preferences in both samples. As well, scientific experts in FAW along with the above two organizations are the most credible in providing information about the welfare of pigs. The extent to which these organizations are knowledgeable about the welfare of pigs is the most important factor enhancing consumers’ trust. Results from this study suggest that there are potential marketing opportunities for pork chops sourced from pigs raised on farms where sows are kept in groups, and where credible <b>quality</b> <b>assurances</b> can be established, that private industry could consider. As well, the results suggest that consumers would derive benefits from the government taking a more active role with respect to validating FAW <b>quality</b> <b>assurances...</b>|$|R
