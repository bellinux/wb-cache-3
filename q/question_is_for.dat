But we will not be indebted even to so tried a friend for a tittle of our happiness. The work shall be all our own, even to the letters of nobility, which I shall command at an early day from Vienna; for it would be cruel to let the noble fellow want so simple an advantage, which will at once raise him to our own level, and make him as good--ay, by the beard of Luther! better than the best man in Berne." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kuhn {{acknowledges}} having {{used the}} term [...] "paradigm" [...] in two different meanings. In the first one, [...] "paradigm" [...] designates what {{the members of a}} certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls [...] "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term [...] "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.|$|E
