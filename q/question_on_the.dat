25|$|The SASO {{consists}} of 12 questions. Six {{of these questions}} assess sexual attraction, four assess sexual behavior, and two assess sexual orientation identity. For each <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> scale that measures homosexuality there is a corresponding question that measures heterosexuality giving six matching pairs of questions. Taken all together, the six pairs of questions and responses provide a profile of an individual's sexual orientation. However, results can be further simplified into four summaries that look specifically at responses that correspond to either homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality or asexuality.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the above}} {{quotation}} is often attributed to Vuk Stefanović Karadžić in Serbia, {{it is in}} fact an orthographic principle devised by the German grammarian and philologist Johann Christoph Adelung. Karadžić merely used that principle to push through his language reform. The attribution of the quote to Karadžić is a common misconception in Serbia, Montenegro and the rest of former Yugoslavia. Due to that fact, the entrance exam to the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology occasionally contains a <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> authorship of the quote (as a sort of trick question).|$|E

Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another question would be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E
25|$|A November 2011 Public Policy Polling {{survey found}} that 44% of Arizona voters {{supported}} the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed it and 12% were not sure. A separate <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same {{survey found that}} 72% of respondents supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 40% supporting same-sex marriage, 32% supporting civil unions, 27% opposing all legal recognition and 1% not sure. Arizona Proposition 102, known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment, appeared as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment on the November 4, 2008 ballot in Arizona, where it was approved: 56.2%–43%. It amended the Arizona Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.|$|E

25|$|On October 7, 2003, {{the recall}} {{election}} resulted in Governor Gray Davis being {{removed from office}} with 55.4% of the Yes {{vote in favor of}} a recall. Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot with 48.6% of the vote to choose a successor to Davis. Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante, fellow Republican Tom McClintock, and others. His nearest rival, Bustamante, received 31% of the vote. In total, Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3million votes. Under the regulations of the California Constitution, no runoff election was required. Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862.|$|E

The reconciliation bill passed on a vote of 220–211, with all 178 Republicans and 33 Democrats voting against it.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Jews in Australia traces the history of Australian Jews from the British {{settlement}} of Australia commencing in 1788. The first Jews came to Australia as convicts transported to Botany Bay in 1788 aboard the First Fleet that established the first European settlement on the continent, {{on the site of}} present-day Sydney. There were 97,335 Australians who identified themselves as Jewish in the 2011 census, but the actual number is estimated to be 112,000. (An answer to the <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> census was optional.) The majority are Ashkenazi Jews, many of them refugees and Holocaust survivors who arrived during and after World War II, and their descendants. Jewish citizens make up about 0.5% of the Australian population.|$|E

25|$|Confronted {{with this}} sharp {{increase}} in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the International Court of Justice in the case entitled ICJ Arrest Warrant Case. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found {{that it did not}} have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials. However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions, such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The quorum for a Parliamentary sitting is {{one quarter}} {{of the total number of}} MPs, not {{including}} the Speaker. An MP begins a debate by moving a motion and delivering an opening speech explaining the reasons for the motion. The Speaker (or chairman, if Parliament is in committee) then puts the motion in the form of a question, following which other MPs may debate the motion. After that, the mover may exercise a right of reply. When the debate is closed, the Speaker puts the <b>question</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> motion to the House and calls for a vote. Voting is generally done verbally, and whether the motion is carried depends on the Speaker's personal assessment of whether more MPs have voted for than against the motion. MPs' votes are only formally counted if an MP claims a division.|$|E
25|$|Judicial {{review is}} {{available}} {{as a means of}} challenging the legality of decisions of all governmental authorities, though it is regarded as a procedure of last resort that should be used only where the individual has no alternative remedy such as a right of appeal. If a right of appeal exists, it is more favourable for a person {{to take advantage of it}} as the appellate court may substitute its decision for that of the original authority and grant a remedy. An appeal may also involve a reconsideration of the merits of the case and not merely its legality, although this depends on the wording of the statute in <b>question.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, when exercising judicial review, the High Court is almost always limited to examining whether public authorities have acted lawfully, and do not evaluate the substantive merits of decisions taken.|$|E
