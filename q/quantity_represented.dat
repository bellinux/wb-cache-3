25|$|Vectors are {{fundamental}} {{in the physical}} sciences. They {{can be used to}} represent any quantity that has magnitude, has direction, and which adheres to the rules of vector addition. An example is velocity, the magnitude of which is speed. For example, the velocity 5 meters per second upward could be represented by the vector (0,5) (in 2 dimensions with the positive y axis as 'up'). Another <b>quantity</b> <b>represented</b> by a vector is force, since it has a magnitude and direction and follows the rules of vector addition. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as linear displacement, displacement, linear acceleration, angular acceleration, linear momentum, and angular momentum. Other physical vectors, such as the electric and magnetic field, are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a vector field. Examples of quantities that have magnitude and direction but fail to follow the rules of vector addition: Angular displacement and electric current. Consequently, these are not vectors.|$|E

[...] The sum of two random variables characterized by well-specified probability distributions is another precise probability distribution typically only when the copula (dependence function) between the two summands is completely specified. When their dependence is unknown or only partially specified, the sum will be more appropriately represented by a p-box because different dependence relations lead to many different distributions for the sum. Kolmogorov originally asked what bounds could be placed about the distribution of a sum when nothing {{is known about the}} dependence between the distributions of the addends. [...] The question was only answered in the early 1980s.

5000|$|In physics, a {{field is}} a {{physical}} <b>quantity,</b> <b>represented</b> by a number or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time. For example, on a weather map, the surface wind velocity is described by assigning a vector to each point on a map.

As another example, an electric field {{can be thought of as}} a [...] "condition in space" [...] emanating from an electric charge and extending throughout the whole of space. When a test electric charge is placed in this electric field, the particle accelerates due to a force. Physicists have found the notion of a field to be of such practical utility for the analysis of forces that they have come to think of a force as due to a field.

40|$|A {{special issue}} on {{applications}} of Signal Detection Theory to visual perception Like most theories that have wide application, signal detection theory {{is based upon}} simple ideas. The stimulus factors that influence perceptual decisions are corrupted by random variations — noise. Observers collect noisy information and distill {{it down to a}} single <b>quantity,</b> <b>represented</b> by the decision variable. The value of that variable after a given observation is compared against a criterion value and the result determines the choice of the observer. Thus, according to signal detection theory, to predict the behavior of the observer one needs to understand both the deterministic and random aspects of the stimulus information, the task characteristics that influence the collection and distillation, and the motivational factors that influence the criterion. These ideas were most famously systematized by Peterson et al. (1954) but in vision had been employed earlier. In particular, Hecht et al.
