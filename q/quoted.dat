40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Psychological SciencesRichard J. HarrisTo date, no {{research}} has been conducted to establish the discourse goals accomplished through social movie <b>quoting.</b> In this thesis four studies were conducted to learn what discourse goals are accomplished through social movie <b>quoting</b> and if Roberts and Kreuz’ (1994) discourse goal taxonomy for figurative language would be a suitable theoretical framework {{for the study of the}} social movie <b>quoting</b> phenomenon. Study 1 examined movie <b>quoting</b> without being tied to any specific movie <b>quotes.</b> Demographic variables were correlated with common movie viewing preferences, behaviors, and attitudinal responses. Study 2 had participants generate a realistic movie <b>quote</b> they would actually use for accomplishing each of several specific discourse goals in conversation. Study 3 had participants generate a plain English interpretation of the movie <b>quotes</b> selected from Study 2. Study 4 participants rated the movie <b>quotes</b> and plain English equivalents generated in studies 2 and 3 for aptness and likelihood for use in conversation with the knowledge (Condition 1) and without the knowledge (Condition 2) of the underlying discourse goal. <b>Quotes</b> were randomized and counterbalanced so that half the participants in each condition received all movie <b>quotes</b> first (Group 1) and half the plain English first (Group 2). Results indicated that movie <b>quotes</b> were used to accomplish a set of discourse goals most similar to the traditional figures of speech of hyperbole, understatement, metaphor, and simile. The most common purposes of social movie <b>quoting</b> were to compare similarities and either downplay or exaggerate these similarities. Knowledge of the underlying discourse goal significantly increased the aptness and likelihood of both <b>quote</b> types for several discourse goals. The order of presentation did not significantly affect participants’ ratings. The aptness of the <b>quote</b> was strongly related to participants’ likelihood of using a particular <b>quote,</b> regardless of <b>quote</b> type. Future research should focus on capturing naturally occurring language to further increase the ecological validity of these results. It appears that the act of <b>quoting</b> movie lines in conversation is heavily dependent on individual preferences and a method should be developed to capture movie <b>quoting</b> in such a way. Suggestions for enhanced selection of movie <b>quotes</b> is discussed...|$|R
