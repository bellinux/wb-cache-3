5000|$|Doctor Dolittle's assistant, Tommy Stubbins, {{reports on}} Professor <b>Quetch,</b> {{curator of the}} Dog Museum in the Home for Crossbred Dogs. Meanwhile, the doctor has learnt insect {{languages}} and hears ancient tales of a giant race of insects. Fascinated, the doctor plans a voyage to find them [...] - [...] but before he does so, one arrives in his garden.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is set on}} {{the fictional}} planet Twinsun, a world which is held in a {{suspended}} orbit between two suns resulting in a polar region around its equator. Four different sentient species populate Twinsun; Quetchs are aesthetically similar to humans except that they all possess ponytails, Spheros are short spherical creatures, Grobos resemble anthropomorphic elephants, and Rabbibunnies are tall, thin humanoid rabbits. As the game begins, it is explained that all peoples of Twinsun have been herded into the Southern hemisphere by a brutal tyrant called Dr FunFrock, who has subjugated the planet by developing an army of clones which travel using teleport machines which he has dispersed around the planet. The player character is a young <b>Quetch</b> named Twinsen, who has been incarcerated in an asylum on the fortress-like Citadel Island because of his prophetic dreams {{about the end of}} the world.|$|E
5000|$|The United Underworld equip {{themselves}} with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a penguin, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and <b>Quetch).</b> It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When Batman and Robin return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. The Catwoman, disguised as Soviet journalist [...] "Miss Kitka", helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, {{as part of a}} plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of the Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Bruce Wayne escapes captivity, the Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: The Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water, used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile.|$|E
