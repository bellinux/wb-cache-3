40|$|Grid {{applications}} typically need to {{deal with}} large amounts of data. The traditional approach for data storage is to employ high-performance dedicated servers with data replication.

In the recent past, the landfill has been progressively renovated in order to align the waste disposal process with the state-of-the-art technology. During the past years, the site had been equipped with seven biogas engines, fuelled with the biogas produced at the oldest part of the landfill. More recently, another two engines of the same type have been installed {{for a total of}} 9 MW electrical power installed at the landfill. The landfill of Bellolampo faces a significant leachate disposal problem. Some 250 m 3 of contaminated leachate are produced daily and transported by ships and trucks to an area about 1000 km away before being treated and disposed. The disposal of this extremely polluting fluid causes significant nuisance in the integrated waste management process and significant disposal expenses (in excess of € 60 per ton of fluid disposed and € 4. 5 mln per year). Furthermore, the recent legislation strongly suggests the landfill manager to activate fully integrated systems and 100 % landfill auto-sustainability. On the other hand, the above mentioned biogas engines produce a great <b>quantity</b> of <b>unused</b> thermal energy yearly. This study demonstrates that this energy could be effectively and efficiently used to enable the sustainable in-house treatment of the leachate.

It is {{emphasized that the}} presence of the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equations for quark distribution functions of the photon implies important difference in the way factorization mechanism works in photon-hadron and photon-photon collisions as compared to the hadronic ones. Moreover, a careful definitions of the very concepts of the "leading order" and "next-to-leading order" QCD {{analysis of}} F_ 2 ^γ are needed in order to separate genuine QCD effects from those of pure QED origin. After presenting such definitions, I show that all existing allegedly LO, as well as NLO analyses of F_ 2 ^γ(x,Q^ 2) are incomplete. The source of this incompleteness of the conventional approach is traced back to the lack of clear identification of QCD effects and to the misinterpretation of the behaviour of q^γ(x,M) as a function of α_s(M). Complete LO and NLO QCD analyses of F_ 2 ^γ(x,Q^ 2) are shown to differ substantially from the conventional ones.

5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{perpetual}} inventory, backflushing is automatic accounting of material consumed for production, {{at the time of}} confirmation of the production, e.g. when a 4-wheeler automobile is rolled out from assembly line, 4 wheels and tires are deemed to be consumed and issued to production order automatically by way of back flushing by the system. Typically the assembly line has its own limited stock of materials as work in process. This stock is replenished by transferring materials from a warehouse (store) into the assembly lines own designated location, e.g. a supermarket. At goods receipt the consumed materials are posted automatically from the location designated to the issuing production line. In other words, back flushing refers only to materials which are already withdrawn from the inventory of the warehouse (store) and were delivered to the shop floor. Parts are issued from stores to Work-In-Process inventory, but not based on a job order or for a specific production order. They are issued in quantities estimated to cover requirements of individual work centers and production lines. The issuing may be used to cover a period of time or to fill a fixed—size container. But unlike the traditional approach, also known as [...] "preproduction issuing" [...] where the costs are assigned to the product order at the withdrawal of materials from the stores and after completion of production any excess material is given back to the stores, backflushing delays that until the goods receipt of the finished product or assembly is issued. The remaining <b>quantity</b> of <b>unused</b> material left on the shops is still held in the system as floor stock and so material will not be ordered incorrectly through the Manufacturing resource planning (MRP). By eliminating work-in-process accounts, backflush costing simplifies the accounting process. However, this simplification and other deviations from traditional costing systems mean that backflush costing may not always conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Another drawback of this system is the lack of a sequential audit trail. The main advantage of postproduction issuing, not necessarily of backflushing, {{is that there is no}} need to update the store balances of inventory at the withdrawal of the materials from stores and recording the excess material through reverse posting (storno). This is especially useful in series or mass production where it is no need to give back excess material to the stores because it is used for the next production order. Even if excess material is given back to stores it does not involve any update to the inventory balance in the financial accounting (stock accounts). It involves only a stock transfer in the inventory management or warehouse management. Only the materials reported as consumed through the method of backflushing or by the MES imply an update to the inventory balance: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{traces the}} {{development}} of the abstraction licensing system in England and Wales from the perspective of changes to water rights. It assesses the relative effectiveness of recent changes to supporting legislation in achieving a sustainable water resource balance. Particular emphasis is placed on actions to address problems caused where licensed abstraction results in environmental damage to designated sites. Water law in England and Wales, as elsewhere, is changing, in response to increasing societal, economic and environmental pressures on the finite water resource, including those recently identified relating to climate change. The Water Act 2003 is the most recent legislation aimed at ensuring sustainable use of water resources. The 1963 Water Act was the first to require that the right to abstraction of surface or groundwater (with some exemptions) was subject to a licence. ‘Permanent’ licences conferring legal rights to take water were issued to riparian occupiers (whose right to water had hitherto been considered part of their right to land), on a ‘first come, first served’ basis, without formal guidelines for justification of required quantities. This reflected the perception of water as a free and plentiful resource, and followed the long established ‘riparian rights’ principle. [1] These riparian rights, and corresponding obligations, which had been shaped by case law, are described by Hodgson [2] as “an integral part of the right of ownership of the land in question”, and as such, the loss of that right would justify some form of compensation. Successive rounds of legislation since 1963, notably the Water Resources Acts (1989, 1991), Environment Act 1995 and most recently the 2003 Act, have increased regulatory control over abstraction (and discharges) to protect the environment as well as the rights of existing abstractors. This has been broadly in response to greater awareness of environmental impacts, the obligation to comply with European Directives, and increasing demands on water resources from a greater and more affluent population. However, none of these laws has challenged the ‘licence of right’ concept, despite the considerable (and partly <b>unused)</b> <b>quantities</b> of water ‘tied up’ in them which could arguably in some cases be more appropriately assigned for other purposes. Caponera [3] suggests that modern water legislation needs to: “replace existing…. common law principles with written rules which will facilitate the most rational use of available water through appropriate administrative action”. Hodgson [4] uses the term ‘modern water rights’ for this introduction of formal and explicit water rights, and states that this approach is of benefit to all: (a) society by permitting “the orderly allocation and sustainable use of valuable water resources”; (b) the user, by providing ”the necessary security to invest in activities entailing the use of water” and (c) the regulator because the system is “legally backed”.

40|$|Objectives: Major {{objective}} is {{the evaluation of}} the medical effectiveness of different therapeutical approaches and the cost effectiveness with relevance for Germany. Methods: This health technology assessment (HTA) evaluates systemically randomized controlled studies (RCT) on the therapy of atopic dermatitis which were published between 1999 and 2004. Further it includes some important clinical studies which have been published after 2004 and other updates the English HTA report by Hoare et al. [1]. Results: Topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin-inhibitors are the principal substances which are currently used for anti-inflammatory therapy in atopic dermatitis. These substances have shown a significant therapeutic efficacy in controlled studies. In newer controlled studies no difference was observable when corticosteroids were applied once or more than once daily onto the skin. Moreover, there is now one controlled study available which points to the fact that an interval therapy with a stronger topical corticosteroid over a limited time (some weeks) may lower the risk of recurrent flares of atopic dermatitis. Both topical calcineurin-inhibitors pimecrolimus and tacrolimus have shown a significant therapeutical efficacy in a number of placebo-controlled prospective studies. The wealth of data is high for these substances. Both substances {{have been shown to be}} efficient in infants, children and adult patients with atopic dermatitis. The importance of a so-called basic therapy with emollients which have to be adapted to the current status of skin is generally accepted in clinical practice. Controlled studies show the efficacy of ”basic therapy” - although the level of evidence is quite low for this approach. The skin of patients with atopic dermatitis is colonized in the majority with Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium. Therefore, a therapeutical approach for the treatment of atopic dermatitis is the anti-bacterial or anti-septic treatment of the skin. Due to the lack of randomized controlled studies there is still not certain proof that antimicrobial or anti-septic treatment of non-infected eczematous skin is efficient for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. A reduction of Staphylococcus aureus is observable during an anti-inflammatory treatment of the skin with topical corticosteroids and/or the topical calcineurin-inhibitor tacrolimus. Antihistaminic drugs which are orally applied in atopic dermatitis may support the therapy of the itching skin disease. One controlled study showed a rapid reduction of itch during the use of a non-sedating antihistaminic drug. There are, however, no controlled studies which show the efficacy of antihistaminic drugs on the skin condition in atopic dermatitis. Dietetic restrictions should be applied only after a specific allergological diagnostic clarification. The “gold standard” is still a (blinded) oral provocation test which has to show an influence of a given food on the skin condition. There is sufficient evidence that there is no general dietetic approach which shows efficacy in atopic dermatitis. The treatment of patients with lactobacillae is still controversially discussed. Available studies which showed an efficacy show methodological weaknesses so that this approach can not be generally recommended for clinical practice at the time now. Approaches reducing house dust mite in the surroundings of patients with atopic dermatitis can have an effect on the skin condition so that at least in mite sensitized patients this approach appears to be reasonable. The specific immunotherapy with house dust mite showed clinical efficacy in a controlled study and in some open studies. The education of patients with atopic dermatitis or their parents is a further efficient approach in the management of this chronic skin disease. Interdisciplinary approaches in patients’ education containing also psychological elements appear to be an attractive new approach for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Phototherapy is a further possibility of intervention in atopic dermatitis in adolescent or adult patients. The available evidence points to the fact that UVB radiation (both small and broad spectrum), UVA- 1 radiation and balneo-phototherapy are efficient therapeutical options for atopic dermatitis. The systemic treatment with the immunosuppressive substance cyclosporine A is efficient in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis. Cyclosoprine A is approved for the treatment of adult patients with this skin disease. The immunosuppressive substance azathioprine showed a high clinical efficacy in two controlled studies for severe atopic dermatitis in adults. There are still controversial results for the application of antagonists to leucotriens in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: in some open studies a therapeutical efficacy was described which was, however, not reproducible in a newer controlled study. The phosphodiesterase- 4 -inhibitor cipamphyllin was efficient in the treatment of atopic dermatitis in a controlled study but weaker than a topical class II (i. e. moderate strength) corticosteroide. The HTA assessment further describes so-called complementary therapeutical approaches which have either not properly been studied in controlled clinical trials or which have been shown to be of no value for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Altogether six full health-economic evaluations were found which did not cover the whole therapy spectrum of atopic dermatitis. The choice of the most cost effective treatment option of topic corticosteroids depends less on application frequency, but rather on the drug price and more used or <b>unused</b> <b>quantity</b> of the standard packages, so even smallest improvements justify a more frequent application. The results from health economic evaluations of calcineurin-inhibitors are not reliable. The therapy of severe atopic dermatitis in adults with ciclosporin shows comparable cost effectiveness in comparison to UVA/UVB therapy. Discussion: The spectrum of therapeutical procedures has increased for atopic dermatitis but is still not sufficient. The spectrum of established substances is much smaller compared to psoriasis, another chronic and common inflammatory skin disease. There is need for the development new substances which can be applied topically and which are aimed to treat atopic dermatitis in early childhood. Another need for new developments can be found for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in adults. Conclusions: The spectrum of therapeutical procedures has increased for atopic dermatitis but is still not sufficient. The spectrum of established substances is much smaller compared to psoriasis, another chronic and common inflammatory skin disease. There is need for the development new substances which can be applied topically and which are aimed to treat atopic dermatitis in early childhood. Another need for new developments can be found for the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis in adults. Due to lack of health economic evaluations therapy decisions in the treatment of atopic dermatitis must take place on the basis of clinical decision criteria. The prescription of topic corticosteroids should prefer low priced drugs. Reliable statements about the cost effectiveness of the new calcineurin-inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus...|$|R
