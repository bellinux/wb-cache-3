50|$|The LLM01 (Laser Light Module 01) is an {{adaptive}} target acquisition module made by Rheinmetall Soldier Electronics GmbH in Stockach, Germany. It {{is designed to}} be mounted with a metal integral <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>clamping</b> adapter {{on the left side of}} the carry handle adapter of Heckler & Koch G36 assault rifles. It can also be attached to other firearms, such as the Heckler & Koch MP7 submachine gun and L85A2 assault rifle.|$|R
5000|$|To fold, the seat-post is {{released}} from the {{two parts of the}} seat-tube by their respective <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>clamps,</b> then pulled up into {{the upper part of the}} seat-tube to unlock the frame. A pivot in the main frame tube then allows the rear triangle (comprising the seat-stays, chain-stays and the lower portion of the seat-tube) and rear wheel to swing down and forward under the main tube. The seat-post is then slid back down through the upper part of the seat-tube to lock the rear wheel in the folded position.|$|R
50|$|Tatrapan is an {{armoured}} {{off-road vehicle}} {{built on the}} military version of the Tatra 815 chassis. The vehicle has a cab for a driver and a commander of the vehicle and a superstructure body which can be modified and equipped for various applications. The superstructure body is designed as an autonomous unit and its crew can work independently also as a permanent autonomous station. <b>Quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>clamps</b> with centering pins provide a means for fastening the body, thus enabling application of various bodies on a single chassis. Maximum time required to replace a body is 60 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the Brompton or Birdy, this fold is not {{particularly}} compact; in fact, it is larger than many 20 and 16 in wheel folding bicycles (such as those from Dahon). However, the tikit's claim to fame is {{the speed of the}} fold in its [...] "Hyperfold" [...] model. Here, the action of rotating the rear of the bike slackens an internal cable which enables the handlebar stem to be folded. As a result, no <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>clamps,</b> latches, or locks are involved in the fold. This feature, unique among folding bicycles, enables the tikit to fold easily in under five seconds.|$|R
50|$|Gyratory {{equipment}} is divided to a {{top and a}} bottom unit. The unit on top consists of screening frames supported with rugged springs attached to the circular base, which allows free vibration of the top unit. Secondary support springs are attached to for heavy duty operation, preventing the vibration of the top unit from reaching the floor. The base of the machine (bottom unit) consists of top and bottom eccentric weights attached to a heavy duty motor. Minimum energy is consumed with the installation of double extended shafts on the motors, which are attached to both {{the top and bottom}} eccentric weights. Screen decks can be mounted on top of another within the machine assembly with spacing frames connected together via stainless steel <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>clamps.</b>|$|R
40|$|The force-velocity {{relation}} during oscillatory {{work was}} {{compared with that}} measured in the traditional way with <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> and force <b>clamps</b> using toad sartorius, frog sartorius, and mouse soleus muscles. Plotting the force and corresponding velocity data in this way produces a 'power-loop'. The 'power-loop' has less intuitive value than the frequently reported 'work-loops' but it is useful because it permits comparison with the force-velocity curve produced using traditional methods. The force/velocity combinations for oscillatory work during a contraction often exceed those that would be predicted from the force-velocity curve. Although it {{has been known for}} many years that more force is developed by stimulated muscle when it is being stretched than can be developed during an isometric contraction, my results show that the increase in force is of importance at stretch velocities that probably occur in viva during locomotion.

50|$|A side-effect is {{that the}} <b>quick</b> <b>release,</b> which was {{developed}} to allow the wheel to be removed without having to unscrew any components, no longer works as designed: the skewer must be unscrewed in order to remove the wheel (although tools do remain unnecessary). This means that the tension on refitting must be adjusted again. Some cyclists file off the lawyer tabs so the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> works as originally intended.|$|R
