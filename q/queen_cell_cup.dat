40|$|In honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) {{the queen}} monopolises reproduction. However, {{especially}} after queen loss, workers can lay eggs, but {{are unable to}} mate. They produce haploid male offspring (drones) from unfertilised eggs via arrhenotokous parthenogenesis. In contrast, workers of the honeybee subspecies Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz typically produce diploid female offspring from unfertilised eggs thelytokously. After queen loss and without queen-derived brood A. m. capensis colonies can successfully requeen from worker-derived brood. This, however, is a relatively rare event in wild populations. Moreover, workerderived queens were described to be smaller, more worker-like and reproductively inferior. On the other hand, the fixation of the thelytokous trait relies mainly on sufficient numbers of viable drones produced by worker-derived queens. Small numbers of reproductively inferior worker-derived queens in A. m. capensis populations would be clearly counterintuitive. It is therefore necessary to quantify the significance of worker-dependant queen rearing pathways on the individual (queen) and on population level. Reproductive inferiority of worker-derived queens could not be confirmed on the individual (queen) level when comparing parameters indicating potential reproductive success of queen- and worker-derived queens. Queen- and worker-derived queens clearly showed a congruent range of reproductive performance. In queen rearing preference tests, increased acceptance of worker-derived female larvae was exactly counterbalanced by increased mortality, resulting in {{an equal number of}} eclosing virgin queens from an equal number of grafts in both test groups. Larval survival and successful eclosion is a prerequisite for a queen’s reproductive success. I found no difference in eclosion success for queen- and worker-derived virgin queens, indicating a similar potential for reproductive success in both queen types. Assessments of the developmental patterns of colonies headed by both queen and worker-derived queens in long-term experiments revealed no significant differences in reproductive success. Colonies headed by queen-derived queens and colonies headed by worker-derived queens could not be separated when comparing the different developmental pathways observed or from differences in worker-force. Reproductive dominance in A. m. capensis appeared tobe determined by a function of relative compositional and absolute quantitative pheromonal patterns, where individuals, which produce compositionally most queen-like blends in highest quantities, occupy top positions. Queen- and worker-derived virgin queens occupied intermediate positions between pseudoqueens and mated queens. However, {{no significant differences between the}} pheromonal status of queen- and worker-derived virgin queens were observed, suggesting a similar range of reproductive dominance for both queen types. In behavioural bioassays queen- and worker-derived virgin queens appeared to be similarly attractive to clustering workers and to drones in a drone congregation area, indicating no differences in potential reproductive success for queens from both origins for those parameters. The significant influence of the queen substance 9 -ODA on attractiveness to workers and drones was confirmed. Rare requeening events from worker-derived female brood in queenless A. m. capensis do not satisfactorily explain the fixation of the thelytokous trait at a population level. I observed A. m. capensis worker ovipositing into empty artificial <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cups</b> in queen-right colonies. The queen was confined behind a queen excluder grid in a separate compartment of the colony, to imitate reduced pheromonal flow, similar to swarming or superseding colonies. Eggs oviposited by workers in artificial <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cups</b> were readily accepted for queen rearing and successful eclosion of viable virgin queens was observed. Consequently I suggested an alternative worker-dependant reproductive pathway in A. m. capensis, which was never described before: In swarming or superseding queenright colonies, laying workers may directly compete with the queen for reproductive success by ovipositing (instead of the queen) into natural <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> <b>cups.</b> At a population level this reproductive tactic may result in large numbers of worker-derived queens of high reproductive quality in natural populations of A. m. capensis. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the rearing of drone larvae grafted in <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> From the 1200 drone larvae that were grafted during spring and autumn, 875 were accepted (72. 9 %) and reared as queens. Drone larvae in false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> received royal jelly {{of the same}} composition and of the same amounts as queen larvae. Workers capped the <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> {{as if they were}} drones, 9 - 10 days after the egg laying. Out of 60 accepted false <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> 21 (35 %) were capped. The shape of false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> with drone larvae is unusually long with a characteristically elongate tip which is probably due to the falling of larvae. Bees start the destruction of the cells when the larvae were 3 days old and maximised it before and after capping. Protecting false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> in the colony by wrapping, reversing them upside down, or placing in a horizontal position, did not help. The only adult drones that emerged from the false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> were those protected in an incubator and in push-in cages. Adult drones from false <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> had smaller wings, legs, and proboscis than regular drones. The results of this study verify previous reports that the bees do not recognise the different sex of the larvae at least at the early stage of larval development. The late destruction of false <b>queen</b> <b>cells,</b> the similarity in quality and quantity of the produced royal jelly, and the bigger drone cells, allow for the use of drone larvae in cups for the production of royal jelly...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{harvested}} {{by humans}} by stimulating colonies with movable frame hives to produce queen bees. Royal jelly is collected from each individual <b>queen</b> <b>cell</b> (honeycomb) when the queen larvae are about four days old. It is collected from <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> {{because these are}} the only cells in which large amounts are deposited; when royal jelly is fed to worker larvae, it is fed directly to them, and they consume it as it is produced, while the <b>cells</b> of <b>queen</b> larvae are [...] "stocked" [...] with royal jelly much faster than the larvae can consume it. Therefore, only in <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> is the harvest of royal jelly practical. A well-managed hive during a season of 5-6 months can produce approximately 500 g of royal jelly. Since the product is perishable, producers must have immediate access to proper cold storage (e.g., a household refrigerator or freezer) in which the royal jelly is stored until it is sold or conveyed to a collection center. Sometimes honey or beeswax {{is added to the}} royal jelly, which is thought to aid its preservation.|$|R

In general, the old queen starts laying eggs into queen cups when conditions are right for swarming or supersedure.

40|$|Nepotism is an {{important}} potential conflict in animal societies. However, clear evidence of nepotism in the rearing of queens in social insects is limited and controversial. In the honey bee, Apis mellifera, multiple mating by queens leads {{to the presence of}} many patrilines within each colony. When the colonies reproduce through swarming, workers rear a number of new queens, only a few of which will ultimately head a colony. Workers can potentially increase their inclusive fitness by nepotistically favoring full-sister over half-sister queens during the queen rearing and elimination process. Most studies have focused on interactions between workers and immature queens (eggs and larvae) or adult queens who have exited their <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> However, adult <b>queens</b> often remain in their <b>queen</b> <b>cells</b> for up to 1 week after emerging from their pupa. In this situation, workers prevent the queens from emerging, feed them, and protect them from other emerged queens. This stage in queen rearing is therefore one in which nepotism could occur. The current study is the first to investigate the kinship between workers and adult queens who have not emerged from their <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> We observed the full suite of behaviors expected during this phase of colony reproduction. Although there was no evidence for nepotism in the worker [...] queen interactions, there was a nonrandom distribution across patrilines of the workers interacting with the <b>queen</b> <b>cells.</b> In addition, in one colony we found differential treatment of fostered (nonkin) -queen cells.
