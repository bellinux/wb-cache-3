50|$|Phase 1: Air feeding: Air supply {{from the}} air {{compressor}} passes through a 3/2 way solenoid valve feed, the <b>Quick</b> <b>Release</b> <b>Valve</b> (QRV), and reach the triggering mechanism with its piston disc in closed position. The air reservoir is then pressurized in less than 15 seconds, depending on the air pressure and air volume used.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, {{pressure}} jumps {{were limited}} to one direction. Most commonly fast drops in pressure were achieved by using a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> or a fast burst membrane. [...] Modern equipment can achieve pressure changes in both directions using either double reservoir arrangements (good for large changes in pressure) or pistons operated by piezoelectric actuators (often faster than valve based approaches). Ultra fast pressure drops can be achieved using electrically disintegrated burst membranes. [...] The ability to automatically repeat measurements and average the results is useful since the reaction amplitudes are often small.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} an efficient, economical, {{effective}} and quiet device for moving coal and other difficult bulk solids was recognized. Thus came {{the advent of the}} low pressure pneumatic blasting system - a very efficient means of using a small amount of plant air (up to 125 PSI) to eliminate the most troublesome material hang-ups in storage containers. This simple device has one moving part and uses approximately 3 % of the air consumed by a pneumatic vibrator on the same job. The principle of operation is very simple: air stored in the unit's reservoir is expelled directly into the material via a patented <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> The number, size, and placement of the blaster units on the storage vessel is determined by a series of tests to ascertain flowability of the problem material. These tests in conjunction with the hopper or silo configuration determine specification of a low pressure pneumatic blasting system. This concept has often proven effective in solving flow problems when all other means have failed...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{means of}} utilising dry ice in spud guns {{is to use}} the {{sublimation}} of dry ice to create substantial pressure behind a valve, and placing a barrel {{on the other side of}} that valve with a projectile loaded into it. Pressures behind the valve can reach upwards of , and by quickly <b>releasing</b> the <b>valve,</b> the projectile can be launched. Whilst this method is more controllable and in many means safer than utilising a soda bottle as a burst disk (provided pressure rated valves and piping are used), it is limited in that <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>valves,</b> such as ball valves, are generally not bigger in diameter than 1 or 2 inches. Additionally, they cannot be opened as rapidly as a soda bottle will rupture, and consequently there is less immediate airflow. However, this is offset by the fact that such a design can operate at more than double the pressure of a typical dry ice bomb launcher, as soda bottles will rupture at only [...]|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Bicycle {{configuration}} is not {{as large}} as those of motorcycles or automobiles, while it indeed composes a complicated dynamic system. People’s requirements on comfortability, controllability and safety grow higher as {{the research and development}} technologies improve. The shock absorber affects the vehicle suspension performances enormously. The absorber takes the vibration energy and releases it at a suitable time, keeping the wheel under a proper contact condition with road surface, maintaining the vehicle chassis stability. Suspension design for mountain bicycles is more difficult than that of city bikes since it encounters dynamic variations on road and loading conditions. Riders need a stiff damper as they exert to tread on the pedals when climbing, while a soft damper when they descend downhill. Various switchable shock absorbers are proposed in markets, however riders have to manually switch them among soft, hard and lock positions. This study proposes a novel design of the bicycle shock absorber, which provides automatic smooth tuning of the damping coefficient, from a predetermined lower bound to theoretically unlimited. An automatic <b>quick</b> <b>releasing</b> <b>valve</b> is involved in this design so that it can release the peak pressure when the suspension fork runs into a square-wave type obstacle and prevent the chassis from damage, avoiding the rider skeleton from injury. This design achieves the automatic tuning process by innovative plunger valve and fluidic passage arrangements without any electronic devices. Theoretical modelling of the damper and spring are established in this study. Design parameters of the valves and fluidic passages are determined. Relations between design parameters and shock absorber performances are discussed in this paper. The analytical results give directions to the shock absorber manufacture...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} seismic {{response}} and optimum {{design of a}} base isolation system for earthquake protection of structures. The system incorporates spherical supports for the base, a specially designed spring-cam system to keep the base rigidly supported under normal conditions and {{to allow it to}} move {{for the duration of the}} earthquake under the constraint of a spring with optimized stiffness characteristics. A single degree of freedom structure was considered to investigate the feasibility of the concept. The simulation of the system response shows a 20 times reduction of the transmitted force as a result of using the proposed design in the considered case. This paper extends the previous study to the case a 3 story concrete structure subjected to the Taft as well as El Centro earthquakes. A 11. 5 and 17 times reduction of the maximum transmitted force was achieved for the considered disturbances respectively without any adverse effects due to the tilting moment which is inherent in this type of base isolation. Since the system performance is highly dependent on the rapid unlocking of the cams in the event of a seismic disturbance, careful consideration should be given to the design of a reliable cam release control. This can be achieved by spring loading each cam such that it would be normally unlocked. A hydraulic actuator would be used to force it rotate to the locking position under fluid pressure which would be constantly maintained at the design level during normal conditions. The actuator would be equipped with a <b>quick</b> response <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> for rapidly <b>releasing</b> the pressure and consequently unlocking the cam as soon as an earthquake is detected...|$|R
40|$|Handling and dosing {{of cells}} {{comprise}} {{the most critical}} step in the microfabrication of cell-based assay systems for screening and toxicity testing. Therefore, the immediate drop-on-demand technology (I-DOT) was developed to provide a flexible noncontact liquid handling system enabling dispensing of cells and liquid without the risk of cross-contamination down to a precise volume in the nanoliter range. Liquid is dispensed from a source plate within nozzles at the bottom by a short compressed air pulse that is given through a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> into the well, thus exceeding the capillary pressure in the nozzle. Droplets of a defined volume can be spotted directly onto microplates or other cell culture devices. We present {{a study on the}} performance and biological impact of this technology by applying the cell line MCF- 7, human fibroblasts, and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). For all cell types tested, viability after dispensing is comparable to the control and exhibits similar proliferation rates in the absence of apoptotic cells, and the differentiation potential of hMSCs is not impaired. The immediate drop-on-demand technology enables accurate cell dosage and offers promising potential for single-cell applications...|$|E
40|$|Probabilistic {{calculations}} done {{to verify}} the integrity of a Safety Instrumented System design require failure rate and failure mode data of all equipment including the mechanical devices. For many devices, such data is only available in industry databases where only failure rates are presented. The failure mode information is rare, if available at all. Many give up and just say 50 % safe and 50 % dangerous thinking this is conservative. In some cases {{this is not a}} conservative assumption. In other cases it can be an over-kill. Techniques originally developed in the electronic industry can be applied to mechanical devices to obtain more accurate estimates of both failure rates and failure modes. The failure modes in particular are important for safety verification calculations. A detailed Failure Modes Effects and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA) will provide relatively accurate failure mode and diagnostic coverage estimates. When this information is combined with field failure reports, a reasonable estimate can be made of both failure rates and failure modes. While these techniques are not mature, they can be used now to obtain data that is superior to that available from other sources. As the techniques are used more frequently, the mechanical component failure rate and failure mode data will become even more accurate. Eventually failure metrics estimates will consider many individual stress factors and can be tailored to specific applications. The mechanical FMEDA techniques are described with examples including a pneumatic actuator and a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{handling}} and dosing of cells {{is the most}} critical step in the microfabrication of cell-based assay systems for screening and toxicity testing applications. The use of robotic workstations for liquid handling has increased enormously over the last decades, {{in order to meet}} the requirements for high accuracy and high throughput of current bioanalytics. However, dispensing small volumes of cell suspensions up to the single cell level is still a great challenge. The Fraunhofer IPA developed the immediate drop on demand technology (I-DOT) to overcome the challenge of dispensing cells in a small volume precisely and with low shear stress. It is a fast and flexible non-contact liquid handling system enabling dispensing liquids without the risk of cross-contamination down to a precise volume in the nanoliter range. Liquid is dispensed from a special source plate with a nozzle at the bottom. The small diameter keeps the liquid due to capillary forces inside the well and prevents leaking under normal pressure. To release a defined amount of liquid a short compressed air pulse is given through a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> into the well, exceeding the capillary pressure in the nozzle. Droplets with a defined volume can be spotted directly onto plates or other cell culture devices. We present a study on the performance and biological impact of this technology by applying viable mammalian cells. The cell line MCF- 7, primary skin cells and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were tested for viability, adherence capability, apoptosis induction and proliferative capacity after printing with the I-DOT. Since stem cells are more sensitive to stress compared to cell lines and primary cells, hMSCs were analyzed for their adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity after printing. For all cell types tested, viability after dispensing was comparable to the control, all cells had a viability > 80 %. I-DOT application did not affect hMSCs in undergoing adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. I-DOT is an automated dispensing platform which can be easily integrated into automated work stations. It enables the user to apply accurate cells without detrimental fluorochrome tagging and shows promising potential for single cell and non-invasive stem cell application, 3 D-bioprinting and biomarker screening...|$|E

50|$|It {{released}} the first publicly available dive watch with helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> named the Conquistador. In certain diving situations, helium can penetrate the watch seals and cause a pressure buildup in the watch, eventually blowing the crystal off the watch face. Rolex invented and introduced the first dive watches with a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve</b> in 1969, which prevented this helium buildup. While {{this was a}} major advance at the time, few actual watches with this feature were produced. Doxa introduced the Sub300t Conquistador in 1969 featuring a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve.</b> According to the sales brochures and advertisements in Skin diver magazine, DOXA was the first watch company to introduce this device {{to the public for}} general sale. Rolex was manufacturing watches with the Helium <b>Release</b> <b>Valve</b> at the same time, but was only selling them to Commercial Diving Companies such as COMEX. Rolex offered the Sea Dweller with Helium Escape Valve to the public in 1972. Omega also eventually introduced a helium <b>release</b> <b>valve,</b> in its Seamaster watch.|$|R
