25|$|Circularly {{polarized}} light {{can be converted}} into linearly {{polarized light}} by passing it through a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate.</b> Passing linearly polarized light through a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> with its axes at 45° to its polarization axis will convert it to circular polarization. In fact, {{this is the most}} common way of producing circular polarization in practice. Note that passing linearly polarized light through a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> at an angle other than 45° will generally produce elliptical polarization.|$|E
25|$|A {{waveplate}} or retarder is {{an optical}} device that alters the polarization state {{of a light}} wave travelling through it. Two common types of waveplates are the half-wave plate, which shifts the polarization direction of linearly polarized light, and the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate,</b> which converts linearly polarized light into circularly polarized light and vice versa. A <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> {{can be used to}} produce elliptical polarization as well.|$|E
25|$|Generally speaking, and {{not making}} direct {{reference}} to the above illustration, when {{either of the two}} polarizations of circularly polarized light enters the first <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate,</b> one of a pair of orthogonal components is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength relative to the other. This creates one of two linear polarizations depending on the handedness the circularly polarized light. The linear polarizer sandwiched between the quarter wave plates is oriented so that it will pass one linear polarization and block the other. The second <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> then takes the linearly polarized light that passes and retards the orthogonal component that was not retarded by the previous <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate.</b> This brings the two components back into their initial phase relationship, reestablishing the selected circular polarization.|$|E
40|$|Restricted Access. We {{show that}} a device {{consisting}} of an optical rotator placed between two identically oriented <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> always acts as a halfwave retarder for some pair of orthogonal elliptically polarized states that can be selected by linear adjustment of the optical rotation and orientation of the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two identities {{involving}} <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> and half-wave {{plates are}} established. These {{are used to}} improve on an earlier gadget involving four wave plates leading to a new gadget involving just three plates, a half-wave <b>plate</b> and two <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates,</b> which can realize all SU(2) polarization transformations. This gadget is shown to involve the minimum number of <b>quarter-wave</b> and half-wave <b>plates.</b> The analysis leads to a decomposition theorem for SU (2) matrices in terms of factors which are symmetric fourth and eighth roots of the identity...|$|R
40|$|The {{isoclinic}} parameter can {{be determined}} from points of intersection of two systems of characteristic lines called secondary isochromatics. These lines, along which the light intensity is a minimum, {{can be observed in}} monochromatic light in an originally linear polariscope with two crossed <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> in which the polarizer and analyser have been rotated through small angles in opposite directions. The theory of the polariscope, based on Jones’s metric equations, is given and the influence of imperfect <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> is discussed. The effect of light of incorrect wave-length on the resulting error is con-sidered. A disc loaded by two opposite compression forces is used for demonstration of the methods...|$|R
25|$|The {{transmission}} axis of {{the linear}} polarizer needs to be half way (45°) between the fast and slow axes of the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{trying to}} {{appreciate}} how the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> transforms the linearly polarized light, {{it is important}} to realize that the two components discussed are not entities in and of themselves but are merely mental constructs one uses to help appreciate what is happening. In the case of linearly and circularly polarized light, at each point in space, there is always a single electric field with a distinct vector direction, the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> merely has the effect of transforming this single electric field.|$|E
25|$|First {{note that}} a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> always {{transforms}} circularly polarized light into linearly polarized light. It is only the resulting angle of polarization of the linearly polarized light that {{is determined by the}} orientation of the fast and slow axes of the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> and the handedness of the circularly polarized light. In the illustration, the left-handed circularly polarized light entering the polarizer is transformed into linearly polarized light which has its direction of polarization along the transmission axis of the linear polarizer and it therefore passes. In contrast right-handed circularly polarized light would have been transformed into linearly polarized light that had its direction of polarization along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer, which is at right angles to the transmission axis, and it would have therefore been blocked.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} quantum eraser {{experiment}} which actually uses a Young double-slit to create interference. The experiment {{can be considered}} an optical analogy of an experiment proposed by Scully, Englert and Walther. One photon of an entangled pair is incident on a Young double-slit of appropriate dimensions to create an interference pattern in a distant detection region. <b>Quarter-wave</b> <b>plates,</b> oriented so that their fast axes are orthogonal, are {{placed in front of}} each slit to serve as which-path markers. The <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> mark the polarization of the interfering photon and thus destroy the interference pattern. To recover interference, we measure the polarization of the other entangled photon. In addition, we perform the experiment under delayed erasure circumstances.

25|$|To create right-handed, {{clockwise}} {{circularly polarized}} light one simply rotates {{the axis of}} the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> 90° relative to the linear polarizer. This reverses the fast and slow axes of the wave plate relative to the transmission axis of the linear polarizer reversing which component leads and which component lags.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} ways to create circularly {{polarized}} light, the cheapest and most common involves placing a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> after a linear polarizer and directing unpolarized light through the linear polarizer. The linearly polarized light leaving the linear polarizer is transformed into circularly polarized light by the quarter wave plate.|$|E
25|$|When one {{attempts}} to pass unpolarized {{light through the}} linear polarizer, only light that has its electric field at the positive 45° angle leaves the linear polarizer and enters the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate.</b> In the illustration, the three wavelengths of unpolarized light represented would be transformed into the three wavelengths of linearly polarized light {{on the other side}} of the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|The sensitive-tint (full-wave) and <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> {{are widely}} used {{in the field of}} optical mineralogy. Addition of plates between the polarizers of a {{petrographic}} microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks, in particular by allowing deduction of the shape and orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections.|$|R
25|$|At {{least two}} {{species have been}} {{reported}} to be able to detect circularly polarised light. Some of their biological <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> perform more uniformly over the visual spectrum than any current man-made polarizing optics, and it has been speculated that this could inspire a new type of optical media that would outperform the current generation of Blu-ray disc technology.|$|R
40|$|By placing an {{intracavity}} Fabry-Perot transmission etalon between <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> it {{is possible}} to operate it at normal incidence without spurious oscillation due to reflections from the etalon. The insertion loss and reduced finesse associated with a tilted etalon are thereby avoided. This technique will allow the use of longer etalons thus allowing much greater mode selectivity...|$|R
25|$|Because the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> {{is made of}} a {{birefringent}} material, when in {{the wave}} plate, the light travels at different speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the horizontal component which is along the slow axis of the wave plate will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical fast axis. Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the wave plate the horizontal component of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting {{the thickness of the}} wave plate one can control how much the horizontal component is delayed relative to vertical component before the light leaves the wave plate and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> the rightward horizontal component will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|E
25|$|To {{create a}} {{circular}} polarizer that instead passes right-handed polarized light and absorbs left-handed light, one again rotates the wave plate and linear polarizer 90° relative to each another. It {{is easy to}} appreciate that {{by reversing the positions}} of the transmitting and absorbing axes of the linear polarizer relative to the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate,</b> one changes which handedness of polarized light gets transmitted and which gets absorbed.|$|E
50|$|The sensitive-tint (full-wave) and <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> {{are widely}} used {{in the field of}} optical mineralogy. Addition of plates between the polarizers of a {{petrographic}} microscope makes easier the optical identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks, in particular by allowing deduction of the shape and orientation of the optical indicatrices within the visible crystal sections.|$|R
40|$|Logic gates {{for light}} signals {{constructed}} from combinations of prisms, polarizing plates, and quarterwave plates. Optical logic gate performs elementary logic operation on light signals received along two optical fibers. Whether gate performs OR function or exclusive-OR function depends on orientation of analyzer.

40|$|Restricted Access. A {{detailed}} analysis of the polarization eigenmodes of a QHQ retarder (a half-wave plate sandwiched between two identical <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates)</b> is presented. These are shown to be discontinuous {{as a function of the}} orientation of the half-wave plate, as a function of the wavelength of incident light and as a function of the retardation of the middle waveplate...|$|R
25|$|In the {{arrangement}} above, the transmission {{axis of the}} linear polarizer is at a positive 45° angle relative to the right horizontal and is represented with an orange line. The <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> has a horizontal slow axis and a vertical fast axis and they are also represented using orange lines. In this instance the unpolarized light entering the linear polarizer is displayed as a single wave whose amplitude and angle of linear polarization are suddenly changing.|$|E
25|$|In the {{illustration}} toward {{the right is}} the electric field of the linearly polarized light just before it enters the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate.</b> The red line and associated field vectors represent how the magnitude {{and direction of the}} electric field varies along the direction of travel. For this plane electromagnetic wave, each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the direction of travel. Refer to these two images in the plane wave article to better appreciate this.|$|E
25|$|Waveplates are {{constructed}} {{out of a}} birefringent material (such as quartz or mica), for which the index of refraction is different for different orientations of light passing through it. The behavior of a waveplate (that is, {{whether it is a}} half-wave plate, a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate,</b> etc.) depends on the thickness of the crystal, the wavelength of light, and the variation of the index of refraction. By appropriate choice of the relationship between these parameters, it is possible to introduce a controlled phase shift between the two polarization components of a light wave, thereby altering its polarization.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{design of a}} {{universal}} gadget, consisting of two half-wave <b>plates</b> and two <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> coaxially mounted, which can realize every SU (2) polarization optical transformation; to realize a given SU (2) element one simply has to rotate these plates about the common axis to angular positions characteristic of the element.

Referred to by:		Erratum: Physics Letters A, Volume 141, Issues 8 - 9, 20 November 1989, Page 438 Using a {{generalized}} form of Jordan's {{formulation of the}} geometric phase problem it is shown that a single gadget capable of realising an arbitrary element of the polarization transformation group SU (2) can be constructed using two half-wave <b>plates</b> and two <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates.</b> For special transformations, simpler, practical gadgets are proposed...|$|R
40|$|We {{would like}} to propose a new, simple method to {{evaluate}} the pretilt angle of a transmissive or reflective LCD cell. The compensator is consisted of two <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> (QWP) and one half-wave plate (HWP). By proper adjusting the orientation of quarter wave plate and half wave plate, the phase value of the compensator which corresponding to the minimum transmission can be obtained. We can make use such value for calculating the actual pretilt angle...|$|R
25|$|At {{the top of}} the {{illustration}} toward the right, is the circularly polarized light after it leaves the wave plate, and again directly below it, for comparison purposes, the linearly polarized light that entered the <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate.</b> In the upper image, because this is a plane wave, each vector leading from the axis to the helix represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the direction of travel. All the electric field vectors have the same magnitude indicating that the strength of the electric field does not change. The direction of the electric field however steadily rotates.|$|E
25|$|When {{the light}} propagates either along or {{orthogonal}} to the optic axis, such a lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations {{see the same}} effective refractive index, {{so there is no}} extraordinary ray. In the second case the extraordinary ray propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to ne) but is not an inhomogeneous wave. A crystal with its optic axis in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to create a waveplate, {{in which there is no}} distortion of the image but an intentional modification of the state of polarization of the incident wave. For instance, a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate</b> is commonly used to create circular polarization from a linearly polarized source.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{birefringence}} Δn {{may vary}} slightly due to dispersion, this is negligible {{compared to the}} variation in phase difference according to the wavelength of the light due to the fixed path difference (λ0 in the denominator in the above equation). Waveplates are thus manufactured {{to work for a}} particular range of wavelengths. The phase variation can be minimized by stacking two waveplates that differ by a tiny amount in thickness back-to-back, with the slow axis of one along the fast axis of the other. With this configuration, the relative phase imparted can be, for the case of a <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plate,</b> one-fourth a wavelength rather than three-fourths or one-fourth plus an integer. This is called a zero-order waveplate.|$|E

40|$|A phase {{compensation}} method is presented {{for measuring the}} cell gap of reflective LCD. We use the so-called QHQ compensator that {{is made up of}} two <b>quarter-wave</b> <b>plates</b> (Q) and one half-wave late (H). This method is different from other compensation methods in that we can change both the orientation angle and retardation value of the compensator by rotating the quarterwave and halfwave retarders. As a result, the QHQ compensation method has a higher accuracy and a simpler procedure...|$|R
