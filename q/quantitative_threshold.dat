Hydrophobicity is a property which is characterized by the water contact angle (CA) and interfacial energies of the solid-water, solid-vapor, and water-vapor interfaces and thus it is a thermodynamic property usually quantitatively defined as CA>90 degrees. Another difference is that the hydrophobicity is opposed to the hydrophilicity in a natural way.

40|$|Abstract. The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was {{launched}} in 2000. To understand why some national programs have been more successful than others, a panel of individuals with expertise in LF elimination efforts met to assess available data from programs in 8 countries. The goal was to identify: 1) the factors determining success for national LF elimination programs (defined as the rapid, sustained reduction in microfilaremia/ antigenemia after repeated mass drug administration [MDA]); 2) the priorities for operational research to enhance LF elimination efforts. Of more than 40 factors identified, the most prominent were 1) initial level of LF endemicity; 2) effectiveness of vector mosquitoes; 3) MDA drug regimen; 4) population compliance. Research important for facilitating program success was identified as either biologic (i. e., [1] quantifying differences in vectorial capacity; [2] identifying seasonal variations affecting LF transmission) or programmatic (i. e., [1] identifying <b>quantitative</b> <b>thresholds,</b> especially the population compliance levels necessary for success, and the antigenemia o...|$|R

In order to create levels of risk tolerance by user group it has been necessary to look at the available literature on risk tolerance to imposed and ac-cepted risks and societies low tolerance for multiple fatalities. By comparing the probability of individual or societal risk with risk acceptance thresholds for different categories of users it is then possible to see whether mitigations are needed to reduce risk to a level likely to be tolerable to users and society, it should also be possible to ascertain how accurate forecasting and control measures need to be in order stay below the risk tolerability thresholds...|$|R
