5000|$|A nested <b>quotation</b> is a <b>quotation</b> that is {{encapsulated}} inside another <b>quotation,</b> {{forming a}} hierarchy with multiple levels. When {{focusing on a}} certain <b>quotation,</b> one must interpret it within its scope. Nested <b>quotation</b> {{can be used in}} literature (as in nested narration), speech, and computer science (as in [...] "meta"-statements that refer to other statements as strings). Nested <b>quotation</b> can be very confusing until evaluated carefully and until each <b>quotation</b> level is put into perspective.|$|R
25|$|<b>Quotation</b> marks {{are placed}} below at the {{beginning}} and above at the ending of a <b>quotation,</b> both signs turning left, being curly and double. If another <b>quotation</b> is included in a <b>quotation,</b> angle <b>quotation</b> marks (guillemets) are used, directed towards each other with their tips: („quote1 »quote2« quote1”).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Quotation</b> marks {{are written}} {{as a pair}} of opening and closing marks in either of two styles: single (‘...’) or double (“...”). Opening and closing <b>quotation</b> marks may be {{identical}} in form (called neutral, vertical, straight, typewriter, or [...] "dumb" [...] <b>quotation</b> marks), or may be distinctly left-handed and right-handed (typographic or, colloquially, curly <b>quotation</b> marks); see <b>quotation</b> mark glyphs for details. Typographic <b>quotation</b> marks are usually used in manuscript and typeset text. Because typewriter and computer keyboards lack keys to directly enter typographic <b>quotation</b> marks, much typed writing has neutral <b>quotation</b> marks. The [...] "smart quotes" [...] feature in some computer software can convert neutral <b>quotation</b> marks to typographic ones, but sometimes imperfectly.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{artwork and}} sculptures, <b>quotations,</b> {{furniture}} and photography have been commissioned {{as part of}} the art strategy. A range of <b>quotations</b> have been inscribed onto the stonework in and around the parliamentary complex. Beneath the Canongate Building façade is the Canongate Wall, constructed from a variety of indigenous Scottish rocks such as Lewisian gneiss, Torridonian sandstone and Easdale slate. The stones are set into large concrete casts, each one inscribed with a quotation. The Canongate Wall contains a total of 24 <b>quotations.</b> Etched along the lower stretch of the wall is a pictorial representation of the Old Town of Edinburgh-based around a sketch by Enric Miralles showing the view of the Old Town from his bedroom window in the Balmoral Hotel.|$|E
50|$|In Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian, angled <b>quotation</b> marks {{are used}} without spaces. In case of quoted {{material}} inside a <b>quotation,</b> rules and most noted style manuals prescribe {{the use of}} different kinds of <b>quotation</b> marks. However, some of them allow to use the same <b>quotation</b> marks for quoted material inside a <b>quotation,</b> and if inner and outer <b>quotation</b> marks fall together, then one of them should be omitted.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>quotation</b> marks use the Polish format in {{the format}} [...] "quote [...] "inside" [...] quote", that is, [...] "[...] [...]" [...] for a normal <b>quotation,</b> and double angle symbols for a <b>quotation</b> inside a <b>quotation.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{typewriter}} keyboards, {{the curved}} <b>quotation</b> marks were not implemented. Instead, to save space, the straight <b>quotation</b> marks were invented as a compromise. Even {{in countries that}} did not use curved <b>quotation</b> marks, angular <b>quotation</b> marks were not implemented either.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{generally}} no space between an opening <b>quotation</b> mark {{and the following}} word, or a closing <b>quotation</b> mark and the preceding word. When a double <b>quotation</b> mark or a single <b>quotation</b> mark immediately follows the other, proper spacing for legibility may suggest that a thin space (...) or larger non-breaking space (...) be inserted.|$|R

5|$|A catchy jingle and ad campaign, it {{has come}} to embody a piece of Americana, and has even seeped into the {{consciousness}} of people who were too young (or not even alive) to remember the campaign when it occurred.

50|$|<b>Quotation</b> marks, {{also called}} quotes, quote marks, quotemarks, speech marks, {{inverted}} commas or talking marks, are punctuation marks used in pairs in various writing systems {{to set off}} direct speech, a <b>quotation,</b> or a phrase. The pair consists of an opening <b>quotation</b> mark and a closing <b>quotation</b> mark, {{which may or may}} not be the same character.|$|R
50|$|The curved <b>quotation</b> marks (“…”) usage was {{exported}} to some non-Latin scripts, notably {{where there was}} some English influence (for instance, in Indian scripts). The angular <b>quotation</b> marks («…») usage was {{exported to}} some non-Latin scripts, like Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic and Ethiopic. The Far East angle brackets <b>quotation</b> marks (《…》) are also a development of the in-line angular <b>quotation</b> marks.|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{two kinds}} of <b>quotation,</b> namely {{indirect}} <b>quotation</b> (e. g., 2 ̆ 7 Anita said that Mexico is beautiful 2 ̆ 7) and pure <b>quotation</b> (e. g., 2 ̆ 7 Mexico 2 ̆ 7 has six letters). With respect to each, we have both a negative and a positive plaint. The negative plaint is that the strict Davidsonian (1968, 1979 a) treatment of indirect and pure <b>quotation</b> cannot be correct. The positive plaint is an alternative account of how <b>quotation</b> of these two sorts works...|$|R
5|$|In Quotation of Dream (1991), direct <b>quotations</b> from Debussy's La Mer and Takemitsu's earlier works {{relating}} to the sea are incorporated into the musical flow ("stylistic jolts were not intended"), depicting the landscape outside the Japanese garden of his own music.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President is {{structured}} {{as a series}} of loosely interrelated narratives. The book combines practical theology, Biblical theology, Church history, contemporary stories, political manifesto, and Bible stories.

5|$|Reviewers {{wrote that}} Peshkin's account was fair, and praised his {{decision}} to let the participants speak for themselves through <b>quotations.</b> They {{also noted that the}} book filled a literary lacuna in scholarly understanding of the rapidly expanding and understudied fundamentalist Christian school.|$|E
5000|$|In Simplified Chinese, the European-style <b>quotation</b> marks {{are always}} used in {{horizontal}} text. Here, single <b>quotation</b> marks are used when embedded within double <b>quotation</b> marks: [...] These <b>quotation</b> marks are fullwidth in printed matter but {{share the same}} codepoints as the European <b>quotation</b> marks in Unicode, so they require a Chinese-language font to be displayed correctly. In vertical text, corner brackets rotated 90° clockwise ( [...] , are used as in Traditional Chinese. Although Simplified Chinese is usually written horizontally, corner brackets are commonly encountered in vertically-printed newspaper headlines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quotation</b> using a country's home {{currency}} as {{the price}} currency (for example, EUR 0.8989 = USD 1.00 in the Eurozone) is known as direct <b>quotation</b> or price <b>quotation</b> (from that country's perspective) and is used in most countries.|$|R

5|$|The text is {{surrounded}} by a marginal commentary; it is the only codex that has both text and commentary in uncial script. The commentary is a catena of <b>quotations</b> of nine church fathers: Origen, Eusebius, Titus of Bostra, Basil, Isidore of Pelusium, Cyril of Alexandria, Sever from Antioch, Victor from Antioch, and Chrysostom. The commentary surrounds the single-column text of Luke on three sides. Patristic text is written in small uncial letters. Most of the <b>quotations</b> are those of Ciril of Alexandria (93 scholia); next comes Titus of Bostra (45 scholia). The commentary was written in a different kind of uncial script than the biblical text.|$|E
5|$|A Book of Mediterranean Food was an {{influential}} cookery book written by Elizabeth David in 1950, her first, {{and published by}} John Lehmann. After years of rationing and wartime austerity, the book brought light and colour back to English cooking, with simple fresh ingredients, from David's experience of Mediterranean cooking while living in France, Italy and Greece. The book was illustrated by John Minton, and the chapters were introduced with <b>quotations</b> from famous writers.|$|E
