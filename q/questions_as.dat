5|$|In February, Magoon {{was called}} {{to testify before the}} Senate Committee {{responsible}} for Canal administration, including responding to Bigelow's report. He was criticized now for the earlier adoption of Panama's penal system in the Zone. One major point of contention was that it did not allow for trial by jury for American citizens arrested there. They raised <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> {{to the quality of the}} judges in the territory and other issues.|$|E
5|$|A 2002 {{article in}} BusinessWeek {{said that a}} series of {{bankruptcies}} of McKinsey clients, such as Swissair, Kmart, and Global Crossing, in the 1990s raised <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> to whether McKinsey was responsible or had a lapse in judgement. McKinsey recommended that Swissair avoid high operating costs in its home country by developing partnerships with airlines based in other regions. In order to attract partners, Swissair acquired more than $1 billion in shares of other airlines, {{many of which were}} failing. This led to huge losses for Swissair.|$|E
5|$|A member may be disqualified if he {{is found}} to be of unsound mind, if he becomes {{insolvent}} or is an undischarged bankrupt, {{if he is}} convicted and sentenced to imprisonment of not less than one year or a fine of not less than S$2,000, or if he has lost his Singaporean citizenship or declared himself allied to a foreign country. Any <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> to membership or disqualification are determined by a tribunal convened in secret that consists of a Supreme Court judge appointed by the Chief Justice and two members appointed by the Council. The Constitution does not stipulate any procedure for the removal of a member besides disqualification and the member's own resignation.|$|E

5|$|After the ten minutes, {{the first}} team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team {{questions}} from the announced category. Each question is given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play {{the same set of}} questions. Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> possible, and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity as well as all winnings from previous episodes.|$|E
5|$|As Alice's memory {{begins to}} fade, she daydreams {{of her mother}} and sister, who died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She memorizes words and sets a series of {{personal}} questions on her phone, which she answers every morning. She hides sleeping pills in her room, and records a video message instructing her future self to swallow the pills when she can no longer answer the <b>questions.</b> <b>As</b> her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching for the bathroom in her own home and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play.|$|E
5|$|GRO J0422+32 (V518 Persei) {{is another}} X-ray binary in Perseus. One {{component}} {{is a red}} dwarf star of spectral type M4.5V, which orbits a mysterious dense and heavy object—possibly a black hole—every 5.1 hours. The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E

5|$|In 1871 {{he became}} the first Cavendish Professor of Physics at Cambridge. Maxwell was put in charge of the {{development}} of the Cavendish Laboratory, supervising every step in the progress of the building and of the purchase of the collection of apparatus. One of Maxwell's last great contributions to science was the editing (with copious original notes) of the research of Henry Cavendish, from which it appeared that Cavendish researched, amongst other things, such <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> the density of the Earth and the composition of water.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under {{cross-examination}} about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty {{back to the house}} after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the <b>questions,</b> <b>as</b> the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from whooping cough. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1990s, {{observations}} of certain globular clusters appeared to indicate, {{that they were}} about 15billion years old, which conflicted with most then-current estimates {{of the age of}} the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to stellar winds, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. While there still remain some <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.|$|E

5|$|On 16 November 2010, it was {{revealed}} that the Glazers were to pay off the remaining £220million contained within the PIK loans by 22 November 2010. The loans were by then accruing interest at a rate of 16.25%, as the club's overall debt had exceeded its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by more than five times. However, the club claimed that none of its own money had been put towards the repayment, raising <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> to how the Glazer family had raised the funds; suggested methods include the sale of a minority stake in the club to a third party, the sale of {{some or all of the}} family's other businesses, and – the most likely option – the refinancing of the PIKs with another loan at a lower interest rate.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> to whether he had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E

5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves <b>questions</b> <b>as</b> to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
