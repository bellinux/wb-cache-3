40|$|Tubulin {{targeting}} agents {{constitute an}} important class of anticancer drugs. By acting either as microtubule stabilizers or destabilizers, they disrupt microtubule dynamics, thus inducing mitotic arrest and, ultimately, cell death by apoptosis. Three different binding sites, whose exact location on tubulin has been experimentally detected, {{have been identified}} so far for antimitotic compound targeting microtubules, namely the taxoid, the colchicine and the vinka alkaloid binding site. A number of ligand- and structure-based molecular modeling studies in this field has been reported over the years, aimed at elucidating the binding modes of both stabilizing and destabilizing agent, {{as well as the}} molecular features responsible for their efficacious interaction with tubulin. Such studies are described in this review, focusing on information provided by different modeling approaches on the structural determinants of antitubulin agents and the interactions with the binding pockets on tubulin emerged as fundamental for antitumor activity. To describe molecular modeling approaches applied to date to molecules known to bind microtubules, this paper has been divided into two main parts: microtubule destabilizing (Part 1) and stabilizing (Part 2) agents. The first part includes structure-based and ligand-based approaches to study molecules targeting colchicine (1. 1) and vinca alkaloid (1. 2) binding sites, respectively. In the second part, the studies performed on microtubule-stabilizing antimitotic agents (MSAA) are described.

30|$|The {{physiological}} {{basis for}} high light ‘stress’ in plants originates within {{the process of}} energy absorption and transduction {{and the fact that}} there is a limited capacity for plants to utilise absorbed light energy. Photosynthesis is a complex physio-chemical process that converts light energy into chemical energy via the fixing of CO 2 into sugars. Light is first absorbed by chlorophyll, located in the light-harvesting complexes of both photosystems I and II (PSI, PSII) within the thylakoid membrane. This creates resonance energy, which is then transferred through neighbouring chlorophyll molecules to photosystems. An excited chlorophyll a molecule can return to ground state after light absorption through several pathways <b>–</b> <b>photochemistry</b> (photosynthesis), thermal dissipation, chlorophyll fluorescence or formation of a reactive oxygen species (ROS). The latter two are much less likely than the former (Murchie and Lawson 2013). Electrons are transferred from PSII to PSI via the redox reactions within the electron transport chain, coupled with the transfer of H+ across the thylakoid membrane. The resulting NADPH and ATP are utilized in the Calvin-Benson cycle to reduce CO 2 to organic compounds. However, the capacity of photosynthesis to utilise sunlight is limited, and more so in C 3 plants such as rice. Moreover this is a highly erratic resource, fluctuating according to climate and season cycles and canopy position and it is clear that photosynthesis does not maintain a high efficiency during such transients leading to the risk of biomass loss and oxidative stress (Pearcy 1990; Murchie et al. 2009; Niinemets and Anten 2009).|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of organic micropollutants (OMPs) in water {{is of great}} environmental concern. OMPs such as endocrine disruptors and certain pharmaceuticals have shown alarming effects on aquatic life. OMPs {{are included in the}} priority list of contaminants in several government directorate frameworks. The low levels of OMPs concentration (ng/L to μg/L) force the use of sophisticated analytical instruments. Although, the techniques to detect OMPs are progressing, the focus of current research is only on limited, important OMPs due to the high amount of time, cost and effort involved in analyzing them. Alternatively, quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models help to screen processes and propose appropriate options without considerable experimental effort. QSAR models are well-established in regulatory bodies as a method to screen toxic chemicals. The goal of the present thesis was to develop QSAR models for OMPs removal by oxidation. Apart from the QSAR models, a decision support system (DSS) based on multi-criteria analysis (MCA) involving socio-economic-technical and sustainability aspects was developed. Also, hybrids of different water treatment processes were studied to propose a sustainable water treatment train for OMPs removal. In order to build the QSAR models, the ozone/hydroxyl radical rate constants or percent removals of the OMPs were compiled. Several software packages were used to 5 compute the chemical properties of OMPs and perform statistical analyses. For DSS, MCA was used since it allows the comparison of qualitative (non-monetary, non-metric) and quantitative criteria (e. g., costs). Quadrant plots were developed to study the hybrid of natural and advanced water treatment processes. The QSAR models satisfied both chemical and statistical criteria. The DSS resulted in natural treatment and ozonation as the preferred processes for OMPs removal. The QSAR models {{can be used as a}} screening tool for OMPs removal by oxidation. Moreover, the <b>QSAR</b> <b>-</b> defining molecular descriptors help in detailed understanding of oxidation.

40|$|Absorption, distribution, {{metabolism}} and excretion (ADME) determine target tissue doses upon human exposure to chemicals. In this respect, ADME {{is a critical}} piece of information {{in the framework of}} chemical risk assessment. This is especially true in an era where risk assessment must increasingly be based on in vitro toxicity experiments. Human external exposure must be translated into human tissue doses and compared with in vitro actual cell exposure associated to effects (in vitro - in vivo comparison). Much of the information needed can be generated at tissue/cell or sub-cellular level using in vitro and/or in silico (data-based such as <b>QSAR</b> <b>-</b> Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship) tools. Finally, (computer) modelling serves to integrate disparate in silico and in vitro findings in order to simulate whole body processes. However, there are few freely-available computational modelling platforms currently available in the public domain. Also, the absence of a complete toolbox of in silico and in vitro prediction tools to provide estimates for kinetic parameters is currently a problem. Although some ADME processes can be reasonably estimated in vitro or in silico, important gaps withhold physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modelling from wider use for in vitro to in vivo dose extrapolation. Examples of gaps include unknown applicability domains and lack of high-throughput models to measure the following: (1) penetration of barriers, (2) partitioning between blood and tissues and (3) metabolic clearance. This paper is based on a joint EPAA - EURL ECVAM expert meeting and provides a summary of the state of art of in silico and in vitro ADME models used to deliver parameter values for basic (Tier 1) PBTK modelling. Furthermore insights and concrete recommendations are provided to in silico QSAR and in vitro test developers, toxicologists, safety assessors and regulators on priorities to further progress towards a new integrated in silico / in vitro risk assessment paradigm for systemic toxicity without or with significantly fewer animals. The paper, (1) describes a set of critical in vitro and in silico methods providing credible input data for Tier 1 PBTK modelling; (2) defines recommendations for public availability of PBTK modelling tools; (3) provides concrete suggestions where to address the scientific issues to foster progress with a new integrated risk assessment framework; (4) identifies gaps and lists a set of recommendations for initiating PBTK assessment in R&D and standardization and optimization efforts.

40|$|Computer-based drug {{design is}} a vital area of {{pharmaceutical}} chemistry; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSARs), determined computationally from experimental observations, are crucial in identifying candidate drugs by early screening, saving time on synthesis and in vivo testing. This thesis investigates the viability and the practicalities of using Mass Spectra- based pseudo-molecular descriptors, in comparison with other molecular descriptor systems, to predict the carcinogenicity, mutagenicity and the CI- transport inhibiting ability {{of a variety of}} molecules, and in the first case, of chemotherapeutic drugs particularly. It does so by identifying a number of QSARs which link the physical properties of chemicals with their concomitant activities in a reliable and mathematical manner. First, this thesis confirms that carcinogenicity and mutagenicity are indeed predictable using a variety of Artificial Intelligence techniques, both supervised and unsupervised, information germane to pharmaceutical research groups interested in the preliminary screening of candidate anti-cancer drugs. Secondly, it demonstrates that Mass Spectral intensities possess great descriptive fidelity and shows that reducing the burden of dimensionality is not only important, but imperative; selecting this smaller set of orthogonal descriptors is best achieved using Principal Component Analysis as opposed to the selection of a set of the most frequent fragments, or the use of every peak up to a number determined by the boundaries of supervised learning. Thirdly, it introduces a novel system of backpropagation and demonstrates that it is more efficient than its principal competitor at monitoring a series of connection weights when applied to this area of research, which requires complex relationships. Finally, it promulgates some preliminary conclusions about which AI techniques are applicable to certain problem-scenarios, how these techniques might be applied, and the likelihood that that application will result in the identification of series of reliable <b>QSARs.</b> EThOS <b>-</b> Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{investigating}} the isotopic fractionation {{in the formation}} of H 2 by the photolysis of CH 2 O under tropospheric conditions are reported and discussed. The deuterium (D) depletion in H 2 produced is 500 (± 20) ‰ with respect to the parent CH 2 O. We also observed that complete photolysis of CH 2 O under atmospheric conditions produces H 2 that has virtually the same isotopic ratio as that of the parent CH 2 O. These findings imply that there must be a very strong concomitant isotopic enrichment in the radical channel (CH 2 O + h ! CHO + H) as compared to the molecular channel (CH 2 O + h ! H 2 + CO) of the photolysis of CH 2 O in order to balance the relatively small isotopic fractionation in the competing reaction of CH 2 O with OH. Using a 1 <b>-</b> box <b>photochemistry</b> model we calculated the isotopic fractionation factor for the radical channel to be 0. 22 (± 0. 08), which is equivalent to a 780 (± 80) ‰ enrichment in D of the remaining CH 2 O. When CH 2 O is in photochemical steady state, the isotopic ratio of the H 2 produced is determined not only by the isotopic fractionation occurring during the photolytical production of H 2 (m) but also by overall fractionation for the removal processes of CH 2 O (f), and is represented by the ratio of m/ f. Applying the isotopic fractionation factors relevant to CH 2 O photolysis obtained in the present study to the troposphere, the ratio of m/ f varies from 0. 8 to 1. 2 depending on the fraction of CH 2 O that reacts with OH and that produces H 2. This range of m/ f can render the H 2 produced from the photochemical oxidation of CH 4 to be enriched in D (with respect to the original CH 4) by the factor of 1. 2 – 1. 3 as anticipated in the literature...|$|R

The approach taken here is that of using approximate vibronic coupling models, as well as extending the methods and algorithms to construct them. These are then used in quantum dynamic calculations to obtain time-dependent properties, compute spectra and calculate dissociation cross-sections. A genetic algorithm which aids to the fitting of diabatic model parameters is described in detail and tested in two systems. The neutral and cationic surfaces of cyclo-butadiene is one of the systems for which this fitting algorithm was used and the photo-electron spectrum was then calculated to compare with the experimental one. We show how one can generate polynomial functions which are invariant with respect to the non-Abelian point groups. These invariant polynomials are then used for the construction of an acetylene model, where photo-dissociation cross sections are calculated for all possible angles. A bigger system Tolan, the monomial of a family of a photo-active dendritic antenna, was modelled. Comparison between the experimental and calculated absorption spectra validates the model and is subsequently used to model the first few picoseconds of population transfer. ...|$|R

Partitioning the effects of different processes can be useful when considering the sensitivity of chemical transformation to, for example, a changing environment or anthropogenic influence. However, transformation is not observed directly, since mixing ratios are measured, and models must be used to relate changes to processes. Here, four cases from the ITCT-Lagrangian 2004 experiment are studied. In each case, aircraft intercepted a distinct air mass several times during transport over the North Atlantic, providing a unique dataset and quantifying the net changes in composition from all processes. A new framework is presented to deconstruct the change in O 3 mixing ratio (Δ O 3) into its component processes, which were not measured directly, {{taking into account the}} uncertainty in measurements, initial air mass variability and its time evolution. The results show that the net chemical processing (Δ O 3 chem) over the whole simulation is greater than net physical processing (Δ O 3 phys) in all cases. This is in part explained by cancellation effects associated with mixing. In contrast, each case is in a regime of either net photochemical destruction (lower tropospheric transport) or production (an upper tropospheric biomass burning case). However, physical processes influence O 3 indirectly through addition or removal of precursor gases, so that changes to physical parameters in a model can have a larger effect on Δ O 3 chem than Δ O 3 phys. Despite its smaller magnitude, the physical processing distinguishes the lower tropospheric export cases, since the net photochemical O 3 change is − 5 ppbv per day in all three cases. Processing is quantified using a Lagrangian photochemical model with a novel method for simulating mixing through an ensemble of trajectories and a background profile that evolves with them. The model is able to simulate the magnitude and variability of the observations (of O 3, CO, NO y and some hydrocarbons) and is consistent with the time-average OH following air-masses inferred from hydrocarbon measurements alone (by Arnold et al., 2007). Therefore, it is a useful new method to simulate air mass evolution and variability, and its sensitivity to process parameters...|$|R

We found that although 100 % of WT mice developed skin tumors after 45 weeks of UV irradiation, only 60 % of CD 1 d-/- mice developed skin tumors. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the resistance of CD 1 d-/- mice to UV-induced carcinogenesis, we determined the time course and kinetics of keratinocyte cell death after UV irradiation. After acute UV exposure, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) -positive keratinocytes were eliminated from the skin of WT mice by 72 h post-UV, but they still persisted until 96 h in CD 1 d-/- mice. The kinetics of p 53 protein expression closely followed the kinetics of apoptotic cell death. Chronic UV irradiation resulted in induction of a significantly higher number of apoptotic keratinocytes in CD 1 d-/- than WT mice. In addition, epidermis and dermis from chronically UV-irradiated CD 1 d-/- mice harbored significantly fewer p 53 mutations than WT mice.

40|$|The {{environment}} is often exposed to chemical mixtures from multiple sources. The toxicity of various chemical mixtures {{is higher than}} single chemicals. However, {{the vast majority of}} toxicity studies deal with single chemicals, and therefore the prediction of mixture toxicity becomes a necessary and vital issue. In recent years, the development of quantum mechanical theory was combined with the progress of computational technology, which means quantitative calculation can be conducted from the atomic or molecular structure of a substance with little or even without empirical results. Besides, the parameter calculated was directly connected to organic activity, toxicity, chemical reaction, to construct the projection patterns, among which the QSAR is generally used to project mixture toxicity now. In this study, the objective is the binary mixtures toxicity of 12 benzene and its derivatives in the environment and 9 organophosphorus pesticides used with high frequency domestically, from which the DFT of quantum mechanical theory developed in recent years is used as a basis to build up the QSAR of toxicity prediction. The differences between Semi-empirical (AM 1) and DFT (B 3 LYP) are discussed as well, and the prediction pattern will further be applied to each field to access mixtures and reach the goal of fast prediction. The results suggest that the results of prediction pattern are similar from either B 3 LYP or AM 1 that are used to calculate benzene and its derivatives and mixtures. When using one parameter to predict toxicity, total surface area (TSA), apolar surface area (APSA), electron affinity (EA), and chemical potential (μ) are major factors. As multi-parameters are concerned, the increase of reaction energy (ΔEAB) and global soft (S) are required as parameters. Thus, AM 1 has priority for choices in the future due to its fast calculation. When constructing prediction patterns of toxicity, surface area is an important parameter no matter benzene and its derivatives or organophosphorus pesticides are concerned with single parameter. And surface area could be influenced by chemical polarity depending on different subjects of prediction. Moreover, groups of fat and fragrance are factors to influence toxicity as well, so the number of ring and atom are used as parameters while the variety of toxic substances are complicated. When predicting mixture toxicity with multi-parameters, TSA, Etot, η, S, and μ are necessary parameters. And avoid aromatic compounds induce difference, so use sum of ring (R) and sum of atoms (NO, NN, NS, NP, NCl). Besides, ΔEAB is an important parameter in mixture. 環境中常同時存在多種來源的化學混合物，而許多混合化學物質的毒性高於單一化學物質。然而大部分的毒性研究對象都是單一化學物質，因此預測混合物毒性為必要且重要的議題。近年來，量子力學的興起結合了電腦計算技術的提升，可由較少甚至不需實驗結果即可從物質的原子、分子結構進行定量計算，並藉由計算所得的參數直接與生物活性、毒性、化學反應性等建構預測模式，其中，定量結構活性關係(QSAR) 是目前被廣泛使用於預測混合毒性的方法。 本研究分別以環境中常出現的 12 種苯類化合物與國內使用量較高的 9 種有機磷劑農藥之混合毒性為研究標的，以近年在量子力學興起的密度泛函理論(DFT) 為基礎建立預測毒性之定量結構活性關係，並探討以半經驗(AM 1) 及密度泛函法(B 3 LYP) 計算的差異，欲由此預測模式進一步套用在各個領域中評估混合物，並達到快速預測的目的。 研究結果顯示，無論是以B 3 LYP或AM 1 法計算苯類化合物和混合物都可得到相似的預測模式結果－以單參數為考量時，總表面積、非極性表面積、電子親和力和化學勢為主要的影響因子；而以多參數為考量時，需增加能量差(ΔEAB) 與整體軟度為參數。因此未來在選擇使用方法上可以計算較快速的AM 1 法為優先。而在有機磷劑農藥之毒性預測方面，以單參數為考量時，單一型態的結果顯示環數與體積為主要參數，其次是總表面積、極性表面積與分子量；而混合型態則是以環數為主要參數，次之為分子量、總表面積、極性表面積與體積。當以多參數為考量時，須再添加總能量與化學勢，而在混合型態需增加各原子數目作為參數。另外，在建立毒性預測模式時，不論是苯類化合物或有機磷劑在考量單參數時，表面積皆是一重要的參數，而且依預測的對象不同，會受極性與非極性的影響。另外，脂肪族與芳香族也是影響毒性的因子之一，故當致毒物的種類較複雜時，須以環數和各原子數目作為參數。而以多參數預測毒性時，總能量、整體軟硬度與化學勢為必考慮的參數。另外，在混合型態預測上，混合物作用能量是必考慮因子，因其可表示混合物間的交互作用。摘要	i Abstract	ii 目錄	iii 圖目錄	iv 表目錄	vi 第一章 緒論	 1 1 - 1 研究動機	 1 1 - 2 研究目的	 2 第二章 背景簡介與文獻回顧	 3 2 - 1 苯和其衍生物	 3 2 - 2 農藥(Pesticide) 	 4 2 - 3 混合物聯合毒性作用	 7 2 - 4 定量結構活性關係(Quantitative structure-activity relationships, <b>QSAR)</b> 	 15 2 <b>-</b> 5 計算化學與量子化學	 16 2 - 5 - 1 半經驗法(Semi-empirical) 	 17 2 - 5 - 2 密度泛函理論(Density functional theory, DFT) 	 17 2 - 6 軟硬酸鹼理論(Hard-soft acid-base principle, HSAB) 	 19 2 - 7 密度泛函理論與軟硬酸鹼理論的合併	 20 第三章 計算方法	 22 3 - 1 研究架構	 22 3 - 2 分子參數計算	 23 3 - 2 - 1 結構最佳化計算	 25 3 - 2 - 2 得失電子計算	 26 3 - 3 混合毒性計算方法	 27 3 - 4 QSAR分析和數據處理	 28 第四章 結果與討論	 29 4 - 1 建立以密度泛函理論為基礎的定量結構活性關係(DFT-based quantitative structure-activity relationship, DFT-based <b>QSAR)</b> 	 29 4 <b>-</b> 2 以密度泛函法計算之參數進行定量結構活性關係的複因子迴歸	 56 4 - 2 - 1 單一型態苯類化合物之迴歸結果	 56 4 - 2 - 2 混合型態苯類化合物之迴歸結果	 74 4 - 3 以半經驗法計算之參數進行定量結構活性關係的複因子迴歸	 89 4 - 3 - 1 單一型態苯類化合物之迴歸結果	 89 4 - 3 - 2 混合型態苯類化合物之迴歸結果	 104 4 - 3 - 3 單一型態有機磷劑農藥之迴歸結果	 120 4 - 3 - 4 混合型態有機磷劑農藥之迴歸結果	 130 第五章 結論	 14...|$|R

The H 2 O center dot center dot center dot CO complexes in Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe matrices are generated by ultraviolet (UV, 193 and 250 nm) photolysis of formic acid (HCOOH). VUV photolysis of the H 2 O center dot center dot center dot CO complexes {{is found to}} lead to the formation of the OH center dot center dot center dot CO radical-molecule complexes and trans-HOCO radicals. It is shown that the matrix material, local matrix morphology, and possibly the H 2 O center dot center dot center dot CO complex geometry strongly affect the VUV photolysis pathways. The intrinsic reactivity of the matrix-isolated OH center dot center dot center dot CO complex resulting in the formation of trans-HOCO is directly demonstrated for the first time. This reaction occurs in Ar, Kr, and Xe matrices upon annealing above 25 K and may proceed over the barrier. The case of a Ne matrix is very special because the formation of trans-HOCO from the OH center dot center dot center dot CO complex is observed even at the lowest experimental temperature (4. 5 K), which is {{in sharp contrast to the}} other matrices. It follows that quantum tunneling is probably involved in this process in the Ne matrix at such a low temperature. Infrared light also promotes this reaction in the Ne matrix at 4. 5 K, which is not the case in the other matrices. The last findings show the effect of the environment on the tunneling and infrared-induced rates of this fundamental chemical reaction...|$|R
