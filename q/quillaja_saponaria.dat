50|$|Matorral is a shrubland plant community, {{composed}} of sclerophyll ("hard-leaved") shrubs and small trees, cactus, and bromeliads. Typical species include Litre (Lithraea venenosa), Quillay or Soapbark Tree (<b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria),</b> cactus (Echinopsis chiloensis), and bromeliads of genus Puya, with a diverse understory of herbs, vines, and geophytes. The matorral {{is similar to}} the chaparral of California and the maquis of the Mediterranean Basin.|$|E
5000|$|QS-21 is a {{purified}} {{plant extract}} that enhances {{the ability of}} the immune system to respond to vaccine antigens. It is derived from the soap bark tree (<b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria),</b> which is native to the country of Chile. Isolation of QS-21 destroys the soap bark tree, which has resulted in regulation of the tree by the governments where it is grown.1.|$|E
50|$|Saponins {{have also}} been used as {{adjuvants}} in vaccines, e.g. Quil A component QS-21, isolated from the bark of <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> Molina, to stimulate both the Th1 immune response {{and the production of}} cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against exogenous antigens. This makes them ideal for use in subunit vaccines and vaccines directed against intracellular pathogens as well as for therapeutic cancer vaccines but with the aforementioned side-effects of hemolysis.|$|E
50|$|Quillaia is the milled {{inner bark}} or small stems and {{branches}} of the soapbark (<b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria,</b> Molina). Other names include Murillo bark extract, Panama bark extract, Quillai extract, Quillaia extract, Quillay bark extract, and Soapbark extract. It contains {{a high concentration of}} saponins which is increased by processing; highly purified quillaia is used to enhance vaccines. Other compounds in the extract include tannins and other polyphenols, and calcium oxalate. It is listed as an ingredient in root beer and cream soda.|$|E
50|$|In particular, the {{saponins}} from <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> {{are used}} in veterinary vaccines as adjuvant (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease vaccines, helping to enhance the immune response). Initially the crude fraction was used. Later on, a purified mixture called Quil A was developed by Dalsgaard, which was more effective and caused fewer local side reactions. Quil A is still a mixture of more than 25 different saponin molecules. One of them, the saponin QS21, is being investigated for possible beneficial adjuvant effects on the human immune system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria,</b> {{the soap}} bark tree or soapbark, is an {{evergreen}} {{tree in the}} family Quillajaceae, native to warm temperate central Chile. In Chile it occurs from 32 to 40° South Latitude approximately. Populations are found even 2000 m (6500 ft) above sea level. It can grow to 15-20 m (50-65 ft) in height. The tree has thick, dark bark, smooth, leathery, shiny, oval evergreen leaves 3-5 cm long, white flowers 15 mm diameter borne in dense corymbs, and a dry fruit with five follicles each containing 10-20 seeds.|$|E
50|$|ISCOM {{technology}} {{was invented in}} 1982 by Professor Bror Morein at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala. The key components of ISCOMs are the Quillaja saponins, which are derived from the bark of the Chilean soap-bark tree <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> Molina. Quillaja saponins are well known {{for their ability to}} activate the immune system. It is also known that saponins in general can have toxic side-effects, including the induction of haemolysis. However, when Quillaia saponins, cholesterol and phospholipids are mixed under the specific stoichiometry that forms ISCOMs, this haemolytic activity is practically eliminated, while the adjuvant activity is retained.|$|E
50|$|The {{inner bark}} of <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> {{can be reduced}} to powder and {{employed}} as a substitute for soap, since it forms a lather with water, owing to the presence of a glucoside saponin, sometimes distinguished as quillaia saponin. It also applied as an agricultural spray adjuvant. The same, or a closely similar substance, is found in soapwort (Saponaria officinalis), in senega root (Polygala senega) and in sarsaparilla; it appears to be chemically related to digitonin, which occurs in digitalis. The wood is used in cabinetry, and scents derived from the tree are used in perfumes and cosmetics.|$|E
5000|$|Soap bark tree has a {{long history}} of {{medicinal}} use with the Andean people who used it especially as a treatment for various chest problems. It is the source of quillaia, the extract of which is used as a food additive and as an ingredient in pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and fire-fighting foam. It is used as additive for photographic films and foaming for drinks. The saponin content of the bark helps to stimulate the production of a more fluid mucus in the airways, thus facilitating the removal of phlegm through coughing. The saponins of this tree are also considered to have adjuvant properties for vaccine solutions., [...] QS21 adjuvant is a saponin obtainable from <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> extract.|$|E
50|$|Saponins have {{historically}} been understood to be plant-derived, but they have also been isolated from marine organisms such as sea cucumber. Saponins are indeed found in many plants, and derive their name from the soapwort plant (genus Saponaria, family Caryophyllaceae), the root of which was used historically as a soap. Saponins are {{also found in the}} botanical family Sapindaceae, with its defining genus Sapindus (soapberry or soapnut), and in the closely related families Aceraceae (maples) and Hippocastanaceae (horse chestnuts; ref. needed). It is also found heavily in Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Gynostemma, Cucurbitaceae) in a form called gypenosides, and ginseng or red ginseng (Panax, Araliaceae) in a form called ginsenosides. Within these families, this class of chemical compounds is found {{in various parts of the}} plant: leaves, stems, roots, bulbs, blossom and fruit. Commercial formulations of plant-derived saponins, e.g., from the soap bark (or soapbark) tree, <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria,</b> and those from other sources are available via controlled manufacturing processes, which make them of use as chemical and biomedical reagents.|$|E
50|$|To {{some degree}} the flora of central Chile is of a {{transition}} character between {{the northern and}} southern zones. It is much more than this, however, for it has a large number of genera and species peculiarly its own. This zone, with the Chilean Matorral, extends from about the 30th to the 36th parallel, perhaps a little farther south to include some characteristic types. The evergreens largely predominate here {{as well as in the}} extreme south, and on the open, sunburnt plains the vegetation takes on a sub-tropical aspect. One of the most characteristic trees of this zone is the peumo (Cryptocarya alba), whose dense evergreen foliage is everywhere conspicuous. The quillay (<b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria)</b> is another characteristic evergreen tree of this region, whose bark possesses saponaceousproperties. In earlier times the coquito palm (Jubaea chilensis) was to be found throughout this part of Chile, but it is almost completely extinct due to the destructive extraction process of its sweet sap, from which a syrup is made. Through the central zone the plains are open and there are forests on the mountain slopes.|$|E
50|$|These {{compounds}} give {{a permanent}} froth when shaken with water. They also cause hemolysis of red blood cells. Saponin glycosides {{are found in}} liquorice. Their medicinal value is due to their expectorant, and corticoid and anti-inflammatory effects. Steroid saponins, for example, in Dioscorea wild yam the sapogenin diosgenin—in form of its glycoside dioscin—is an important starting material for production of semi-synthetic glucocorticoids and other steroid hormones such as progesterone. The ginsenosides are triterpene glycosides and Ginseng saponins from Panax Ginseng C. A. Meyer, (Chinese ginseng) and Panax quinquefolius (American Ginseng).In general, {{the use of the}} term saponin in organic chemistry is discouraged, because many plant constituents can produce foam, and many triterpene-glycosides are amphipolar under certain conditions, acting as a surfactant.More modern uses of saponins in biotechnology are as adjuvants in vaccines: Quil A and its derivative QS-21, isolated from the bark of <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> Molina, to stimulate both the Th1 immune response and the production of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) against exogenous antigens make them ideal for use in subunit vaccines and vaccines directed against intracellular pathogens as well as for therapeutic cancer vaccines but with the aforementioned side-effect of hemolysis.|$|E

In the Present study the anti-inflammatory activities of the aqueous extract of commercially partially purified saponin from <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> Mol. in in vivo animal models. Methods & materials:: Aqueous extract of the plant material was prepared by cold maceration. The anti-inflammatory activity of a commercial <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> Mol. (QS) saponin extract was investigated by carragenan induced mice paw edema model for acute inflammation (Winter, 1962) [16]. Results: The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by carragenan in paw edema model in swiss albino mice (18 – 20  g). The anti-inflammatory activity was found to be dose dependent in carragenan induced paw edema. QS was found to significantly (p <  0. 05) reduce the carragenan induced mice paw edema (38. 59 %; 20  mg/kg bw) as compared to carragenan control. The percentage inhibition of standard anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin was (55 %; 10  mg/kg, bw).

Antibacterial effect of ampicillin, streptomycin, and ciprofloxacin {{in the presence of}} saponins was measured by cultivation methods. Properties of saponins against CHO-K 1 cells were measured by the MTT test, hemolysis assay and flow cytometry. Saponin from <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> has a cytotoxic effect at concentrations higher than 25 [*]μg/mL and in the range of 12 – 50 [*]μg/mL significantly increases the level of early apoptotic cells.

Saponins do not have synergetic effects on antibacterial action of tested antibiotics. In contrary, in the presence of saponins and antibiotics, more CFU/mL E. coli cells were observed. This effect was similar to saponins action alone towards E. coli cells. In conclusion, saponins was cytotoxic against CHO-K 1 cells, whereas against E. coli cells this effect was not observed...|$|E
40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> bark {{contains}} {{a high percentage}} of triterpene saponins and has been used for centuries as a cleansing and analgesic agent in Chilean folk medicine. Aim of the study: The topical and systemic analgesic effects of a commercial partially purified saponin extract, 3, 16 -dihydroxy- 23 -oxoolean- 12 -en- 28 -oic acid (quillaic acid), methyl 3, 16 -dihydroxy- 23 - oxoolean- 12 -en- 28 -oate and methyl 4 -nor- 3, 16 -dioxoolean- 12 -en- 28 -oate. Materials and methods: The samples were assessed in mice using the topical tail-flick and i. p. hot-plate tests, respectively. Results: All the samples showed activity in both analgesic tests in a dose-dependent manner. The most active against tail flick test was commercial partially purified saponin extract (EC 50 27. 9 mg%, w/v) and more than the ibuprofen sodium. On hot-plate test, methyl 4 -nor- 3, 16 -dioxoolean- 12 -en- 28 -oate was the most active (ED 50 12. 2 mg/kg) and more than the ibuprofen sodium.

40|$|Graduation date: 2000 Numerous {{properties}} of Yucca schidigera and <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> {{have been studied}} {{with respect to the}} saponins in the plant. These saponins are present in the extract as well and have been utilized commercially in the food and cosmetic industry for various products. Saponins have detergent-like properties in the presence of water. The detergent-like behavior of saponins {{plays a major role in}} their membranolytic properties. In addition, emulsification effects on fat which are characteristic of surfactant-type substances, may occur as well. Three studies were conducted using adult roosters, growing broiler chicks, and growing Japanese quail. Various effects of supplementing Yucca schidigera in the diets of these birds were studied such as: growth performance, overall health, and nutrient availability. An additional experiment was conducted comparing effects of <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> and Yucca schidigera extracts on body weight and fat digestibility in adult roosters. Addition of Yucca schidigera extract to high fat diets (tallow-based) increased lipid excretion in roosters, broilers, and quail. In roosters, dose of yucca extract affected excretion of lipid but no dose effects were seen in broilers or quail. Fat digestibility was not significantly affected by addition of saponins to the diet of adult roosters. However, fat digestibility was reduced in broilers and quail consuming a high fat diet. In general, level of dietary fat seemed to play a role in the effects of Yucca schidigera supplementation in growing birds.

40|$|Yucca (Yucca schidigera) and Soapbark (<b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria),</b> both native desert plants, {{are major}} {{commercial}} sources of saponin extracts. Yucca schidigera {{is native to}} the southwestern United States and to the arid Mexican desert, and <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> is found in arid areas of Chile. Saponins have detergent or surfactant properties with both water-soluble and fat-soluble components. The use of natural saponins from yucca and soapbark as an additive in the diet, has improved production in aquatic organisms. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of inclusion of Nutrafito plus (NTF+), which is a mixture of Yucca and Soapbark extracts, on growth, survival, and development of Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and the effect on growth, survival, development, and digestive enzyme activities for juvenile Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei. The extracts were included at different levels in the diets of tilapia and shrimp in four experiments. In experiment 1, at the end of 6 weeks there was no significant difference (p > 0. 05) between growth rates of tilapia fed 6 different diets, with no mortality nor abnormal behavior in any of the treatments. Water quality parameters were determined weekly and remained within recommended limits for Nile tilapia culture. In the second trial, at the end of 40 days, there was no significant difference (p > 0. 05) between growth rates of fish fed 7 different diets with various levels of Nutrafito.

40|$|Plantations with {{fast growing}} exotic tree species can negatively affect native plant species {{diversity}} {{and promote the}} spread of alien species.  Mediterranean Chile experienced major landscape changes with a vast expansion of industrial plantations of Pinus radiata in the past. However, with increasing knowledge of biodiversity effects on ecosystem services Chilean forest owners now aim to integrate the conservation of native biodiversity into forest management, but data on native species diversity and establishment within a plantation landscape is scarce. Here we investigated plant species diversity and composition in four forest management options applied within a landscape dominated by P. radiata plantations in comparison to an unmanaged reference: (i) a clear cut, (ii) a strip cut, (iii) a native canopy of Nothofagus glauca and (iv) a young P. radiata plantation. We wanted to assess if native plant species can be maintained either by natural regeneration or by planting of native tree species (Nothofagus glauca, N.  obliqua, <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria)</b> within this landscape.  Results show a high diversity of native and forest plant species within the different management options indicating a high potential for native biodiversity restoration within an anthropogenic landscape. In particular, herbaceous species can benefit from management. They are rare in unmanaged natural forests that are characterized by low light conditions and a thick litter layer. Management, however, also promoted a diversity of alien species.  The rapid spread of alien grass species after management can deter an initial establishment of native tree species or the survival and growth after planting mainly under dry but less under sufficient moisture conditions. The most unsuccessful option for promoting native plant species was clear cutting in a dry area where alien grasses were abundant. For drought-tolerant tree species such as <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria,</b> though, even a joint establishment with Pinus radiata seems possible. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> extract to enhance passive {{immunization}} in a pig model was investigated.

Piglets were weighed and serum immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG and IgM) concentrations measured on D 4, D 8, D 16 and D 32 of age. In initial analyses, a strong relationship was found between neonatal pig weight (D 2 of age) and the majority of measured parameters. Hence, within treatment, pigs were blocked by body weight, High (> 1. 50 kg), Moderate (1. 0 to 1. 5 kg), or Low weight (< 1. 0 kg). Saponin treatment did not affect serum immunoglobulin concentration of piglets from the High or Moderate weight groups; however, D 4 serum concentrations of IgA tended (P = 0. 06) to be higher in the Low weight saponin-treated group compared to controls. Additionally, saponin tended (P < 0. 1) to increase the rate (139 ? 6 vs. 111 ? 14 g/day for Saponin vs. Control pigs) and the extent (5. 1 ? 0. 2 vs. 4. 2 ? 0. 4 kg, Saponin vs. Control at D 32 of age) of growth in the Low weight group.

30|$|Immune-stimulating {{complexes}} (ISCOMs) were documented as both {{a delivery}} system and an immunostimulant for the vaccine development. ISCOMs are 40 nm nano-vectors of open cage structure and comprise cholesterol, phospholipids and mixture of saponins extracted from <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria</b> Molina (Sanders et al., 2005; Skene and Sutton, 2006; Sun et al., 2009 b). Vaccines of ISCOMs induced systemic and mucosal immune responses upon intranasal administration, incorporating protein antigens such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) envelope proteins (Hu et al., 1998), Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (MmmSC) prtoein (Abusugra and Morein, 1999), and recombinant HBsAg (Pandey and Dixit, 2010). Initially only hydrophobic antigens like membrane proteins were incorporated in the ISCOMs (Morein et al., 1984), but later ISCOMATRIX was developed to mix with antigens to circumvent the incorporation dependence on antigen properties. ISCOM and ISCOMATRIX can induce humoral and CTL responses (controversial for ISCOMATRIX) (Scheerlinck and Greenwood, 2008). Although the immunity potentiating mechanism is presently unclear, ISCOMs have been suggested as a potential intranasal and oral vaccine delivery system for protein antigens (Mowat et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2001).|$|E
40|$|QS- 21 is a saponin {{extracted}} from <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria,</b> widely investigated as a vaccine immunoadjuvant. However, QS- 21 use is mainly limited by its chemical instability, significant variety in molecular composition and low tolerance dose in mammals. Also, this compound tends to form micelles in a concentration-dependent manner. Here, we aimed to characterize its conformation {{and the process}} of micelle formation, both experimentally and computationally. Therefore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed in systems containing different numbers of QS- 21 molecules in aqueous solution, in order to evaluate the spontaneous micelle formation. The applied methodology allowed the generation of micelles whose sizes were shown to be in high agreement with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Furthermore, the ester linkage between fucose and acyl chain was less solvated in the micellar form, suggesting a reduction in hydrolysis. This is the first atomistic interpretation of previous experimental data, the first micellar characterization of saponin micelles by SAXS and first tridimensional model of a micelle constituted of saponins, contributing {{to the understanding of the}} molecular basis of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{study of}} {{ultrasonically}} assisted extraction of bioactive principles from <b>Quillaja</b> <b>Saponaria</b> Molina (Quillay) is presented. To {{address the problem}} it was studied the effects that could influence the extraction process through a two-level Factorial Design. The effects considered in the Experimental Design were: Granulometry, Extraction time, Acoustic Power and Acoustic Impedance. The production of the quillaja extracts is done with an aqueous extraction and the process is assisted by an ultrasonic field; no other solvents are used in its production. The final product only incorporates natural ingredients and raw materials, authorized for their use in food manufacturing processes. The principal factors affecting the ultrasonic extraction process were: Granulometry and Extraction time. The enhanced of ultrasonic assisted extraction ratio was measuring the increasing yield of extracted components, the extraction ratio was increased by ultrasonic effect {{and a reduction in}} extraction time was verified. In addition the process can be carried out at temperatures lower than the traditional way. The influence of ultrasound on the quality of bioactive principles was examined by HPLC technique and no influence of ultrasound on natural components was found...|$|E
40|$|Approximately in the 33 {{degree of}} {{southern}} latitude, the occidental Andes mountains shows an altitudinal vegetation distribution from the 800 to the 3500 meters. The local -ecologycal {{conditions and the}} effects of the altitude don't permit observe a clear sucession in the vegetable-level-represented in this area. In a general way speaking, the MOUNTAIN-LEVEL still conserve a number of sclerophyllous evergreen trees representatives typicall from valley and lowlands (Lithraea caustica, <b>Quillaja</b> <b>saponaria,</b> Maytenus boaria). By the other side, the SUBANDINE LEVEL presents a number of new exponents with an high-adaptability characteristic (Colliguaya, Kageneckia, Escallonia). Over 200 meters of altitude, the ANDINE_LEVEL shows a low and disperse shrub associated with grass and perennial gramineous (Adesmia, Calceolaria, Berberis, Laretia, Stipa), short grassland with andine meadows. Usually moist much of the summer due to melt water. A little bovine and caprine grazing is practiced in the fertile plains sectors. In a general way speaking, must be said that this region is being exposed to the degradation done by the felling of trees, grazing and tourism effect...|$|E
