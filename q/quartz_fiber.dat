Parker created a metric for radiation exposure he called the roentgen equivalent man or rem. After the war, this replaced the roentgen as the standard measure of radiation exposure.

The radiation hardness of the fibers to photons, electrons and hadrons is essential for satisfactory operation of this detector.
