25|$|Note: In {{cases where}} the optical design of a {{microscope}} produces an appreciable lateral separation of the two beams we have the case of classical interference microscopy, which does not result in relief images, but can nevertheless {{be used for the}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>determination</b> of mass-thicknesses of microscopic objects.|$|E
25|$|SPA-LEED is a {{technique}} where the intensity of diffraction beams is measured {{in order to determine}} the diffraction spot profiles. The spots are sensitive to the irregularities in the surface structure and their examination therefore permits more-detailed conclusions about some surface characteristics. Using SPA-LEED may for instance permit a <b>quantitative</b> <b>determination</b> of the surface roughness, terrace sizes or surface steps.|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} is shown that, by using the circuit theory which {{operates}} with lumped parameters, {{it is possible to}} derive mathematical models of a high power salient pole synchronous machine (SPSM), that can take into account the basic processes of the machine. It offers results regarding the electromagnetic and mechanical stresses for a given practical application. The <b>quantitative</b> <b>determinations</b> were performed on an 8000 kW synchronous motor. The results of <b>quantitative</b> <b>determinations</b> are of essential interest in the designing stage, for dynamic characteristics and parameters derivation and for constructive solutions to be chosen...|$|R
50|$|Particularly if {{a limited}} number of {{frequency}} components are present, the FID may be analysed directly for <b>quantitative</b> <b>determinations</b> of physical properties, such as hydrogen content in aviation fuel, solid and liquid ratio in dairy products (time-domain NMR).|$|R
30|$|All <b>quantitative</b> <b>determinations</b> {{were made}} with {{triplicate}} injections. The extraction was done in triplicate for each leaf sample. The content of nicotine of each sample was then quantitatively determined based on the external calibration curve (Saunders and Blume 1981).|$|R
500|$|The {{sample holder}} {{held up to}} 4 cells. Cells could be moved into the light path via an {{external}} control, allowing the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment. As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a blank, or standard, [...] "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent." [...] The standard could be a cell filled with a solvent such as distilled water or a prepared solvent of a known concentration. At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, transmittance, to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to absorbance which {{is proportional to the}} solute concentration according to Beer's law. This makes possible the <b>quantitative</b> <b>determination</b> of the amount of a substance in solution.|$|E
2500|$|... {{in which}} A is the {{absorbance}} {{measured by the}} instrument, ε is the molar absorption coefficient of the sample, l is the pathlength of the light beam through the sample, and c is the concentration of the substance in the solution or medium. The Spectronic 20 is thereby commonly used for <b>quantitative</b> <b>determination</b> of the concentration of a substance of interest. The Spectronic 20 measures the absorbance of light at a pre-determined concentration, and the concentration is calculated from the Beer-Lambert relationship.|$|E
60|$|The {{mathematical}} {{and experimental}} elucidation of the phenomena of electricity, {{and the study}} of the relations of this form of energy with chemical and thermal action, had made extensive progress before 1837. But the determination of the influence of magnetism on light, the discovery of diamagnetism, of the influence of crystalline structure on magnetism, and the completion of the mathematical theory of electricity, all belong to the present epoch. To it also appertain the practical execution and the working out {{of the results of the}} great international system of observations on terrestrial magnetism, suggested by Humboldt in 1836; and the invention of instruments of infinite delicacy and precision for the <b>quantitative</b> <b>determination</b> of electrical phenomena. The voltaic battery has received vast improvements; while the invention of magneto-electric engines and of improved means of producing ordinary electricity has provided sources of electrical energy vastly superior to any before extant in power, and far more convenient for use.|$|E
50|$|The {{concentration}} {{of a sample}} can be determined through calibration with certified reference material such as single or multi-element reference standards.
