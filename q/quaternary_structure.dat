5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the <b>quaternary</b> <b>structure</b> of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.|$|E
25|$|Hemoglobin has a <b>quaternary</b> <b>structure</b> {{characteristic}} of many multi-subunit globular proteins. Most of the amino acids in hemoglobin form alpha helices, and these helices are connected by short non-helical segments. Hydrogen bonds stabilize the helical sections inside this protein, causing attractions within the molecule, which then causes each polypeptide chain to fold into a specific shape. Hemoglobin's <b>quaternary</b> <b>structure</b> comes from its four subunits in roughly a tetrahedral arrangement.|$|E

50|$|Many {{food allergies}} {{are caused by}} hypersensitivities to {{particular}} proteins in different foods. Proteins have unique properties {{that allow them to}} become allergens, such as stabilizing forces in their tertiary and <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> which prevent degradation during digestion. Many theoretically allergenic proteins cannot survive the destructive environment of the digestive tract, thus do not trigger hypersensitive reactions.|$|R
25|$|Many {{proteins}} have a <b>quaternary</b> <b>structure,</b> {{which consists}} of several polypeptide chains that associate into an oligomeric molecule. Each polypeptide chain in such a protein is called a subunit. Hemoglobin, for example, consists of two α and two β subunits. Each of the four chains has an all-α globin fold with a heme pocket.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quaternary</b> <b>structure</b> has {{not been}} broadly {{considered}} for MTs. Dimerization and oligomerization processes have been observed and attributed to several molecular mechanisms, including intermolecular disulfide formation, bridging through metals bound by either Cys or His residues on different MTs, or inorganic phosphate-mediated interactions. Dimeric and polymeric MTs {{have been shown to}} acquire novel properties upon metal detoxification, but the physiological significance of these processes has been demonstrated only in the case of prokaryotic Synechococcus SmtA. The MT dimer produced by this organism forms structures similar to zinc fingers and has Zn-regulatory activity.|$|E
500|$|By the mid-1930s, {{analytical}} ultracentrifugation {{studies by}} Theodor Svedberg {{had shown that}} proteins had a well-defined chemical structure, and were not aggregations of small molecules.

[...] However, it was difficult to determine the exact molecular weight and number of amino acids in a protein.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in structural biology {{is to determine}} the configuration of domains and proteins in multidomain proteins and assemblies, respectively. All available data should be considered to maximize the accuracy and precision of these models. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) efficiently provides low-resolution experimental data about the shapes of proteins and their assemblies. Thus, we integrated SAXS profiles into our software for modeling proteins and their assemblies by satisfaction of spatial restraints. Specifically, we modeled the <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> of multidomain proteins with structurally defined rigid domains as well as <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> of binary complexes of structurally defined rigid proteins. In addition to SAXS profiles and the component structures, we used stereochemical restraints and an atomic distance-dependent statistical potential. The scoring function is optimized by a biased Monte Carlo protocol, including quasi-Newton and simulated annealing schemes. The final prediction corresponds to the best scoring solution in the largest cluste...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCellular {{proteolysis}} involves large oligomeric peptidases {{that play}} key {{roles in the}} regulation of many cellular processes. The cobalt-activated peptidase TET 1 from the hyperthermophilic Archaea Pyrococcus horikoshii (PhTET 1) was found to assemble as a 12 -subunit tetrahedron and as a 24 -subunit octahedral particle. Both <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> were solved by combining x-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy data. The internal organization of the PhTET 1 particles reveals highly self-compartmentalized systems made of networks of access channels extended by vast catalytic chambers. The two edifices display aminopeptidase activity, and their organizations indicate substrate navigation mechanisms different from those described in other large peptidase complexes. Compared with the tetrahedron, the octahedron forms a more expanded hollow structure, representing {{a new type of}} giant peptidase complex. PhTET 1 assembles into two different <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> because of quasi-equivalent contacts that previously have only been identified in viral capsids...|$|R

500|$|The {{formula for}} calitoxin is C203H305N55O72S7. It has a {{molecular}} mass of 4886 Daltons and an isoelectric point at pH 5.4. [...] The {{amino acid sequence}} is markedly dissimilar from other known sea anemones toxins. [...] There are two known genes coding for two highly homologous calitoxins—CLX-1 and CLX-2. [...] Both originate from a precursor peptide of 79 amino acids where the C-terminus determines {{whether it will be}} the mature CLX-1 or CLX-2. [...] The activated toxins consist of 46 amino acids with three disulfide bonds. [...] Researchers suspect that the toxins are stored as precursors in cnidocytes. [...] Under the effects of some triggering stimulus, the precursor is modified and released in the active form. [...] The patterning of cleavage sites targeted during maturation of the peptide suggest that the active <b>quaternary</b> <b>structure</b> might be a tetrapeptide.|$|E

40|$|At {{the heart}} of protein–protein {{interactions}} are protein–protein interfaces where the direct physical interactions occur. By developing and applying an efficient structural alignment method, we study the structural similarity of representative protein–protein interfaces involving interactions between dimers. Even without structural similarity between individual monomers that form dimeric complexes, ∼ 90 % of native interfaces have a close structural neighbor with similar backbone Cα geometry and interfacial contact pattern. About 80 % of the interfaces form a dense network, where any two interfaces are structurally related using a transitive set of at most seven intermediate interfaces. The degeneracy of interface space {{is largely due to}} the packing of compact, hydrogen-bonded secondary structure elements. This packing generates relatively flat interacting surfaces whose geometries are highly degenerate. Comparative study of artificial and native interfaces argues that the library of protein interfaces is close to complete and comprised of roughly 1, 000 distinct interface types. In contrast, the number of possible <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> of dimers is estimated to be about 104 times larger; thus, an experimentally determined database of all representative <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> is not likely in the near future. Nevertheless, one could in principle exploit the completeness of protein interfaces to predict most dimeric <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures.</b> Finally, our results provide a structural explanation for the prevalence of promiscuous protein interactions. By side-chain packing adjustments, we illustrate how multiprotein specificity can be attained at a promiscuous interface...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Quaternary</b> <b>structure</b> is the {{three-dimensional}} structure {{consisting of the}} aggregation {{of two or more}} individual polypeptide chains (subunits) that operate as a single functional unit. In this context, the <b>quaternary</b> <b>structure</b> is stabilized by the same non-covalent interactions and disulfide bonds as the tertiary structure. Complexes of two or more polypeptides (i.e. multiple subunits) are called multimers. Specifically it would be called a dimer if it contains two subunits, a trimer if it contains three subunits, a tetramer if it contains four subunits, and a pentamer if it contains five subunits. The subunits are frequently related to one another by symmetry operations, such as a 2-fold axis in a dimer. Multimers made up of identical subunits are referred to with a prefix of [...] "homo-" [...] (e.g. a homotetramer) and those made up of different subunits are referred to with a prefix of [...] "hetero-", for example, a heterotetramer, such as the two alpha and two beta chains of hemoglobin.|$|E

40|$|An {{unbiased}} survey {{has been}} made of the stable, most abundant multi-protein complexes in Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) that are larger than Mr {approx} 400 k. The <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> for 8 of the 16 complexes purified during this work were determined by single-particle reconstruction of negatively stained specimens, a success rate {approx} 10 times greater than that of previous 'proteomic' screens. In addition, the subunit compositions and stoichiometries of the remaining complexes were determined by biochemical methods. Our data show that the structures of only two of these large complexes, out of the 13 in this set that have recognizable functions, can be modeled with confidence based on the structures of known homologs. These results indicate that there is significantly greater variability in the way that homologous prokaryotic macromolecular complexes are assembled than has generally been appreciated. As a consequence, we suggest that relying solely on previously determined <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> for homologous proteins may not be sufficient to properly understand their role in another cell of interest...|$|R

[...] Further association of two of these dimers in a face-to-face fashion produces the homotetrameric structure and creates the two thyroxine binding sites per tetramer.

Controlled tryptic digestion of each isolated quaternary form generates, as limit digest products, folded and enzymatically active molecules, very resistant to further tryptic degradation. Electrospray mass spectrometric analyses and N-terminal sequence determinations indicate that trypsin can discriminate between the conformationally different <b>quaternary</b> <b>structures</b> of seminal RNase, and exerts a differential and asymmetric action on the two dimeric forms, depending on the original quaternary conformation of each form. The two digestion products from the MXM and the M=M dimeric forms have different structures, which are reminiscent of the original quaternary conformation of the dimers: one with interchange, the other with no interchange, of the N-terminal ends. The surprising resistance of these tryptic products to further tryptic action is explained by the persistence in each digestion product of the original intersubunit interface...|$|R
