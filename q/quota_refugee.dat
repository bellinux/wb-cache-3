50|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War {{contributed to}} a growth in the Jewish people of Germany. An {{important}} step for the renaissance of Jewish life in Germany occurred in 1990 when Helmut Kohl convened with Heinz Galinski, to allow Jewish people from the former Soviet Union to emigrate to Germany, {{which led to a}} large Jewish emigration. Germany is home to a nominal Jewish population of more than 200,000 (although this number reflects non-Jewish spouses or children who also immigrated under the <b>Quota</b> <b>Refugee</b> Law); 104,024 are officially registered with Jewish religious communities. The size of the Jewish community in Berlin is estimated at 120,000 people, or 60% of Germany's total Jewish populaion. Today, between 80 and 90 percent of the Jews in Germany are Russian speaking immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Many Israelis also move to Germany, particularly Berlin, for its relaxed atmosphere and low cost of living. Olim L'Berlin, a Facebook snowclone asking Israelis to emigrate to Berlin, gained notoriety 2014. Some eventually return to Israel after a period of residence in Germany. There are also a handful of Jewish families from Muslim countries, including Iran, Turkey, Morocco, and Afghanistan. Germany has the third-largest Jewish population in Western Europe after France (600,000) and Britain (300,000). and the fastest-growing Jewish population in Europe in recent years. The influx of immigrants, many of them seeking renewed contact with their Ashkenazi heritage, has led to a renaissance of Jewish life in Germany. In 1996, Chabad-Lubavitch of Berlin opened a center. In 2003, Chabad-Lubavitch of Berlin ordained 10 rabbis, the first rabbis to be ordained in Germany since World War II. In 2002 a Reform rabbinical seminary, Abraham Geiger College, was established in Potsdam. In 2006, the college announced that it would be ordaining three new rabbis, the first Reform rabbis to be ordained in Germany since 1942.|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the nexus between Jewish {{immigration}} to the Federal Republic of Germany and legal definitions of German ethnicity (Volkszugehörigkeit). It claims that the recognition of Jewish immigrants as Germans was continuously negotiated between different bureaucratic and societal actors struggling over the power to define who is a German. Examining the production of national belonging in practice, it breaks open the “black box” of the often alleged “ethnocultural” and “descent-based” German perception of nationhood. The fluid boundary between “German” and “Jewish” immigrants was only fixed in 1991 {{with the creation of}} the separate category of “Jewish <b>quota</b> <b>refugee.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Both the 1991 <b>Quota</b> <b>Refugee</b> Law {{as well as}} the 1993 War Aftermath Compensation Law (henceforth 1993 KfbG) {{require the}} {{prospective}} immigrant to first submit an application for admission (Aufnahmebescheid) in their home country before legal entry will be approved. As a result of these measures, federal, state and local governments can better organize and coordinate their efforts in refugee and returnee resettlement. Since receipt of social welfare provisions as well as legal residency requirements are tied to this application procedure the government has been able to effect a greater degree of control in regulating the annual flows of Soviet Jews and Ethnic Germans entering the Federal Republic. Both policies lend themselves well to a study of this sort as both policies’ possess comparable policy-administrative attributes which permit closer analysis. Additionally, both are peculiar to the FRG based exclusively upon historical and humanitarian principles...|$|E

Today, not many have asked the <b>Quota</b> <b>Refugees</b> about their experience of coming to Denmark and as a result this group has not previously been able to express their opinions on their integration to Denmark and the difficulties and health issues encountered {{as a result of this}} move. The empirical data presented in this report is based on three in-depth interviews with five Congolese <b>Quota</b> <b>Refugees</b> currently living in different municipalities of Denmark.

40|$|The aims {{of study}} were {{to examine the}} immigrants’ {{integration}} process in many aspects of living in Finland amongst Burmese families as a <b>quota</b> <b>refugee.</b> Their expectations for moving to Finland, social services and living conditions, the situation in labour market and education, social relations in personal connections and networks were important issues in examining the process of integration. Furthermore, in a relationship between {{parents and their children}} considering the cultural succession could appear the parent's ethnic identity, which might have affected their child's education. This study was based on the face-to-face interviews of Burmese refugees according to qualitative research method. The study followed the previous researches of immigrants and the integration process in Finland from different perspectives. The theories, which relate to the themes, such as immigrant identity, acculturation and family relationships, were used for analysing the material of the interviews. As a result, they were satisfied with the services in accordance with the Act on the Integration of Immigrants and Reception of Asylum Seekers (493 / 1999) in their living, learning language and career education for three years in the integration programme. Nevertheless, they had difficulties to get a job because of their weak language skills. They wanted to keep their identity with the language and culture in Finnish society and they hoped to teach their own language and culture to their children. The conclusion was that the Burmese refugees recognised their identity and importance of culture, when they tried to adjust themselves to a new culture in the new country. Their own identity and culture was also expressed in their child's education. Employment and language skills {{played an important role in}} the integration process. Having good relations with Finns supported their cultural adaptation in the society. Moreover, Burmese refugees were having a positive thinking and attitude in the integration process compared to previous studies of refugees even though they have had similar problems as other refugee groups.

40|$|This {{research}} {{seeks to}} contribute to the study of forced migration and resettlement programmes through the analysis of experiences of Latin American people who were granted refugee status in New Zealand from 1973 until the present. This study aims to analyse the reasons that forced people from Latin America to flee their countries and become refugees in New Zealand and how such “push” factors have varied over time. In particular, I will consider differences in their country of origin, socio-economic backgrounds, and access to education by exploring the political context of specific Latin American countries during their most significant periods of migration and displacement. Most of the Latin American refugees who arrived in New Zealand during the 1970 s and 1980 s had fled military dictatorships. More recent arrivals have been displaced from their country of origin as the result of conflicts surrounding narco-production and trafficking, civil wars, repression against indigenous and peasant populations, and the uprising of armed movements. This has also seen a shift from receiving refugees from Southern Cone countries such as Chile, to countries further north, especially Colombia. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with two groups of participants between February and June 2016 in five cities of New Zealand with high concentration of former refugees from Chile and Colombia. Group one is comprised of nine former refugees from Latin American countries who were accepted in New Zealand from 1973 until 2015 under the <b>quota</b> <b>refugee</b> category or as asylum seekers. Group two comprises four case and cross-cultural workers providing services for resettlement agencies with experience supporting former refugees from Latin America, whose opinions were used to support the discussion and findings of this research. It is expected that this research will help to develop more accurate policies to support former refugees from Latin American countries, understanding their previous experiences, refugee journey, cultural aspects, and the differences among countries within the Latin American region. It is also expected that this study will assist the wider community to confront the stereotypes associated with refugees in general, but particularly with Latin Americans. This research has the potential to raise awareness of Latin American people living in New Zealand who have fled wars and conflicts and help to spread information about the reasons that forced them to become refugees. Therefore, this will increase the support and understanding towards them. The significance of this research is its potential to influence policy makers and workers in the fields of refugee resettlement and counselling to improve services while considering specific cultural aspects of their Latin American clients. Therefore, this study offers recommendations for improving refugee policies and services, that have been backed up by professionals with vast experience on refugee issues...|$|E

30|$|During {{the fall}} of 2015 a number of {{political}} initiatives were taken {{in response to the}} all-time high refugee migration. On 23 October, all parliamentary parties except the Left Party and the Sweden Democrats (the former decided not {{to take part in the}} agreement and the latter was not invited) reached an agreement including the decision to only admit time-limited permits to asylum seekers – presented as a temporary deviation from the principle to grant immediate security of residence (Överenskommelse, 2015). <b>Quota</b> <b>refugees,</b> unaccompanied minors and families with children were, however, exempted from the agreed restriction (so could still receive permanent residence), and it therefore amounted to quite small changes in terms of family reunification rights (though the self-support requirement was expanded to apply to family formation cases involving Swedish citizens, EU citizens and people with more than four years of residence).|$|R
30|$|As {{asylum seekers}} kept {{arriving}} in record-high numbers, {{the sense of}} crisis grew in importance, pressing the government to find solutions. On 24 November, only {{a month after the}} six-party-agreement, the Social Democratic and Green Party coalition government announced a number of additional actions intended to limit the refugee flows (Government Offices of Sweden, 2015). One measure was to temporarily introduce ID checks at Sweden’s borders – these took effect on 4 January 2016. Further, the government explained that a temporary adjustment of the Swedish asylum policies to the “EU minimum” was needed in order “to limit the refugee flow and put pressure on other EU countries to take their share of the refugee burden.” This meant that most asylum seekers would only achieve time-limited residence: 3  years for Geneva Convention refugees, and 1  year for persons with alternative protection status (<b>quota</b> <b>refugees</b> would, however, continue to achieve permanent residence). Unlike the six-party-agreement, this initiative had drastic consequences for family reunification. Formulated to meet no more than the minimum requirements (as stipulated in the EU directive on family reunification), the right to rejoin with the close family was only to be granted to convention refugees (provided the application was turned in within 3  months after the asylum decision), and hence denied to those with alternative protection needs. Similarly, following the ambition to temporarily bring Swedish regulations in line with the more restrictive policies found in other EU countries, a reference person must not only be self-supporting, but also be able to financially maintain the incoming family member. <b>Quota</b> <b>refugees</b> and children were exempted from the support requirement, as were asylum seekers who had turned in their application prior to 24 November 2015, when the announcement of changes had been made. The proposal also involved an increase in the required minimum age for spousal reunification, from 18 to 21  years, but this was justified solely as a way to adjust Swedish regulations to the less liberal “EU minimum” (and is applicable only if the reference person is granted asylum under the new temporary law; Government bill, 2015 / 16 : 174 (2016)). Arguments about “civic maturity” or prevention of forced marriages have been conspicuous by their absence.|$|R

40|$|Migrant {{networks}} are usually regarded as helpful for {{the labor market}} integration of recently arrived immigrants. From a general assimilation perspective, however, it has been questioned whether they are really the right sort of ties to help immigrants succeed in the host society, or whether, instead, they constitute some sort of mobility trap. Empirical evidence from available studies is mixed, and a reference to more general social capital theory suggests that the effect might be contingent on the institutional context of the receiving country, the specific immigrant groups involved, and the particular types of jobs. In this paper, we study the impact of migrant networks on the labor market integration of recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union to Germany. This {{turns out to be}} a strategic test case, for both theoretical and methodological reasons. Relying on longitudinal data and using discrete event history models, we show that the findings are different for two distinguishable groups involved, Ethnic Germans and Jewish <b>Quota</b> <b>Refugees,</b> and that whether the effects are positive or negative further depends on whether or not these groups seek entry to higher-status jobs in the professional, managerial, or technical occupations...|$|R

40|$|Due to an {{increased}} flow of refugees {{over the past few}} years, affairs of refugees have caught increased attention. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the integration process of an earlier group of <b>quota</b> <b>refugees</b> who came to rural Iceland in 1998, from former Yugoslavia. Eighteen years have passed and the refugees’ views of entering and living in Icelandic society will help to understand the process of integration and the role of migration in an ever-changing social context and in times of rapid globalization. The study aims to explore two questions: 1) How did the life events of the refugees affect their integration processes? 2) How did transnational practices impact the integration processes? In-depth interviews were carried out and a life course perspective was the method used for obtaining the refugees’ stories and life experiences, and to investigate their integration processes. The analysis draws on the theories of integration, life course perspective, transnationalism and social networks. This study indicates that transnational practices are beneficial for the lifetime project of integration. Access to an extended social network of relatives and co-ethnics also plays a crucial role. Another important element for integration is the feeling of normal life, supported by a feeling of security in the physical, economic and institutional sense. ...|$|R
