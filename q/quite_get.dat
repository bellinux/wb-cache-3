25|$|Kent Spitfires {{demolished}} the Scottish Saltires {{at their}} home ground in a rain-haunted match. Winning the toss and bowling, Scotland did not <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> the wickets they wanted, the South African Martin van Jaarsveld top-scoring for Kent with 57 while Darren Stevens smashed 51 off 30 balls towards the end. Scotland's innings was frequently interrupted by rain and Darren Stevens' bowling - he took five for 32, his first career five-for, as Scotland crawled to 134 all out in 32.2 overs - 94 short of the adjusted target, coincidentally {{exactly the same as}} Kent had made, but shortened by seven overs.|$|E
500|$|I {{never did}} <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> all the {{organizational}} acronyms straight—YPSL, LID, SP, SDA, ISL—but the key words were [...] "democratic", [...] "labor", [...] "young" [...] and, until events redefined {{it away from}} their understanding, [...] "socialist". Ultimately, the umbrella group became [...] "Social Democrats, U.S.A", and Tom Kahn was a principal [...] "theoretician.|$|E
500|$|Geiger began skiing {{at the age}} of two in Austria, {{and made}} the {{national}} team in 2006. He won numerous Australian Championships during his teenage years, and represented Australia at the 2008 World Junior Alpine Skiing Championships and the 2009 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. This changed after his 2009 accident. [...] "I tried to get back to able bodied [...] but couldn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> back to where I was, let alone where I wanted to go," [...] he later explained, [...] "so I had to hang it up." ...|$|E

50|$|John Simon, {{a former}} double {{agent for the}} Network. He and Poe {{used to be in}} a relationship, and he has never <b>quite</b> <b>gotten</b> over that. He's a bit of a big brother to Raven but harbors a dislike for Gabe.|$|R
500|$|Nelson used an {{analogue}} 2-inch type tape in recording most of {{the tracks}} in the album. As recording progressed, [...] "Yellow" [...] {{was one of a}} couple of songs that they [...] "couldn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> on analogue". They recorded different versions but it did not satisfy their taste. So Nelson used Pro Tools [...] "to get the feel of [...] just right"; once all takes were recorded into the computer, [...] "we then put it down to the 2-inch, which I found was a great way to do it", according to Nelson.|$|E
500|$|Whedonesque {{was one of}} six fan {{websites}} {{featured in}} Click Critics: The Power of Fan Websites, held May 19, 2008 at The Paley Center for Media in New York. Other attendees included Lostpedia and Television Without Pity. The event highlighted six popular fan-run websites focused on current media. [...] One participant remarked that [...] "The Paley Center itself is trying {{kind of hard to}} figure out what this whole blogging thing is, and doesn’t <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> it, as evidenced by the fact that no urls appeared in the program for the event." ...|$|E
500|$|Agnew {{has been}} known to laugh at or include {{occasional}} sexual innuendo, while on air. The most notable of these occurrences took place in August 1991, when Agnew was commentating with Brian Johnston. In a review of the day, Johnston was describing how Ian Botham, while batting, had overbalanced and tried, but failed, to step over his stumps. Botham was consequently given out hit wicket. Agnew's comment on this action was: [...] "He just didn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> his leg over." [...] Botham had attracted a number of headlines during his career for his sexual exploits and in British English, [...] "" [...] is a euphemism for having sexual intercourse.|$|E
5000|$|Writing in Salon in 2010, Laura Miller noted, [...] "The {{awards are}} only 3 years old, but have already proved a fitting {{tribute to a}} writer who roamed freely over similar ground and has never <b>quite</b> <b>gotten</b> the respect she deserves." ...|$|R
60|$|Nathaniel and I used {{to stand}} by {{watching}} them, and wishing {{that we might be}} allowed to throw the line, but never <b>quite</b> <b>getting</b> up our courage to say so, knowing full well we should probably make a tangle of it.|$|R

500|$|Joe Rohde, the Imagineer {{in charge}} of {{building}} the attraction and Animal Kingdom, {{was asked about the}} yeti at the 2013 D23 Expo. Rohde responded [...] "You have to understand, it's a giant complicated machine sitting on top of, like, a 46-foot tall tower {{in the middle of a}} finished building. So, it's really hard to fix, but we are working on it. And we continue to work on it. We have tried several 'things', none of them <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> to the key, turning of the 40-foot tower inside of a finished building, but we are working on it... I will fix the Yeti someday, I swear." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode, like [...] "Aliens of London" [...] and [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", {{properly}} {{introduces the}} lead companion's family. Unlike the Tyler or Jones families, both Sylvia Noble and Wilfred Mott {{had met the}} Doctor before (in [...] "The Runaway Bride" [...] and [...] "Voyage of the Damned", respectively), providing Raynor with an additional subplot. Expository dialogue explains Mott's absence from [...] "The Runaway Bride" [...] by the character having had Spanish flu. Wilfred's positive opinion of the Doctor is different from Sylvia's, who, according to Tennant, joined [...] "a long line of mothers that don't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> the Doctor"; Davies had wanted a family member who trusted the Doctor since the show's revival.|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} was heard {{by thousands of}} commuters driving home from work, {{many of whom were}} forced to stop driving because they were laughing so much: a two-mile traffic jam {{at the entrance to the}} Dartford Tunnel was reportedly caused by drivers unable to pay the toll due to laughter. Fourteen years later, in 2005, Agnew's line, [...] "Just didn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> his leg over" [...] was voted [...] "the greatest sporting commentary of all time" [...] by listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live. The other eight finalists included Kenneth Wolstenholme's [...] "They think it's all over – it is now!" [...] and Ian Robertson's [...] "This is the one. He drops for World Cup glory... It's up! It's over! He's done it! Jonny Wilkinson is England's hero yet again". Agnew and Johnston secured 78% of the votes.|$|E
50|$|Freddy Merkle never {{finishes}} anything. He has a half-done painting, half {{a sculpture}} and a sonata he's been composing {{for quite a}} while. His girlfriend Ginny encourages him to finish something he starts, but Freddy, a delivery boy, never <b>quite</b> <b>gets</b> around to it.|$|R
50|$|Holmes {{fans and}} writers of Sherlockiana have speculated {{on the nature}} of the giant rat story for decades. The Firesign Theatre version seems to begin with Watson about to write the tale anyway since the pair are desperate for money, but he never <b>quite</b> <b>gets</b> around to telling it.|$|R
5000|$|The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a B, stating [...] "While I thought that last week's Family Guy was {{something}} of a return to form, this episode was closer to a modern Simpsons episode in certain ways—aping the form of the classics, while not <b>quite</b> <b>getting</b> it right. Still good—not great".|$|R
500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Daniel Lanois became disoriented {{with the}} {{direction}} U2 took [...] "Acrobat" [...] during its recording. Bono noted [...] "Daniel had {{such a hard time}} on that... {{he was trying to get}} us to play to our strengths and I didn't want to. I wanted to play to our weaknesses. I wanted to experiment." [...] Bono noted that the end product [...] "doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> off the ground the way I'd hoped it would." [...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby. The mix, titled [...] "'Baby' Acrobat", contained lyrics that were later modified to a different perspective ("You know I'd hit out if I only knew who to hit" [...] instead of the final [...] "I know you'd hit out if you only knew who to hit") or scrapped entirely ("If the sky turns to purple and the moon turns to blood / Will you dig me out when I'm face down in the mud").|$|E
500|$|Shadowrun {{has been}} {{positively}} recounted in many retrospective lists and articles. It was listed {{it as the}} 34th best SNES game by Super Play in 1996, {{as well as the}} 48th best game on any Nintendo platform by Nintendo Power in 1997. Ranking it as the 77th top SNES game in 2011, IGN commented that while Shadowrun [...] "didn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> away from all the common RPG stereotypes" [...] it was still [...] "a milestone for the introduction of film noir style into the gaming industry, though, so we can forgive the game for only being 90% groundbreaking." [...] The game was also cited as an important milestone in the use of film noir style in video games by Game Informer, according to which [...] "Shadowruns moody music and dark streets set the somber tone for this RPG's prying conversations and self-reflective narrative." [...] Game Informer also ranked Shadowrun as 125th place on their list of best video games of all time in 2009. IGN Australia listed Shadowrun among their favourite Australian video games in 2010, writing it was [...] "without question, one of the best underexposed classics of the SNES era" [...] because it presented players with [...] "a mature narrative, strong characters and a dystopian backdrop" [...] blended with traditional RPG elements in an [...] "irresistible" [...] way. That same year, 1UP.com included Shadowrun on their list of 15 games [...] "ahead of their time" [...] for its use of a keyword dialogue system, common to PC games but foreign to console games of the time.|$|E
50|$|A month later, on 13 April, Barbara was at Aalborg {{where she}} {{cut out of}} the {{anchorage}} a ship of 400 tons, two galliots, and a sloop, loaded with grain for the Norwegian market. She escaped with these prizes though nine Danish gunboats pursued her, fortunately never <b>quite</b> <b>getting</b> within range of their guns.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{retrospective}} review by AllMusic critic Rob Caldwell gave the album a star rating of 2 out of 5 (meaning [...] "Poor") and {{he stated that}} considering the stalwart guitarists featured on the album it's a [...] "song-oriented album" [...] and he also added that the album [...] "never <b>quite</b> <b>gets</b> off the ground." ...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewer Roger Ebert {{noted that}} the film's central core was as a [...] "beach film" [...] but that the director's vision was confusing. [...] "His problem, then, is that his {{insights}} keep interrupting the sex, and the sex keeps undermining the insights. The result is a movie that doesn't really work as semi-erotic romance, and never <b>quite</b> <b>gets</b> itself together as a character study." ...|$|R

2500|$|Being out hit-wicket {{is often}} seen as a comic method of dismissal. In 1991 Jonathan Agnew and Brian Johnston, {{commentators}} on BBC Radio's Test Match Special, got themselves into difficulty while commentating on Ian Botham's dismissal (Botham dislodged his leg bail whilst trying to step over the stumps, having lost his balance in missing a hook shot against Curtly Ambrose), Agnew commenting that he [...] "couldn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> his leg over".|$|E
2500|$|David Boies {{has agreed}} to {{represent}} SCO. I am trying to remind myself that our legal system is predicated on lawyers sometimes representing people they don't personally admire, and the system really does depend on someone being {{willing to take on}} unpopular clients. I know Boies doesn't use email, or at least he didn't the last time I checked. So maybe he doesn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> the tech ... ah, hang it all, there's no way around it: I feel bad he's chosen to represent them, especially after I posted an Ode singing his praises, and I hope he loses.|$|E

25|$|He {{began the}} year with a 42-match win streak, winning his first six events {{of the year and}} {{reaching}} his first French Open final, where his opponent was Ivan Lendl. McEnroe won the first two sets, but Lendl's adjustments of using more topspin lobs and cross-court backhand passing shots, as well as McEnroe's fatigue and temperamental outbursts, resulted in a demoralizing five-set loss. In his autobiography, McEnroe described this as his most bitter defeat and implied that he's never <b>quite</b> <b>gotten</b> over it.|$|R
2500|$|This {{fusion of}} {{influences}} was discernible in two black-and-white productions for BBC television in 1966: the series Adam Adamant Lives!, starring Gerald Harper as an Edwardian adventurer {{who had been}} cryopreserved in time and Juliet Harmer as Georgina Jones, a stylish [...] "mod" [...] who befriended him, and Jonathan Miller's dreamy, rather Gothic production of Lewis Carroll's mid-Victorian children's fantasy Alice in Wonderland (1865). (Confirming the aspiration, Sydney Newman, the BBC's Head of Television Drama in the 1960s, reflected of Adam Adamant that [...] " [...] could never <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> [...] Victorian mentality to contrast with the '60s".) ...|$|E
2500|$|Thayer was {{resourceful}} in his teaching, {{which he}} saw as a useful, inseparable part of his own studio work. Among his devoted apprentices were Rockwell Kent, Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Richard Meryman, Barry Faulkner (Thayer's cousin), Alexander and William James (the sons of Harvard philosopher William James), and Thayer's own son and daughter, Gerald and Gladys. He also had a profound influence on Dennis Miller Bunker, who, while not a formal pupil, was invited to paint alongside the older artist in 1886, and wrote [...] "Thayer's the first great man I ever knew, and I can't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> used to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Justin Speer scored it 3 out of 5. He too was {{critical}} {{of the connection between}} Story Mode and Mob Wars, and concluded [...] "it can't hold itself together well enough to deliver a really satisfying game experience." [...] Game Informers Andrew Reiner scored it 4.5 out of 10, stating [...] "Electronic Arts couldn't <b>quite</b> <b>get</b> The Godfather to run correctly on the PSP, but that didn't stop them from releasing it. Applying cement shoes to the experience, [...] stripped all of the open world gameplay from this version, leaving nothing but the lame missions and a putrid Risk-like minigame." ...|$|E
