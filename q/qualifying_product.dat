50|$|The {{compensation}} plan operates by {{the recruitment of}} customers by existing IRs.As per official spokesperson, {{even though there are}} no sign-up fees, a purchase might be required. This may be {{in the form of the}} sale of a <b>qualifying</b> <b>product</b> to a retail customer or by the new representative making a qualifying purchase to validate a Tracking Centre or a slot in the computer system of Qnet. An IR is provided an ID that gives access to a 'Tracking Centre' (TC) in its system that tracks sales. A TC has a left and right customer group. A 'direct' transaction (a customer's personal reference or sale) is counted as one transaction. An 'indirect transaction (someone in the customer's TC buys/refers/sells) is also counted as 1 transaction. The company pays $250 each time 3 product sales on an IR's left customer group are matched by 3 product sales on the right.|$|E
40|$|The European textile-apparel {{industry}} has recently undergone major changes, {{due to increased}} competition from low cost, emerging countries {{and changes in the}} international division of labour. Most companies have globalised their supply chains, either sourcing components from around the world, or moving manufacturing to East Europe or East Asia. This paper analyzes how the Italian textile {{industry has}} been trying to contain the effects of globalisation. Using a variety of data sources and on the basis of extensive field work, the paper offers some insights on possible strategies to remain competitive in such a global and mature industry: a) high <b>qualifying</b> <b>product</b> and service offer, guaranteeing quality, reactivity and innovation; b) outsourcing and global supply chain re-designing. The paper argues that only companies able to couple lean and agile supply chain structures, thus solving the trade-offs between the corresponding design and management principles, are likely to remain competitive in the futur...|$|E
