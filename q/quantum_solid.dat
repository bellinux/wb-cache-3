50|$|Building on this picture, {{as well as}} a 2000 {{article on}} time-correlated soliton tunneling, a more recent quantum model proposes Josephson-like {{coupling}} (see Josephson effect) between complex order parameters associated with nucleated droplets of charged soliton dislocations on many parallel chains. Following Richard Feynman in The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. III, Ch. 21, their time-evolution is described using the Schrödinger equation as an emergent classical equation. The narrow-band noise and related phenomena result from the periodic buildup of electrostatic charging energy and thus do not depend on the detailed shape of the washboard pinning potential. Both a soliton pair-creation threshold and a higher classical depinning field emerge from the model, which views the CDW as a sticky quantum fluid or deformable <b>quantum</b> <b>solid</b> with dislocations, a concept discussed by Philip Warren Anderson.|$|E

40|$|Field-effect {{transistors}} {{have been}} widely used to study electronic transport and doping in colloidal <b>quantum</b> dot <b>solids</b> to great effect. However, the full power of these devices to elucidate the electronic structure of materials has yet to be harnessed. Here, we deploy nanodielectric field-effect transistors to map the energy landscape within the band gap of a colloidal <b>quantum</b> dot <b>solid.</b> We exploit the self-limiting nature of the potentiostatic anodization growth mode to produce the thinnest usable gate dielectric, subject to our voltage breakdown requirements defined by the Fermi sweep range of interest. Lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots are applied as the active region and are treated with varying solvents and ligands. In an analysis complementary to the mobility trends commonly extracted from field-effect transistor studies, we focus instead on the subthreshold regime and map out the density of trap states in these nanocrystal films. The findings point to the importance of comprehensively mapping the electronic band- and gap-structure within real <b>quantum</b> <b>solids,</b> and they suggest a new focus in investigating <b>quantum</b> dot <b>solids</b> with an aim toward improving optoelectronic device performance. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|Colloidal <b>quantum</b> dot <b>solids</b> combine {{convenient}} solution-processing with quantum {{size effect}} tuning, offering avenues to high-efficiency multijunction cells {{based on a}} single materials synthesis and processing platform. The highest-performing colloidal quantum dot rectifying devices reported to date have relied on a junction between a quantum-tuned absorber and a bulk material (e. g., TiO 2); however, quantum tuning of the absorber then requires complete redesign of the bulk acceptor, compromising the benefits of facile quantum tuning. Here we report rectifying junctions constructed entirely using inherently band-aligned quantum-tuned materials. Realizing these quantum junction diodes relied upon {{the creation of an}} n-type <b>quantum</b> dot <b>solid</b> having a clean bandgap. We combine stable, chemically compatible, high-performance n-type and p-type materials to create the first quantum junction solar cells. We present a family of photovoltaic devices having widely tuned bandgaps of 0. 6 - 1. 6 eV that excel where conventional quantum-to-bulk devices fail to perform. Devices having optimal single-junction bandgaps exhibit certified AM 1. 5 solar power conversion efficiencies of 5. 4 %.

40|$|A Jastrow wave {{function}} (JWF) and a shadow {{wave function}} (SWF) describe a <b>quantum</b> <b>solid</b> with Bose [...] Einstein condensate; i. e. a supersolid. It {{is known that}} both JWF and SWF describe a <b>quantum</b> <b>solid</b> with also a finite equilibrium concentration of vacancies x_v. We outline a route for estimating x_v by exploiting the existing formal equivalence between the absolute square of the ground state wave function and the Boltzmann weight of a classical solid. We compute x_v for the quantum solids described by JWF and SWF employing very accurate numerical techniques. For JWF we find a very small value for the zero point vacancy concentration, x_v=(1. 4 ± 0. 1) x 10 ^- 6. For SWF, which presently gives the best variational description of solid 4 He, we find the significantly larger value x_v=(1. 4 ± 0. 1) x 10 ^- 3 at a density close to melting. We also study two and three vacancies. We find {{that there is a}} strong short range attraction but the vacancies do not form a bound state. Comment: 19 pages, submitted to J. Low Temp. Phy...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{symmetry}} principles {{play a crucial role in}} physics [1]. The theory of symmetry is a basic tool for understanding and formulating the fundamental notions of physics [2]. In the present work we focus on the applications of the sym-metry principles to <b>quantum</b> <b>solid</b> state theory. The development and applications of the method of quasiaverages, formulated by N. N. Bogoliubov, to quantum statistical mechanics and to <b>quantum</b> <b>solid</b> state theory and, in particular, to quantum theory of magnetism, are discussed. Some physical implications involved in a new concept, termed the quantum protectorate, are reviewed. In addition, the interrelation of the concepts of symmetry breaking [3, 4, 5, 6], quasiaverages and quantum protectorate are analyzed in the context of quantum theory of magnetism and BCS-Bogoliubov theory of superconductivity. The detailed analysis was carried out of the idea of quan-tum protectorate in the context of quantum theory of magnetism. This idea reveals the essential difference in the behaviour of the complex many-body systems at the low-energy and high-energy scales.
