Organizations can {{use a variety of}} competitive bidding methods including <b>requests</b> for <b>quotation,</b> <b>requests</b> for proposals, requests for information, requests for tender, request for solution or a request for partnership. Some institutions choose to use a notification service in order to raise the competition for the chosen opportunity. These systems can either be direct from their e-tendering software, or as a re-packaged notification from an external. During this step direct contact may be made with the suppliers. References for product/service quality are consulted, and any requirements for follow-up services including installation, maintenance, and warranty are investigated. Samples of the product/service being considered may be examined, or trials undertaken. Organizations should do a risk assessment, total cost of ownership analysis and best value assessment before selecting the final suppliers/solution.|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing {{companies}} are continuously faced with requirements regarding technology novelty, shorter time to market, {{a higher level}} of functionality, and lower prices for their products. This is especially true of suppliers that develop and manufacture highly customized products within the automotive industry. It is not uncommon that a request for a new product or subsystem goes out to several suppliers and that the one that can deliver the product most quickly and at the lowest price receives the contract. It is therefore vital for any supplier to answer to <b>quotation</b> <b>requests</b> rapidly and {{with a high level of}} precision while also ensuring that company assets are used efficiently. Other issues that apply to suppliers in the automotive industry are heavily fluctuating requirements during development projects, each customer’s individual preferences, and the ever changing interfaces with the OEM product with which the supplier’s product is to be integrated. Platform strategies have been widely accepted in industry to serve a wide product variety while maintaining business efficiency. However, the challenge of applying a platform strategy at the supplier level in the face of the reality described above has not been fully investigated. Platform approaches tend to require a focused development of the platform, which in turn requires some knowledge about which future variants are to be derived from the platform. The research presented in this thesis investigates the state of practice in industry regarding the challenges, needs, and current use of platforms. To respond to the identified need, a platform approach is proposed that expands the scope of what a product platform has traditionally contained. This is undertaken to aid in the development of highly customized products when physical modules or component scalability does not suffice. The platform approach provides a coherent environment for heterogeneous design assets to be used in product development, supporting both the activity of designing and off-the-shelf solutions. The approach is based on identifying and modelling generic product items that are associated with descriptions governing their design. By describing the outcome of technology and product development like finished designs, design guidelines, constraints, etc., in a standardized format, the platform continues to evolve. To aid in using the platform approach, a support system called Design Platform Manager is introduced at a company active as a secondtier supplier in the automotive industry. The system enables the creation of generic product items that can be structured, instantiated, and associated with descriptions, which aids in realizing product variants. The aim of the platform approach and tool is to support the quotation and continued design processes by identifying valid knowledge to use as circumstances, such as requirement changes or new design iterations, warrant. The support tool and overarching model have been evaluated by company representatives, who reported good results...|$|R
40|$|Negotiation in {{traditional}} commerce {{is a complex}} communication process. Research in negotiation support for electronic commerce has focused on new negotiation protocols such as auctions. However, for peer-to-peer negotiations in business-to-business electronic commerce such protocols are inappropriate. In this paper we present a novel approach to the effective support of electronic negotiations. Existing negotiation processes {{in traditional}} commerce are analysed {{to find out about}} negotiation patterns and to anticipate potential problems. Our aim is to exploit the potential of information technology to overcome (most of) these problems for electronic negotiations. Electronic negotiations between business partners involve the exchanges of documents and messages. Documents are contracts which evolve during the negotiations. The evolution is coordinated through the exchange of structured messages such as offers, <b>requests,</b> <b>quotations,</b> counteroffers, and acceptances. In contrast to the current practice of separate management of messages and documents, we propose a powerful framework for effective negotiation support in electronic commerce by combining communication and document management. ...|$|R
50|$|While {{the costs}} of {{development}} were shared half-and-half between Westland and the government, the firm determined that it would still need to contribute a further £9 million in order to complete development and achieve production-ready status. Following the issuing of a <b>requested</b> <b>quotation</b> to the British government for 18 production Rotodynes, 12 for the RAF and 6 for BEA, the government responded that no further support would be issued for the project due to economic reasons. Accordingly, on 26 February 1962, official funding for the Rotodyne was terminated in early 1962. The project's final end came when BEA chose to decline on placing its own order for the Rotodyne, principally due to its concerns regarding the high-profile tip-jet noise issue. The corporate management at Westland determined that further development of the Rotodyne towards production status would not be worth the investment required. Thus ended all work on the world's first vertical take-off military/civil transport rotorcraft.|$|R
40|$|In {{recognising}} {{the relevance}} of production networks and flexible manufacturing, CNC Worknet aims to be a company that approaches the new era of flexible manufacturing by developing a novel business model that combines the technologies of e-Business with production networks. This business model {{is based on an}} Internet portal that acts as an intermediary between the company and its customers. It allows customers to <b>request</b> <b>quotations</b> and place orders for the manufacture of simple products that are produced on CNC machining centres or through layered manufacturing techniques. The Internet portal is connected to a coordinated network of manufacturing plants in which the ordered products are manufactured. These manufacturing plants operate within a franchise model. CNC Worknet aims to provide the customer access to a univocal, direct and easily accessible global manufacturing network that consistently manufactures products according to the needs and specifications of the customer. This research aims to enable CNC Worknet to successfully implement and industrialise the theory in the business model. The overall goal is to establish a supply chain that adheres to the business model as effective and efficient as possible. A generic and modular architecture is developed that acts as a guideline for {{the development and implementation of}} a generic manufacturing system. A system based on this architecture is proposed that closes the gap between theory and practice for the distributed manufacturing of products in small batches. This system and many of its functional and operational constituents have been devised, elaborated and have subsequently been implemented in two cases; milling and layered manufacturing. The system derives its strength from the integration of quality and workflow management as these play a central role in all processes in the manufacturing system. This leads to a manufacturing environment that is focussed on both the quality of the product and the quality of the processes throughout the entire supply chain...|$|R

What is this charge that the Judge thinks I must have a very corrupt heart to make? It was a purpose {{on the part of}} certain high functionaries to make it {{impossible}} for the people of one State to prohibit the people of any other State from entering it with their [...] "property," [...] so called, and making it a slave State. In other words, it was a charge implying a design to make the institution of slavery national. And now I ask your attention to what Judge Douglas has himself done here. I know he made that part of the speech as a reason why he had refused to vote for a certain man for public printer; but when we get at it, the charge itself is the very one I made against him, that he thinks I am so corrupt for uttering. Now, whom does he make that charge against? Does he make it against that newspaper editor merely? No; he says it is identical in spirit with the Lecompton Constitution, and so the framers of that Constitution are brought in with the editor of the newspaper in that [...] "fatal blow being struck." [...] He did not call it a [...] "conspiracy." [...] In his language, it is a [...] "fatal blow being struck." [...] And if the words carry the meaning better when changed from a [...] "conspiracy" [...] into a [...] "fatal blow being struck," [...] I will change my expression, and call it [...] "fatal blow being struck." [...] We see the charge made not merely against the editor of the Union, but all the framers of the Lecompton Constitution; and not only so, but the article was an authoritative article. By whose authority? Is there any question but he means it was by the authority of the President and his Cabinet,--the Administration? ...|$|R
