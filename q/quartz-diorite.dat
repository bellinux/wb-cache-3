5000|$|Diorite (...) is an {{intrusive}} {{igneous rock}} composed principally of the silicate minerals plagioclase feldspar (typically andesine), biotite, hornblende, and/or pyroxene. The chemical composition of diorite is intermediate, between that of mafic gabbro and felsic granite. Diorite is usually grey to dark-grey in colour, {{but it can}} also be black or bluish-grey, and frequently has a greenish cast. It is distinguished from gabbro on the basis of the composition of the plagioclase species; the plagioclase in diorite is richer in sodium and poorer in calcium. Diorite may contain small amounts of quartz, microcline, and olivine. Zircon, apatite, titanite, magnetite, ilmenite, and sulfides occur as accessory minerals. Minor amounts of muscovite may also be present. Varieties deficient in hornblende and other dark minerals are called leucodiorite. When olivine and more iron-rich augite are present, the rock grades into ferrodiorite, which is transitional to gabbro. The presence of significant quartz makes the rock type <b>quartz-diorite</b> (>5% quartz) or tonalite (>20% quartz), and if orthoclase (potassium feldspar) is present at greater than 10 percent, the rock type grades into monzodiorite or granodiorite. A dioritic rock containing feldspathoid mineral/s and no quartz is termed foid-bearing diorite or foid diorite according to content.|$|E

40|$|The {{relation}} between orogenic movements and metamorphism is discussed. Schistosity and especially lineations are characteristic for metamorphites of the synkinematic phase. Lineations show a regular pattern. Late-kinematic metamorphism accompanied by {{different kinds of}} movement result in irregular rock flowage and rheomorphism. The structures of synkinematic mica-schists, gneisses, amphibolites and marbles are discussed. In the three satellite massifs a series of gneisses and granitic rocks exists which are the products of silica and sodium metasomatism of originally pelitic rocks. The time and duration of the metamorphism determines the final state of the rocks. Synkinematic metamorphism alone {{gave rise to the}} garnet-augen-gneisses which, being rather dry, can be classified in the granulite facies. The lower part of these augen-gneisses are converted into schistose (not linear) gneisses and granites by post-kinematic feldspathisation. At the same time many anhydrous minerals are replaced by hydrous ones. Late-kinematic feldspathisation without a preceding synkinematic feldspar phase, leads to the formation of migmatites (sillimanitegneisses), and by continuing metamorphism to <b>quartz-diorites.</b> The transitional rocks between the garnet-augen-gneisses and the migmatites are the granitic biotite-muscovite-gneisses. Rheomorphism and mobilization of tho <b>quartz-diorites</b> is an important feature and probably leads finally to the intrusive biotite-granodiorites. The muscovite-granites and gneisses which in part are also synkinematic, show a strong late phase of microclinization, due to potash metasomatism, originating from the underlying migmatites. In the mica-schists also, a syn- and post-kinematic phase of metamorphism can be detected. The biotite-granodiorites show a different texture compared with the <b>quartz-diorites</b> of the migmatite-series. Their age is younger than the last phase of metamorphism, since the biotite-granodiorites did not participate in a late stage of muscovitisation, which is characteristic for most of the metamorphic rocks. These granodiorites are considered as intrusive magmatic bodies, originating from deeper levels, where continuing rheomorphism has lead to complete liquefaction. Chemical analyses showed that the migmatites and the basal gneisses are enriched in silica, sodium and some calcium. Aluminium, iron, some magnesium, and titanium are removed. The <b>quartz-diorites</b> lost part of their potash. The muscovite-granites and gneisses show a strong enrichment in silica, sodium and potash. Aluminium, iron and magnesium are expelled. Characteristic for the synkinematic phase is abundance of anhydrous minerals which suggest metasomatism in a dry state. Post-kinematic metasomatism goes together with introduction of water. The behaviour of water is considered to be responsible for the structural difference between syn- and post-kinematic rocks. Finally the repartition of the various gneisses in the three satellite massifs is discussed...|$|R

40|$|In the {{introduction}} the criteria are mentioned which {{enable us to}} distinguish {{the products of the}} synkinematic and post-kinematic phases of the Hercynian metamorphism. A short characteristic has been given of the Silurian and Cambro-Ordovician rocks. The mica-schists, discussed in Chapter I, are exposed in the southeastern, central and northern parts of the mapped area. The grade of metamorphism increases from north to south in this rock-series. A biotite-, an andalusiteand a sillimanite zone can be distinguished. The biotite- and andalusite zones originated during the synkinematic phase. However, the sillimanite of the mica-schists is thought to be post-kinematic. There are indications that the rocks of the sillimanite zone have undergone high-grade metamorphism. In the low-grade biotite-muscovite-schists a marble layer occurs with biotite-gneiss bands, containing fairly basic plagioclase. Three varieties of synkinematic gneiss are distinguished: A) Sillimanitegneisses (migmatites), B) quartz-dioritic gneisses and C) homogeneous biotite-gneisses. The migmatites predominate in a 200 m thick zone which is located structurally below the mica-schists. The migmatization (both lit-par-lit replacement and metamorphic differentiation probably were involved) appears to be late- to post-kinematic. Nearly all the sillimanite, however, is postkinematic. The quartz-dioritic gneisses are supposed to have been formed by a selective sodium metasomatism of lime-bearing pelites. The biotite-gneisses possibly originated from semipelitic or pelitic rocks by sodium metasomatism. The <b>quartz-diorites</b> which occur structurally below the zone of migmatites, mentioned above, occupy most of the area in the north-eastern and southeastern parts of the region investigated. In most cases it was clear that these rocks were formed by rheomorphism at the expense of migmatites. On the other hand, static recrystallization of homogeneous biotite-gneisses may also result in the formation of <b>quartz-diorites.</b> The field observations show that rheomorphism took place on a regional scale in the Trois Seigneurs massif. Nowhere do the <b>quartz-diorites</b> break through the sillimanite-gneiss zone, which forms a continuous envelope around these rocks. Numerous relics of the pre-existing rock series are still recognizable in the autochthonous quartzdiorites. The resisters (Chapter IV) occur as conformable layers or lenses in the synkinematic gneisses. These lenses and layers have been broken into many pieces, due to the flow movements in the rheomorphic <b>quartz-diorites.</b> A series of rock types of sedimentary origin (part I) could be distinguished: magnesian and non-magnesian marbles and lime-silicate rocks, hornblende and biotite-bytownite-gneisses (presumably original marls) and quartzites. They may be intercalated, and usually show a typical sedimentary banding. Transitions between the three different types have been observed. Another group of resisters (part II) show characteristics which indicate that they are of igneous origin. The quartz-gabbros (part III) probably originated at the expense of amphibolites through an extreme static recrystallization. In the registers a synkinematic paragenesis can be distinguished which can be placed in the amphibolite facies. The following minerals: diopside, clinopyroxene, grossularite, wollastonite, forsterite, spinel, calcic plagioclase and green hornblende characterize this paragenesis. Furthermore a high-grade post-kinematic association is present which contains, among others: cummingtonite, light green amphibole, pargasite, cordierite (?), anthophyllite (?), and bytownite. During the post-kinematic phase the green hornblende of the hornblende-bytownite-gneisses apparently remained stable as did the clinopyroxene, grossularite and basic plagioclase of the lime-silicate rocks. In association with late cross-cutting pegmatites a low-grade paragenesis occurs: sericite, pennine, epidote, clinozoisite, prehnite, actinolite and albite. It was not possible to establish, whether the tremolite, epidote and clinozoisite of the lime-silicate rocks originated in association with pegmatites, or {{as a result of the}} cooling in the rock series during the latest stages of the metamorphism. In general the resisters probably underwent an isochemical metamorphism. Sills or cross-cutting dykes of pegmatite and leucocratic granitic rocks (Chapter V) are of frequent occurrence in the gneisses of the Trois Seigneurs massif. They originated during many different stages of the Hercynian metamorphism. In the <b>quartz-diorites</b> the early sills reacted as plastic bodies during the stage of rheomorphism and preserved their original parallel position. The muscovite-granite of the Pic d’Estibat is located close above the migmatite boundary. The biotite-muscovite granite of la Ruse (Chapter VI) is possibly intrusive and perhaps originated at the expense of a concentration of pegmatites and leucocratic granites which, as a rule, occur near the migmatite boundary. The biotite-granodiorite of the Pic des Trois Seigneurs is described in Chapter VII. Its intrusive character is clear, mainly from evidence of shouldering aside the enclosing rocks. It is suggested that the original magma of the granodiorite originated at the expense of autochthonous gneisses and quartzdiorites which have become intrusive. There are indications that the granodiorite body narrows downward and that the connection with the autochthonous rocks has more or less been lost. Bodies of chlorite-albite rock (Chapter VIII) occur in many places in the gneisses and <b>quartz-diorites</b> of the mapped area, but also in the biotite-granodiorite of the Pic des Trois Seigneurs, and even in the micaschists. It could be proved that these rocks were formed through a strong sodium metasomatism under hydrothermal conditions. Especially in the field, the original appearance of the pre-existing rocks has been well preserved. Small lenses of chloritite frequently occur in the chlorite-albite rocks. They are original basic resisters. These rocks appear to be later than the late-Hercynian cross-cutting pegmatites. The age of the chlorite-albite rocks could not yet be determined. Possibly they are associated with the late-Hercynian period of faulting or with the Alpine orogeny. The influence of chloritization and albitization is also clear in gneisses and <b>quartz-diorites</b> near important fault zones. The structural relations of the Trois Seigneurs massif with respect to the surrounding mesozoic rocks and the axial zone of the Pyrenees are discussed in the last chapter...|$|R

This intrusion has a quartz-dioritic composition, with plagioclase, quartz, amphibole(hornblende, but locally also cummingtonite) and biotite as the main mineral phases. Mafic microgranular enclaves in the <b>quartz–diorite</b> show the same minerals as the host, but with a greater abundance of amphibole and lower proportions of felsic minerals, especially quartz. U–Pb zircon ages obtained in one sample of the <b>quartz–diorite</b> and one sample of a mafic microgranular enclave gave identical ages, within error, of ca. 337 Ma. Geochemical data show that the <b>quartz–diorite</b> has a calc-alkaline signature with moderate enrichment in LILE/HFSE ratio (ThN/YN: 2. 71 – 11. 43) and clear negative Ti and Nb–Ta anomalies (ThN/NbN: 1. 33 – 6. 22). The composition of the enclaves shows {{that they do not}} represent direct melt compositions. Instead, their geochemical features (namely the abundances of Fe andMn in variation diagrams and REE patterns in primitive mantle normalized diagrams) suggest that they correspond to mineral clustering formed during the previous crystallization stage of quartz-dioritic magma. Overlapping of mineral chemistry and Sr–Nd isotope compositions in the <b>quartz–diorite</b> and the enclaves provides further support to that conclusion.

This isotope composition may be explained either by differentiation of a mafic magma extracted from a mantle wedge enriched by long lasting subduction processes, or by mixing between a mafic magma from a depleted mantle source and a crustal melt.

40|$|Abstract: The Late Cretaceous Silistar {{intrusion}} comprises of gabbros, gabbro-diorites to <b>quartz-diorites</b> and aplites, {{that were}} emplaced into a volcano-sedimentary succession of similar age. Structural {{data suggest that}} this intrusion {{is part of a}} larger, partially exposed body. A dense network of primary and secondary joints, in many places filled with various ore and gangue minerals, is a conspicuous feature of the intrusion. Hydrothermal alteration affecting the intrusion and the wall rocks includes: uralitization (amphibole–epidote), secondary biotitization and propylitization. Propylitic alteration occurred in two stages: high temperature (epidote-actinolite-chlorite) and middle to low temperature (sericite-chlorite-carbonate-epidote and chlorite-sericite-carbonate). Products of later alteration events include quartz-adularia, quartz-carbonate, carbonate, quartz-zeolites and zeolites. Apart from previously recognized contact-metasomatic mineralization, the presence of stockwork-type and disseminated pyrite and chalcopyrite mineralization, hosted by both the intrusion and the host rocks, is documented here. Two types of magnetite and pyrite (magmatic and metasomatic) are recognized. Based upon the alteration products and ore minerals, the presence of two differing zones is suggested. The first zone, which closely coincides with the intrusion, is potassic and hosts py-ma-cpy-hm-(ilm). The second zone is propylitic with py-ma-cpy-hm-(ilm) +(sph+ga) +(bo+hz).

They belong to the high-K calc-alkaline series, having features of typical Andean-type cordilleran granitoids. Trace and rare-earth elements distribution patterns for the Astaneh rocks indicate a distinctive depletion in Nb, Sr, Ba, P and Ti relative to other trace elements and a greater enrichment in LILE compared to HFSE. These geochemical characteristics suggest the participation of an important recycled (sedimentary?) component in the source region of the granitoids. They have Sr initial isotopic ratios in the range 0. 7078 – 0. 7084 and negative eNd values of 5. 39 to 6. 13 for a time of generation of 170 Ma.

The minerals and textural features (kink, decussate and foliated textures) of the <b>quartz-diorite</b> reveal that it was subjected to deformation and thermal metamorphism. The Rutig Volcanics and <b>quartz-diorite</b> represent subduction related I-type magma, generated from anatexis of older crust with contribu-tion of mantle-wedge magma. The quartz-monzonite and monzogranite are evolved from hybrid magma due to injection of the partly crystallized granitic magma by more basic melts. The mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of these granites indicate a mildly alkaline character and belonging to transitional magma type on the borderline between the calc-alkaline and alkaline magma. The mafic microgranular enclaves (MME) in the quartz-monzonite and monzogranite represent cooled globules from a dioritic magma mingled with the partly crystalline granitic magma. The association of rapakivi texture with the MME confirms the genetic link between the rapakivi texture and magma mixing. The overall characteristics of the Katherina Volcanics and A-type granite are consistent with within-plate tectonic setting.

The trace elements and Sr–Nd isotopic composition suggest that the granitoids from the AGC are similar to crustal derived I-type granitoids of continental arcs. The whole rock suite was produced by assimilation and fractional crystallization starting from a melt with intermediate composition likely possessing a mantle component. In situ zircon U–Pb data on the granites with LA-ICP-MS yield a crystallization age of 165 Ma.

40|$|Approximately 90 % of {{the upper}} crust exposed in {{southern}} Jordan is composed of intrusive rocks of latest Neoproterozoic age, grouped into two major subdivisions: the Aqaba (600 – 640 Ma) and the Araba (560 – 600 Ma) complexes. The Aqaba complex comprises several suites that range in composition from gabbro to high silica granite (45 – 80 % SiO 2) and follow a high-K calc-alkaline trend. This phase, which started with the emplacement of the Duheila Hornblendic Suite between 640 and 600 Ma, represents the main crust-forming stage in southwest Jordan. The Araba complex is a bimodal alkali-calcic to alkali igneous suite generated after development of a regional unconformity and deposition of the Saramuj Conglomerate. Mafic members of the Aqaba complex, the Duheila Hornblendic Suite, are enriched in LILE relative to the HFSE and are moderately enriched in REE [(La/Lu) n = 5 – 11], traits typical of arc basalts. Geochemical modeling suggests derivation by 10 – 15 % melting of amphibole-bearing spinel lherzolite, possibly above a subduction zone. The granitoids of the Aqaba complex are high in Ba, Sr and LREE, have low Y and have steep REE patterns [(La/Lu) n = 20 – 25]. They have low initial 87 Sr / 86 Sr (∼ 0. 70305) and high εNd values (+ 2. 3 to + 5. 0).

These plutons form the wall rock to the Burns Bluff tonalite-granodiorite pluton, the youngest component of the complex. The Burns Bluff pluton comprises tonalite-granodiorite sheets which, at the plutons margins, are interleaved with screens of mylonite wall rock. The Moore Point hornblende gabbro has ϵNd 141 of ca. + 4 and ϵSr 141 of ca. + 1. It is predominantly mantle in origin, although its parent magma assimilated some continental crust during emplacement. The Creswick Gap pluton has ϵNd 141 between ca. + 4 (<b>quartz-diorite)</b> and ca. − 1 (granodiorite) and ϵSr 141 from ca. − 1 (<b>quartz-diorite)</b> to ca. + 22 (granodiorite). This pluton contains both mantle and crustal components. We suggest that the <b>quartz-diorite</b> facies fractionated from a similar parent magma {{to that of the}} Moore Point gabbro, whilst the granodiorite fractionated from a gabbro-quartz-diorite magma during continued crustal assimilation. Geochemical variations within the Creswick Gap pluton cannot be generated by AFC models. Some of the granodiorite samples have chemical characteristics which typify partial melts of amphibole ± garnet-bearing crust. We conclude that the pluton comprises fractionates of basaltic magma and crustal partial melt. The Burns Bluff tonalite-granodiorite sheets have ϵNd 141 between ca. + 4 and ca. − 2 and ϵSr 141 from ca. + 5 to ca. + 31. Their isotopic and chemical compositions suggest that some are fractionates of basalt-gabbro magma, others are predominantly partial melts of amphibole ± garnet-bearing crust, and some are mixtures of these two magma types. The chemical and isotopic compositions of the Burns Bluff plutons constituent tonalite sheets and its dyke-like internal structure suggest that it grew incrementally via the addition of melt batches from a variety of crustal and mantle sources. The growth of this pluton, via dyking, may reflect magma pulsing associated with transtensional movement along the Creswick Gap shear zone.

40|$|The Tanzawa mountainland {{consists}} of a pyroclastic complex chiefly of basic composition which is intruded by a large mass of <b>quartz-diorite</b> at the center. This complex, well-known as the Misaka series, is the products of largescale geosynclinal volcanisms which {{took place during the}} period from the latest Oligocene to the middle Miocene in age. As compared with other geologic units, the present complex is characterized by its unusually thick accumulation of pyroclastic rocks, and by the intense hydrothermal alteration of the rocks, furnishing us an excellent section of the so-called green tuff series in the southeastern region of the Fossa Magna. Also the development of the products of interesting metamorphism of the <b>quartz-diorite</b> to the surrounding pyroclastic rocks is a feature uncommon in the other green tuff series of the above region. The crustal movement occurring during the volcanisms, however, make the structure of this complex highly complicate. In addition, the topographically unfavourable condition of this mountainland causes great hindrance to the geological investigation of this complex. Accordingly, the true natures of the complex remain unknown both stratigraphically and petrographically. Since 1948, the writer has been studying on the complex distributed in the eastern region of the Tanzawa massif from the volcano-stratigraphical point of view, some of the results of which have been published as miscellaneous reports. The main scope {{of this paper is to}} describe the stratigraphy, petrography, and the tectonic history of this complex.

40|$|The {{following}} paper {{describes the}} geology of the Last Coachella Tunnel of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. This tunnel extends {{along the southern}} flank of the Little San Bernardino Mountains, in Riverside county, California. Four rock types were encountered in the excavation of the tunnel: a regionally metamorphosed series of schists and gneisses of sedimentary origin, here called the Berdoo series; granitoid rocks resulting from replacement, called the Thermal Canyon series; a grananitic intrusive called the Fargo granite; and bench gravels. The Berdoo series is divisible {{on the basis of}} lithology into three facies: a dark thin-bedded feldspathic and biotitic schist, a light gray feldspathic gneiss, and a medium gray coarse grained schist which is transitional between the first two. The Thermal Canyon series consist of massive granitoid rocks which are of the mineralogical composition and general aspect of <b>quartz-diorites.</b> 	 Between these two rock series occurs a transition zone of from 1000 to 6000 feet in width within which, as examined in the field, the sedimentary textures and structures which characterize the Berdoo series appear to gradually give way to the massive granitoid textures of the Thermal Canyon series. Petrographic studies reveal the existence of a zone of mineralogical gradation between the two series within which the assemblage which constitutes the Berdoo series gradually becomes replaced through recrystallization by that which constitutes the Thermal Canyon series. The minerals of the recrystallized assemblage are not conformable to definite surfaces such as bedding, but instead show the fortuitous orientation of an igneous rock. Also, the plagioclase feldspars of the recrystallized assemblage are slightly more calcic than those of the Berdoo series. Chemical analyses show that the composition of the two rock series is very nearly the same, excepting for a progressive increase in lime, and corresponding decreases in ferric iron and potassa with advancing recrystallization. The results of field, petrographic, and chemical methods of investigation thus indicate that the Thermal Canyon series rocks resulted trough recrystallization of a portion of the Berdoo series rocks. Ascending hot solutions and gases of magmatic origin are postulated as the actuating agencies in the recrystallization. The Fargo granite occurs as an intrusive stock in the east central portion of the area, and consists of a pinkish gray coarsely crystalline rock of about the mineralogical composition of a quartz-monzonite. The chief structural feature of the area is faulting, of which two systems are recognizable, one which trends easterly, and one which trends northerly. Two successive periods of domical uplift in the south-eastern portion of the area are postulated as causes for the faulting. The geological aspects of tunnel excavation, with especial reference to the influence of structure, are discussed briefly. ...|$|R
40|$|The Neoproterozoic tectonic {{development}} of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS) can be divided in three parts: 1) the oceanic stage; 2) the arc-accretion stage; 3) the extensional stage. Three key-areas in the Arabian-Nubian Shield, namely the Bi'r Umq Complex, The Tabalah and Tarj Complex and the Wadi Kid Complex, were studied {{in the framework of}} this research with the aim to investigate each of these three stages in detail. The Bi'r Umq Complex is part of the Bi'r Umq-Nakasib Suture that trends SE-NW. The ophiolite of the Bi'r Umq complex was formed at 830 Ma. D 1 structures resulted from SE-vergent thrusting on the Bi'r Umq Shear Zone (BUSZ). The D 1 -deformation phase was a result of NW-SE compression. The second phase, D 2, was marked by dextral strike-slip in the BUSZ. This phase resulted from WNW-ESE compression. The third phase, D 3, involved sinistral strike-slip shear reversal on the BUSZ and resulted from NNE-SSW compression. Deformation in the Bi'r Umq Complex (BUC) occurred during obduction of the Bi'r Umq ophiolite and ended at 760 Ma. The changes of movement on the shear zones of the BUC were related to a change in the direction of motion of the subducting plate. The structural history in the region is associated with the closure of an oceanic basin by subduction and is relict of the “off-shore amalgamation” of a number of island-arcs in the Arabian shield. The Tabalah and Wadi Tarj Complex in {{the central part of the}} Asir Terrane in Saudi Arabia, displays typical intra-terrane features. The Tabalah and Wadi Tarj areas contain gabbros and <b>quartz-diorites,</b> which were intruded in an island arc. These rocks were deformed during D 1 and D 2. The D 1 -phase was characterized by thrusting. This phase was dated at 779 Ma and resulted from E-W to WNW-ESE compression. The D 2 -phase was characterized by dextral strike slip that resulted from NNE-SSW compression. This event was dated at 765 Ma. The deformation phases and late intrusions in the Tabalah and Wadi Tarj area are related to the “off-shore amalgamation” along NE-SW trending sutures. In the Wadi Kid Complex in the Sinai, Egypt, a sequence of sub-horizontal amphibolite HT/LP grade schists, was interpreted as low-angle normal shear zones which displayed top-to-the-NW movement and was associated with upper-crustal extension. The activity on the low-angle shear zone was dated at ~ 595 Ma. These geological features indicate that the Wadi Kid Complex represents a core complex. Published data show that the extension as observed in the Wadi Kid Complex, was pre-dated by a phase of arc-accretion at the N-S trending active continental margins of East- and West Gondwanaland at 700 - 650 Ma. During this phase, island-arcs and superterranes, accreted upon continental margins. In summary, the arc-accretion at the continental margins led to lithospheric thickening. When convergence slowed down, thermal re-equilibration led to a decrease of strength in the lithosphere. This led to the gravitational collapse of the thickened lithosphere and extension. The Neoproterozoic {{development of}} the ANS is similar to the Mesozoic {{development of the}} Cordillera in western North America...|$|R
40|$|Plagioclase {{crystal size}} {{distribution}} (CSD) {{has been investigated}} in a <b>quartz-diorite</b> body, in the leucosome of migmatites and in the melanosome of un-melted contact metamorphic rocks from Gennargentu Complex (Sardinia, Italy). During the crystallization of the dioritic magma, a variety of competing kinetic processes determine {{the evolution of the}} igneous microstructure, but the relative contribution of each process remains elusive. Our approach was aimed to study the plagioclase crystallization from a liquid (quartz-diorites and migmatite leucosomes), comparing it to a crystallization at subsolidus conditions. CSD indicates that plagioclase in the <b>quartz-diorite</b> nucleated and grew in a cooling system at a constant cooling rate, producing straight-line CSD in a diagram of ln of population density vs. size range. The plagioclase crystallization continued until the latent heat was available and the temperature was high enough to allow the plagioclase growing. This can occur only when a crystal is held at temperature close to its liquidus {{for a long period of}} time. Under these conditions, the plagioclase nucleation rate is zero, but growth rate is high for crystal larger than the critical size. This does not necessarily mean that the temperature was held constant, just that the undercooling remained small (Ostwald ripening process). The aggregated small crystals, due to their high surface energy per unit volume, to minimise energy in the system dissolved and“fed” the growth of larger crystals. This process occurs because small grains have a higher surface energy per unit volume than do larger grains. The crystallization temperature (~ 900 °C, 100 MPa) allows the formation of plagioclase as liquidus phase. From CSD measurements we calculated the different cooling ages for the different sample type...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. — The area studied {{is located}} in Northeast Anatolia between the Pontide and Tauride orogenic belts. The {{metamorphic}} rocks called Ağvanis Group are bounded {{to the north and}} south by faults of the North Anatolian Fault Zone; in the east and west they are unconformably overlain by sedimentary rocks of Eocene and younger age. The Ağvanis Group consists mainly of metabasic rocks with lesser amounts of marble, phyllite, metadacite and metaacidic plutonic rocks. The major metaacidic pluton is the Gökseki metatrondhjemite which forms a large sheet. Metamorphic and surrounding rocks are cut by hundreds of dacite sills, stocks and a <b>quartz-diorite</b> pluton related to Paleocene acid magmatism. The western part of the Ağvanis Group forms a WNW-ESE trending large anticlinorium whereas in the east N-S trending antiform and synforms, probably as part of older structural elements, are preserved. Metamorphic rocks of the Ağvanis Group have undergone regional metamorphism in greenschist facies; a contact metamorphism superim-posed on the regional metamorphism has developed around the <b>quartz-diorite</b> pluton. In terms of lithology, stratigraphy and type of metamorphism rocks of the Ağvanis Group resemble those of the Tokat Massif and probably constitute, like the Tokat Massif, the basement to the Pontide Mesozoic sequence. Hacıören Formation of Liassic age consisting of volcano-clastic sediments occurs {{to the north of the}} Ağvanis metamorphic rocks; whereas to the northeast of the Ağvanis metamorphic rocks there is the newly described Taşdemir Formation consisting of olistostromes of Paleocene age.
