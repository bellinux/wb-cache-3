5|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, Bowlby, in Attachment and Loss, volume one of Attachment (1969), {{makes it}} <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> infants {{become attached to}} carers who are sensitive and responsive in their social interactions with them and that this {{does not have to}} be the mother or indeed a female. As a matter of social reality mothers are more often the primary carers of children and therefore are more likely to be the primary attachment figure, but the process of attachment applies to any carer and infants develop a number of attachments according to who relates to them and the intensity of the engagement. However, attachment theory relates to the development of attachment behaviours and relationships after about 7 months of age and there are other theories and research relating to earlier carer–infant interactions.|$|E
25|$|The Krag–Petersson {{is often}} {{said to be a}} good rifle. By {{comparing}} it to the Remington M1867, which was the standard issue rifle in the Norwegian Army, as well as against the standard service rifles of Germany, France and the United Kingdom at the time, it is <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Krag–Petersson suffered from having been designed for an outdated cartridge.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} {{does not appear}} quite {{definitely}} expressed in Darwin's discussion {{of the development of}} mental powers, it seems <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection. This idea was also brought out very clearly by Wallace, who emphasized that apparently reasonable activities of man might very well have developed without an actual application of reasoning.|$|E

25|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) {{the fact that}} Wonder Woman {{had fallen in love}} with the first Steve Trevor, the {{producers}} chose to drop any suggestion that Steve Jr. and Wonder Woman were anything more than good friends. Indeed, when an impostor posing as Steve Jr. attempted to seduce Diana, she made it <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> she had no sexual interest in him. Executive producer Douglas S. Cramer noted the difficulties in maintaining long-term romantic tension between leads, because the resolution of that romantic tension often results in the cancellation of the series.|$|E
25|$|Though Jayewardene indeed did {{not take}} {{measures}} to stop the attack on Tamils, he was not opposed to them personally, only politically. One of his most esteemed friends was a supreme court judge of Tamil ethnicity, {{a member of an}} elite family and raised in Colombo, but who was strongly linked to his Jaffna Tamil heritage. This is but one close Tamil friend of the president's, and it is <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> he was not a racist but rather a man who knew how to exploit racism to win the majority.|$|E
25|$|It {{was long}} thought that Saluki type sighthounds were {{originally}} brought to Russia from Byzantium in the South about the 9th and 10th centuries and again {{later by the}} Mongol invaders from the East. However, now that the archeological archives and research results of the former USSR are open to scientists, it has become <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the primal sighthound type evolved between the Kyrgyzstan, the lower Kazakhstan part of Altai and the Afghan plains, and that the earliest actual sighthound breeds were the plains Afghan hounds and the Kyrgyz Taigan.|$|E

25|$|Chad {{was invited}} then to become {{bishop of the}} Northumbrians by King Oswiu. Chad is often listed as a Bishop of York. Bede {{generally}} uses ethnic, not geographical, designations for Chad and other early Anglo-Saxon bishops. However at this point, he does also refer to Oswiu's desire that Chad become bishop {{of the church in}} York. York later became the diocesan city partly because it had already been designated as such in the earlier Roman-sponsored mission of Paulinus to Deira, so {{it is not clear whether}} Bede is simply echoing the practice of his own day, or whether Oswiu and Chad were considering a territorial basis and a see for his episcopate. It is <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Oswiu intended Chad to be bishop over the entire Northumbrian people, over-riding the claims of both Wilfrid and Eata.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little story to tell. When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

I said I could not shoot Petacci, so John said he would shoot her himself, while making it <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Mussolini however, had to be killed by an Italian.|$|E

500|$|On 8 November, The Times {{newspaper}} {{published an}} article accusing Williams and McLaren of colluding to decide the finishing order {{at the end of}} the Grand Prix. The article's claims were based on recordings of the radio transmissions made by the two teams. The FIA World Council rejected the claims when the matter was brought before them. FIA president Max Mosley stated [...] "It is <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the result of the race was not fixed. There was no arrangement between McLaren and Williams that Mika Häkkinen was going to win. They were able to demonstrate very clearly that was not the case." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a 1978 {{essay by}} German {{historian}} Andreas Hillgruber, the invasion plans {{drawn up by}} the German military elite were coloured by hubris stemming from the rapid defeat of France {{at the hands of}} the [...] "invincible" [...] Wehrmacht and by ignorance tempered by traditional German stereotypes of Russia as a primitive, backward [...] "Asiatic" [...] country. Red Army soldiers were considered brave and tough, but the officer corps was held in contempt. The leadership of the Wehrmacht paid little attention to politics, culture and the considerable industrial capacity of the Soviet Union, in favour of a very narrow military view. Hillgruber argued that because these assumptions were shared by the entire military elite, Hitler was able to push through with a [...] "war of annihilation" [...] that would be waged in the most inhumane fashion possible with the complicity of [...] "several military leaders", even though it was <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> this would be in violation of all accepted norms of warfare.|$|E

5000|$|Cyril Vladimirovich's father, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, married Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, a Lutheran {{who did not}} {{convert to}} Orthodoxy until she was already widowed. The {{arguments}} regarding the objections to this marriage {{are similar to the}} arguments regarding the religious objections to Cyril Vladimirovich's marriage. It is <b>quite</b> <b>clear,</b> however, <b>that</b> Cyril and his brothers were considered throughout the life of the monarchy to be in the line of succession.|$|R
500|$|Other than {{mentioning}} that {{he carried a}} pocket chronometer by French which gave good results, Stokes' account of the voyage does not list or even enumerate the chronometers. [...] It may be that chronometers were now so commonplace that their use was no longer something of note. [...] However it is <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the chronometers remained {{a key part of}} the mission; frequent stops were made throughout the voyage to check the rates. On 7 December 1839 Stokes went ashore at Point Pearce near the mouth of Victoria River to make observations. Even though he knew the indigenous Australians could be dangerous, he left behind his gun to more safely carry a chronometer. [...] While separated, Stokes was pursued by a group of Australians, one of whom pierced Stokes' chest cavity with a spear throw. Despite his wounds and profuse bleeding, Stokes considered the chronometer to be valuable enough to save; he carried it while he staggered back to his comrades barely able to walk and still being pursued by his attackers.|$|E
500|$|While Creation {{were pleased}} with the final album, and the initial music press reviews were positive, the label soon {{realised}} that although, {{in the words of}} plugger James Kyllo, [...] "it was such a beautiful record, and it was wonderful to have it... it just didn't sound like a record that was going to recoup all the money that had been spent on it." [...] Alan McGee liked the record, but admitted, [...] "It was <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> we couldn't bear the idea of going through that again, because there was just nothing to say that [...] wouldn't do exactly the same again. That's enough. Lets step back". Despite a severe shortage of money, Creation funded a short tour of the north of England late in 1991. At the time the band were making the marketing of Loveless difficult—there would be no singles, and the band's name was forbidden to appear on the record sleeve. McGee was by now exhausted and frustrated. He recalled, [...] "I thought: I went to the wall for you. If this record bombs, I've stolen my father's money. And they were so...not understanding of anybody else's position." [...] McGee dropped My Bloody Valentine from Creation soon after the album's release because he could not bear working with Shields again; [...] "It was either him or me", he told The Guardian in 2004. Loveless peaked at number 24 on the UK Albums Chart, and failed to chart in the United States, where it was distributed by Sire Records. In 2003 Rolling Stone estimated the sales figures for Loveless as 225,000 copies sold.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2009 {{interview}} with Channel 4 News, Griffin claimed that [...] "There's {{no such thing}} as a black Welshman", which was criticised by Vaughan Gething, the first black president of the Welsh NUS and the Welsh TUC, and the first black candidate for the Welsh assembly. Commenting on Griffin's claim, he said [...] "On that basis, most white people wouldn't qualify. It's <b>quite</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Nick Griffin just doesn't accept that black British people or black Welsh people are entitled to call themselves proper, full citizens of the country." [...] Griffin's {{interview with}} Channel 4 News was in response to a decision by the Equality and Human Rights Commission to investigate the BNP's membership criteria, which, it stated, [...] "appeared to discriminate on the grounds of race and colour, contrary to the Race Relations Act." [...] He rejected claims that the BNP was [...] "acting unlawfully" [...] and said [...] "...because we are here, as it was pointed out, for specific ethnic groups—it's nothing to do with colour, your reporter there said that we'll only lift a finger for white people—that's a simple lie." [...] In an interview with the BBC on 8 July 2009, during a discussion on European immigration, he proposed that the EU should sink boats carrying illegal immigrants, to prevent them from entering Europe. Although the interviewer, BBC correspondent Shirin Wheeler, implied that Griffin may have wished the EU to [...] "murder people at sea", he quickly corrected her by saying [...] "I didn't say anyone should be murdered at sea—I say boats should be sunk, they can throw them a life raft and they can go back to Libya" [...] (a staging post for migrants from Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa).|$|E
