5|$|Oil spills {{present a}} {{localized}} threat to otter populations, especially in coastal areas. Water pollution and other diminution of aquatic and wetland habitats may limit distribution and pose long-term threats if {{the enforcement of}} water quality standards is not upheld. Acid drainage from coal mines is a persistent water <b>quality</b> <b>issue</b> in some areas, as it eliminates otter prey. This dilemma prevents, and consequently inhibits, recolonization or growth of otter populations. Recently, long-term genetic consequences of reintroduction projects on remnant otter populations has been discussed. Similarly, many perceived threats to otters, such as pollution and habitat alterations, have not been rigorously evaluated. Little effort has gone into assessing the threat of disease to wild river otter populations, so it is poorly understood and documented. River otters may be victims of canine distemper, rabies, respiratory tract disease, and urinary infection. In addition, North American river otters can contract jaundice, hepatitis, feline panleucopenia, and pneumonia. They host numerous endoparasites, such as nematodes, cestodes, trematodes, the sporozoan Isopora, and acanthocephalans. Ectoparasites include ticks, sucking lice(Latagophthirus rauschi), and fleas (Oropsylla arctomys).|$|E
25|$|Salinity {{is another}} {{important}} water <b>quality</b> <b>issue.</b> Drainage return flows to the Nile result {{in an increase in}} salinity of the water from 250 ppm (mg/l) at Aswan to 2,700 ppm at the Delta barrages. However, more salts are being discharged into the Mediterranean Sea than are entering at Aswan (see Irrigation for agriculture in Egypt) so {{that in the long run}} the salinity of the water at the Delta barrages could decrease. However, saline groundwater of marine origin enters the Delta through pumping of brackish water and upwelling in lakes and drains, thus counterbalancing this effect.|$|E

The central office purchases and distributes all ingredients to maintain the quality of the final product. For example, the urad dal is imported from Myanmar, asafetida is imported from Afghanistan, and black pepper comes from Kerala. The committee often makes surprise visits to various branches to assure that production conditions are hygienic. When a new branch of Lijjat opens, a neighbouring Lijjat branch helps it by guiding and training new members.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Even though {{considerable}} progress {{regarding the}} technical perspective on modeling and supporting business processes has been achieved, {{it appears that}} the human perspective is still often left aside. In particular, we do not have an in-depth understanding of how process models are inspected by humans, what strategies are taken, and what cognitive processes are involved. This paper takes a first step towards such an understanding and reports an exploratory study investigating how humans identify <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> in BPMN process models. Provid-ing preliminary answers to initial research questions, we also indicate other research questions that can be investigated using this approach. Our qualitative analysis shows that humans adapt different strategies on how to identify <b>quality</b> <b>issues.</b> Finally, we observed for different <b>quality</b> dimensions <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> that were spotted by a large number of subjects (e. g., deadlocks), but also <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> that did not seem to bother the participants of this study (e. g., line crossings) ...|$|R

40|$|Our work on Delta water <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> {{began in}} the summer of 1989 as part of {{reviewing}} the expected water quality in the Delta Wetlands in-Delta water storage reservoirs. In the spring 1999 we became involved in the San Joaquin River (SJR) Deep Water Ship Channel (DWSC) low-DO problem as a technical resource to the SJR DO TMDL Steering Committee. It was through this activity that we began to become familiar with SJR water <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> and the impacts of the SJR watershed water diversions and pollutants on Delta water quality. In 2000, with CALFED support, we became the coordinating PIs for a $ 2 -million project designed to investigate the impact of SJR watershed-derived chemicals on the SJR DWSC low-DO problem. This activity resulted in our developing a 2003 Synthesis Report of what was known about the cause of the DWSC low-DO problem and the sources of oxygen demand derived from the SJR DWSC watershed. Since the completion of the Synthesis Report, without support, we have continued to become familiar with CVRWQCB water quality management efforts in the SJR watershed. We have published a series of reports on SJR and Delta water <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> which are available on our website, www. gfredlee. com, in the Watershed Studies section, San Joaquin River Watershed Delta subsection. The report presented herein contains an Abstract, a Summary of water <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> and a more detailed discussion of water <b>quality</b> <b>issues,</b> with references to sources of information that provide additional discussions of these issues. It is an integration and synthesis of our reports and other information on SJR water <b>quality</b> <b>issues</b> and the impact of SJR watershed-derived constituents and water diversions on Delta water quality. It also updates the information on Delta water quality that was presented in our 2004 Delta Water <b>Quality</b> <b>Issues</b> report.
