The internal consistency, construct validity, convergent validity and discriminant validity of the Chinese version of SOC <b>questionnaire</b> were also established. The SOC <b>questionnaire</b> demonstrated acceptable internal consistency including the three subscales: Elective Selection subscale, Optimization subscale, and Compensation subscale. In terms of construct validity, the Chinese version of SOC <b>questionnaire</b> correlated negatively with depressive symptoms assessed by the Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D) scale. Moreover, the construct validity of the SOC <b>questionnaire</b> was demonstrated by the positive association between the SOC <b>questionnaire</b> and self esteem and life satisfaction.

25|$|Assessment of {{psychological}} processes related to tinnitus involves measurement of tinnitus severity and distress (i.e. {{nature and extent}} of tinnitus-related problems), measured subjectively by validated self-report tinnitus <b>questionnaires.</b> These <b>questionnaires</b> measure the degree {{of psychological}} distress and handicap associated with tinnitus, including effects on hearing, lifestyle, health and emotional functioning. A broader assessment of general functioning, such as levels of anxiety, depression, stress, life stressors and sleep difficulties, is also important in the assessment of tinnitus due to higher risk of negative well-being across these areas, which may be affected by and/or exacerbate the tinnitus symptoms for the individual. Overall, current assessment measures are aimed to identify individual levels of distress and interference, coping responses and perceptions of tinnitus in order to inform treatment and monitor progress. However, wide variability, inconsistencies and lack of consensus regarding assessment methodology are evidenced in the literature, limiting comparison of treatment effectiveness. Developed to guide diagnosis or classify severity, most tinnitus <b>questionnaires</b> have also been shown to be treatment-sensitive outcome measures.|$|E

We used {{data from a}} national volunteer cohort of young adult twins, who were scheduled for assessment by <b>questionnaire</b> in 1989 and by interview in 1996 - 2000, to identify predictors of <b>questionnaire</b> non-response. Out {{of a total of}} 8536 twins, 5058 completed the <b>questionnaire</b> survey (59 % response rate), and 6255 completed a telephone interview survey conducted a decade later (73 % response rate). Multinomial logit models were fitted to the interview data to identify socioeconomic, psychiatric and health behavior correlates of non-response in the earlier <b>questionnaire</b> survey. Male gender, education below University level, and being a dizygotic rather than monozygotic twin, all predicted reduced likelihood of participating in the <b>questionnaire</b> survey. Associations between <b>questionnaire</b> response status and psychiatric history and health behavior variables were modest, with history of alcohol dependence and childhood conduct disorder predicting decreased probability of returning a <b>questionnaire,</b> and history of smoking and heavy drinking more weakly associated with non-response. Body-mass index showed no association with <b>questionnaire</b> non-response. Despite a poor response rate to the self-report <b>questionnaire</b> survey, we found only limited sampling biases for most variables.
