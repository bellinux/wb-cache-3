50|$|On December 25, 1969, Seiko {{released}} the world’s first <b>quartz</b> <b>watch,</b> the Seiko <b>Quartz</b> ASTRON. The <b>watch</b> uses a <b>crystal</b> oscillator {{at its core}} for accuracy, where the crystal generate steady vibration when voltage is applied to it. During the ten years of development period at Suwa Seikosha, Seiko manage to create many parts which enabled viable application of quartz on wristwatch. For example, Seiko cut the crystal oscillator {{into the shape of}} a tuning-fork, developed integrated circuit and step motor to properly operate the signals from the crystal oscillator.Additional to creating the parts that enabled <b>quartz</b> <b>watch,</b> Seiko did not monopolize the patent rights for the unique pieces, but decided to open it.|$|R

Bulova ignored the growing trend and did not introduce a digital watch line until 1975, five years after its competitor, Pulsar. The company also failed {{to build on the}} Accutron technology. Bulova failed to successfully market the newer <b>quartz</b> <b>watch.</b> <b>Quartz</b> <b>watches</b> were battery-powered and used a vibrating quartz crystal instead of an internal tuning fork, like the Accutron.

40|$|Pierre Curie (1859 ^ 1906) had the {{creative}} curiosity {{of a great}} physicist. Distinguished for his discovery of piezoelectricity, now the heart of <b>quartz</b> <b>crystal</b> <b>watches</b> beating more regularly than Galileo's pendulum, he is known more reconditely for Curie's Principle of symmetries and asymmetries. His lasting fame is ensured from transmuting, by marriage, Marie Sk•odowska into Madame Curieödiscoverer, with Pierre's help, of the most curious of all the elements, radium. Pierre was {{professor of physics at}} the Sorbonne, his Chair going to Marie, when he died from an accident with a cart carrying military uniforms. Curie's Principle, may be stated: Symmetry cannot produce systematic asymmetry. Asymmetry can occur once-off. Thus a stone will break a window in a jagged irregular pattern, but, when repeated, the pattern will vary and on average will be symmetrical. Yet, and this is what I will discuss, some symmetrical illusion figures show asymmetrical distortions. Can illusions of perception flout such a basic principle of physics? The most familiar, though curiously seldom recognised, visual challenge to Curie's Principle is mirror-reflectionömirrors reversing right ^ left but not up ^ down. As a plan...|$|R
50|$|The {{introduction}} of the <b>quartz</b> <b>watch</b> was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, it used a quartz crystal resonator which vibrated at 8,192 Hz, driven by a battery-powered oscillator circuit. Since the 1980s, more <b>quartz</b> <b>watches</b> than mechanical ones have been marketed.|$|R

50|$|Tuning-fork watches use {{a type of}} {{electromechanical}} movement. Introduced by Bulova in 1960, {{they use}} a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 hertz) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. Tuning-fork watches were rendered obsolete when electronic <b>quartz</b> <b>watches</b> were developed. <b>Quartz</b> <b>watches</b> were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.|$|R
50|$|In 1978, Seiko {{released}} the Twin <b>Quartz</b> <b>watch</b> {{to address the}} impact of temperature on {{the frequency of the}} quartz crystal oscillator, which put a limitation on the accuracy of <b>quartz</b> <b>watch.</b> Seiko put a second <b>crystal</b> in the <b>watch</b> that's linked with a processor that detects the change in temperature and signals the main oscillator to compensate. The result was a huge improve in the watch’s accuracy from 5 seconds per month to 5 seconds per year.|$|R

50|$|Watches {{evolved in}} the 17th century from spring-powered clocks, which {{appeared}} {{as early as the}} 14th century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring, and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. In the 1960s the electronic <b>quartz</b> <b>watch</b> was invented, which was powered by a battery and kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the <b>quartz</b> <b>watch</b> had taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these {{dramatic}} advancements, the Swiss hesitated in embracing <b>quartz</b> <b>watches.</b> At the time, Swiss mechanical watches dominated world markets. In addition, {{excellence in}} watchmaking {{was a large}} component of Swiss national identity. From their position of market strength, and with a national watch industry organized broadly and deeply to foster mechanical watches, many in Switzerland thought that moving into electronic watches was unnecessary. Others outside of Switzerland, however, saw the advantage and further developed the technology, and by 1978 <b>quartz</b> <b>watches</b> overtook mechanical watches in popularity, plunging the Swiss watch industry into crisis {{while at the same}} time strengthening both the Japanese and American watch industries. This period of time was marked by a lack of innovation in Switzerland at the same time that the watch-making industries of other nations were taking full advantage of emerging technologies, specifically <b>quartz</b> <b>watch</b> technology, hence the term [...] "quartz crisis".|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, {{when the}} Swiss watch {{industry}} {{was in the middle of}} crisis, Japanese watchmakers invaded the world market with the <b>quartz</b> <b>watch.</b> Consequently, the Genevan brand Rolex decided to put forward a new line of watches to combat this event; thus, the Datejust Oysterquartz was born. Although not designed to turn the company’s tradition of producing mechanical watches upside down, it faced the international, namely Asian, markets seeking to keep alive interest in Swiss luxury watchmaking; an industry that seemed at that moment to have been completely absorbed by the Japanese <b>quartz</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|R
