5|$|Six months later, King Stewart {{learns that}} Redbush {{is gone and}} {{he makes his way}} to <b>Quahog</b> to reclaim his wife and kill Griffin Peterson. King Stewart's army arrives in <b>Quahog</b> where they terrorize the colony (similar to a scene from Blazing Saddles). King Stewart orders Cockney First Lieutenant (Chris) to search every house for them. Upon being {{discovered}} by the First Lieutenant, Griffin Peterson and Lady Redbush are confronted by King Stewart. Griffin Peterson threatens to kill the officer, while King Stewart threatens to kill Redbush. After exchanging threats without getting anywhere, Griffin and Stewart decide to settle their dispute with a talent show, with the winner winning Lady Redbush's hand in marriage, and ownership of the town of <b>Quahog.</b> For his act, King Stewart steals his jester's mostly unfunny jokes about his Aunt Frieda. However, Griffin, Quagmire, Joe, Cleveland, Mort, and Seamus effectively steal the show with a techno-rock number from Revenge of the Nerds. This was enough to defeat King Stewart in the talent show. After King Stewart and his army leaves, Griffin and Redbush remain in <b>Quahog</b> to live happily ever after.|$|E

The entire police force then comes after them, until they are able to jump on a train and arrive in <b>Quahog,</b> only to be met by the sheriff and his deputies. Joe, however, had called ahead and arranged for the <b>Quahog</b> police department to arrive and rescue them. Joe then smashes the sheriff's vehicle, shoots him in the leg, and demands he leave <b>Quahog.</b>|$|E

Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a parallel universe, he shows him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes.

40|$|Techniques are {{described}} for preparing acetate peels of sectioned valves of ocean <b>quahogs,</b> Arctica islandica, for age determinations.

5000|$|In {{many areas}} where {{aquaculture}} is important, clam farmers have bred specialized versions of these clams with distinctions needed {{for them to}} be distinguished in the marketplace. These are quite similar to common [...] "wild type" [...] Mercenaria clams, except that their shells bear distinctive markings; for example, those from Wellfleet, Massachusetts and elsewhere have pronounced wavy or zigzag chestnut-colored lines on their shells, reminiscent of a line of W's running across the shell. These are known as the notata strain of <b>quahogs,</b> which occur naturally in low numbers wherever <b>quahogs</b> are found.|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} if population density in areas closed to fishing in Narragansett Bay is causing {{differences in the}} reproductive potential of the organisms, this study used two approaches to determine the reproductive condition of the animals. The first approach consisted in employing a gravimetric condition index (CI) to evaluate the general condition of <b>quahogs</b> from nine different sites, 3 sites open conditionally for fishing (conditional areas) and 6 sites closed to fishing. The second approach was a determination of gonadal index (GI) of {{a subset of the}} sample sites, by histological observation of gonadal tissue sections. Initial sampling included determination of CI only, and lasted from March 25 to Sep. 22, 2005. The subset of six of the sites was sampled the next year (2006), every three weeks from April 15 until Sep. 28 to determine CI and the gonadal index (GI). Results show that there is {{a significant difference between the}} CI of northern <b>quahogs</b> from conditional areas and <b>quahogs</b> from closed areas (...|$|R
