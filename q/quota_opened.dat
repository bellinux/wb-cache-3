The present study aimed at revealing {{the current status of}} the employment and academic achievements of our physician and their attitude toward their job, in order to provide required information for the relevant authorities. Methods: In this descriptive cross-sectional study, an 8 -item questionnaire was developed including 7 closed as well as 1 open question. The list of {{the physicians}} who were graduated from the Medical School of Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences and Health Services (SBMU) from 1993 to 1997, was obtained from the Education Deputy of the University and Islamic Republic of Iran Medical Council. The questionnaires were then posted to the target group of physicians. The returned questionnaires were controlled and the related data was entered into the SPSS software. Results: Of all respondents, 356 (67. 3 %) were male and others were female; 363 (68. 4 %) were married; 260 (50. 8 %) had completed the military service, and others were exempted. One hundred ninety (55. 1 %) of the men and 103 (62 %) of the women had entered the university using <b>open</b> <b>quota.</b> Ninety four (61 %) of the single participants were dissatisfied with their jobs.

KingThis thesis addresses questions of identity and ontological legitimacywithin the commercial shark fishing community of Bass Strait,Australia. I consider the implications of competing discourses for theintegrity of fisher identity, environmental conservation and publicnarratives on environmental ‘crises’. I draw upon ethnographic materialdeveloped with commercial fishers and, to a lesser extent, fisheries‘experts’, to explore ambiguities in understandings of individuality andperceptions of the marine environment. Informing this analysis aretheories of practice, particularly notions of embodied relationships andknowledge, the role of ‘luck’ in enabling a particular expression of‘individuality’, the ‘skipper effect’, a consideration of nation-statesanctioned and popular media representations of the environment, andthe peculiarly Australian experience and representation of individuality,both as performance and as trope.

40|$|We {{consider}} an industry with firms that produce a final good emitting pollution to different degree {{as a side}} effect. Pollution is regulated by a tradable quota system where some quotas may have been allocated at the outset, i. e. before the <b>quota</b> market is <b>opened.</b> We study how volatility in quota price affects firm behaviour, {{taking into account the}} impact of quota price on final-good price. The impact on the individual firm differs depending on how polluting it is - whether it is `clean' or `dirty'- and whether it has been allocated quotas at the outset. In the absence of long-term or forward contracting, the optimal initial quota allocation turns out to resemble a grandfathering regime: clean firms are allocated no quotas - dirty firms are allocated quotas for a part of their emissions. With forward contracts {{and in the absence of}} wealth effects initial quota allocation has no effect on firm behaviour. ...|$|R
40|$|A Dutch {{pilot study}} of fully {{documented}} fisheries provided the opportunity to observe actual changes in fishing behaviour under catch quota management (CQM). Interviews with fishers in the pilot study aided in interpreting the results and giving insight in the decision making process and reasoning of fishers. The CQM pilot study entailed a fleet of small and large demersal vessels. For these vessels, all cod catches were counted against quota, including catches of individuals below minimum landings size. To obtain reliable catch data all vessels were equipped with electronic monitoring (EM) systems. These systems recorded videos of all fishing and processing activities on board. In return, fishers received a 30 % quota bonus for cod and were compensated with more flexibility on effort regulations. It was hypothesized that vessels in the CQM will (i) increase their landings by 30 % according to their quota bonus, (ii) increase the use of gear with large mesh size, and (iii) change effort towards fishing locations with high catch rates of large cod and avoid areas with high catch rates of undersized cod. The results showed that CQM {{had no effect on}} fishing behaviour of the small vessels. In contrast, large vessels significantly increased their cod landings (216 %) and avoided undersized cod. This difference in response of different fleets suggested that implementation of CQM, for instance {{in the context of the}} European Common Fisheries Policy, should consider fleet characteristics. It seemed that larger vessels in this study more easily adapted their behaviour to new management regimes and that the <b>quota</b> bonus <b>opened</b> up new fishing strategies, that were not envisaged during the implementation. </p...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} effects of introducing <b>quotas</b> to an <b>open</b> access fishery. When quotas are introduced, effort should decrease. This leads to higher prices and lower costs. Thus, overall profits should increase. An empirical analysis of profits in the Norwegian cod fisheries is conducted. Quotas were introduced in this fishery in 1990, and the dataset used covers 1985 - 2005. The research question is: Did profits rise in Norwegian fisheries for cod, after quotas were introduced? Because the quotas limit {{the activity of the}} fishers, the stock is affected. In order to see whether quotas increased profits, it is necessary to do an analysis with levels of stock as it would have developed without the quotas. Therefore a simulation of the stock is done. This is used to simulate landings and profits. The empirical results suggest that there have been a considerable increase in profits for the fishers after 1990. Few variables on effort and opportunities explain profits. Binary variables for years with and without quotas, however, explain a lot of the change in profits. The effects of other changes to policy and market conditions are also controlled for. These indicate that the quotas increased profits in two rounds. First right after the introduction, and then again some years later, as fishers started to trade quotas...|$|R

You state, and we agree, that “cultural industries are serious business”. The structures protecting the national interest in iron, minerals, fishing, sport and many other areas are strongly enforced and defended here in South Africa. Why not our music?” More initiatives such as the “Play Local of Die” campaign whose aim is to urge commercial broadcasters to increase their local content with regards to commercial radios stations playlist was launched by South African Hip Hop artist commonly known as JR (Real Name: JR Bogopa) to further exhibit the South African musicians plight in how pivotal it is to their careers and overall financial well-being that the current quota be raised significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the impact of local content quota on domestic radio broadcasters in South Africa. The population for this study included 100 radio station which broadcast in the republic of South Africa. The response rate for the e-mail questionnaire was 100 percent of the 100 respondents. A Likert-type scale instrument consisted of 39 questions divided into two sections: Section one looked at the demographic profile of the respondents and section two focused on getting responses on the factors impacting local content quotaand domestic broadcasters, namely local content quota, implications for domestic broadcasters, revenue streams, impact on local musicians, governments role in local content quota, success factors, globalisation and piracy. In order to realise the purpose of this study, the following research design was used: Step 1 A literature review was conducted to determine the various factors impacting local artists, local broadcasters and local content quota. Step 2 A questionnaire was composed according to the principles and guidelines in steps 1. Step 3 Empirical data was obtained with the aid of an e-mail survey. Step 4 The results of the data were analysed and interpreted. Step 5 The empirical results were integrated with Step 3. Step 6 Conclusions and recommendations were completed. The main findings from the study were: The study revealed that the radio industry is not unanimous in the call from artists for government to increase the local content quota and thus prefer that the current status quo continue. That local content quota are not the only way to curb the South African music industry‟s woes, artists should seek to maximise their revenue by exploiting the infinite avenues for revenue that globalisation avails...|$|R
