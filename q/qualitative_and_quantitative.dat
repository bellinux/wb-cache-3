It conducts <b>qualitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> analysis {{in order to}} evaluate management decisions across {{the public and private}} sectors. According to The New York Times, it is considered the most prestigious management consultancy in the world. McKinsey publishes the McKinsey Quarterly since 1964, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored many influential books on management. Its practices of confidentiality, influence on business practices, and corporate culture have experienced a polarizing reception.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of <b>qualitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E

25|$|These {{developments}} {{led to a}} {{deep understanding}} of basic processes in free-radical polymerisation—the commonest industrial process. For the propagation reaction, Gilbert led an international team that produced a methodology that overcame the long-standing problem of obtaining reliable rate coefficients for this process. He showed that the Arrhenius parameters for different types of monomer take different classes of values, and developed <b>qualitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> understanding of these classes from fundamental transition-state theory and quantum mechanics. These new methods were based on those that he had developed in his work on unimolecular gas-phase processes.

40|$|Backgroud: Hepatic {{fibrosis}} {{can lead}} to deformation of vessel morphology and structure. In the present feasibility study, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) using diffraction-enhanced imaging (DEI) was used to represent three-dimensional (3 D) vessel microstructures of hepatic fibrosis in rats and to differentiate different stages of hepatic fibrosis using <b>qualitative</b> descriptions <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> measurement of microvessels. Material and Methods: Three typical specimens at different stages, i. e., mild, moderate and severe hepatic fibrosis, were imaged using DEI at 15 keV without contrast agents. The correspondence between DEI-CT images and histopathological findings was determined. The 3 D visualizations from different stages of hepatic fibrosis were presented using DEI-CT. Additionally, <b>Qualitative</b> descriptions <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> evaluation of vessel features, such as vessel trend, vascular distortion deformation, thrombus formation and texture features on the inner wall of the vessel, were performed. Results: DEI-CT produced high-resolution images of the vessel microstructures in hepatic fibrosis that corresponded to information on actual structures observed from the histological sections. Combined with the 3 D visualization technique, DEI-CT enabled the acquisition of an accurate description of the 3 D vessel morphology from different stages of hepatic fibrosis. <b>Qualitative</b> descriptions <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> assessment of microvessels demonstrated clea...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to discuss how}} <b>qualitative</b> (intensive) <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> (extensive) research strategies differ by contrasting epistemological and ontological aspects and how these beliefs and views fit with their different intellectual goals. Firstly, this paper discusses the importance of understanding philosophy in social science research {{and its relation to}} <b>qualitative</b> (intensive) <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> (extensive) research strategies. Then it develops by contrasting these two types of research strategies in relation to the principle orientation to the role of theory, epistemological and ontological assumptions. Epistemological assumptions consist of interpretivism for qualitative (intensive) research strategies <b>and</b> positivism for <b>quantitative</b> (extensive) research strategies. Whereas ontological assumptions constitute subjectivism/constructivism for <b>qualitative</b> (intensive) research <b>and</b> objectivism for <b>quantitative</b> (extensive) research strategies. Further it will explain how these two types of research strategies fit the different intellectual goals and finally concludes by discussing an alternative research strategi namely mixed method that may be employed in social science research...|$|R

25|$|Institutionalized {{cultural}} capital comprises an institution's formal {{recognition of a}} person's {{cultural capital}}, usually academic credentials or professional qualifications. The greatest social role of institutionalized cultural-capital is {{in the labor market}} (a job), wherein it allows the expression of the person's array of cultural capital as <b>qualitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>quantitative</b> measurements (which are compared against the measures of cultural capital of other people). The institutional recognition facilitates the conversion of cultural capital into economic capital, by serving as a heuristic (practical solution) with which the seller can describe his or her cultural capital to the buyer.|$|E
