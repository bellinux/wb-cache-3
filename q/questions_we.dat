Although he was often called a travel writer, he did not identify as one nor did he consider himself a novelist. ("I don't quite {{know the meaning of}} the word novel," [...] he said). He preferred to call his writing stories or searches. He was interested in asking big questions about human existence, sharing unusual tales, and making connections between ideas from various sources. His friend and fellow writer Robyn Davidson said, [...] "He posed <b>questions</b> <b>we</b> all want answered and perhaps gave the illusion they were answerable." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP), an , Wheeler used a variant on Twenty Questions, called Negative Twenty Questions, {{to show how}} the <b>questions</b> <b>we</b> choose to ask about the universe may dictate the answers we get. In this variant, the respondent does not choose or decide upon any particular or definite object beforehand, but only on a pattern of [...] "Yes" [...] or [...] "No" [...] answers. This variant requires the respondent to provide a consistent set of answers to successive questions, so that each answer can be viewed as logically compatible with all the previous answers. In this way, successive questions narrow the options until the questioner settles upon a definite object. Wheeler's theory was that, in an analogous manner, consciousness may play some role in bringing the universe into existence.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] <b>Questions</b> <b>we</b> all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

The book answers three fundamental questions: why do banks merge? do M&As create value for shareholders in the short-term? do M&As create value for shareholders in the long-term? To answer the first <b>question,</b> <b>we</b> firstly provided a theoretical analysis of M&A motives. Next we critically analysed seven of the largest merger deals in European banking. To answer the second <b>question,</b> <b>we</b> analysed a large sample of M&As between 1991 and 2005 within the EU 27 running an event study method.

40|$|In this paper, we reanalyse the {{alternation}} in the Brazilian Portuguese verbal {{system called}} verbal vowel harmony (VH), which applies to verb stems {{in the second}} and third conjugations (e. g., bebér ‘to drink’ > bébo ‘I drink’; segír ‘to follow’ > sígo ‘I follow’). We pose the following questions concerning VH: Is it a synchronic process? Does it exhibit paradigmatic effects? and How can it be described in Optimality Theory? To answer <b>question,</b> <b>we</b> present a corpus of BP dictionarized verbs in the third person and results from empirical tests that evaluate acceptability/productivity in the conjugation of pseudo-verbs. Concerning <b>question,</b> <b>we</b> show that a paradigmatic correspondence between verbal forms in BP accounts for misapplication patterns. Answering <b>question,</b> <b>we</b> offer a description of the process in line with Transderivational Correspondence Theory (Benua 1997). ...|$|R
