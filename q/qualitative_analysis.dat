40|$|The {{application}} of computer-assisted <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analysis</b> software (CAQDAS) {{in the field}} of qualitative sociology is becoming more popular. However, in Polish scientific research, the use of computer software to aid <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analysis</b> is uncommon. Nevertheless, the Polish qualitative research community is turning to CAQDAS software increasingly often. One noticeable result of working with CAQDAS is an increase in methodological awareness, which is reflected in higher accuracy and precision in <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analysis.</b> Our purpose in this article is to describe the qualitative researchers' environment in Poland and to consider the use of computer-assisted <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analysis.</b> In our deliberations, we focus mainly on the social sciences, especially sociology.

25|$|The {{test can}} be scored two ways. The number correct score is {{calculated}} {{based on an}} all-or-nothing approach; points are awarded if the reproduction of the design matches the original. The number error score, on the other hand, {{is calculated based on}} the number and type of errors made for each design. The major categories for these errors are omissions, distortions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, and size errors. These scores are then be compared to several sets of normative data available in the manual, each representing different demographic characteristics, and conclusions can be drawn by the examiner. The two different methods of scoring allow for both quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>analysis</b> of an individual's test.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Purdue University in 1945 for {{graduate}} studies, Eicher taught organic technic and <b>qualitative</b> <b>analysis</b> {{for six years}} as an assistant instructor.

Eicher then worked on the preparation of various nitro and oximino compounds to earn his Ph.D. in 1952. One of his dissertation advisors was Herbert C. Brown (1912–2004), 1979 Nobel Laureate. Eicher often visited with his friend Linus C. Pauling (1901–1994), who won two Nobel Prizes, one for chemistry in 1954 and the Peace Prize in 1962.|$|E
40|$|This article {{offers a}} {{step-by-step}} {{description of how}} <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analysis</b> software {{can be used for}} a <b>qualitative</b> content <b>analysis</b> of newspaper articles. Using NVivo as an example, it illustrates how software tools can facilitate analytical flexibility and how they can enhance transparency and trustworthiness of the qualitative research process. Following a brief discussion of the key characteristics, advantages and limitations of <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analysis</b> software, the article describes a <b>qualitative</b> content <b>analysis</b> of 230 newspaper articles, conducted to determine international media perceptions of New Zealand's environmental performance in connection with climate change and carbon emissions. The article proposes a multi-level coding approach during the analysis of news texts that combines quantitative and qualitative elements, allowing the researcher to move back and forth in coding and between analytical levels. The article concludes that while <b>qualitative</b> data <b>analysis</b> software, such as NVivo, will not do the analysis for the researcher, it can make the analytical process more flexible, transparent and ultimately more trustworthy.

25|$|To be acceptable, any {{rule of law}} must {{be capable}} of being applied consistently, thus a {{definition}} of the criteria for this <b>qualitative</b> <b>analysis</b> must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B {{on the road and}} by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury {{and the extent to which}} B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more substantial cause and so represents a novus actus breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a novus actus and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} reagents {{which can be used}} to label terminal amino acids. They all react with amine groups and will therefore also bind to amine groups in the side chains of amino acids such as lysine - for this reason it is necessary to be careful in interpreting chromatograms to ensure that the right spot is chosen. Two of the more common reagents are Sanger's reagent (1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) and dansyl derivatives such as dansyl chloride. Phenylisothiocyanate, the reagent for the Edman degradation, can also be used. The same questions apply here as in the determination of amino acid composition, with the exception that no stain is needed, as the reagents produce coloured derivatives and only <b>qualitative</b> <b>analysis</b> is required. [...] So the amino acid {{does not have to be}} eluted from the chromatography column, just compared with a standard. Another consideration to take into account is that, since any amine groups will have reacted with the labelling reagent, ion exchange chromatography cannot be used, and thin layer chromatography or high-pressure liquid chromatography should be used instead.|$|E

2500|$|Solid samples can be {{prepared}} {{in a variety of}} ways. One common method is to crush the sample with an oily mulling agent (usually mineral oil Nujol). A thin film of the mull is applied onto salt plates and measured. The second method is to grind a quantity of the sample with a specially purified salt (usually potassium bromide) finely (to remove scattering effects from large crystals). This powder mixture is then pressed in a mechanical press to form a translucent pellet through which the beam of the spectrometer can pass. [...] A third technique is the [...] "cast film" [...] technique, which is used mainly for polymeric materials. The sample is first dissolved in a suitable, non hygroscopic solvent. A drop of this solution is deposited on surface of KBr or NaCl cell. The solution is then evaporated to dryness and the film formed on the cell is analysed directly. Care is important to ensure that the film is not too thick otherwise light cannot pass through. This technique is suitable for <b>qualitative</b> <b>analysis.</b> The final method is to use microtomy to cut a thin (20–100µm) film from a solid sample.
