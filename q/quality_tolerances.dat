These {{problems have been}} addressed separately in the past. We consider admission and production control policies of the threshold type whereby the system produces until stock reaches a certain level and accepts orders until its backlog reaches another critical level. The problem {{is to find the}} optimal <b>quality</b> <b>tolerances</b> and the critical stock and backlog levels which maximize the mean profit rate of the system. We also examine a supply chain comprising two factories in series with external subcontractors, and we compare the benefit of determining the optimal base stocks for the two systems jointly rather than individually.

40|$|A {{method to}} sort 'Jonagold' apples {{based on the}} {{presence}} of defects was proposed. A multi-spectral vision system including four wavelength bands in the visible/NIR range was developed. Multi-spectral images of sound and defective fruits were acquired tending to cover the whole colour variability of this bicolour apple variety. Defects were grouped into four categories: slight defects, more serious defects, defects leading to the rejection of the fruit and recent bruises. Stem-ends/calyxes were detected using a correlation pattern matching algorithm. The efficiency of this method depended on the orientation of the stem-end/calyx according to the optical axis of the camera. Defect segmentation consisted in a pixel classification procedure based on the Bayes' theorem and non-parametric models of the sound and defective tissue. Fruit classification tests were performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. No error was made on rejected fruits and high classification rates were reached for apples presenting serious defects and recent bruises. Fruits with slight defects presented a more important misclassification rate but those errors fitted however the <b>quality</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the European standard. Considering an actual ratio of sound fruits of 90 %, less than 2 % of defective fruits were classified into the sound ones. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E

A 60 cm diameter aperture beam expander with an expansion ratio of 15 : 1 and a primary mirror focal ratio of f/ 2 was designed for the study. An HDOS copyrighted analysis program determined the value of merit function for various optical misalignments.

For these data to be of value to our customers, {{we need to understand}} what quality measures will allow them to assess whether the data are fit for their purpose. In the case of 3 -dimensional (3 D) data, this is particularly important as it will inform research into capturing and modelling these data. However, for a data type in its infancy, such as 3 D data, it is rare that a clear idea of quality requirements is available since the full range of uses of the data is still unknown. Instead, the potential use contexts of such data need to be investigated. To this end, we have conducted user needs research across a wide range of professional use contexts. This research has been analysed to identify measures and their required quality for use contexts where 3 D information about buildings is of particular interest to the user. However, it is often the case that the user cannot realistically make explicit statements anticipating what they would require in terms of 3 D data measures and quality elements such as positional accuracy.

30|$|The {{assumption}} {{regarding the}} principles of VBM (A 1) was completely {{in line with the}} case company’s strategic orientation. For the case company, retaining a strong cash flow position and achieving long-term growth are the two most important strategic objectives. The assumption about the process demand that follows a trend with random deviations (A 2) was judged as uncritical. The interviewees confirmed a stably increasing development of the customer base over the past 5  years. However, they could not exclude disruptive events over the entire planning horizon. A demand model that allows for such exogenous demand shocks would constitute a good extension of the decision model. However, the probability for demand shocks was estimated to be so low that the implementation of shock events would not dramatically affect the case results. Further, the interviewees considered the assumption regarding constant demand weights (A 3) as fair. When deciding about setting up the call center, the company conducted a survey to predict the brokers’ behavior. Since the establishment of the call center, the company monitors the call center’s utilization to assess its profitability. The results indicate stable usage behaviors as well as a steady distribution over interaction channels. With the coverage switching process counting among the case company’s core processes, the interviewees confirmed the assumption about high process maturity (A 4). Almost all end costumers traverse this process. In contrast to the positive feedback regarding assumptions (A 1) to (A 4), the interviewees criticized the assumptions on the mechanics of quality and time effects (A 5, A 6). Both the uniformly distributed time and <b>quality</b> <b>tolerances</b> and the linear relationships were judged as being unsuitable. The sensitivity analysis, however, showed that a violation of these two assumptions does not impact the optimal process variant profile in the case at hand (Sect.  5.4. 2).|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{potential}} bioremediation approaches {{that may be}} suitable for prawn farms in Queensland. Although most share generally accepted bioremediation principles, advocacy for different methods tends to vary widely. This diversity of approach is particularly driven by the availability and knowledge of functional species at different localities around the world. In Australia, {{little is known about}} the abilities of many native species in this regard, and translocation and biosecurity issues prevent the use of exotic species that have shown potential in other countries. Species selected must be tolerant of eutrophic conditions and ecological shifts, because prawn pond nutrient levels and pathways can vary with different assemblages of autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms. Generally, they would be included in a constructed ecosystem because of their functional contributions to nutrient cycling and uptake, and to create nutrient sinks in forms of harvestable biomass. Wide salinity, temperature and water <b>quality</b> <b>tolerances</b> are also valuable attributes for selected species due to the sometimes-pronounced effects of environmental extremes, and to provide over-wintering options and adequate safety margins in avoiding mass mortalities. To practically achieve these bioremediation polycultures on a large scale, and in concert with the operations of a prawn farm, methods involving seed production, stock management, and a range of other farm engineering and product handling systems need to be reliably achievable and economically viable. Research funding provided by the Queensland Government through the Aquaculture Industry Development Initiative (AIDI) 2002 - 04 has enabled a number of technical studies into biological systems to treat prawn farm effluent for recirculation and improved environmental sustainability. AIDI bioremediation research in southern Queensland was based at the Bribie Island Aquaculture Research Centre (BIARC), and was conducted in conjunction with AIDI genetics and selection research, and a Natural Heritage Trust (NHT) funded program (Coast and Clean Seas Project No. 717757).

40|$|Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is an {{important}} thermosetting elastomer for microfluidic devices because it can replicate nano-scale features and form flexible membranes useful for microactuation. PDMS is used extensively in research environments because it is readily available and biocompatible. However, the prototyping process is too slow for volume manufacturing. The dominant rate limiting step is curing, and high temperature cures used to speed the curing process have adverse effects on {{the shape of the}} parts produced. This thesis examines the PDMS cure process and presents a methodology to intelligently design faster cure processes without compromising the quality of parts produced. The first part of this thesis applies statistical mechanics to relate the time evolution of cure with the modulus of elasticity. This enables mechanical testing strategies to be used in situ to monitor the extent of cure, which is important to determine the critical gel point and quantify when the cure process is complete. The gel point describes when PDMS first transitions from a liquid to a solid, and is important for modeling shrinkage and warpage. A novel heated microindentation setup is designed to monitor curing of thin PDMS films, and experimentally validate the theory. The second part of this thesis presents a model for final PDMS shrinkage and warpage using the gel point. Gelation is spatially and temporally distributed, and temperature at the gel point has a direct impact on the shrinkage and warpage observed. The model is validated with experimental data. Since gel temperature is the only parameter to affect shrinkage and curvature, the cure process is accelerated after the gel point without affecting dimensional quality. Increasing the process temperature immediately following gelation is indeed shown to decrease the current cure process time by a factor of five, while maintaining comparable <b>quality.</b> <b>Tolerances</b> on shrinkage and curvature can be used with these models to determine the gel temperatures required, and design multi-temperature processes that speed the cure process. by Eehern J.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the aquaculture potential of a hybrid between the two largest African silurid catfish, Heterobranchus longifilis (HL) and Clarias gariepinus (CG). A morphometric, meristic and karyological study showed that the hybrid shared some of the physical characteristics of both C. gariepinus and H. longifilis, while its chromosome complement and fundamental number (2 N = 54, FN = 95), was intermediate between that of H. longifilis (2 N = 52, FN = 92) and C. gariepinus (2 N = 56, FN = 97). The HLxCG cross could therefore be regarded as a true hybrid. For the characters tested, no morphological or karyological differences were apparent between the HLxCG hybrids produced in West Africa and those produced in southern Africa. In southern Africa, the HL♂xCG♀ cross had higher fertilization and hatching rates than pure strain H. longifilis, C. gariepinus or the reverse cross. There was no difference in the survival of the ` hybrid larvae and C. gariepinus larvae up to the onset of exogenous feeding. Pure strain H. longifilis juveniles had a faster growth rate than the H. longifilis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ juveniles, but the hybrid always grew at a faster rate than C. gariepinus or the reverse cross. The HL♂xCG♀ cross was consequently chosen as the hybrid with the greatest potential for siluroid aquaculture in southern Africa. The HL♂xCG♀ hybrid showed evidence of partial gonadic, gametic and post-zygotic sterility in both sexes. The hybrid was not completely sterile, as it was artificially induced to spawn, and a small number of viable F₂ hybrid and F₁ hybrid x C. gariepinus larvae were produced. However, in the light of its probable reproductive strategy, it is highly unlikely that the hybrid would pose an ecological risk to the southern African region. The H. longifllis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ hybrid was compared to C. gariepinus for selected water quality preferences and tolerances. The hybrid had a wider temperature preference (28 °C to 34 °C) than C. gariepinus (28 °C to 30 °C), but appeared to be more dependent on aerial respiration than C. gariepinus. The air-breathing frequency of hybrid fish began to increase at dissolved oxygen concentrations below 3. 8 mg. ℓ·', while C. gariepinus only showed an increase in air-breathing frequency at concentrations below 3. 8 mg. ℓ·'. The hybrid was more tolerant of unionised ammonia (96 -hour LC₆₀ = 9. 1 mg. t·') than C. gariepinus (96 -hour LC₆₀ = 6. 5 mg. ℓ·'), but their 96 -hour LC₆₀ salinity tolerances were similar (10. 8 - 11. 0 g. ℓ·'). The H. longifilis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ hybrid had a higher fillet yield (43. 9 %) than C. gariepinus (38. 9 % 1, but the crude protein content and amino acid profile of the two groups were similar. Catfish are traditionally grown in earthen ponds under semiintensive conditions in southern Africa, at around 4 kg of fish per cubic meter of water (kg. m·'). However, the hybrid could tolerate densities of up to 415 kg of fish per cubic metre of water, if the water was exchanged hourly (kg. m·'. hr'), and the density at which yield was optimised was rounded off to 400 kg. m·'. hr·'. The high threshold density and water <b>quality</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the H. longifilis ♂ x C. gariepinus ♀ hybrid indicates that it is ideally suited for highly intensive aquaculture. It was concluded that it would be more productive to farm the HL♂xCG♀ hybrid on an intensive basis in southern Africa, than it would be to farm C. gariepinus in the traditional manner. ...|$|E
