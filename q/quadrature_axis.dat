50|$|The diagram shows three {{arrangements}} of a metadyne machine. In all cases, compensation windings have been omitted for clarity. The first arrangement represents a one-cycle cross-field machine. In a normal DC machine, {{the effect of}} the excitation current generates a flux (A1), which in turn generates a quadrature flux which is at right angles to the exciting flux. By wiring the quadrature brushes together, current is produced in the armature, and the flux that this produces (A2) is again at right angles to the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis,</b> resulting in an armature reaction which is directly opposed to the original excitation. This feature is fundamental to the machine, and does not depend on its direction of rotation. When the armature reaction is partially compensated by a compensation winding, the uncompensated portion of the armature reaction acts in this way. As the output current rises, it suppresses {{the effect of the}} excitation, until it reaches a state where there is just enough excitation to maintain the current. Any further increase would eliminate the flux which sustains its operation, and the current is maintained irrespective of the resistance of the load or the back emf produced by it. The machine thus acts as a constant-current generator, where the current is proportional to the excitation.|$|E

In addition, the stability limits for the SynRM are studied using a suggested more accurate method. The saturation and cross-saturation effects on both direct (d) and <b>quadrature</b> (q) <b>axis</b> flux linkages are considered. A Finite Element Method (FEM) is used to obtain an accurate representation for the dq-axis flux linkages relations. In order to reduce the calculation time of the finite element analysis, a look-up table (LUT) for the dq-axis flux linkages is generated based on the FEM to be used for simulating the SynRM characteristics. It is found that the magnetic saturation in the adopted motor results in an enlarged region of stable operation of the SynRM by about 200 % compared with the unsaturated case. The results show the importance of including the saturation factors on the performance of the SynRM and its stability limits. Hence, the magnetic saturation effect will not only reflect on the stability of the motor but also on the whole drive system...|$|R
40|$|Core loss {{is one of}} the {{significant}} factors affecting the high power density of permanent magnet machines; thus, it is necessary to consider core loss in machine design. This paper presents a novel method for calculating the core loss of permanent magnet synchronous machines under space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) excitation, taking magnetic saturation and cross coupling into account. In order to accurately obtain the direct and <b>quadrature</b> (d-q) <b>axis,</b> current in the given load condition, the permanent magnet motor model under SVPWM excitation has been modified, so as to consider the influence of magnetic saturation and cross coupling effects on the d-q axis flux-linkage.

In this study, the method has been applied to analyze core loss in an interior permanent magnet synchronous machine, and has been validated by the experimental results.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of investigations into an interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine having characteristics which are superior to those available from an existing type. The improvements are made to a conventional IPM machine having radially mounted magnets on the direct axis, by shaping the rotor airgap profile. In the new machine the airgap length is gradually increased towards the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> in comparison to the airgap length along the direct axis. Finite element simulations show that a near sinusoidal distribution of airgap flux density due to the magnets can be achieved while reducing the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> inductance (Lq). It has been shown that the shaped pole machine has significantly reduced cogging torque. The torque pulsations in the total torque and also in the reluctance torque versus load angle characteristics are reduced in the case of shaped pole machine. It is shown that the shaped pole machine has a higher total torque within the normal operating mode in comparison to that of the uniform airgap machine. The new machine also gives a linear torque versus current relationship even at currents much higher than the rated current. The simulation results show that the saturation effects are less in the new shaped pole machine. The reduced Lq of the new IPM machine may provide an advantage in vector control using controlled <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> current making the machine fast responding.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{synchronous}} machine {{is an essential}} component of a power system and determination of its parameters accurately is an important task in securing adequate modes of operation through certain control strategies. An estimation technique based on the Powell algorithm was evaluated for the identification of these parameters on the basis of small- signal input-output data. A fifth order Park doman flux linkage model of a salient pole machine was used for the identification of the parameters. Stator terminal voltages as transformed into the Park domain, field voltage and rotor frequency were used as input signals to the model. The input signals to the actual machine are the stator terminal voltages and the field voltage. The Park domain stator terminal currents and field current were used as output signals. Due to the lack of access to real data, digital simulation of an actual machine was used in an effort to establish the machine responses in the time domain to small changes in the input signals. These responses were compared with those obtained from the model with the unknown parameters and utilized in the identification process. The sensitivity of a least-square loss-function with respect to each parameter was tested. The proposed parameter identification method was evaluated with data of two different machines. Careful observation of the results indicates that convergence can only be secured if nonsimultaneous perturbation of the direct - and <b>quadrature</b> - <b>axis</b> components of the terminal voltages is applied. Implementation of such a procedure is highly complicated in practice. Therefore, a suitable method for resolving this problem is presented, which is based on transforming the input and output signals of the actual machine and the model to the frequency domain. In this form, the model can be reduced to two sets of equations, each of which depends on one of the forcing function components. The same identification algorithm that was tested in the time domain, can be used for the frequency domain identification process and has the same convergence properties...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the efficiency {{and the cost of}} electrical machines has been observed. The efficiency of electric motors is important because electric motors consume about 40 %- 45 % of the produced electricity worldwide and about 70 % of the industrial electricity 1. Therefore, some types of electric motors have been classified in proposed standard classes 1 based on their efficiency. By consequence, efficient and low cost electric motors are necessary on the market. Several types of electric motors are used in industrial applications such as permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs), induction motors (IMs) and reluctance motors (RMs). Due to the high cost of PMSMs and due to the rotor losses of the IMs, the RMs can be considered as promising and attractive candidates. Moreover, they have a robust and simple structure, and a low cost as there are no cage, windings and magnets in the rotor. There are two main types of RMs: switched reluctance motors (SRMs) and synchronous reluctance motors (SynRMs). However, there are some disadvantages of these types of machines. On the one hand, the SRMs have problems of torque ripple, vibrations and noise. In addition, their control is more complicated than that of three-phase conventional motor drives, a. o. because of the high non-linearity of the inductance. On the other hand, the SynRMs have a low power factor, so that an inverter with a high Volt-Ampère rating is required to produce a given motor output power. Therefore, adding a proper amount of low cost permanent magnet (PM) material - such as ferrite - may be a good option to boost the power factor. The PMs also increase the efficiency and torque density. These types of motors are [...] 1 Waide, P. and C. Brunner (2011),”Energy-Efficiency Policy Opportunities for Electric Motor Driven Systems”, IEA Energy Papers, No. 2011 / 07, OECD Publishing, Paris. xiv Summary called permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance motors (PMaSynRMs). In this thesis, both SynRMs and PMaSynRMs are investigated. The main focus is given to the rotor design, magnetic material grade and winding configuration. In addition, the modelling and control of SynRMs and PMaSynRMs is also investigated. First, parametrized models are made of the machines. The finite element method (FEM) is used to obtain the dq-axis flux-linkages λd(id, iq, θr) and λq(id, iq, θr) of the SynRM in static 2 D simulations, as a function of d-axis current id, and q-axis current iq and rotor position θr. As known, the performance (output torque, power factor and efficiency) of SynRMs depends mainly on the ratio between the direct (d) and <b>quadrature</b> (q) <b>axis</b> inductances (Ld/Lq). This ratio is well-known as the saliency ratio of the SynRM. As magnetic saturation causes significant changes in the inductances and by consequence in the saliency ratio during operation, a SynRM model based on constant inductances (Ld and Lq) is not good enough. It can lead to large deviations in the prediction of the torque capability compared with the real motor. How large these deviations are, is clarified in this thesis by comparing several models that do or do not take into account saturation, cross-saturation and rotor position effects. It is found that saturation and cross saturation must be included in the model for an accurate representation of the SynRM performance and control. This means the flux linkages should be function of id and iq. The rotor position needn’t be included. Apart from the currents, the FEM contains many parameters for the flux barrier geometry, which have a strong influence on the torque and torque ripple of the machine. Next to static simulations, also dynamic simulations are done. In these simulations, the flux-linkages are stored in lookup tables, created a priori by FEM, to speed up the simulations. Based on the SynRM FEM model, the design of the SynRM rotor is investigated. Choosing the flux-barrier geometry parameters is very complex because there are many parameters that play a role. Therefore, an optimization technique is always necessary to select the flux-barrier parameters that optimize the SynRM performance indicators (maximize the saliency ratio and output torque and minimize the torque ripple). To gain insight in the relevant parameters, first a sensitivity analysis is done: the influence of the flux-barrier parameters is studied on the SynRM performance indicators. These indicators are again saliency ratio, output torque and torque ripple. In addition, easy-to-usexv parametrized equations are proposed to select the value of the two most crucial parameters of the rotor i. e. the flux-barrier angle and width. The proposed equations are compared with three existing literature equations. At the end, an optimal rotor design is obtained based on an optimized technique coupled with FEM. The optimal rotor is checked mechanically for the robustness against mechanical stresses and deformations. Apart from the geometry, the electric steel grade {{plays a major role in}} the losses and efficiency of an electric machine. Therefore, several steel grades are compared with respect to the SynRM performance i. e. output torque, power factor, torque ripple, iron losses and efficiency. Four different steel grades NO 20, M 330 P- 50 A, M 400 - 50 A and M 600 - 100 A are considered. The steel grades differ in thickness and in the losses they produce. It was found that the “best” grade NO 20 had in the rated operating point of the considered SynRM 9. 0 % point more efficiency than the “worst” grade M 600 - 100 A. Next to energy-efficiency, a large interest in recent research is dedicated to obtain a high torque density. One of the main techniques to improve the machine torque density is to increase the fundamental winding factor through an innovative winding layout. Among several configurations, the so-called combined star-delta winding layout was proposed in literature several years ago. In the PhD, the combined stardelta winding is compared with the conventional star winding in terms of output torque, torque ripple and efficiency. A simple method to calculate the equivalent winding factor of the different winding connections is proposed. In addition, the modelling of a SynRM with combined star-delta winding is given. Furthermore, the effect of different winding layouts on the performance of the SynRM is presented. To compare both windings experimentally, two stators are made, one with combined star-delta windings and one with conventional star windings, having the same copper volume. Measurements revealed a 5. 2 % higher output torque of the first machine at rated current and speed. In order to even further improve the power factor and the output torque of the SynRM, ferrite PMs are inserted in the center of the rotor flux-barriers. The rotor geometry of the resulting PMaSynRM is the same as the conventional SynRM. Hence, two rotors with identical iron lamination stack were built: one with PMs and a second one without magnets. Having the two stators and two rotors, a comparison of fourxvi Summary prototype SynRMs is done in the PhD, each of 5. 5 kW. Several validation measurements have been obtained. The combined-star delta SynRM with PMs in the rotor had up to 1. 5 % point more efficiency than the SynRM with star winding and rotor without magnets at the rated current and speed. As an application of SynRM, an efficient and low cost photovoltaic (PV) pumping system employing a SynRM is studied. The proposed system does not have a DC-DC converter that is often used to maximize the PV output power, nor has it storage (battery). Instead, the system is controlled in such a way that both the PV output power is maximized and the SynRM works at the maximum torque per Ampère, using a conventional three phase pulse width modulated inverter. The design and the modelling of all the system components are given. The performance of the proposed PV pumping system is presented, showing the effectiveness of the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{generating}} electrical power using reluctance generator {{is yet to}} be fully exploited, which will necessitate its development into industrial standard. This research aims to facilitate the development through a comparative evaluation of the performance of caged and cageless reluctance generators. A three-phase synchronous reluctance generator was modeled using existing information and its performance with or without a cage rotor was analyzed. Evaluation of the machines’ performance was carried out at both steady and dynamic states using MATLAB. The results show that a self-excited cage rotor synchronous reluctance generator yielded a power of 0. 25 p. u compared to the cage-less rotor that yielded 0. 2 p. u at an excitation of 62 μF; while on further excitation using capacitance of 110 µF, the cage rotor yielded a higher power of 0. 9 p. u whereas the cageless rotor could not excite beyond 62 μF. This implies that the cage rotor generator has the ability to excite at capacitance values high enough to circulate rotor current in the machine windings due to the existence of remnant flux, magnetic saturation and rotor geometry. The removal of damper cage of a synchronous reluctance machine allows for more modifications of the rotor geometry which include reduction in the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> flux path and hence the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> reactance which ultimately improves the machine performance.

The frequency responses of the resulting circuits are plotted against the test data to show a proper match. To enable control design in the state space, the transformation of the equivalent circuits into state space representation is finally proposed...|$|E
40|$|For {{economic}} reasons, {{many rural}} consumers are supplied from single phase medium voltage networks. Three phase power is desirable for many applications. This paper {{shows that a}} well-balanced three phase supply can be produced with a Scott transformer connection of a single phase inverter and the existing single phase supply. The single phase converter only processes half of the load power. A regulation scheme based in the DQ frame is proposed and it is shown the single phase inverter directly controls the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> voltage. A well balanced supply can be produced by regulating this inverter to eliminate any negative sequence voltages. A bidirectional rectifier supplies the inverter and simultaneously provides power factor correction and a reduced cost option to integrate storage and photovoltaic (PV) generation at its DC bus...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{computer simulation}} for interconnecting {{wind energy system}} to an electric utility is presented. The proposed system consists of four high rating wind turbines each one uses double fed induction generator (DFIG). Two back to back bidirectional PWM inverters {{are used in the}} rotor circuit of each DFIG to be interfaced with the electrical utility. The simulation incorporates a flexible independent control for the active and reactive powers by using field oriented control technique. Also it introduces an effective technique to track the maximum power point of the wind energy by controlling the pitch angle and rotational speed. Active power is controlled through the direct axis current of the rotor side converter in outer control layer. Reactive power is controlled by the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> current of the rotor side converter. The system shows a stable operation under different operating conditions. © 2010 IEEE.

40|$|Linear {{synchronous}} motors can be {{used for}} large scale electromagnetic launch. The machines are short time rated and can therefore use substantial values of stator current loading. This leads to high values of armature flux and the risk of demagnetising the excitation magnets. In order to mitigate this risk by reducing the armature flux, <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> flux barriers can be positioned in the permanent magnet backing iron. These reduce the armature field but leave the permanent magnet excitation field largely unchanged. In addition to improving the force due to the larger usable stator current loading, the barriers are beneficial in reducing the synchronous reactance and hence improving the power factor and reducing the Volt Amps per Newton of useful force (VA/N) of a linear motor. The paper explores the use of these barriers for a typical configuration and shows the performance improvements that can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{inductance}} characteristics present in single tooth wound synchronous reluctance motors, specifically the stator leakage inductance. Despite {{the nature of}} the single tooth design resulting in increased air gap harmonic content, having has consequences for the machines' design, performance & operation, the topology has been shown previously to be competitive for high efficiency drives. A key design constraint in the design of synchronous reluctance motors is maximizing the direct axis inductance and minimizing the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> inductance for a high saliency ratio. The effect of increased leakage inductance on this saliency ratio is explored with emphasis placed on design aspects of such single tooth wound synchronous reluctance motors. It is shown that careful design of the machine is required to maximize the saliency ratio in this machine topology and that the dominant leakage inductance component is the air gap harmonic leakage...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the simulation of cascaded multilevel inverter fed induction motor drive. The poor quality of {{voltage and current}} of a conventional inverter fed induction machine {{is due to the}} presence of harmonics and hence there is significant level of energy losses. To obtain high quality sinusoidal output voltage with reduced harmonics, multi carrier based Sinusoidal pulse width modulation(MSPWM) control scheme is proposed for cascaded H bridgemultilevel inverter. The field orientation control techniqueis used to control the speed of induction motor by controlling the <b>quadrature</b> <b>axis</b> current using PI speed regulator. The proposed system is an effective replacement for the conventional method which produces high switching losses results in poor drive performance. The simulation results reveal that the proposed circuit effectively controls the motor speed and enhances the drive performance through reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD). The effectiveness of the system is verified through simulation using PSIM Simulink software...|$|E
