5|$|At {{this time}} the 12th Light Horse Regiment was in the Judean Hills {{on the front line}} near Kuddis, where the {{disposition}} of the Ottoman defenders was static and <b>quiet,</b> <b>but</b> observant. From 12 December the regiment was working to extend a sangar and enjoyed fresh meat, bread, vegetables, and rum. On 17 December bivouac sheets and blankets arrived. The weather continued cold and showery, but the good rations and extra blankets and bivouac shelters lifted morale.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept <b>quiet.</b> <b>But</b> to his astonishment, keeping quiet {{caused him to}} lose his post as Secretary General – Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power between the two camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at {{an evening}} church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The {{progress}} {{of their relationship}} was slowed by Hobbs' shyness and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event <b>quiet,</b> <b>but</b> it {{was reported in the}} press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.|$|E

5|$|On 14 September, the {{squadron}} began flying missions to escort B-24 Liberator bombers. The Japanese had 200 aircraft at Kahili Airfield and Balalae Island, opposed by only 50 aircraft from the U.S. squadrons in the area. The {{first couple of}} missions that {{the squadron}} undertook were relatively <b>quiet</b> <b>but,</b> on 16 September, VMF-214 was attacked {{by a group of}} 35 Japanese A6M Zeros. The squadron repelled the strike, destroying 11 Japanese aircraft for the loss of only one of their own. Several costly engagements with the strong Japanese forces in the area followed. Bolt did not score any victories during this time, but was promoted to first lieutenant that month.|$|E
5|$|The vocalisations of {{cockatoos}} are {{loud and}} harsh. They serve {{a number of}} functions, including allowing individuals to recognize one another, alerting others of predators, indicating individual moods, maintaining the cohesion of a flock and as warnings when defending nests. The use of calls and number of specific calls varies by species; the Carnaby's black cockatoo has as many as 15 different calls, whereas others, such as Major Mitchell's cockatoo, have fewer. Some, like the gang-gang cockatoo, are comparatively <b>quiet</b> <b>but</b> do have softer growling calls when feeding. In addition to vocalisations, palm cockatoos communicate over large distances by drumming on a dead branch with a stick. Cockatoo species also make a characteristic hissing sound when threatened.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français is {{generally}} bay or chestnut in color, {{the latter being}} a legacy of its origins in the Anglo-Norman breed. Gray is much less common, with its origins in the Thoroughbred and Anglo-Arabian horses {{that contributed to the}} breed. White markings, such as white on the lower legs, are fairly common within the breed, and are again inherited from its Norman ancestors. The temperament of the Selle Français is highly variable from one horse to another. This is due to the selection criteria for breeding stock, which {{since the beginning of the}} breed have been based on physical ability. In recent years, however, the ANSF and breeders have been working to create selection criteria that focus on temperament. The vast majority of Selle Français have good temperaments, <b>quiet</b> <b>but</b> energetic, patient and friendly. The breed is reputed to be intelligent and quick to learn.|$|E

25|$|A {{very strong}} {{way to express}} anger or {{frustration}} {{is to use the}} words tabarnak, sacrament, and câlice. Depending on the context and the tone of the phrases, it might make everybody <b>quiet,</b> <b>but</b> some people use those words to add rhythm or emphasis to sentences.|$|E

Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.|$|E

The legislation restricted a number of civil liberties, including freedom of assembly; gatherings of more than four people were banned.|$|E

25|$|Feldman {{was known}} for being a <b>quiet</b> <b>but</b> very {{effective}} leader of the UFT. She fought school system chancellors and mayors both, winning significantly higher wages and benefits as well as improved working conditions for her members.

25|$|The years 1640 to 1642 were {{comparatively}} <b>quiet,</b> <b>but</b> in 1643 French Weimar regiments were in occupation, {{along with}} the entire French general staff. The so-called “Weimar occupation” lasted until May 1643, when victory was achieved {{after three days of}} fighting by the Bavarian army under the command of Graf Fugger. In 1645, the town was again plundered by French and Hessian troops. Subsequently, the Bavarians moved back, but provisions were barely enough to feed them. Virtually all that remained were cabbages, beets and new wine.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} this {{extensive}} activity and expansion was that by 1937 the annual electricity output of PreussenElektra exceeded one billion kWh.

Cappy became the first K-9 casualty, 23 July, when he was mortally wounded by a Japanese grenade.

25|$|By midnight all was <b>quiet,</b> <b>but</b> {{the ship}} was still labouring to rejoin {{the main part of}} the convoy. Steaming on slowly, Saturday turned into Sunday. Sunday 26 October would be a day that the crew of the English Trader would never forget. Between 1 am and 1.30 am, {{the ship was}} {{struggling}} against a strong ebbing tide, which in turn forced her dangerously close to the sandbanks of Hammond Knoll. At around 1.45 am the crew felt a slight jolt followed by a more severe jolt. This flung the ship forward followed by loud grinding, crunching and scraping of metal. Then there was silence. The ship had run aground on Hammond Knoll.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notorious}} murder {{was that of}} Walter Liggett, the founder and editor of a weekly paper called The Midwest American. He had been {{threatened}} and offered bribes to stay <b>quiet,</b> <b>but</b> he persisted in reporting on links he found between organized crime figures and Minnesota's ruling Farmer-Labor Party. Liggett was beaten up, prosecuted for a non-existent rape incident, and finally died after being machine gunned in the alley behind his home on December 9, 1935. His wife and daughter witnessed the assassination as did several neighbors. All identified Kid Cann as the shooter. Kid Cann was indicted by a grand jury, but poor investigative work and a careless trial meant that he was acquitted. Liggett's widow would always believe that Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson was deeply implicated in the murder. Her husband had repeatedly accused the governor of corruption.|$|E

50|$|The {{period from}} August to December 1822 seemed <b>quieter,</b> <b>but</b> farmers {{attributed}} {{the death of}} cattle and sheep in the Eyjafjörður area to poisoning from this eruption, which modern analysis identifies as fluoride poisoning.
