5|$|Drusus' first {{office was}} that of <b>quaestor</b> in AD 10. Being {{politically}} inclined, he was made a permanent member of the Senate committee Augustus had founded in AD 13 to draw up the Senate's daily business.|$|E
5|$|His son Theodore, nicknamed Kontocheres or Zetonoumios, {{would succeed}} him as magister officiorum in 566, {{after a brief}} {{interval}} where the post was held by the <b>quaestor</b> sacri palatii ("Quaestor of the Sacred Palace") Anastasius. He held the post until some time before 576, being appointed as comes sacrarum largitionum ("Count of the Sacred Largess") thereafter; in the same year, he also led an unsuccessful embassy to Persia to end the ongoing war over the Caucasus.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{a series}} of {{potential}} heirs {{seem to have been}} selected, among them Tiberius and his brother Drusus. In 24BC at the age of seventeen Tiberius entered politics under Augustus' direction, receiving the position of <b>quaestor,</b> and was granted the right to stand for election as praetor and consul five years in advance of the age required by law. Similar provisions were made for Drusus.|$|E
50|$|Sulla also {{increased}} the number of <b>quaestors</b> to 20. <b>Quaestors</b> were the least powerful in the senatorial magistracy.|$|R
50|$|The Senate has a College of <b>Quaestors,</b> which {{consists}} of three Senators who {{are in charge of}} Senate housekeeping. These Senators, who are known as <b>Quaestors,</b> are responsible for the financial management of the Senate, they {{have to make sure that}} the necessary equipment and facilities are available and they advise the Bureau on matters relating to the administration of the services of the Senate, such as human resources and logistics. The <b>Quaestors</b> are also members of the Bureau. The Colleges of <b>Quaestors</b> of the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives meet regularly to settle common problems concerning the library, buildings, security, catering, etc.|$|R
50|$|The Chamber of the Representatives has, {{just like}} the Senate a College of <b>Quaestors,</b> which {{consists}} of five representatives who are elected by the plenary assembly for a duration of two years. The <b>Quaestors</b> {{are in charge of}} the housekeeping of the Chamber, they are also responsible for matters such as human resources and computers. The Colleges of <b>Quaestors</b> of the Senate and the Chamber meet regularly to settle common problems concerning the library, buildings, security, catering, etc.|$|R
5|$|The {{office of}} <b>quaestor</b> was {{considered}} the lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which <b>quaestor</b> accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} public treasury, (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, the treasury. In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in the treasury. The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, who handled the actual accounting for the treasury. The treasury was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in the treasury {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, Justinian {{appointed}} the <b>quaestor</b> Tribonian to oversee this task. The {{first draft of}} the Codex Iustinianus, a codification of imperial constitutions from the 2nd century onward, was issued on 7 April 529. (The final version appeared in 534.) It {{was followed by the}} Digesta (or Pandectae), a compilation of older legal texts, in 533, and by the Institutiones, a textbook explaining the principles of law. The Novellae, a collection of new laws issued during Justinian's reign, supplements the Corpus. As opposed {{to the rest of the}} corpus, the Novellae appeared in Greek, the common language of the Eastern Empire.|$|E
5|$|Just as Agrippa's sons were, Drusus {{was about}} the same age as Germanicus, and both of them also {{followed}} parallel careers. Drusus and Germanicus held all their offices at the same age, and progressed through the cursus honorum at the same pace. Both held the office of <b>quaestor</b> at the same age, both were exempted from holding the praetorship, they held their first and second consulships at the same age, and both were given proconsular imperium maius when they were sent to govern Germania and Illyricum respectively.|$|E
5000|$|In the Roman Republic, <b>quaestors</b> {{were elected}} {{officials}} who supervised the treasury and financial {{affairs of the}} state, its armies and its officers. The <b>quaestors</b> tasked with financial supervision were also called , because they oversaw the [...] (public treasury) in the Temple of Saturn. The earliest origins of the office is obscure, but by about 420 BC there were four <b>quaestors</b> elected each year by the [...] (Assembly of the People). After 267 BC, the number was expanded to ten.|$|R
25|$|It {{would seem}} that in the reign of Claudius (AD 41-54) the <b>quaestors</b> had become {{responsible}} for the paving of the streets of Rome, or at least shared that responsibility with the quattuorviri viarum. It {{has been suggested that}} the <b>quaestors</b> were obliged to buy their right to an official career by personal outlay on the streets. There was certainly no lack of precedents for this enforced liberality, and the change made by Claudius may have been a mere change {{in the nature of the}} expenditure imposed on the <b>quaestors.</b>|$|R
50|$|When Augustus became emperor, forty <b>Quaestors</b> {{were elected}} each year, but Augustus reduced this number to twenty. Augustus then divided {{the college of}} <b>Quaestors</b> into two divisions, and {{assigned}} one division the task of serving in the senatorial provinces, and the other the task of managing civil administration in Rome. The <b>Quaestors</b> who {{were assigned to the}} provinces (quaestores pro praetore) managed funds given to the province by the senate or the emperor. The two Urban <b>Quaestors</b> (quaestores urbani) had authority over the treasury in Rome (aerarium Saturni), which functioned as a depository for both state funds and official documents. In 56 AD the <b>Quaestors</b> lost their authority over state funds, but retained their authority over official documents. Julius Caesar had increased the number of Aediles to six, and while Augustus retained this number, he also transferred control of the grain supply from the Aediles to a board of commissioners. It wasn't until after they lost the power to maintain order in the city, however, that they truly became powerless, and the office disappeared entirely during the 3rd century.|$|R
5|$|Little {{was done}} to either secure or {{indicate}} how his succession was to take place; the Julians and their supporters had fallen to the wrath of Sejanus, and his own sons and immediate family were dead. Two of the candidates were either Caligula, the sole surviving son of Germanicus, or his own grandson, Tiberius Gemellus. However, only a half-hearted attempt {{at the end of}} Tiberius' life was made to make Caligula a <b>quaestor,</b> and thus give him some credibility as a possible successor, while Gemellus himself was still only a teenager and thus completely unsuitable for some years to come.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus reaped {{political}} {{benefit for}} having {{put down the}} rebellion. Both Crassus and Pompey returned to Rome with their legions and refused to disband them, instead encamping outside Rome. Both men stood for the consulship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because of his youth and lack of service as praetor or <b>quaestor.</b> Nonetheless, both men were elected consul for 70 BC, {{partly due to the}} implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.|$|E
5|$|From c. 57 to 59, Titus was a {{military}} tribune in Germania, and later served in Britannia. His first wife, Arrecina Tertulla, died two years after their marriage, in 65. Titus then took a new wife of a more distinguished family, Marcia Furnilla. However, Marcia's family was {{closely linked to the}} opposition to Emperor Nero. Her uncle Barea Soranus and his daughter Servilia were among those who were killed after the failed Pisonian conspiracy of 65. Some modern historians theorize that Titus divorced his wife because of her family's connection to the conspiracy. He never remarried. Titus appears to have had multiple daughters, {{at least one of them}} by Marcia Furnilla. The only one known to have survived to adulthood was Julia Flavia, perhaps Titus's child by Arrecina, whose mother was also named Julia. During this period Titus also practiced law and attained the rank of <b>quaestor.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} career of Vespasian included {{the offices of}} <b>quaestor,</b> aedile, and praetor, and culminated with a consulship in 51, the year of Domitian's birth. As a military commander, Vespasian gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43. Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family {{at the time of}} Domitian's upbringing, even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors Caligula (37–41) and Nero (54–68). Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a propaganda campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and to maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius (41–54) and his son Britannicus.|$|E
5|$|The {{successes in}} Illyricum were {{followed}} by the defeat of Varus at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. As proconsul, Germanicus was dispatched with Tiberius to defend the empire against the Germans in AD 11. The two generals crossed the Rhine, made various excursions into enemy territory and, {{in the beginning of}} autumn, recrossed the river. The campaigns of Tiberius and Germanicus in Germania in the years 10/11–13 AD, combined with the alliance with the Marcomannic federation of Marbod effectively prevented the anti-Roman Germanic coalition led by Arminius from crossing the Rhine and invading Gaul and Italy. In winter, Germanicus returned to Rome, where he was appointed consul for the year AD 12, after five mandates as <b>quaestor,</b> and despite never having been aedile or praetor. He shared the consulship with Gaius Fonteius Capito.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Augustus, Germanicus enjoyed an {{accelerated}} political career as the heir of the emperor's heir, entering the office of <b>quaestor</b> five years before the legal age in AD 7. He held that office until AD 11, and was elected consul {{for the first time}} in AD 12. The year after, he was made proconsul of Germania Inferior, Germania Superior, and all of Gaul. From there he commanded eight legions, about one-third of the entire Roman army, which he led against the Germanic tribes in his campaigns from AD 14 to 16. He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the Teutoberg Forest and retrieved two of the three legionary eagles that had been lost during the battle. In AD 17 he returned to Rome where he received a triumph before leaving to reorganize the provinces of Asia Minor, whereby he incorporated the provinces of Cappadocia and Commagene in AD 18.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} <b>quaestors</b> were [...] (<b>quaestors</b> with judicial power), {{an office}} {{dating back to}} the Kingdom of Rome. [...] were chosen to investigate capital crimes, and may have been appointed as needed rather than holding a permanent position.

5|$|Germanicus {{was given}} the title of <b>quaestor</b> in AD 7, five years before the legal age of 25, and in that year was sent to assist Tiberius {{in the war against}} the Pannonians and Dalmatians. According to Cassius Dio, Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum because Tiberius' lack of {{activity}} made Augustus suspect that he was delaying to remain under arms as long as possible under the pretense of war. Germanicus brought an army of levied citizens and manumitted slaves that were bought from their masters to reinforce Tiberius in Siscia, his base of operations in Illyricum. In late autumn/early winter additional reinforcements arrived at Siscia from Moesia and the East: three legions from Moesia led by Aulus Caecina Severus and two from Anatolia led by Silvanus with Thracian cavalry and auxiliary troops. While this did show that Augustus took the threat seriously, Tiberius had some soldiers sent back, because he had more than he needed.|$|E
5|$|The tomb of Archimedes {{carried a}} {{sculpture}} illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, {{consisting of a}} sphere and a cylinder of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman orator Cicero was serving as <b>quaestor</b> in Sicily. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, {{but none of the}} locals were able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription. A tomb discovered in the courtyard of the Hotel Panorama in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes, but there was no compelling evidence for this and the location of his tomb today is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Around 38 AD, Vespasian married Domitilla the Elder, the {{daughter}} of an equestrian from Ferentium. They had two sons, Titus Flavius Vespasianus (born in 39) and Titus Flavius Domitianus (born in 51), and a daughter, Domitilla (born in 45). Domitilla the Elder died before Vespasian became emperor. Thereafter his mistress Caenis was his wife in all but name until she died in 74. The political career of Vespasian included the offices of <b>quaestor,</b> aedile and praetor, and culminated with a consulship in 51, the year Domitian was born. As a military commander, he gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43. Nevertheless, ancient sources allege poverty for the Flavian family at the time of Domitian's upbringing, even claiming Vespasian had fallen into disrepute under the emperors Caligula (3741) and Nero (5468). Modern history has refuted these claims, suggesting these stories were later circulated under Flavian rule as part of a propaganda campaign to diminish success under the less reputable Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, and maximize achievements under Emperor Claudius (4154) and his son Britannicus. By all appearances, imperial favour for the Flavians was high throughout the 40s and 60s. While Titus received a court education in the company of Britannicus, Vespasian pursued a successful political and military career. Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s, he returned to public office under Nero, serving as proconsul of the Africa province in 63, and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of Greece in 66.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of his}} reforms, in 539 Emperor Justinian I created another office named <b>quaestor</b> or {{alternatively}} quaesitor (Greek: κυαισίτωρ) who was given police and judicial powers in Constantinople, and also tasked with the supervision of new arrivals to the imperial capital. By {{the turn of the}} 9th century, the original <b>quaestor</b> had lost most of his former duties to other officials, chiefly the logothetēs tou dromou and the epi tōn deēseōn. The functions of the middle Byzantine <b>quaestor</b> were essentially those of the quaesitor: {{he was one of the}} kritai ("judges") of Constantinople. However, as John B. Bury notes, an examination of his subordinate staff, and the fact that it could be held by a eunuch, shows that the later office was the direct continuation of the <b>quaestor</b> sacri palatii.|$|E
25|$|The skribas (Greek: σκρίβας), {{the direct}} {{successor}} of the scriba, a notary {{attached to the}} late antique official known as magister census, {{who was responsible for}} wills.

It is known from legislation that the skribas represented the <b>quaestor</b> in supervising the provisions of wills as regards minors.|$|E
25|$|In 205 BC, Cato was {{appointed}} <b>Quaestor,</b> {{and in the}} next year (204 BC) he entered upon the duties of his place of work, following Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major to Sicily. When Scipio, after much opposition, obtained from the senate permission to transport armed forces from Sicily to Africa, Cato and Gaius Laelius were appointed to escort the baggage ships. Yet there proved not to be the friendliness of cooperation between Cato and Scipio which ought to have existed between a <b>quaestor</b> and his proconsul.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} republic, {{there were two}} <b>quaestors,</b> and their duties were {{maintaining}} the public treasury, both taking in funds and deciding who to pay them to.
