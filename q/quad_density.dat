5000|$|... 8- and -inch floppy disks were {{available}} with both soft sectoring and hard sectoring. Because of the similarity in magnetic characteristics between some disk types, {{it was possible}} to use an incorrectly certified disk in a soft sectored drive. <b>Quad</b> <b>density</b> -inch disks were rare, so it was not uncommon to use higher quality double density disks, which were usually capable of sustaining the 96 TPI formatting of <b>quad</b> <b>density,</b> in drives such as the Commodore 8050.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} variants, {{including}} the Superbrain II, Superbrain II Jr., [...] "QD" [...] (<b>quad</b> <b>density</b> disk drives) and [...] "SD" [...] (super density) models.|$|E
50|$|The DCT and DST formats yielded {{relatively}} high capacity and speed for data and video. Double-density DST data storage {{was introduced in}} 1996. The final generation of these products were <b>quad</b> <b>density,</b> introduced in 2000, resulting in a large cartridge holding 660GB of data.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quad</b> <b>density</b> (QD or 4D) doubles {{capacity}} over DD by {{narrowing the}} width of tracks to 0.160 mm for a density of 96 tpi. Some manufacturers (Micropolis, Tandon, Micro Peripherals (MPI), Teac) used a track density of 100 tpi for quad-density drives, which were incompatible with 96 tpi models.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the standard 48 track-per-inch 5.25" [...] drives, the CS6 was available in a version with 96 track-per-inch drives (<b>quad</b> <b>density)</b> for DEC Rainbow and Tandy 2000 formats. A 3.5" [...] drive version could copy Amiga, Apple Macintosh and Unidisk, IBM PC Convertible, and other standard 3.5" [...] formats.|$|E
50|$|Sakya {{went to the}} US in 1981. He {{worked in}} {{developing}} floppy disk controllers with 900Kb (<b>quad</b> <b>density)</b> storage space. As there were no I/O cards, after {{he came back from}} the US, he made I/O cards required for the hard disk. He also designed microprocessor-based traffic controllers in Kathmandu. Back in his own country, he opened the first company for manufacturing computer cards, Sun Moon Computer Industry, in 1995, and also established Hi-Tech Pioneer Ltd, an Internet Service Provider.|$|E
5000|$|Micropolis's first advance was to {{take the}} {{existing}} 48 tpi (tracks per inch) standard created by Shugart Associates, and double both the track density and track recording density to get four times the total storage on a 5.25-inch floppy in the [...] "MetaFloppy" [...] series with <b>quad</b> <b>density</b> (Drives :1054, :1053, and :1043) around 1980. Micropolis pioneered 100 tpi density because of the attraction of an exact 100 tracks to the inch. [...] "Micropolis-compatible" [...] 5.25-inch 77-track diskette drives were also manufactured by Tandon (TM100-3M and TM100-4M). Such drives were used in a number of computers like in a Vector Graphic S-100 bus computer, the Durango F-85 and in a few Commodore disk drives (8050, 8250, 8250LP and SFD-1001).|$|E
