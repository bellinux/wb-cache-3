5|$|Ceria is {{the most}} widely used {{compound}} of cerium. The main application of ceria is as a polishing compound, for example in chemical-mechanical planarization (CMP). In this application, ceria has replaced other metal oxides for the production of high-quality optical surfaces. Major automotive applications for the lower sesquioxide are as a catalytic converter for the oxidation of CO and NOx emissions in the exhaust gases from motor vehicles, Cerium(IV) sulfate is used as an oxidising agent in <b>quantitative</b> <b>analysis.</b> Cerium(IV) in methanesulfonic acid solutions is applied in industrial scale electrosynthesis as a recyclable oxidant. Ceric ammonium nitrate is used as an oxidant in organic chemistry and in etching electronic components, and as a primary standard for <b>quantitative</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|E

He further broke down the 747 short pieces by their primary subjects as follows. 29% were on biogeography and natural history, 27% were on evolutionary theory, 25% were social commentary, 12% were on Anthropology, and 7% were on spiritualism and phrenology.

We highlight how a number of activities which are central to <b>quantitative</b> data <b>analysis,</b> referred to as ‘data management’, can benefit from e-infrastructural support. We conclude by discussing how these issues are relevant to the DAMES (Data Management through e-Social Science) research Node, an ongoing project that aims to develop e-Infrastructural resources for <b>quantitative</b> data <b>analysis</b> {{in the social}} sciences...|$|R

5|$|The {{results of}} {{paleontology}} have {{also contributed to}} the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used <b>quantitative</b> <b>analysis</b> to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by the advocates of evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis. In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the contribution of design thinking to <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> in the manufacturing of jet engines focusing on human factors. Prior studies on <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> in this industry do not refer {{to the use of}} design thinking, and therefore no prior literature has covered design-thinking application on <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> In order to obtain the risk factors, the authors conducted an interview with experienced technicians in jet engine manufacturing. An affinity diagram classified the data obtained and then a Bayesian network was constructed considering the interdependency among the risk factors. The technique was validated by prototyping the network. Results indicate that the design thinking is an adequate technique for human factors risk analysis in preparation for <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> The benefits of the technique are evident and have practical implications for specialists dealing with the identification of human factor risk factors in the <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> design thinking; <b>quantitative</b> risk analysis; human factors; jet engines; jet engine manufacturing; risk assessment; Bayesian networks; aircraft mmanufacturing; aerospace industry...|$|R

40|$|The high hazard {{mechanical}} system (HHMS) has three characteristics in the petroleum and petrochemical industry (PPI) : high risk, high cost, and high technology requirements. For a HHMS, part, component, and subsystem failures {{will result in}} varying degrees and various types of risk consequences, including unexpected downtime, production losses, economic costs, safety accidents, and environmental pollution. Thus, obtaining the quantitative risk level and distribution in a HHMS to control major risk accidents and ensure safe production is of vital importance. However, {{the structure of the}} HHMS is more complex than some other systems, making the <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> process more difficult. Additionally, a variety of uncertain risk data hinder the realization of <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis.</b> A few <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> techniques and studies for HHMS exist, especially in the PPI. Therefore, a study on the <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> method for HHMS was completed to obtain the risk level and distribution of high-risk objects. Firstly, Fuzzy Set Theory (FST) was applied to address the uncertain risk data for the occurrence probability (OP) and consequence severity (CS) in the risk analysis process. Secondly, a fuzzy fault tree analysis (FFTA) and a fuzzy event tree analysis (FETA) were used to achieve <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> and calculation. Thirdly, a fuzzy bow-tie model (FBTM) was established to obtain a quantitative risk assessment result according to the analysis results of the FFTA and FETA. Finally, the feasibility and practicability of the method were verified with a case study on the <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> of one reciprocating pump system (RPS). The <b>quantitative</b> risk <b>analysis</b> method for HHMS can provide more accurate and scientific data support for the development of Asset Integrity Management (AIM) systems in the PPI...|$|R
