5|$|Islamic feminists {{advocate}} women's rights, gender equality, {{and social}} justice grounded within an Islamic framework. Advocates seek to highlight the deeply rooted teachings of equality in the Quran and encourage a <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patriarchal interpretation of Islamic teaching through the Quran, hadith (sayings of Muhammad), and sharia (law) towards {{the creation of a}} more equal and just society. Although rooted in Islam, the movement's pioneers have also utilized secular and Western feminist discourses and recognize the role of Islamic feminism as part of an integrated global feminist movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{rejection}} of traditional forms and structures for poetry {{that began in}} the first half of the 20th century coincided with a <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> purpose and meaning of traditional definitions of poetry and of distinctions between poetry and prose, particularly given examples of poetic prose and prosaic poetry. Numerous modernist poets have written in non-traditional forms or in what traditionally would have been considered prose, although their writing was generally infused with poetic diction and often with rhythm and tone established by non-metrical means. While there was a substantial formalist reaction within the modernist schools to the breakdown of structure, this reaction focused as much on the development of new formal structures and syntheses as on the revival of older forms and structures.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{his books}} he wrote {{frequently}} for The Dublin Review, The Month, and other periodicals, both English and American, and read papers before The Manchester Statistical Society, The Catholic Truth Society, and other bodies. A {{considerable number of}} his later essays and lectures dealing with contemporary social problems were issued by The Catholic Truth Society in pamphlet form. His last book, The Key to the World's Progress, was published in 1906. This, unlike his earlier works, is directly apologetic, being an elaborate defence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Church written {{with a view to}} meeting <b>the</b> difficulties and <b>questionings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> twentieth century. A popular edition was issued after his death.|$|R

5|$|Albert {{seems to}} have {{received}} Luther's letter with the Theses {{around the end of}} November. He requested the opinion of theologians at the University of Mainz and conferred with his advisers. His advisers recommended he have Luther prohibited from preaching against indulgences in accordance with the indulgence bull. Albert requested such action from the Roman Curia. In Rome, Luther was immediately perceived as a threat. In February 1518, Pope Leo asked the head of the Augustinian Hermits, Luther's religious order, to convince him to stop spreading his ideas about indulgences. Sylvester Mazzolini was also appointed to write an opinion which would be used in the trial against him. Mazzolini wrote A Dialogue against Martin Luther's Presumptuous Theses concerning the Power of the Pope, which focused on Luther's <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pope's authority rather than his complaints about indulgence preaching. Luther received a summons to Rome in August 1518. He responded with Explanations of the Disputation Concerning the Value of Indulgences, in which he attempted to clear himself of the charge that he was attacking the pope. As he set down his views more extensively, Luther {{seems to have}} recognized that the implications of his beliefs set him further from official teaching than he initially knew. He later said he might not have begun the controversy had he known where it would lead. The Explanations have been called Luther's first Reformation work.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} {{of two major}} parallel dimensions, like time periods in Chrono Trigger, {{plays a significant role}} in the game. Players must go back and forth between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another—for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in the other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment. Rounding out the notable facets of Chrono Crosss gameplay are the New Game+ option and multiple endings. As in Chrono Trigger, players who have completed the game may choose to start the game over using data from the previous session. Character levels, learned techniques, equipment, and items gathered copy over, while acquired money and some story-related items are discarded. On a New Game+, players can access twelve endings. Scenes viewed depend on players' progress in the game before the final battle, which can be fought at any time in a New Game+ file.|$|E

25|$|Brown remains {{controversial}} among traditionalist Catholics {{because of}} their claim that he denied <b>the</b> inerrancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> scripture and cast doubt on <b>the</b> historical accuracy <b>of</b> numerous articles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Catholic faith. Some conservatives were angered at his <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> whether <b>the</b> virginal conception <b>of</b> Jesus could be proven historically. He was regarded as occupying the center ground in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> biblical studies, opposing the literalism found among many fundamentalist Christians while not carrying his conclusions as far as many other scholars.|$|R
25|$|The first {{publication}} produced from the couple's collaboration was a monograph of the myelination of the anterior {{part of the}} brain in the cat. The finding led to the Vogts' <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German neurologist Paul Flechsig's doctrine of association centers. Together they pursued advanced neuropathological research, publishing their findings on both cyto- and myelo-architecture in the central nervous system and on the functional anatomy of the basal ganglia.|$|E

25|$|Sonia Brownell then {{commissioned}} Bernard Crick, {{a professor}} of politics at the University of London, to complete a biography and asked Orwell's friends to co-operate. Crick collated {{a considerable amount of}} material in his work, which was published in 1980, but his <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> factual accuracy of Orwell's first-person writings led to conflict with Brownell, and she tried to suppress the book. Crick concentrated on the facts of Orwell's life rather than his character, and presented primarily a political perspective on Orwell's life and work.|$|E
25|$|Criticisms of {{marriage}} are arguments against the practical or moral {{value of the}} institution of matrimony or particular forms of matrimony. These have included the effects that marriage has on individual liberty, equality between the sexes, the relation between marriage and violence, philosophical questions about how much control can a government have over its population, the amount of control a person has over another, the financial risk when measured against the divorce rate, and <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> necessity {{to have a relationship}} sanctioned by government or religious authorities.|$|E
25|$|After 1881, {{with the}} mass {{immigration}} of Eastern European Jews to the United States, B'nai B'rith sponsored Americanization classes, trade schools and relief programs. This began {{a period of}} rapid membership growth, {{a change in the}} system of representation and <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> secret rituals common to fraternal organizations. In 1897, when the organization's U.S. membership numbered slightly more than 18,000, B'nai B'rith formed a ladies' auxiliary chapter in San Francisco. This was to become B'nai B'rith Women, which in 1988 broke away as an independent organization, Jewish Women International.|$|E
40|$|In La Mothe Le Vayer’s Dialogues Made in Imitation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients, Nature, studied {{from various}} aspects, appears in {{particular}} as <b>the</b> object <b>of</b> physics. However, if the Dialogues claim to reject skeptically all physics, in fact Aristotle is particularly concerned. Specifically, three approaches converge in a <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> Aristotelian scholasticism. <b>The</b> {{first is to}} use Aristotle’s physics against metaphysics and theology. The second is to question this very Aristotelian physics by attacking its principles. The third is to put forward <b>the</b> critique <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aristotelian cosmos led by Copernicanism. While most authors quoted by La Mothe Le Vayer are chosen among <b>the</b> philosophers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Antiquity, the text is still enrolled in <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> Aristotelianism in <b>the</b> first seventeenth century, and part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions for <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a &# 34;new science&# 34;.

25|$|The Black Egyptian {{hypothesis}} {{is held by}} various authors that ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa and a Black civilization. This includes a particular focus on links to Sub Saharan cultures and the <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race of specific notable individuals from Dynastic times, including Tutankhamun and the king represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza, and Cleopatra. Since {{the second half of}} the 20th century, typological and hierarchical models of race have increasingly been rejected by scientists, and most scholars have held that applying modern notions of race to ancient Egypt is anachronistic.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November, at {{the request}} of Burakov and Fetisov, Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, the {{psychiatrist}} who had written the 1985 psychological profile of the then-unknown killer, was invited to assist in the <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suspect. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo. Within two hours, Chikatilo burst into tears and confessed to Bukhanovsky that he was indeed guilty of the crimes for which he had been arrested. After conversing into the evening, Bukhanovsky reported to Burakov and Fetisov that Chikatilo was ready to confess.|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{with the}} Council of Trent in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation as {{an answer to}} the Reformation, a {{large-scale}} <b>questioning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. (This loss of confidence then led to major shifts of power away from the Church.) Under the popes from Pius IV to Sixtus V, Rome became the centre of the reformed Catholicism and saw the instalment of new monuments which celebrated the papacy's restored greatness. The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.|$|E
