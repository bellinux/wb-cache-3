60|$|At {{the table}} Carl carried Ruth off in talk, {{like a young}} Lochinvar out of the Middle West. Around them was the storm of highballs and brandy and club soda, {{theatrical}} talk, and a confused mass of cigar-smoke, shirt-fronts, white shoulders, and drab waiters; yet here was a <b>quiet</b> <b>refuge</b> for the eternal force of life....|$|E
60|$|When he was {{relieved}} of the perplexed affairs that nothing would make plain, through having them returned upon his hands by a dozen agents in succession who could make neither beginning, middle, nor end of them or him, he found his miserable place of <b>refuge</b> a <b>quieter</b> <b>refuge</b> {{than it had been}} before. He had unpacked the portmanteau long ago; and his elder children now played regularly about the yard, and everybody knew the baby, and claimed a kind of proprietorship in her.|$|R
60|$|She {{remained}} silent, shrinking back trembling in her corner; {{and after}} waiting {{a while and}} getting no answer he went grumbling away, and presently she heard him go out at the street door. Then she sprang to her feet, and stood for a while intently listening, with a terror and hatred of this man stronger {{than she had ever}} felt before urging her to fly and place herself for ever beyond his reach. Somewhere in this great city she might find a hiding-place; it was so vast; in all directions the great thoroughfares stretched away into the infinite distance, bright all night with the flaring gas and filled with crowds of people and the noise of traffic; and branching off from the thoroughfares there were streets, hundreds and thousands of streets, leading away into black silent lanes and <b>quiet</b> <b>refuges,</b> in the shadow of vast silent buildings, and arches, and gateways, where she might lie down and rest in safety. So strong on her was this sudden impulse to fly, that she would have acted on it had not Mrs. Clark returned at that moment to the room.|$|R

Initially, Portola Valley was an exclusive vacation community for wealthy San Franciscans who would make trips down during the summer in horse and buggy.

50|$|Great Mell Fell is a <b>quiet</b> {{place of}} <b>refuge</b> within the {{surrounding}} agricultural land, for wildlife {{as well as}} for walkers. The sheltered lower eastern slopes are well covered by mixed woods of oak, rowan, birch, holly and Scots pine. Within the trees badgers and roe deer live, and green woodpeckers nest. It is said that the last wild cat in Cumberland was snared here in the nineteenth century.|$|R
2500|$|Architectural Digest {{included}} the memorial in {{its list of}} the [...] "Ten Most Significant Memorial Buildings" [...] and said, [...] "Rather than rising heroically, the memorial is meant to evoke the unspeakable, anonymous drama of deportation—its entrance a descending stairway." [...] Fodor's called the memorial [...] "stark" [...] and [...] "evocative". The Guardian published a description by one of its readers, who noted the memorial's obscurity and called it [...] "small, stark and savagely detailed... which goes unnoticed by the thousands of tourists who take selfies of themselves {{in front of the}} adjoining cathedral every day. It is a place for tears and <b>quiet</b> contemplation; a <b>refuge</b> from the crowds and a reminder of one of the darkest episodes in recent history." ...|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic sounds {{influence}} animal vocal behaviour, species distributions, {{and community}} assemblages. Natural sounds {{also have the}} potential to affect the behaviour and ecology of animals, but it is currently unknown if the effects of natural sounds match those of anthropogenic sounds. Here, we quantified and compared the effects of natural and anthropogenic sounds on avian song performance by calculating trade-off frontiers based on trill rate and bandwidth of 2 emberizid species. Chipping sparrows (Spizella passerina) and white-crowned sparrows (Zonotrichia luecophrys) were recorded in areas with and without anthropogenic sound and along a natural sounds gradient generated from ocean surf, respectively. We analysed individuals’ song performance relative to the trade-off frontier and found that both species vocalizing in environments with louder background sounds sang songs that were significantly further below the trade-off frontier than songs sung by birds in quiet settings. Chipping sparrows vocalizing in noisy areas sang almost twice as far below the trade-off frontier than individuals in quiet areas, and white-crowned sparrow song performance declined by ~ 25 % with each 3 dB(A) increase in environmental sounds, or halving the size of a signaller’s listening area. These results suggest that natural and anthropogenic sounds can {{have a significant effect on}} song performance, a trait known to influence the outcome of malemale contests and influence female mate choices. Considering that natural sounds are pervasive, <b>quiet</b> acoustic <b>refuges</b> may be far more important than previously thought, and anthropogenic development may be infringing on larger portions of prime habitat than we realize...|$|R

5000|$|... "Betancourt's third, and longest, {{period of}} exile {{was a time}} of {{enormous}} frustration. In the prime of his life --for roughly the decade of his forties-- he was forced into relative inactivity and obscurity. He traveled extensively, living in Cuba, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico, and remained a leader of an opposition-in-exile to the Perez Jimenez dictatorship. And of course wrote 'Venezuela: Oil and Politics'. A beach home outside of San Juan (Puerto Rico) provided a <b>quiet</b> <b>refuge</b> for this work," [...] wrote Franklin Tugwell in his Introduction to the 1978 English publication of Betancourt's book.|$|E
40|$|Medina, as {{the second}} holy city for Muslims {{around the world and}} a place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) lived and is buried, has a {{distinctive}} identity. On the contrary, however, {{the central part of the}} city, the area where the old city was located, has lost its traditional identity in favour of globalization and modernization. One major factor that affects a location’s sense of place is the absence of public space and green space. In other words, the negligence of the public space’s role in reviving and restoring the identity of a place results in a sense of non-place. For many visitors to Medina, the current state (the contemporary urban setting) of the central city fails to match their expectations. Inserting an urban park (public space) within the area will enhance and help conserve the place’s identity, meet visitors’ visions, and allow more social interactions among visitors and locals. My design proposal is to create an urban park and a public space located at the periphery of the Prophet’s Mosque. The park will offer visitors a <b>quiet</b> place of <b>refuge</b> within the busy surrounding urban context and will demonstrate the location’s identity through shading structures. The program will consist of shading structures, mobile eateries, seating areas, public space, and vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The present article {{describes}} the contributions of three preservationists – Alice Mabel Gray, Dorothy Richardson Buell, and Naomi Ireland Svihla. Each of these women resided in Ogden Dunes {{at some point in}} their lives, loved the natural beauty of the area, and contributed to the preservation of the sand dunes of Northwest Indiana. Alice Gray did so by bringing attention to the Dunes at a time when critical efforts were being made to preserve them as part of the Indiana Dunes State Park. Dorothy Buell founded the Save the Dunes Council that successfully preserved parts of the dunes in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and Naomi Svihla added her efforts to the Save the Dunes Council in forming the National Lakeshore. She also served as an early board member and president of the Historical Society of Ogden Dunes, an organization dedicated to preserving the cultural history of Ogden Dunes. …we were in the grip of an almost irreversible force, which would overrun those who loved the dunes and sweep on to Michigan City and beyond. Then we would have a continuous jungle of asphalt and steel, with pollution of air and water, with no place for the millions of pent-up city folk to seek <b>refuge,</b> <b>quiet</b> and renewal. It seemed impossible to stop this movement…. (Douglas, 1971, pp. 76 - 77). Alice Mabel Gray, Dorothy Richardson Buell, and Naomi Ireland Svihla, residents of Ogden Dunes...|$|R

Andy tells the farmer the truth so when the Shop arrives, {{he is ready to}} stand with them. However, he soon sees that there is no need since Charlie makes quick work of the agents who have invaded the <b>quiet</b> <b>refuge</b> they have found. They again are on the run, but Andy is weak from the use of his gift. They go to their secluded cabin to rest and prepare to finally go public with their story.
