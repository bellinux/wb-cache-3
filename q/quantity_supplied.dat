25|$|Market {{equilibrium}} occurs where <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> equals quantity demanded, {{the intersection}} of the supply and demand curves in the figure above. At a price below equilibrium, {{there is a shortage of}} <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> compared to quantity demanded. This is posited to bid the price up. At a price above equilibrium, there is a surplus of <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> compared to quantity demanded. This pushes the price down. The model of supply and demand predicts that for given supply and demand curves, price and quantity will stabilize at the price that makes <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> equal to quantity demanded. Similarly, demand-and-supply theory predicts a new price-quantity combination from a shift in demand (as to the figure), or in supply.|$|E

The farming accelerated during the 1980s as {{the quantity of}} shrimp demand exceeded the <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied,</b> and as excessive bycatch and threats to endangered sea turtle became associated with trawling for wild shrimp. In 2007, the production of farmed shrimp exceeded the capture of wild shrimp.|$|E
25|$|A supply {{schedule}} is a table {{that shows the}} relationship between the price of a good and the <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied.</b> Under the assumption of perfect competition, supply is determined by marginal cost.

25|$|In micro{{economic}}s, {{supply and}} demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good, or other traded item such as labor or liquid financial assets, will vary until it settles {{at a point where}} the quantity demanded (at the current price) will equal the <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> (at the current price), resulting in an economic equilibrium for price and quantity transacted.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{workers in}} 3D professions are well paid, {{due to the}} undesirability of the work, and the {{resulting}} need to pay higher wages to attract workers. This has allowed the uneducated and unskilled {{to earn a living}} wage by foregoing comfort, personal safety and social status. This concept proves itself in the economic theory of <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> and quantity demanded (see Quantity adjustment), the wages paid to these workers is higher due to the undesirable nature of their professions.|$|E
25|$|In theory, in a {{free market}} the {{aggregates}} (sum of) of quantity demanded by buyers and <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> by sellers may reach economic equilibrium over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent equilibrium, and any equilibrium reached {{may not necessarily be}} morally equitable. For example, if the supply of healthcare services is limited by external factors, the equilibrium price may be unaffordable for many who desire it but cannot pay for it.|$|E

Most economists, even most new classical economists, accepted the new Keynesian notion that for several reasons wages and prices do not move quickly and smoothly to the values needed for long-run equilibrium between <b>quantities</b> <b>supplied</b> and demanded. Therefore, they also accept the monetarist and new Keynesian view that monetary policy can have a considerable effect in the short run. The new classical macroeconomics contributed the rational expectations hypothesis {{and the idea of}} intertemporal optimisation to new Keynesian economics and the new neoclassical synthesis.|$|R
25|$|Supply is the {{relation}} between the price of a good and the quantity available for sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied.</b> Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be profit-maximizers, meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.|$|E
25|$|If {{the demand}} decreases, then the {{opposite}} happens: {{a shift of}} the curve to the left. If the demand starts at D2, and decreases to D1, the equilibrium price will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will also decrease. The <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> at each price {{is the same as}} before the demand shift, reflecting the fact that the supply curve has not shifted; but the equilibrium quantity and price are different {{as a result of the}} change (shift) in demand.|$|E

500|$|Cournot, a {{professor}} of mathematics, developed a mathematical treatment in 1838 for duopoly—a market condition defined by competition between two sellers. [...] This treatment of competition, first published in Researches into the Mathematical Principles of Wealth, {{is referred to as}} Cournot duopoly. It is assumed that both sellers had equal access to the market and could produce their goods without cost. [...] Further, it assumed that both goods were homogeneous. [...] Each seller would vary her output based on the output of the other and the market price would be determined by the total <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied.</b> [...] The profit for each firm would be determined by multiplying their output and the per unit Market price. [...] Differentiating the profit function with respect to <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> for each firm left a system of linear equations, the simultaneous solution of which gave the equilibrium quantity, price and profits. Cournot's contributions to the mathematization of economics would be neglected for decades, but eventually influenced many of the marginalists. [...] Cournot's models of duopoly and Oligopoly also represent one of the first formulations of non-cooperative games. [...] Today the solution can be given as a Nash equilibrium but Cournot's work preceded modern game theory by over 100 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{transport}} economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as [...] "one policy {{response to the}} problem of congestion", was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003: [...] "congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, highway capacity at a specific place and time. The <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it—and use it more wastefully—than they would if they had to pay a price that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users' willingness to pay for the resource".|$|E

This paper deals with a concrete problem of flour purchase by a company that manufactures bakery products and the purchasing price of flour depends on the quantity ordered. The criteria for supplier selection and <b>quantities</b> <b>supplied</b> by individual suppliers are: purchase costs, product quality and reliability of suppliers. The problem is solved using a model that combines revised weighting method and fuzzy multi-criteria linear programming (FMCLP).

2500|$|Economists also {{distinguish}} the short-run market supply curve from the long-run market supply curve. [...] In this context, {{two things are}} assumed constant by definition of the short run: the availability {{of one or more}} fixed inputs (typically physical capital), and the number of firms in the industry. [...] In the long run, firms have a chance to adjust their holdings of physical capital, enabling them to better adjust their <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> at any given price. Furthermore, in the long run potential competitors can enter or exit the industry in response to market conditions. [...] For both of these reasons, long-run market supply curves are generally flatter than their short-run counterparts.|$|E

The analysis shows that in the context of a two (identical) countries world, an increase {{in the size of the}} government in the home country can induce specialization in the production of the intermediate good.

2500|$|A firm's cost is an {{increasing}} function of the wage rate, the higher the wage rate, the fewer hours an employer will demand of employees. This is because, as the wage rate rises, it becomes more expensive for firms to hire workers and so firms hire fewer workers (or hire them for fewer hours). The demand of labor curve is therefore shown as a line moving down and to the right. Since higher wages increase the <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied,</b> the supply of labor curve is upward sloping, and is shown as a line moving up and to the right. [...] If no minimum wage is in place, wages will adjust until quantity of labor demanded is equal to <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied,</b> reaching equilibrium, where the supply and demand curves intersect. Minimum wage behaves as a classical price floor on labor. Standard theory says that, if set above the equilibrium price, more labor {{will be willing to}} be provided by workers than will be demanded by employers, creating a surplus of labor, i.e. unemployment. The basic economic model of markets predicts the same of other commodities (like milk and wheat, for example): Artificially raising the price of the commodity tends to cause the supply of it to increase and the demand for it to lessen. The result is a surplus of the commodity. When there is a wheat surplus, the government buys it. Since the government does not hire surplus labor, the labor surplus takes the form of unemployment, which tends to be higher with minimum wage laws than without them.|$|E
2500|$|When {{technological}} progress occurs, the supply curve shifts. [...] For example, assume that someone invents {{a better way}} of growing wheat so that the cost of growing a given quantity of wheat decreases. [...] Otherwise stated, producers will be willing to supply more wheat at every price and this shifts the supply curve S1 outward, to S2—an increase in supply. This increase in supply causes the equilibrium price to decrease from P1 to P2. The equilibrium quantity increases from Q1 to Q2 as consumers move along the demand curve to the new lower price. As a result of a supply curve shift, the price and the quantity move in opposite directions. [...] If the <b>quantity</b> <b>supplied</b> decreases, the opposite happens. If the supply curve starts at S2, and shifts leftward to S1, the equilibrium price will increase and the equilibrium quantity will decrease as consumers move along the demand curve to the new higher price and associated lower quantity demanded. The quantity demanded at each price is the same as before the supply shift, reflecting the fact that the demand curve has not shifted. But due to the change (shift) in supply, the equilibrium quantity and price have changed.|$|E
