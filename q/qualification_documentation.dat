Determination of the fundamental frequency for directional valve was carried out in all the three directions independently through exploratory vibration test as per ANSI B 16. 41 Annexure E (Para E- 3) to ascertain extent of flexibility as defined in the standard. The fire alarm panel was seismically qualified by using sinusoidal input motion in all the three directions independently to ascertain its capabilities to withstand the expected dynamic, seismic stresses and to ensure that the valves will not be subjected to performance degradation or malfunction under seismic conditions.

40|$|The Death of Contract {{collects}} Professor Gilmore 2 ̆ 7 s lectures {{given at}} Ohio State University Law School in 1970, with footnotes added to provide further explanation, <b>qualification,</b> and <b>documentation.</b> It {{is easy to}} tell that these were lectures, not because of their tone of urbane chattiness (Gilmore 2 ̆ 7 s gift of style makes {{some of his most}} technical work sound like Talleyrand 2 ̆ 7 s table talk), but because of the looseness of their design and casualness of their execution. The speaker frequently drops the thread of his narrative to break into anecdote or digression and, when he again picks up the narrative, it is not always by the same thread. But for all their informality these lectures are of extraordinary interest. They tell us how a great commercial lawyer (who is also a legal historian and contracts casebook editor) views what happened to the law of contract in the 20 th century. Though expounded with rare felicity and supported by an unusual breadth of historical learning, this perspective is, I believe, a common one among scholars of contract law. I shall be arguing here that it is also a fundamentally distorted one-not so much erroneous as myopic. But first, a summary of the book...|$|R

I chose to tackle this subject as I {{regard it as}} being very topical and interesting, bearing in mind that we are talking about spending high amounts of public cash by a contracting authority (such as state allowance organisation, territorial self-governing unit or the Czech Republic itself, etc.). The thesis includes four chapters as well as an introduction and a conclusion, each of them dealing with different aspects of the Act on Public Tenders. Chapter Two is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis: public tender, the contracting body, types of awarding procedures and basic principles of this procedure such as transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination. The chapter Three, referred to as Tender Documentation, is subdivided into five parts. It includes a definition of the basic institution in the first part, and the remaining parts deal with technical specifications, classification of subject-matter of public contract, supplying of tender documentation to economic operators and providing additional information to tender [...] ...|$|R

The Wellcome Trust Monitor is a unique survey of UK adults' (and in some waves, young people's) views around science and biomedical research. The findings {{are representative of the}} UK population and provide fresh and significant insights to inform science communication practice and how research priorities might be shaped, building {{a better understanding of the}} social context of biomedical research. The survey is repeated every three years and a large proportion of the questions recur in each wave. The aim of this tracking survey is to build a high-quality evidence base that explores trends and variations across time on both general scientific and medical themes and specific societal issues. This robust study also seeks to develop a more systematic approach to describing and understanding current interest in, attitudes towards and knowledge of science and biomedical research. There is flexibility within each wave to include a number of additional questions to explore new and topical areas of interest. Further information is available from the Wellcome Trust Monitor webpage. The Wellcome Trust Monitor 2, 2012 is the second survey in the series and was conducted in 2012 by Ipsos MORI. This wave of the survey was designed to provide comparability with findings from the baseline survey, carried out in 2009. The survey also aimed to build on the first wave, by refining the questionnaire and approach to maximise the level and quality of response from respondents. For the second edition (July 2014) two variables 'hedqual' and 'hedqualad' were replaced with variable 'hedqual_rev' and 'hedqualad_rev'. The new variables provide separate coding than 'item not applicable' for those respondents with no <b>qualifications.</b> See <b>documentation</b> for further details. Main Topics : The second Wellcome Trust Monitor questionnaire built heavily on the first, and comprised questions on the following topics: Adults and young people: media usage awareness of and interest in medical research knowledge of medical research engagement with medical research sources of information on medical research expectations and concerns for medical research scientific literacy attitudes towards vaccinations attitudes towards environment, nutrition and behaviour change awareness of and attitudes towards cognitive enhancing drugs understand of and attitudes towards genetic research Adults only: involvement in medical research attitudes to science governance Young people only: out-of-school science-related activities current education and future career aspirations experience of school science friends' and parents' interest in science attitudes to science as a career </ul...|$|R
5000|$|The various general {{contractors}} {{bidding on}} the project obtain copies of the bid (or tender) documents, and then put them out to multiple subcontractors for bids on sub-components of the project. Sub-components include items such as the concrete work, structural steel frame, electrical systems, HVAC, and landscaping. Questions may arise during the bid (or tender) period, and the architect will typically issue clarifications or corrections to the bid documents {{in the form of}} addenda. From these elements, the contractor compiles a complete bid (or [...] "tender price") for submission by the establish closing date and time (i.e., bid date). Bids can be based on the quantities of materials in the completed construction (e.g., as in the UK with bills of quantities), the operations needed to build it (e.g., as in operational bills), or simply as a lump sum cost; however, these bid requirements are elucidated within the bid documents. Once bids are received, the architect typically reviews the bids, seeks any clarifications required of the bidders, investigates contractor <b>qualifications,</b> ensures all <b>documentation</b> is in order (including bonding if required), and advises the owner as to the ranking of the bids. If the bids fall in a range acceptable to the owner, the owner and architect discuss the suitability of various bidders and their proposals. The owner is not obligated to accept the lowest bid, and it is customary for other factors including past performance and quality of other work to influence the selection process. However, the project is typically awarded to the general contractor with the lowest bid.|$|R
