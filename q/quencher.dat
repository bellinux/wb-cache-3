25|$|Molecular break light assay for DNA adenine methyltransferase {{activity}} – an assay {{that relies}} on the specificity of the restriction enzyme DpnI for fully methylated (adenine methylation) GATC sites in an oligonucleotide labeled with a fluorophore and <b>quencher.</b> The adenine methyltransferase methylates the oligonucleotide making it a substrate for DpnI. Cutting of the oligonucleotide by DpnI {{gives rise to a}} fluorescence increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} ethidium bromide's intense {{fluorescence}} after binding with DNA {{is probably not}} due to rigid stabilization of the phenyl , because the phenyl ring {{has been shown to}} project outside the intercalated bases. In fact, the phenyl group is found to be almost perpendicular to the plane of the ring system, as it rotates about its single bond to find a position where it will impinge upon the ring system minimally. Instead, the hydrophobic environment found between the base pairs is believed to be responsible. By moving into this hydrophobic environment and away from the solvent, the ethidium cation is forced to shed any water molecules that were associated with it. As water is a highly efficient fluorescent <b>quencher,</b> the removal of these water molecules allows the ethidium to fluoresce.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Laser flash-induced {{changes of}} the {{fluorescence}} yield were studied in aggregates of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) on a time scale ranging from microseconds to seconds. Carotenoid (Car) and chlorophyll (Chl) triplet states, decaying with lifetimes of several microseconds and hundreds of microseconds, respectively, are responsible for initial light-induced fluorescence quenching via singlet-triplet annihilation. In addition, at times ranging from milliseconds to seconds, a slow decay of the light-induced fluorescence quenching can be observed, indicating the presence of additional <b>quenchers</b> generated by the laser. The generation of the <b>quenchers</b> {{is found to be}} sensitive to the presence of oxygen. It is proposed that long-lived fluorescence <b>quenchers</b> can be generated from Chl triplets that are not transferred to Car molecules. The <b>quenchers</b> could be Chl cations or other radicals that are produced directly from Chl triplets or via Chl triplet-sensitized singlet oxygen. Decay of the <b>quenchers</b> takes place on a millisecond to second time scale. The decay is slowed by a few orders of magnitude at 77 K indicating that structural changes or migration-limited processes are involved in the recovery. Fluorescence quenching is not observed for trimers, which is explained by a reduction of the quenching domain size compared to that of aggregates. This type of fluorescence quenching can operate under very high light intensities when Chl triplets start to accumulate in the light-harvesting antenna...|$|R

Gatorade Thirst <b>Quencher</b> contains water, sucrose (table sugar), dextrose, citric acid, natural flavor, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium citrate, monopotassium phosphate, and flavoring/coloring ingredients; some Gatorade flavor variations use brominated vegetable oil as a stabilizer.

2500|$|Gatorade Tiger was a Gatorade Thirst <b>Quencher</b> sports drink {{formed as}} the result of a {{sponsorship}} arrangement with Tiger Woods. Debuting in March 2008, Gatorade Tiger was available in Red Drive (cherry), Cool Fusion (lemon-lime), and Quiet Storm (grape). Gatorade Tiger contained 25 percent more electrolytes than Gatorade Thirst <b>Quencher.</b> As part of the 2009 rebranding, Gatorade Tiger was re-labeled as Focus. It was reformulated, adding the amino acid theanine which is naturally found in many forms of tea, improving mental focus. Focus contained about 25mg per [...] serving or 50mg per [...] bottle. On 25 November 2009, it was reported by Beverage Digest, and later confirmed by PepsiCo, that they had made a decision, several months before November 2009, to discontinue some products to make room for the Prime and Recover products as part of a then-upcoming G Series re-branding. In 2015, the Gatorade Energy gummies made their debut along with the Gatorade energy bar.|$|E

2500|$|Fluorescence {{quenching}} assays with ANTS/DPX: ANTS is a polyanionic fluorophore, while DPX is a cationic <b>quencher.</b> The assay {{is based}} on the collisional quenching of them.

This method is performed at acidic pH and high concentration.|$|E

Indeed, their unique photophysical properties offer {{the opportunity to}} design luminescent probes for imaging and sensing with unprecedented performance. In this context, we have identified operating principles to transduce the supramolecular association of complementary receptor–substrate pairs into an enhancement in the luminescence of sensitive quantum dots. Our mechanism {{is based on the}} electrostatic adsorption of cationic <b>quenchers</b> on the surface of anionic quantum dots. The adsorbed <b>quenchers</b> suppress efficiently the emission character of the associated nanoparticles on the basis of photoinduced electron transfer. In the presence of target receptors able to bind the <b>quenchers</b> and prevent electron transfer, however, the luminescence of the quantum dots is restored. Thus, complementary receptor–substrate pairs can be identified with luminescence measurements relying on our design logic. In fact, we have demonstrated with a representative example that our protocol can be adapted to signal protein–ligand interactions...|$|R

DNA, although producing a quenching effect on the fluorescence of daunomycin, enhanced the fluorescence of myricetin. Fluore scence quenching has also been used to study the interactions of DNA in the presence and absence of divalent metal ions, with daunomycin. The values of the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (ksy), and static quenching constants (V) obtained, indicate that the quenching of daunomycin and myricetin fluorescence by the <b>quenchers</b> studied proceed via collisional, static, as well as, selective quenching mechanisms, and that they are good <b>quenchers</b> for daunomycin fluorescence. The studies also revealed the pH-dependence of daunomycin fluorescence quenching. Physiologically high levels of Fe++, Cu++, and Mg++, increased the apparent association contant (K) for daunomycin-DNA complex, and changed the number app of available binding sites per drug molecule.
