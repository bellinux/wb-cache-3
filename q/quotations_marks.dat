[URL] Wednesday, April 1 Time: 1 : 30 pm, Gay, Lesbian, and Finally Transgender Picture Books For Young Children: An Underused But Much Needed Resource Location: Gallanti Lounge, 3 rd Floor, URI Library Presenter: Professor Elizabeth Rowell, Rhode Island College This multimedia workshop will include a discussion of why it is so important to use these picture books with all young children; a brief look at their creation, availability, and use; reading aloud of several portions of some including the new transgender books; and an illustrated overview of the different books followed by time for participants to critique some. Video clips of young children wishing their teachers had read these books when they were in kindergarten and teachers using some will be shown and discussed. The session will end with questions and sharing. Handouts will be provided. Time: 3 : 00 pm, A Gay Psychologist’s Healing Journey That Leads to a Psychotherapy Method Based on Christian Spirituality Location: Gallanti Lounge, 3 rd Floor, URI Library Presenter: Dr. Richard York, Psychotherapist This talk is based on a book that is soon to be published — A Christian Spirituality and Psychotherapy: a Gay Psychologist’s Practice of the Clinical Theology. I will tell the story of my experience of healing that relieved me of severe depression, anxiety, and homophobia though my relationship with the God who dwells within me and the church community. This experience led me to define the caring God within as the Indwelling Spirit and how it functions in psychotherapy in opposition to the tyrannical inner self-critic. I use experience in relationships as the primary concept for psychology, psychotherapy, and theology. I critique psychology for its nonrelational scientific method and its lack of dealing with sin and evil, which are essential parts of human experience. I critique theology for promoting a perfectionistic morality as the essence of the Gospel rather than a new relationship with a caring, forgiving God who helps us become caring and unconditionally loving of self, others, and the created order. I explain how loving same-sex relationships can be as moral as loving opposite-sex relationships. Time: 7 : 30 pm, An Evening With Staceyann Chin Location: Hardge Forum, Multicultural Center Presenter: Staceyann Chin. Artist, Out Poet, and Political Activist An evening with poet, performer, and activist Staceyann Chin whose forthcoming Simon and Schuster release, The Other Side of Paradise, is her memoir of growing up multiracial and gay in Jamaica. [URL] Thursday, April 2 Time: 12 Noon, Coming Out Stories: Why We Tell Them, What They Mean Location: Gallanti Lounge, 3 rd Floor, URI Library Presenter: Alexia Kosmider, Ph. D., Part-time Instructor at URI in Women’s Studies/ English Dr. Alexia Kosmider recently completed a documentary, Venus Priests and Supermen, which focuses on the banning of Eve Ensler’s The Vagina Monologues at Providence College. The film has screened at Brown University as well as Tufts University and a portion was broadcast on R. I. PBS. Through a series of coming out stories, filmed from out gays/lesbians who are from the Rhode Island gay/lesbian community, we will explore such issues as why coming out stories are an important rite of passage into the out world and what coming out means to gays and lesbians. Time: 1 : 00 pm, Iron Jawed Angels Location: Gallanti Lounge, 3 rd Floor, URI Library Presenters: Eva Jones, Katie Dunning, and Jessica Ellis This film covers the struggle of Alice Paul and Lucy Burns as they joined the American Woman Suffrage Movement. Contrary to the more conservative efforts employed by the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Paul and Burns historically pushed the envelope and adopted radical means to earn American women the vote. Historically, Paul’s radical practices and experience with the British Women’s Movement allowed her to break from the more conservative NAWSA and form the National Women’s Party (NWP). Iron Jawed Angels captures the tensions and struggles inside and outside of the American Woman Suffrage Movement, which is now termed the first wave of American feminism. The program will encompass a viewing of Iron Jawed Angels and will be followed by a discussion of the film’s content. Time: 7 : 30 pm, Saving Marriage Location: Hardge Forum, Multicultural Center Presenters: Susan MacNeil, MERI Board, and Cassandra Ormiston When Massachusetts becomes the first state to recognize gay marriage, a constitutional amendment immediately emerges that would take that right away. Now, seasoned lobbyists and rookie activists are in the battle of their lives. The holy grail of gay rights is within reach, and their fight to save marriage will change forever how people — including them — view same-sex relationships. Civil rights history begins a new chapter in Massachusetts, and Saving Marriage is there on the scene as the drama unfolds. Friday, April 3 Time: 12 Noon, Coming Out and Substance Abuse: An Affirming, Empowering, and Sobering Journey Location: Gallanti Lounge, 3 rd Floor, URI Library Presenter: Brian Arcand, Proud Openly Gay URI Staff Member and Alumnus, Long-time Advocate in Support of Alcohol and Substance Free Living. Coming Out and Substance Abuse: an affirming, empowering, and sobering journey; an intimate conversation about embracing a positive gay identity while confronting the personal impact of alcohol and substance abuse. Time: 1 : 00 pm, Modernizing HIV Prevention Online: Community-Based Internet Outreach Programs For Gay Men Location: Gallanti Lounge, 3 rd Floor, URI Library Presenter: Elsa Larson, Ph. D. candidate, URI Behavioral Science This presentation has three objectives: 1. Review recent research regarding the relationship between the Internet, sexual practice, and HIV prevention among gay men or MSM, 2. Present examples of innovative community-based programs using the Internet, and 3. Discuss challenges and successes of using Internet-based approaches from an applied perspective. Elsa Larson’s research interests in HIV prevention, GLBTQ health, and program evaluation are informed by ten years of practical experience working in community-based HIV prevention programs. She co-developed the Sexperts Internet Outreach Program for AIDS Project RI while she was the Director of Prevention and continues to investigate applications of Internet-based health promotion. Time: 2 : 00 pm, Living with HIV Location: Gallanti Lounge, 3 rd Floor, URI Library Presenter: Darren Wells, Former Airline Employee, Junior at RIC I plan to discuss the kinds of adjustments I’ve had to make in order to accommodate my continued survival. I’ve had to change my self-concept several times, from “ 20 -something muscle twink” to “dying” to “fighting this thing” to finally admitting that the virus has made me weaker, and limited my options and abilities, accepting that I could not pull myself up by my own bootstraps and make it without outside help. My latest challenge is making the transition from a “disabled” identity to a man reintegrating into the work force, and I plan to make that part the main focus of my presentation. Time: 7 : 30 pm, Mamma Mia! Sing-a-long and Party Location: Hardge Forum, Multicultural Center Presenters: Mike Miele and Symposium Committee Set on a colorful Greek island, the plot serves as a background for a wealth of ABBA songs. A young woman about to be married discovers that any one of three men could be her father.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are ambiguous, {{although}} the conventional rules that govern their different uses {{are similar in}} that they contain quantifications over quotable expressions. Pure uses are governed by a simple rule: by enclosing any expression within <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> one gets a singular term, the quotation, that stands for the enclosed expression. Impure uses are far less simple. In a series of uses the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> conventionally indicate that (part of) the enclosed expression is a contextually appropriate version of expressions uttered by some relevant agent. When the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> have this meaning, {{it is tempting to}} think of them as contributing that indication to the truth-conditional content of the utterance. I adopt a cautious attitude towards this hypothesis, for the evidence in its favor is inconclusive. In other uses the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> conventionally indicate that the enclosed expression should be used not “plainly ” but in some broadly speaking “distanced ” way, or that it is being so used by the utterer, and typically context makes clear the exact nature of the “distance ” at stake. In these cases the <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> do not even appear to contribute that indication to the truth-conditional content of the utterance. I <b>Quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are used for a variety of purposes. One that is especially significant is the purpose of referring to expressions.

5000|$|For some {{languages}} listed above, {{the correct}} typographical <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> are missing, as only , , and [...] are included. Also, this scheme {{does not provide}} for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double <b>quotation</b> <b>marks.</b> Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> {{but this is not}} considered part of the modern standard.|$|R
50|$|The single <b>quotation</b> <b>mark</b> emerged around 1800 as a {{means of}} {{indicating}} a secondary level of quotation. One could expect that the logic would be the corresponding single mark everywhere but it was not the case. British English tends to reverse the usage—single <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (‘…’) are primary, and double <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> (“…”) are secondary—this distinction, however, dating back to around the 1960s. In some languages using the angular <b>quotation</b> <b>marks,</b> the usage of single ones (‹…›) became obsolete, being replaced by double curved ones (“…”); the single ones still survive, for instance, in Switzerland. In Eastern Europe, where there was a hesitation between the French and German tradition, the curved <b>quotation</b> <b>marks</b> („…“) are used as a secondary level when the angular marks («…») are used as a primary level.|$|R
