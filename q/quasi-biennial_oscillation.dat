40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} analysis of total column ozone records obtained from satellite measurements and from two global climate chemistry models on global scale. Firstly, a spectral weight analysis is performed where the relative strength of semiannual, annual and <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations</b> are determined {{with respect to the}} integrated power spectra. The comparison reveals some anomalies in the model representations at each spectral component. The tails of the spectra demonstrate that both models underestimate high frequency (daily) ozone variability, which might have a complex origin, since several dynamical processes affect short time changes of the ozone level at a given location. Secondly, detrended fluctuation analysis is exploited to analyze two-point correlations of anomaly time series. Both models reproduce the characteristic geographic dependence of correlation strength over the overlapping area with empirical observations (latitude band between 60 °S and 60 °N). The values of precise correlation exponents are hard to obtain over regions where <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations</b> or other strong nonstationarities (ozone hole) are present.

Two stations namely Mt. Abu (24. 59 °N, 72. 70 °E) in NH and Reunion Island (21. 11 °S, 55. 53 °E) in SH are chosen over sub-tropical regions. Temperature climatology from SABER observations suggests that stratopause is warmer, and upper mesosphere is cooler in NH as compared to SH. Three atmospheric models are used to understand the monthly thermal structure differences for different altitudes. Moreover, semi-annual, annual and <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations</b> are studied using Lomb Scargle Periodogram and Wavelet transform techniques. Over NH, summer and winter season are warmer (~ 4 K) and cooler (~ 3 K) respectively in stratosphere as compared to SH. It is important to note here that Mt. Abu temperature is warmer (~ 9 K) than Reunion Island in winter but in summer season Mt. Abu temperature is cooler in upper mesosphere and above mesosphere NH shows warming. Results show that annual oscillations are dominated in both hemisphere as compared to semi-annual and <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations.</b> In upper mesosphere, strength of annual oscillations is substantial in NH, while semi-annual oscillations are stronger in SH.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{extended}} the simulations of stationary OGW {{impacts on the}} general circulation and PWs {{in the middle and}} upper atmosphere. We improved parameterizations of the travelling normal atmospheric mode (NAM) forcing in the general circulation model and simulated different modes of stationary PWs and travelling NAMs taking into account dynamical and heating effects of stationary OGWs. It is assumed that the <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations</b> (QBOs) of the zonal mean flow at lower latitudes at stratospheric heights can affect PW propagation conditions (e.g., Baldwin et al. 2001). Therefore, we performed numerical experiments for the background and initial conditions typical for the westerly and easterly QBO phases. In this paper, we focus on the changes in amplitudes of stationary PWs and travelling NAMs in the atmosphere due to OGW effects under different QBO phases.|$|R
40|$|Clear {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} a quasi-biennial geomagnetic variation is shown by an analysis of annual averages of the horizontal (H) component of the geomagnetic field observed at five observatories. The analysis uses a numerical filter, which is equivalent to taking the second order time derivative of the time series. The cause for the variation is external to the earth because its amplitude depends on magnetic activity. The second order time derivative of H is well correlated with the corresponding time derivatives of the relative sunspot number and 10. 7 cm solar flux. It is suggested that <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations</b> observed in the geomagnetic field, cosmic rays, stratospheric zonal wind and temperature, total ozone, and other meteorological parameters could be produced by a common cause on the sun...|$|R

Wallace. They showed that the QBO could be driven by vertically propagating gravity waves with phase speeds in both westward and eastward directions and that the oscillation arose through a mechanism involving a two-way feedback between the waves and the mean flow. It was a bold conjecture, given that {{there was very little}} observational evidence available to either confirm or confute the hypothesis.

50|$|In the Earth's atmosphere, {{gravity waves}} are a {{mechanism}} that produce {{the transfer of}} momentum from the troposphere to the stratosphere and mesosphere. Gravity waves are generated in the troposphere by frontal systems or by airflow over mountains. At first, waves propagate through the atmosphere without appreciable change in mean velocity. But as the waves reach more rarefied (thin) air at higher altitudes, their amplitude increases, and nonlinear effects cause the waves to break, transferring their momentum to the mean flow. This transfer of momentum {{is responsible for the}} forcing of the many large-scale dynamical features of the atmosphere. For example, this momentum transfer is partly responsible for the driving of the <b>Quasi-Biennial</b> <b>Oscillation,</b> and in the mesosphere, it is thought to be the major driving force of the Semi-Annual Oscillation. Thus, this process {{plays a key role in}} the dynamics of the middle atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>{{oscillation}}</b> (QBO) is a quasiperiodic oscillation of {{the equatorial}} zonal wind between easterlies and westerlies {{in the tropical}} stratosphere with a mean period of 28 to 29 months. The alternating wind regimes develop {{at the top of}} the lower stratosphere and propagate downwards at about 1 km per month until they are dissipated at the tropical tropopause. Downward motion of the easterlies is usually more irregular than that of the westerlies. The amplitude of the easterly phase is about twice as strong as that of the westerly phase. At the top of the vertical QBO domain, easterlies dominate, while at the bottom, westerlies are more likely to be found. At the 30mb level, with regards to monthly mean zonal winds, the strongest recorded easterly was 29.55 m/s in November 2005, while the strongest recorded westerly was only 15.62 m/s in June 1995.|$|E
30|$|The other {{important}} result obtained by Das and Sinha (2008) {{was that the}} semi-annual oscillation was very significant at 2000 hrs JST (Japan Standard Time) and as the night progressed, the amplitude of the oscillation reduced. This observation was possible because the nightglow observations at each hour had been considered separately, instead of using the nightly means as done in earlier studies. This result is in absolute conformity with the observations of WINDII/UARS and also the TIME-GCM (Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Electrodynamics-Global Circulation Model) model calculations of the oxygen green nightglow (Shepherd et al., 2005). The annual and the <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations,</b> on the other hand, weakened towards midnight, and their amplitudes increased during the post-midnight hours.

After the effects of <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations</b> and interannual variability are taken into account, the decrease in the column ozone attributed to volcanic eruptions at these latitudes may not be more than 2 - 4 percent. The most noticeable effect on the Pinatubo eruptions, as observed during the El Chichon period, is the breakdown of the phase relation between ozone and temperature. This is attributed to additional heating in the lower stratosphere caused by volcanic aerosols...|$|R

Most current 2 -D models have a transport that is either an Eulerian mean circulation with large stratospheric eddy diffusion or a residual (diabatic or Lagragian) mean circulation which typically is accompanied with small stratospheric eddy diffusion. Because of the assumption of zonal averaging, 2 -D models are primarily useful in making predictions of atmospheric changes of time scales longer than a season. Although decadel atmospheric changes may be reasonably well represented with a 2 -D model, the year to year changes which result from interannual transport differences, stratospheric warmings, semiannual <b>oscillations,</b> or <b>quasi-biennial</b> <b>oscillations</b> may not be well represented in the stratosphere and troposphere...|$|R
