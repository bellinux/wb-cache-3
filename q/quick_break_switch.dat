40|$|A {{synthetic}} circuit {{for making}} test for load <b>break</b> <b>switches</b> was explained and designed in this master thesis following the IEC standard requirements. Also the voltage drop across the triggered vacuum switch {{and across the}} test object were taken into consideration {{in order to get}} more realistic results. By having proper values for voltage drops it was possible to find several appropriate combinations of minimum values of resistance, inductance, and capacitance that make a satisfactory making operation possible. The ending results were positive and showed that the making operation was made correctly for a load <b>break</b> <b>switch</b> rated for 24 kV with closing velocity from 1 to 5 meters per second and a triggered vacuum switch with time delay of 50 microseconds. The making current was in the range of 50 to 60 kA without any high-frequency crossing-zero points as expected...|$|R

The nozzle and contact wear were measured regularly to investigate design requirements and the impact from nozzle wear on gas flow. The contact wear is only moderate, while the nozzle wear causes a decrease in pressure build-up, which in turn may influence the interruption performance...|$|R

However, the closest ship to respond, the RMS Carpathia, wouldn’t reach the Titanic until after it sank. At one point Bride reminded Phillips that the new code was SOS and jokingly said, [...] "Send SOS, its the new call, {{and it may be}} your last chance to send it." [...] Later Phillips took a <b>quick</b> <b>break</b> and Bride took over the wireless.

40|$|This paper {{represents}} a multi-part switching test technique for testing Load <b>Break</b> <b>Switches</b> (LBS) using the basic synthetic test circuit (Weil circuit). In order {{to define the}} transient recovery voltage (TRV) due to LBS contact opening, a 4 -parameter TRV envelope is proposed with an initial time delay parameter.

Limitations with the method that result in excessive TRV are discussed...|$|R

The observation post was, by the ox cart, down the traditionally poor roads, taken and reconstructed in the park near the court, that is, in the present Pioneers` Park. It is located in the very centre of Belgrade, opposite the National Assembly, diagonally from the „stone building“, that is, the building in which The Post of Serbia, Теlecom and the National Bank of Serbia are situated.

Albion however started to play some good football and got themselves back into the match after 21 minutes when the youngest player on the field, 22-year-old Wally Boyes, a boyhood Wednesdayite from Sheffield scored an equaliser. The diminutive left winger took a pass from Carter and hit a stinging, rising drive from {{the left side of the}} penalty area which gave Jack Brown no chance.

40|$|Charles Brockden Brown's novels [...] Wieland, Or the Transformation; Edgar Huntly, Or Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker; and Ormond, Or the Secret Witness [...] {{tend to be}} {{dismissed}} for their narrative inconsistencies. Some critics, however, strive to justify recurring structural peculiarities and to accord more literary value to Brown's writing. This thesis, falling into the latter category, will study these three novels in terms of narrative diseases and antidotes. Indeed, their different exploitation of narrative <b>breaks,</b> <b>switching</b> verb tenses, and filter shifts demonstrate the use of narration {{in the search for}} effective cures. Influenced by the infection of story elements, the narrators of Wieland, Edgar Huntly, and Ormond emulate ventriloquism, somnambulism, and metamorphism, respectively. This mirroring of story elements becomes crucial in experimenting with the concoction of narrative remedie...|$|R
