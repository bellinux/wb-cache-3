40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{approaches of}} district health authorities to quality in contracting. DESIGN: Descriptive survey. SETTING: All district health authorities in one health region of England in a National Health Service accounting year. MATERIAL: 129 <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> used in {{contracting for services}} in six specialties (eight general <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> and 121 service specific <b>quality</b> <b>specifications)</b> MAIN MEASURES: Evaluation {{of the use of}} quality specifications; their scope and content in relation to established criteria of healthcare quality. RESULTS: Most district health authorities developed <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> which would be applicable to their local hospital. When purchasing care outside their boundaries they adopted the <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> developed by other health authorities. The service specific <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> were more limited in scope than the general <b>quality</b> <b>specifications.</b> The <b>quality</b> of clinical care was referred to in 75 % of general and 43 % of service specific <b>quality</b> <b>specifications.</b> Both types of <b>specification</b> considered <b>quality</b> issues in superficial and broad terms only. Established features of quality improvement were rarely included. Prerequisites to ensure provider accountability and satisfactory delivery of service specifications were not routinely included in contracts. CONCLUSION: <b>Quality</b> <b>specifications</b> within service contracts are commonly used by health authorities. This study shows that their use of this approach to quality improvement is inconsistent and unlikely to achieve desired quality goals. Continued reliance on the current approach is holding back a more fundamental debate on how to create effective management of quality improvement through the interaction between purchasers and providers of health care...|$|R
40|$|Analytical <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> play a {{key role}} in assuring and {{continuously}} improving high-quality laboratory services. However, I believe, that there are two "missing links" in the effective management of <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> in the delivery of laboratory services. The first is the evidence that pre-analytical variation and related problems are not taken into great consideration by laboratory professionals. The second missing link is the communication of <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> to clinicians and other possible stake-holders. If <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> represent "the level of performance required to facilitate clinical decision-making", they cannot be used only for internal quality management procedures but must be communicated to facilitate clinical reasoning, decision-making and patient management.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an approach}} to minimize the number of process tooling adjustments and deliver an acceptable fraction of non-conforming products based on given product <b>quality</b> <b>specification</b> limits in assembly processes. A linear model is developed to describe the relationships between product quality and process tooling locating positions. Based on the model, the process mean shifts of tooling locating positions are estimated for both deterministic and stochastic cases by using the least-square estimation or linear mixed model estimation, respectively. A simultaneous confidence interval is obtained to construct the estimation region of a process mean shift under the given false alarm rate. Furthermore, a tooling adjustment strategy is proposed to determine when the process adjustment is essentially {{needed in order to}} ensure an acceptable fraction of non-conforming units based on the given product <b>quality</b> <b>specification</b> limits.

This paper describes the <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> used in EQA schemes of the Centre of Biomedical Research (CRB), in order to design schemes that can assess laboratory reliability performances, meet the changing needs and quality recommendations. METHODS: <b>Quality</b> <b>specifications</b> for control materials, statistical procedures and goals to assess laboratory performance have been applied and introduced in EQA schemes managed by CRB. RESULTS: The application of well-defined <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> has demonstrated effective.

40|$|Management summary The {{aim of this}} {{deliverable}} is two-fold. Firstly, it aims at {{defining the}} initial concepts for specifying and negotiating end-to-end quality, i. e., a service quality meta-model suitable for the definition and negotiation of service <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> and SLAs. The research method for creating this quality meta-model follows a design approach. Initially, requirements are collected dictating the information, structure, and constraints that this meta-model should capture. Then, based on these requirements, the meta-model is designed and finally created. Secondly, this deliverable aims at proposing a methodology for decomposing end-to-end <b>quality</b> into <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> for individual SLAs. The research method for achieving this goal follows a hybrid approach: a proof-of-concept and a paper-based approach. In particular, the meta-model’s effectiveness and sufficiency is highlighted by modeling a composite service negotiation scenario and its result, which is a decomposition of end-to-end <b>quality</b> into <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> of individual SLAs. Then, initial attempts (materialized in papers of WP members) are provided that address (composite) service negotiation...|$|R

This research proposes a novel two-stage optimization system for photolithography process integrating the Taguchi method, back-propagation neural networks, genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and related technologies to effectively generate optimal process parameter settings.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Quality</b> <b>specifications,</b> {{the level}} of {{performance}} required to facilitate clinical decision-making, not only have {{a central role in}} quality management in the laboratory but are also essential for assuring the interpretation and utilization of laboratory data by physicians. Consensus has been reached on the hierarchy of criteria for <b>quality</b> <b>specifications.</b> However, the information on <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> that should be communicated to clinicians, {{and the way in which}} this information should be given, is still widely debated. METHODS: Laboratory tests have been grouped into four categories including uni-modal, and bi-modal distributions, tests used in patients monitoring and in evaluating the response to therapy (serial measurements), and, finally, tests that require interpretive comments. The most suitable and informative ways to communicate <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> to clinicians have been proposed for each category. RESULTS: For tests with a uni-modal distribution, the decision limits should replace traditional reference values in the report. For tests with a bi-modal distribution, in addition to traditional reference values, some flags based on the uncertainty (i. e., analytical and biological variability) of laboratory data, can be included to help clinicians interpret laboratory data. For tests used in monitoring patients and in evaluating the response to therapy (serial measurements), the reference change value or the most effective threshold of the difference between two consecutive results should be indicated. For tests/test batteries that require interpretive comments, these should be added to the report and discussed in multidisciplinary meetings and interpretive rounds to promote knowledge of a more objective evaluation of laboratory data. CONCLUSIONS: A proposal has been made to improve the way laboratory results are communicated to clinicians, with practical information derived from <b>quality</b> <b>specifications.</b> By providing clinicians with information on quality characteristics and the degree of uncertainty, a more objective interpretation of laboratory data may be possible, and data may be more appropriately utilized for diagnosis and monitoring...|$|R

SAS is designed to meet the handling <b>qualities</b> <b>specification</b> known as Aeronautical Design Standard (ADS- 33 E-PRF). A helicopter having a soft inplane four-bladed hingeless main rotor and a four-bladed tail rotor with conventional mechanical controls is used for the simulation studies. In the simulation studies, the helicopter is trimmed at hover, low speeds and forward speeds flight conditions. The performance of the helicopter SAS schemes are assessed with respect to the requirements of ADS- 33 E-PRF. Findings – The SAS in the longitudinal axis meets the requirement of the Level 1 handling <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> in hover and low speed as well as for forward speed flight conditions. The SAS in the lateral axis meets the requirement of the Level 2 handling <b>quality</b> <b>specifications</b> in both hover and low speed as well as for forward speed flight conditions.
