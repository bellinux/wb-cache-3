40|$|Hybrid {{securities}} are a broad {{group of}} securities that combine {{the elements of}} the two broader groups of securities, debt and equity. Hybrid securities are securities that have a combination of debt and equity characteristics. The original hybrid security was preferred stock, representing ownership in a company (like equity) but having fixed payments(like bonds). Since then, companies have structured securities in many different ways. Many are structured in ways similar to debt, allowing the owner to receive a cash flow (floating or fixed) with a periodic rate of return, but also have options for conversion to equity. In many circumstances, <b>quasi-equity</b> instruments may offer a useful source of finance. Unfortunately the accounting profession has not recognised the existence of two significant types of problem. Firstly, a potential investor analysing the financial reports of a firm in which reported debt is really <b>quasi-equity</b> may assess the firm to be a poor investment opportunity because it has an apparently high reliance on debt in its financial structure. The second problem is that there is an increasing reliance on the content of the financial reports of privately held firms by researchers gathering and analysing data to inform and guide policy. The aim of this work is to analyze the recognition, according to the Italian Civil Code (art. 2346) and using the Italian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, of the so called ‘strumenti finanziari partecipativi’ (SFP), a kind of a hybrid security that can be issued by companies...|$|E

This paper provides information about management's views as to which type of debt -trade creditor bank loans- makes the firm look more unsafe to these stakeholders. Management's views should, indeed, be reflected in therm's earnings-management decisions: beefing up the reported earnings tends to reassure third parties, so firms whose funding depends more heavily on the dangerous type of debt should be more likely to manage their earnings upwards. We consider a large sample of unlisted Belgian firms and test which type of debt appears to trigger more earnings management. We find that earnings management is strongly related to bank debt while in the case of trade credit the association is, at best, indicative. This suggests that, in management's views, bank debt looks more alarming to parties that matter to the firm. Our findings have implications about the size of suppliers' <b>quasi-equity</b> stake in therm relative to banks' rent extraction, and these al-of-approval effect from bank loans, assuming banks are no worse informed about the firm than suppliers. status: publishe...|$|E

We employ the Latent growth modeling technique to test the financial growth cycle theory developed by Berger and Udell (1998). The data {{used in this study}} is the Kauffman Firm Survey, the largest longitudinal data set comprised of a random sample of U. S. startups launched in 2004 and surveyed annually through 2011. Consistent with the predictions of financial growth cycle theory, in the startup stage, entrepreneurs rely on initial insider capital sources such as personal savings, financing offered by friends and family, <b>quasi-equity,</b> and personal debt. Over time, as businesses become less opaque, the proportion of business debt and trade credit financing in total capital injection volume increases significantly. Businesses with high R 2 ̆ 6 D activity and those that possess intellectual property rights finance their operations predominantly with equity - particularly external equity raised from angels and venture capitalists, and business debt - particularly bank loans and credit lines.

40|$|Private Finance is {{one method}} of {{financing}} large-scale, capital intensive projects, in which traditionally only the cash flows generated by the project serve {{as the source of}} loan repayment and only the project assets serve as collateral for a non-recourse loan. An important aspect of this form of project finance is that the risks are borne not only by the sponsors but are shared by different types of investors such as equity holders, debt providers, and <b>quasi-equity</b> investors. Therefore, because the risks are shared, the criterion of a project's suitability for financing is whether it is able to stand alone as a distinct legal and economic entity with project assets, project related contracts, and project cash flows separated from those of the sponsors. This form of project financing, since it relies on the security of cash flows, requires a detailed awareness, identification, assessment, and quantification of all the risks. Consequently, a comprehensive and heuristic risk management process is essential for the success of the project. The lenders and other providers of equity and debt play important roles in the implementation of the risk management plan and hence affect the likely overall project success. The structure of this financing and investment on a particular project enables all project stakeholders to take a long-term perspective on the project, thus permitting the various contractors and investors in the project to work together with a common financial interest in creating a whole-of-life, cost-effective project that achieves full client satisfaction and performance to requirements.

40|$|The recent {{corporate}} law reform introduced {{different types of}} financial instruments, while aiming at increasing the recourse to capital markets and meeting the diversified requests of emerging categories of professional and sophisticated investors. The aforementioned financial instruments came to fall in a wide grey zone between stock and corporate bonds, although they differ from both because destined to specific professional investors instead of retail investors. The following research presents an analysis of some particular kinds of financial instruments, called “participating financial instruments” by artt. 2346, 2349 and 2351, civil code. The {{first part of the}} paper explores the content of the adjective “participating” because {{it is not clear whether}} “participating” is to be referred to the social organization or to the exposure to risk that these instruments entail. The latter interpretation eventually prevails. Consequently, “participating” is referred to participation, through the financial instrument, to corporate losses or profits. The issue of participating financial instruments is considered one among other equity-raising activities because the contributions from the instruments flow in the equity and, consequently, are exposed to risk, although the investor does not have the right to a final repayment. The relationship between issuer and subscriber of participating financial instruments goes beyond the credit-debt phenomenon, which instead pertains to bonds and securities similar to bonds, ruled by art. 2411, co. 3, civil code. In fact, the previous instruments entail a repayment obligation, although depending on the level of corporate losses or profits. Participating financial instruments are considered <b>quasi-equity.</b> This legal nature justifies the legislative provision that leaves to contractual freedom the opportunity of the investor’s participation in the profits and, in case, some management rights (art. 2351 civil code). Moreover, the paper analyzes different typologies of possible subscriber contributions -in particular the characteristics of the contribution of services- as well as addressing their financial accounting and reporting in the balance sheet and the different and complex purposes that the issue of participating financial instruments intends to accomplish...|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} {{role played by}} small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) for growth and employment is undisputed in industrialized and developing countries alike and has been documented by numerous studies. If the development potential of this business segment is to be harnessed, {{it is essential that}} SMEs have access to adequate financing. In capital markets SMEs are faced with a number of company-sized related features of financing, e. g. serious information deficits. This situation entails a number of financing-related disadvantages that may mean higher costs for capital, or indeed wholly exclude SMEs from access to investment capital. In developing countries provision of long-term financial resources is a source of major problems. While access to the short-term capital needed to finance current assets has been improved decisively by the development of specialized finance institutions in recent years, SMEs continue to be hampered by a chronic lack of financial resources tailored to their specific investment needs. This often means that potentially profitable projects are not realized, the consequence being stagnation of company development. The use of alternative financing instruments with <b>quasi-equity</b> or equity-substituting features has proven helpful in situations where access to bank loans is problematic. Positive experiences made in industrialized countries indicate that venture capital and leasing are instruments that hold considerable promise for overcoming the bottleneck in access to long-term capital, and this approach is being actively promoted by bi- and multilateral development institutions. Based on the example of Peru, the present study looks into the questions a) whether the above named instruments are suited to financing the investments of SMEs in developing countries and b) what conditions have to be met to ensure that venture capital and leasing are used in a manner suited to the specific needs of the target group. Between February and April 2002 the authors of the present study conducted a comprehensive survey aimed at answering these questions. The interview partners included potential investors of venture capital active in the Peruvian investment market and leasing operators that offer services to larger companies. Furthermore, 38 SMEs from two industries were interviewed with a view to assessing the financing constraints faced by Peruvian companies and to determining their views on possible alternative means of financing. The survey also included complementary interviews with private-sector experts and representatives of public- sector institutions.

Die vorliegende Studie analysiert die Kapitalmarktsituation insbesondere fuer langfristige Kredite am Beispiel des Entwicklungslands Peru. Waehrend institutionelle Strukturen fuer kurzfristige und kleinere Kredite in Peru hinreichend vorhanden sind, ist ein chronischer Mangel an Kapital fuer laengerfristige und riskantere Investitionen zu konstatieren.

40|$|Successful {{implementation}} of MHP projects in Ethiopia and subsequently a broader dissemination {{of the technology}} require an interdisciplinary approach. Based on the analyses of present hindrances in Ethiopia, crucial aspects are identified. Even though an adequate hydrological potential and electricity requirements are provided for at numerous sites, special attention must be directed to competing technologies, such as a diesel generator system or the connection to an existing grid, to investment and operating costs, profitability, financing instruments, financing partners, organisation forms, legal and political boundary conditions, tariff systems and paying modalities. All these relevant aspects are analysed individually and {{with regard to their}} causal interrelationships. The whole study provides the basis {{for the development of a}} decision support system. By means of a regionalisation method, regression equations are developed which facilitate the estimation of the hydrological potential at a site with lacking runoff measurements. The evaluation of existing methods to forecast electricity consumption showed that usual specific consumption figures cannot be applied without taking into account the number of households per official connection and the effect of measures which stimulate market penetration and specific consumption. For example, incentives to purchase electrical appliances are one measure to promote the consumption. Simultaneously, an appropriate tariff system must optimise temporal balancing of loads by truncating peaks and filling of load gaps. Additionally it should help to adopt the continuously growing demand function to the stepwise increase of supply capacity. Selling of capacities in kilowatt instead of energy in kilowatt hours aligns with these objectives. Since profitability of MHP systems in Ethiopia revealed to be marginal and access to loans is limited due to the required collateral, mixed financing with different project partners is recommended. Firstly, some non- or less-profit oriented equity capital donors such as customers, development banks and NGO's and secondly, venture capitalists with significant equity capital for the provision of collateral and enforcing successful management should be involved. Thirdly, banks with loan capital are required to increase the ROE for the highly profit oriented investors due to a positive leverage effect. Some of the problems incurred can be solved by the issuance of juissance rights. They facilitate the participation of customers as co-financiers and allow dividend payment in kW's or kWh's. They reduce the risk of electricity sales, and delayed payments. They accommodate access to "cheap" <b>quasi-equity</b> capital from customers and thus ease the access to loans. In return, they offer the advantage of reduced monthly electricity expenses to the customer who, in case of a fixed rate of dividend, receives energy units unaffected by inflation. Juissance rights do not require a stock market and are permitted within the framework of several organisational forms. Since they do not confer any ownership rights, the management control remains with the (more) liable project partners. The participating partners, their number and liability, control aspects, the type of financing and finally the total investment volume decide on the favoured organisational form. A limited partnership is useful in case of investors with different liabilities, supplemented by consumers with juissance rights. A modern co-operative requires a well funded community, independent from big investors and banks. With regard to legal requirements, the investment licence turned out to be of primary importance, but can only be acquired for projects of a fixed minimum volume. The licence facilitates access to the one-stop-shop and thus to other requirements like operating licence, working permits, registration of the business organisation and the allocation of land and water rights. In order to perspicuously illustrate the theoretical results all mentioned aspects together with the investigations on technical design, investment and operating costs are applied to two fictitious case studies of capacities of 50 and 150 kW. The analysis of prospects for international financing support with regard to the Flexible Mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol, the Global Environmental Fund and others proved that these instruments can contribute to implement either barrier removal projects or concrete MHP pilot projects. In view of the collected information, the potential and the limits of a DSS tool are reviewed. Finally conclusions and recommendations on concrete measures, such as investment incentives, redemption from customs duties and improvement of loan conditions are given...|$|E
