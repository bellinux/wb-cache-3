It was deemed useful {{to understand the}} depth to which an optical trap can reach for purposes of developing a tool {{to assist in the}} fabrication of miniature devices. Additionally, it was desired to know whether the measured <b>trap</b> <b>length</b> favored {{one or the other of}} two competing theories to model an optical trap. The approach was to trap a microsphere of known size and mass and raise it from its initial trap position. The microsphere was then dropped by blocking the laser beam for a pre-determined amount of time. Dropping the microsphere in a free-fall mode from various heights relative to the coverslip provides an estimate of how the <b>trapping</b> <b>length</b> changes with depth in water in a sample chamber on a microscope slide. While it was not possible to measure the <b>trap</b> <b>length</b> with sufficient precision to support any particular theory of optical trap formation, it was possible to find regions where the presence of physical boundaries influenced optical traps, and determine that the <b>trap</b> <b>length,</b> for the apparatus studied, is between 6 and 7 m.

40|$|While fundamental-mode {{discrete}} solitons {{have been}} demonstrated with both self-focusing and defocusing nonlinearity, high-order-mode localized states in waveguide lattices have been studied thus far only for the self-focusing case. In this paper, the existence and stability regimes of dipole, quadrupole and vortex soliton structures in two-dimensional lattices induced with a defocusing nonlinearity are examined by the theoretical and numerical analysis of a generic envelope nonlinear lattice model. In particular, {{we find that the}} stability of such high-order-mode solitons is quite different from that with self-focusing nonlinearity. As a simple example, a dipole (``twisted'') mode soliton which may be stable in the focusing case becomes unstable in the defocusing regime.

40|$|AbstractMeasurements by Fourier-transform mass {{spectrometry}} (FTMS) {{have been used}} to measure trapping oscillation profiles in elongated trapped ion cells of length 10 – 43 cm. Trapping periods extracted from these profiles are found to vary linearly with cell length of elongated cells. This is in contrast with the prediction based on a quadrupolar approximation of the electric field that trapping period should increase exponentially with increased cell length. An alternate analytical expression for trapping motion is derived that better accounts for the motion of ions with sufficient energy to approach the trap plates. Calculated trapping frequencies are within a few percent of values determined from ion trajectory simulations for any combination of cell <b>length,</b> <b>trap</b> potential, ion mass, and ion kinetic energy. The new expression also explains the experimentally determined trapping data obtained in elongated cells.

A model RNA hairpin, P 5 ab, {{was attached to}} two micron-sized beads through hybrid RNA/DNA handles; one bead was trapped by dual-beam lasers {{and the other was}} held by a micropipette. Several experimental variables were changed while measuring the unfolding/refolding kinetics, including handle <b>lengths,</b> <b>trap</b> stiffness, and modes of force applied to the molecule. In constant-force mode where the tension applied to the RNA was maintained through feedback control, the measured rate coefficients varied within 40 % when the handle lengths were changed by 10 -fold (1. 1 – 10. 2 Kbp); they increased by two- to threefold when the trap stiffness was lowered to one-third (from 0. 1 to 0. 035 pN/nm). In the passive mode, without feedback control and where the force applied to the RNA varied in response to the end-to-end distance change of the tether, the RNA hopped between a high-force folded-state and a low-force unfolded-state. In this mode, the rates increased up to twofold with longer handles or softer traps. Overall, the measured rates remained with the same order-of-magnitude over the wide range of conditions studied. In the companion article on pages 3010 – 3021, we analyze how the measured kinetics parameters differ from the intrinsic molecular rates of the RNA, and thus how to obtain the molecular rates...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} a simple {{anisotropic}} magneto-optical trap for neutral atoms that produces a large sample of cold atoms confined in a cylindrically-shaped volume with a high aspect ratio (100 : 1).

We demonstrate that the resulting intensity imbalance produces a net force that spatially localizes the atoms. This limits both the <b>trap</b> <b>length</b> and the total number of trapped atoms. Rotating the cooling beams by a small angle relative to the trap axis avoids the problem of attenuation, and atoms can be trapped throughout the entire available trapping volume.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of nonstationary trapped lee waves in a nonsteady background flow is studied using idealized three-dimensional (3 D) numerical simulations. Trapped waves are {{forced by the}} passage of an isolated, synopticscale barotropic jet over a mountain ridge of finite <b>length.</b> <b>Trapped</b> waves generated within this environment differ significantly in their behavior compared with waves in the more commonly studied two-dimensional (2 D) steady flow. After the peak zonal flow has crossed the terrain, two disparate regions form within the mature wave train: 1) upwind of the jet maximum, trapped waves increase their wavelength and tend to untrap and decay, whereas 2) downwind of the jet maximum, wavelengths shorten and waves remain trapped. Waves start to untrap approximately 100 km downwind of the ridge top, and the region of untrapping expands downwind with time as the jet progresses, while waves downstream of the jet maximum persist. Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) ray tracing shows that spatial gradients in the mean flow are the key factor responsible for these behaviors. An example of real-world waves evolving similarly to the modeled waves is presented. As expected, trapped waves forced by steady 2 D and horizontally uniform unsteady 3 D flows decay downstream because of leakage of wave energy into the stratosphere. Surprisingly, the downstream decay of lee waves is inhibited {{by the presence of}} a stratosphere in the isolated-jet simulations. Also unexpected is that the initial trapped wavelength increases quasi-linearly throughout the event, despite the large-scale forcing at the ridge crest being symmetric in time about the midpoint of the isolated-jet simulation. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} the statistical mechanics framework for {{a bundle of}} Nf living and uncrosslinked actin filaments in a supercritical solution of free monomers pressing against a mobile wall. The filaments are anchored normally to a fixed planar surface at one of their ends and, because of their limited flexibility, they grow almost parallel to each other. Their growing ends hit a moving obstacle, depicted as a second planar wall, parallel to the previous one and subjected to a harmonic compressive force. The force constant is denoted as the trap strength while {{the distance between the}} two walls as the <b>trap</b> <b>length</b> to make contact with the experimental optical trap apparatus. For an ideal solution of reactive filaments and free monomers at fixed free monomer chemical potential μ 1, we obtain the general expression for the grand potential from which we derive averages and distributions of relevant physical quantities, namely, the obstacle position, the bundle polymerization force, and the number of filaments in direct contact with the wall. The grafted living filaments are modeled as discrete Wormlike chains, with F-actin persistence length lp, subject to discrete contour length variations ±d (the monomer size) to model single monomer (de) polymerization steps. Rigid filaments (lp = ∞), either isolated or in bundles, all provide average values of the stalling force in agreement with Hill’s predictions FsH = Nf kBT ln(ρ 1 /ρ 1 c) /d, independent of the average <b>trap</b> <b>length.</b> Here ρ 1 is the density of free monomers in the solution and ρ 1 c its critical value at which the filament does not grow nor shrink in the absence of external forces.
