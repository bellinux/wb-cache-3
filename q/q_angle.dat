2500|$|The Anterior Cruciate Ligament is the {{ligament}} {{that keeps}} the knee stable. Anterior Cruciate Ligament damage is a very common injury, especially among athletes.Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction (ACL) surgery is a common intervention. 1 in every 3,000 American suffers from a ruptured ACL and between 100,000 and 300,000 reconstruction surgeries will be performed {{each year in the}} United States. Around $500 million health care dollar will come from ACL injuries. ACL injuries can be categorized into groups- contact and non-contact based {{on the nature of the}} injury [...] Contact injuries occur when a person or object come into contact with the knee causing the ligament to tear. However, non-contact tears typically occur during the following movements: decelerating, cutting, or landing from a jump. ACL injury is 4-6 times higher in females than in males. An increased <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> and hormonal differences are a few examples of the gender disparity in ACL tear rates.|$|E
50|$|Before puberty, {{there is}} no {{observed}} difference in frequency of ACL tears between the sexes. Changes in sex hormone levels, specifically elevated levels of estrogen and relaxin in females during the menstrual cycle, have been hypothesized as causing predisposition of ACL ruptures. This is because they may increase joint laxity and extensibility of the soft tissues surrounding the knee joint. Additionally, female pelvises widen during puberty through the influence of sex hormones. This wider pelvis requires the femur to angle toward the knees. This angle towards the knee {{is referred to as}} the <b>Q</b> <b>angle.</b> The average <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> for men is 14 degrees and the average for women is 17 degrees. Steps can be taken to reduce this <b>Q</b> <b>angle,</b> such as using orthotics. The relatively wider female hip and widened <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> may lead to an increased likelihood of ACL tears in women.|$|E

In women, the <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> should be less than 22 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 9 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. In men, the <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> should be less than 18 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 8 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. A typical <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> is 12 degrees for men and 17 degrees for women.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{reliability}} of quadriceps-angle (Q-angle) measurements performed using a short-arm goniometer and a long-arm goniometer and to assess the accuracy of goniometer-based Q-angle measurements compared with anatomic <b>Q</b> <b>angles</b> derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Design: An intra- and interobserver reliability study. Setting: University hospital. Participants: Eighteen healthy subjects with no history of knee pain, trauma, or prior surgery were examined. Methods: Two physicians, blinded to subject identity, measured <b>Q</b> <b>angles</b> on both knees of all subjects using 2 goniometers: (1) a short-arm goniometer and (2) a long-arm goniometer. <b>Q</b> <b>angles</b> were derived from axial MRIs of the subjects' hip and knees. Main Outcome Measurements: the intra- and interobserver reliabilities of each goniometer were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). the comparison between clinical and MRI-based <b>Q</b> <b>angles</b> was assessed by using the ICC and a paired t-test. Results: Intra- and interobserver reliabilities of the long-arm goniometer (intraobserver ICC, 0. 92; interobserver ICC, 0. 88) were better {{than those of the}} short-arm goniometer (intraobserver ICC, 0. 78; interobserver ICC, 0. 56). Although both goniometers measured <b>Q</b> <b>angles</b> that were moderately correlated to the MRI-based measurements (ICC, 0. 40), the clinical <b>Q</b> <b>angles</b> were underestimated compared with the MRI-based anatomic <b>Q</b> <b>angles</b> (P <. 05). Conclusion: {{the results of this study}} suggest that, although reproducible Q-angle measurements can be performed using standardized patient positioning and a long-arm goniometer, methods to improve the accuracy of clinical Q-angle measurements are needed.

Methods: In the present case-control study, all of the patients over 18 years age presenting to emergency departments (ED) of two educational Hospitals, complaining from ankle sprain, were evaluated during more than 1 year. A checklist consisting of demographic data, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and history of ankle sprain, as well as degree of <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> was filled for all participants. The correlation of mentioned variables with incidence of ankle sprain was calculated using SPSS 22. Results: 300 patients with ankle sprain were evaluated (53. 5 % male). Mean age of the patients was 37. 03 ± 14. 20 years. Mean weight, height, and BMI were 71. 71 ± 11. 26 (43 – 114), 168. 74 ± 8. 63 (143 – 190) and 25. 14 ± 3. 19 (18. 41 – 38. 95), respectively. Mean <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> of the patients was 12. 78 ± 3. 19 degrees (5 – 23). There was a significant correlation between weight (p < 0. 001), BMI (p = 0. 001), history of sprain (r: 0. 26, p < 0. 001) and <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> (p = 0. 002) with incidence of ankle sprain. In addition, there was a significant statistical correlation between weight (p = 0. 031), BMI (p = 0. 020) and <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> (p = 0. 004) with history of ankle sprain. In patients with a history of ankle sprain, <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> was wider by about 2 degrees. Conclusion: It seems that the prevalence of ankle sprain directly correlates with high weight, BMI, and <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> and is more prevalent in those with a history of sprain. Although the findings of the present study show a statistically significant correlation between these factors and ankle sprain, the correlation is not clinically significant. </p...|$|E

The cause of the breaststroke swimmer’s knee, which is accompanied with medial pain of the knee joint, has not been clearly identified. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the biomechanical and anatomical factors which predispose subjects to injury. This study includes 60 breaststroke and crawl swimmers (16 ± 3. 2 years old) who have participated in 3 – 6 -year-long swimming training in Tabriz city. The knee pain was evaluated with McGill’s pain questionnaire, and <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> was measured with universal goniometry by knee radiography in standing position. The medial pain of knee joint increased significantly and the knee was only symptomatic when the swimmers performed the whip kick. Breaststroke swimmers were hardly able to complete training because of the knee pain. It is concluded that competitive training of breaststroke swimming for 6 months can cause exclusive injury and pain in swimmer’s knee.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Rice farming {{activities}} involve prolonged {{manual work}} and human-machine interaction. Prolonged farming risk-exposure {{may result in}} lower limb malalignment. This malalignment may {{increase the risk of}} lower extremity injury and physical disabilities. However, the prevalence and factors associated with lower extremity malalignment have not yet been reported. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of lower extremity malalignment among rice farmers. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 249 rice farmers. Lower extremity alignment assessment included: pelvic tilt angle, limb length equality, femoral torsion, quadriceps (<b>Q)</b> <b>angle,</b> tibiofemoral angle, genu recurvatum, rearfoot angle, and medial longitudinal arch angle. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze participant characteristics and prevalence of lower extremity malalignment. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify risk factors. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was foot pronation (36. 14 %), followed by the abnormal <b>Q</b> <b>angle</b> (34. 94 %), tibiofemoral angle (31. 73 %), pelvic tilt angle (30. 52 %), femoral antetorsion (28. 11 %), limb length inequality (22. 49 %), tibial torsion (21. 29 %), and genu recurvatum (11. 24 %). In females, the risk factors were abnormal <b>Q</b> <b>angle,</b> tibiofemoral angle, and genu recurvatum. Being overweight was a risk factor for abnormal pelvic tilt angle, <b>Q</b> <b>angle,</b> and tibiofemoral angle. Age was a risk factor for limb length inequality. Years of farming were a major risk factor for abnormal <b>Q</b> <b>angle,</b> tibiofemoral angle, and foot malalignment. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of lower extremity malalignment was reported in this study. Female sex, being overweight, and years of farming were major risk factors for lower extremity malalignment. Lower extremity screening should assist in the identification of foot and knee malalignment in rice farmers. This may then lead to early prevention of musculoskeletal disorders arising from such malalignment. Usa Karukunchit, Rungthip Puntumetakul, Manida Swangnetr, Rose Boucau...|$|E

The optical pumped magnetometer will perform satisfactorily when the <b>angle</b> <b>q</b> within a range, like 10 ° < q <  85 ° or 95 ° < q <  170 ° (CS-L, Scintrex), 6 ° < q <  84 ° or 96 ° < q <  174 ° (G 882, Geometrics). Thus, the measurement value of it is almost not influenced by its orientation in measurement coordinate axes. Therefore, it has a great advantage to assemble an array with scalar {{magnetic sensor}}s. In this paper, we propose a method based on a scalar magnetometer array to track the magnetic target. The position of the target can be obtained by the proposed method in real time. In order to compute in real time, we use the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In addition, we can estimate the magnetic moment of the target after computing its position.|$|R
