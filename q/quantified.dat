30|$|A <b>quantifying</b> concept {{describes}} {{a way to}} <b>quantify</b> the target as a function that has an object graph and optional parameters as input data and that outputs a numerical value. In general, one can classify <b>quantifying</b> concepts into three types. In the following, each type of <b>quantifying</b> concept is introduced. A <b>quantifying</b> concept is denoted by 〈name of a <b>quantifying</b> concept〉. Note that a concept is usually identified with its extension and that the extension {{is assumed to be}} finite.|$|R
30|$|The graphs above show classifications {{and main}} {{attributes}} of <b>quantifying</b> concepts {{from the three}} viewpoints. The first graph classifies <b>quantifying</b> concepts according to the definitions in Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3. The second graph classifies <b>quantifying</b> concepts into those having a single object graph and those having two object graphs. Finally the third graph classifies quality indicators into those having only (an) object graph(s) and those having (an) object graph(s) plus attribute of the root concept and an attribute <b>quantifying</b> function. The latter <b>quantifying</b> concepts are called attribute-based <b>quantifying</b> concepts (abqc).|$|R
30|$|This paper {{introduces}} a representation system QI-RS of quality indicators, towards development a framework to define quality indicators and calculate their values based on medical databases automatically. QI-RS represents a quality indicator as a labeled graph consisting {{of one or}} two object graph(s) based on Medical Service Ontology (MSO) and a <b>quantifying</b> concept. An object graph denotes a target of quantification, while a <b>quantifying</b> concept indicates a way to <b>quantify</b> the object graph. By constructing object graphs and <b>quantifying</b> concepts, the target and the way to <b>quantify</b> medical service quality independently. Moreover, MSO and <b>quantifying</b> concepts unify vocabulary words and constructions of quality indicators. By using MSO, object graphs and <b>quantifying</b> concepts, one can obtain graph-based representation of quality indicators that satisfies formality and understandability.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define and <b>quantify</b> the term {{robustness}} within the context of a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) project environment from the perspective of the Granting Authority. The paper is conceptual, based on conceptual generalisations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper considers the theory of systems thinking within PFI procurement. This is further integrated with the concept of robustness and resilience used extensively in the ecology discipline. Combining the two, this paper presents a mathematical approach of <b>quantifying</b> robustness in PFI projects. Findings – An analytical model is used to support the mathematical analysis to <b>quantify</b> and define robustness. Research limitations/implications – The <b>quantifying</b> of robustness is based on the principal assumptions presented in the paper. The principal assumptions provide an ideal situation which is necessary to pursue and develop the proposed approach to <b>quantify</b> robustness. Changes to the assumptions may affect the generalisability of the approach. Originality/value – The paper provides a greater definition to robustness within PFI projects and the possibility of <b>quantifying</b> robustness to better monitor and manage the characteristic...|$|R
5|$|Paracetamol may be <b>quantified</b> in blood, plasma, or urine as a {{diagnostic}} tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
