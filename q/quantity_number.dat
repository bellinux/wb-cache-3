These are optional; many models disregard fixed or inventory holding costs. There exist numerous other parameters: prices for the different contracts, salvage value, shortage penalty, lead-time, etc.|$|E

Investigation of beta cells following acute onset of Type 1 diabetes has shown little to no proliferation of newly synthesized beta cells, which suggests that the results seen in the mice models would not occur in human subjects either.|$|E

Quantity-quality trade-offs are considered for both immigrant and native workers. Medium- and long-run labor-supply responses by natives to immigrant-induced changes in wage rates are shown to have second-order effects which substantively affect the impacts of immigrants. The impact of immigration policy depends on the quality, as well as quantity, of immigrants; the time horizon; and the speed of actor market adjustment.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the influence of different plastic covers on microclimate and cherry tomato yield in greenhouses. The experiments were carried out in Piracicaba, state of São Paulo (Brazil), during three growing periods (2008 / 2009 / 2010). A greenhouse was divided in: Environment I (EI) - covered with plastic film anti-UV and thermo-reflective shading screen, and Environment II (EII) - covered with diffusive plastic film; monitored with automatic weather sensors; and cultivated with cherry tomato (‘Sweet Grape’ and ‘Sweet Million’). Use of diffusive plastic in greenhouses provides a better inside distribution of solar energy without causing major changes in air temperature and relative humidity, resulting in higher yield (kg plant- 1), fruits <b>quantity</b> (<b>number</b> plant- 1) and fruits average weight than those obtained under thermo-reflective shading screen...|$|E

Successive reduction in exposure time (200, 100 and 50 ms) resulted in an increased dosage strength recognition error rate, but the effect was independent of the distance between the dosage strength and net quantity. Possible explanations, as well as the benefit of using tachistoscopic presentation to assess the impact of design changes on user performance are discussed...|$|E

Accordingly, this paper proposes an adaptable threshold decision method (ATDM) to provide the most appropriate thresholds for assorted applications. This paper also proposes a PSO (particle swarm optimization) based parameters detector (PBPD) to decide the fittest parameters which are used by ATDM. Image segmentation extracts the regions of interest from an image for follow-up analyses, and thresholding is one important technique for image segmentation. This paper will employ ATDM to detect the object contours in an image in order to investigate the performance of ATDM. The experiments show that ATDM can give impressive segmentation results...|$|E
40|$|A major {{question}} in Knot Theory concerns {{the process of}} trying to determine when two knots are different. A knot invariant is a <b>quantity</b> (<b>number,</b> polynomial, group, etc.) that does not change by continuous deformation of the knot. One of the simplest invariant of knots is colorability. In this thesis, we study Fox colorings of knots and knots that are colored by linear Alexander quandles. In recent years, there has been an interest in reducing Fox colorings to a minimum number of colors. We prove that any Fox coloring of a 13 -colorable knot has a diagram that uses exactly five colors. The ideas behind the reduction of colors in a Fox coloring is extended to knots colored by linear Alexander quandles. Thus, we prove that any knot colored by either the linear Alexander quandle Z 5 [t]/(t − 2) or Z 5 [t]/(t − 3) has a diagram using only four colors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Underwater {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} (UWSN) is {{a special kind of}} {{wireless sensor network}} which is composed of a large <b>quantity</b> <b>number</b> of wireless sensor nodes deployed in the water. While there are extensive studies on deploy-issue of terrestrial wireless sensor networks (WSN), UWSN has not been paid enough attention due to the challenges of UWSN, such as low available bandwidth, highly varying multipath, and large propagation delays. In this paper, we propose a depth-adjustment scheme to maximize the coverage in 3 D space. After deploying nodes in the water surface, we use Voronoi diagram to compute redundant nodes whose disappearance will not decrease the coverage in 2 D space, and then we determine the depth that redundant nodes should be moved towards. After all the redundant nodes have moved to the lower layer, the algorithm continues to schedule redundant nodes of the lower layer until 3 D space coverage is fulfilled...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{development}} of SIMS and LA-ICP-MS technology in the 1980 s and 1990 s, single grain U-Pb dating of detrital zircon has quickly become the most popular technique for sedimentary provenance studies. Currently {{by far the most}} widespread method for visualising detrital age distributions is the so-called Probability Density Plot (PDP), which is calculated by summing a number of Gaussian distributions whose means and standard deviations correspond to the individual ages and their respective analytical uncertainties. Unfortunately, the PDP lacks a firm theoretical basis and can produce counter-intuitive results when data <b>quantity</b> (<b>number</b> of analyses) and/or quality (precision) is high. As a more robust alternative to the PDP, this paper proposes a standard statistical technique called Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), which also involves summing a set of Gaussian distributions, but does not explicitly take into account the analytical uncertainties.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, a new {{approach}} is proposed and analyzed for developing efficient and scalable methodologies for multi-robot active Cooperative Simultaneous Localization And Mapping and Target Tracking (C-SLAMTT). The proposed approach employs an active estimation scheme that switches among linear elements and, as a result, its computational requirements scale linearly with the <b>number</b> of estimated <b>quantities</b> (<b>number</b> of number of robots, landmarks and targets). The parameters of the proposed scheme are calculated off-line using a convex optimization algorithm {{which is based on}} Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) and approximation using Sum-of-Squares (SoS) polynomials. As shown by rigorous arguments, the estimation accuracy of the proposed scheme is equal to the optimal estimation accuracy plus a term that is inversely proportional to the number of estimator’s switching elements (or, equivalently, to the memory storage capacity of the robots’ equipment). The proposed approach can handle various types of constraints such as “stay-within-an-area”, obstacle avoidance and maximum speed constraints. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on a 3 D active cooperative simultaneous mapping and target tracking application employing flying robots. I...|$|R
