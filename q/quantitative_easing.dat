5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing,</b> the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing.</b> This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing,</b> and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing</b> on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{financial}} market functioning under the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) {{and the subsequent}} <b>quantitative</b> monetary <b>easing</b> policy (QMEP) conducted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). First, the estimation results of the Japanese government bond yield curve using the Black-Gorovoi-Linetsky (BGL) model show that (1) the shadow interest rate has been negative since the late 1990 s, turned upward in 2003, and has been on an uptrend since then, and (2) the first-hitting time until the negative shadow interest rate hits zero again under the risk-neutral probability {{is estimated to be}} about three months as of the end of February 2006. Second, under the ZIRP and QMEP, the risk premiums for Japanese banks have almost disappeared in short-term money markets such as the market for negotiable certificates of deposit, while they have remained in the credit default swap market and the stock market. This result supports the view that market participants have positively perceived the BOJfs ample liquidity provisions in containing the near- term defaults of banks caused by the liquidity shortage.

5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the base rate was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing,</b> initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing</b> to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing</b> in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the base rate at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|<b>Quantitative</b> <b>easing</b> (QE) is the {{practice}} in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its domestic economy.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the impact of stock prices and {{interest}} rates on the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) market in Japan by comparing the periods before and after Abenomics. The results show that stock prices have a positive impact, indicating that the wealth effect holds and the stock market leads the REIT market. Before the introduction of Abenomics, the positive impact of stock prices is larger. This is consistent with the fact that REIT was sometimes actively purchased when the stock market showed weakness after the introduction of Abenomics. The negative impact of interest rates indicates that an increase causes a decline in the REIT price. After the introduction of Abenomics, the negative impact of interest rates is larger for the maturity of 10 years. This is consistent {{with the fact that the}} Bank of Japan (BOJ) started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB) aggressively to flatten the yield curves of both JGB and swap through <b>quantitative</b> and qualitative <b>easing.</b> Abenomics; interest rate swaps; JGB; Japanese Government Bonds; REIT; Real Estate Investment Trust; stock prices; Japan; interest rates; wealth effect; stock markets; <b>quantitative</b> easing; qualitative <b>easing...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{major feature}} of recent {{monetary}} policy in Japan has been {{heavy reliance on}} the so-called policy duration effect. This policy employs a commitment {{to compensate for the}} central bank’s inability to lower the interest rate below zero by altering the anticipated course of monetary policy actions. This paper analyzes the behavior of the yield curve and examines the effectiveness and limitations of monetary policy commitment under zero interest rates with four indicators for policy duration effect. Specifically, we extend our previous study (Okina and Shiratsuka (2003)) by applying wavelet analysis to indicators for policy duration effect. As in the previous study, the policy duration effect was found to be highly effective in stabilizing market expectations for the path of short-term interest rates, thereby reducing longer-term interest rates and flattening the yield curve. The policy duration effect, however, failed to reverse deflationary expectations in financial markets. zero interest rate policy, <b>quantitative</b> monetary <b>easing,</b> policy duration effects, policy commitment, wavelet analysis...|$|R

Having taken over in August 2013, Governor Mark Carney wrote his first open letter in February 2015 {{to explain why}} inflation had fallen below 1% {{for the first time}} in the MPC's history.

As of February 2015, Carney has written five such letters. Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, the MPC cut the base rate from 0.5% to 0.25%, the first change since March 2009. At the same time, it announced a further round of <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing,</b> valued at £60 billion, bringing the total to £435 billion.|$|E
5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing</b> (common in 2009 and 2010), tends to lead to a fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{spillover}} effects of Japan's <b>quantitative</b> and qualitative <b>easing</b> (QQE) on East Asian economies. Under the new monetary policy regime, the Japanese yen depreciated substantially, raising concerns {{that it would}} have a regional beggar-thy-neighbor effect. It is thus important to see what effects the QQE had on neighboring economies. Our empirical investigation of East Asian stock markets finds that they first reacted to the yen's depreciation negatively, yet came to respond positively as the QQE progressed, implying that the QQE had a much smaller beggar-thy-neighbor effect than was originally feared. We show that the QQE benefited East Asian economies because the positive spillover effect of Japan's stock market recovery dominated the beggar-thy-neighbor effect in the region...|$|R
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with <b>quantitative</b> <b>easing.</b> If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009 the Chancellor {{announced}} an Asset Purchase Facility (APF), {{to be administered}} by the MPC, aimed at ensuring greater liquidity in financial markets.

It had the Bank buy government bonds (gilts), along with a smaller amount of high-quality debt issued by private companies. Although non-gilts initially made up a non-negligible part of the APF portfolio, as of May 2015 the entirety of the APF was held as gilts.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the overall economic impact and transmission mechanisms of Japan's <b>quantitative</b> monetary <b>easing</b> policy (QMEP) based on Honda, Kuroki, and Tachibana (2007). A vector auto regression (VAR) model analysis {{has led to}} the following four observations. First, an increase of base money raises aggregate output. Second, the impact of the QMEP is primarily transmitted through the channels of asset prices and bank balance sheets. Not verified are the transmission channels of the bank's information production, exchange rate, or the policy duration effect. These findings confirm the results of Honda, Kuroki, and Tachibana (2007). but the identification of bank balance sheets as a transmission channel represents a new finding. Additionally, these channels were reaffirmed even when subject to more rigorous analysis. Third, the QMEP raises interest rates in the long term, which raises doubt about the validity of the policy duration effect and, in particular, the signaling effect. Fourth, even during the period when a traditional interest rate policy was being implemented, base money had an effect on aggregate output. These results suggest that Japan's monetary policy has been an effective means of easing Japan's prolonged economic downturn. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model with broad liquidity services {{to discuss the}} consequences of massive money injection in an economy with the zero interest rate bound. We incorporate Good-friend’s (2000) idea of broad liquidity services into the model by allowing the amounts of bonds with various maturities held by a household to enter its utility function. We show that the sa-tiation of money (or the zero marginal utility of money) is not {{a necessary condition for}} the one-period interest rate to reach the zero lower bound; instead, we present a weaker necessary condition that the marginal liquidity service provided by money coincides with the marginal liq-uidity service provided by the one-period bonds, both of which are not necessarily equal to zero. This result implies that massive money injection would have some influences on an equilibrium of the economy even if it does not alter the private sector’s expectations about future monetary policy. Our empirical results indicate that forward interest rates started to decline relative to the corresponding futures rates just after March 2001, when a <b>quantitative</b> monetary <b>easing</b> policy started by the Bank of Japan, and that the forward and futures spread has never closed until the policy ended in March 2006.

I conclude that although the implementation of unconventional monetary policy measures may introduce more volatility into global markets, in general it will support global rebalancing by encouraging emerging market currency revaluation.
