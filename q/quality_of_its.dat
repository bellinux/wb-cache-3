Within a few weeks, he was appointed minister of the First Methodist Church in Jacksonville, Florida, a position he held for the remainder of 1909 and the first half of 1910. Sledd was subsequently invited to return to Southern University as its president, serving from 1910 to 1914. While president of Southern University, he implemented a new pre-college preparatory school and a four-year course of Bible study, and focused his personal efforts on restoring the school's finances and improving the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> instruction.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 57% of the Island's {{area was}} {{agricultural}} land (an increase on 2008). Major agricultural products are potatoes and dairy produce; agriculture's share of GVA increased 5% in 2009, a fifth successive year of growth. Jersey cattle {{are a small}} breed of cow widely known for its rich milk and cream; the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> meat is also appreciated on a small scale. The herd total in 2009 was 5,090 animals. Fisheries and aquaculture make use of Jersey's marine resources to a total value of over £6 million in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Obsidian is {{the first}} game that was {{developed}} by Revolution Software co-founder Tony Warriner, who was a school pupil at the time. Due to concentrating on Obsidians development rather than revising he failed all of his exams. The game received a positive response from journalists, it was praised for the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> graphics, reviewers held mixed views on the game's ability to maintain player interest. The jet pack was criticized for being too sensitive when responding to the player's movement inputs.|$|E

5|$|The {{critic and}} screenwriter Saeroen, writing for Pemandangan, praised Kedok Ketawa, {{especially}} its cinematography {{and the beauty}} of its scenery; he compared the film to imported Hollywood films. An anonymous review in Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found that the film was a mix of native and European sensibilities and lauded its cinematography. According to the review, the film surpassed expectations, but it was evident that this was a first production. Another review, in Soerabaijasch Handelsblad, considered the film among the best local productions, emphasising the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> cinematography and acting.|$|E

5|$|Adult coconut crabs have {{no known}} predators {{apart from other}} coconut crabs and humans. Its large size and the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> meat means that the coconut crab is {{extensively}} hunted and is very rare on islands with a human population. The coconut crab is eaten by Southeast Asians and Pacific Islanders and is considered a delicacy and an aphrodisiac, and intensive hunting has threatened the species' survival in some areas. While the coconut crab itself is not innately poisonous, it may become so depending on its diet, and cases of coconut crab poisoning have occurred. For instance, consumption of the sea mango Cerbera manghas by the coconut crab may make the coconut crab toxic due {{to the presence of}} cardiac cardenolides.|$|E
5|$|Coffin {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor goods for the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> goods. Coffin had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the goods produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for the goods. The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
5|$|On the {{southern}} {{side of the}} town, on a triangle of land bounded on the east by the A37, on the north by {{the line of the}} former East Somerset Railway, and on the west by Cannard's Grave Road, is Tadley Acres, a modern housing development built on land partly belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. The development has been praised for the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> design and the use of locally sourced natural building materials. North of the former railway line is Collett Park. Across Cannard's Grave Road from Tadley Acres is the Mid-Somerset Showground. Immediately to the south-west of the town centre, on a site which {{at the start of the}} 20th century had been the grounds of the former Summerleaze House and then a shoe-factory, is the Townsend Retail Park, built in 2006–7.|$|E

40|$|We {{document}} {{that in the}} European car industry, exchange rate pass-through is larger for low than for high quality cars. To rationalize this pattern, we develop a model <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> pricing and international trade based on the preferences of Mussa and Rosen (1978). Firms sell goods <b>of</b> heterogeneous <b>quality</b> to consumers that differ in their willingness to pay for quality. Each firm produces a unique <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the good and enjoys local market power, which depends on the prices and <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> closest competitors. The market power of a firm depends on the prices and <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> direct competitors in the quality dimension. The top quality firm, being exposed to just one direct competitor, enjoys the highest market power and equilibrium markup. Because higher quality exporters are closer to the technological leader, markups are generally increasing in quality, exporting is relatively more profitable for high quality than for low quality firms, {{and the degree of}} exchange rat...|$|R

5|$|Pillars are a {{major part}} of Western Chalukya {{architecture}} and were produced in two main types: pillars with alternate square blocks and a sculptured cylindrical section with a plain square-block base, and bell-shaped lathe-turned pillars. The former type is more vigorous and stronger than the bell-shaped type, which is made of soapstone and has a <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> own. Inventive workmanship was used on soapstone shafts, roughly carved into the required shapes using a lathe. Instead of laboriously rotating a shaft to obtain the final finish, workers added the final touches to an upright shaft by using sharp tools. Some pillars were left unpolished, as evidenced by the presence of fine grooves made by the pointed end of the tool. In other cases, polishing resulted in pillars with fine reflective properties such as the pillars in the temples at Bankapura, Itagi and Hangal. This pillar art reached its zenith in the temples at Gadag, specifically the Sarasvati Temple in Gadag city.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Antiquary, A {{journal of}} oriental {{research}} in archaeology, history, literature, language, philosophy, religion, folklore, , , (subtitle varies) was a journal of original research relating to India, published between 1872 and 1933. It {{was founded by}} the archaeologist James Burgess to enable the sharing of knowledge between scholars based in Europe and in India and was notable for the high <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> epigraphic illustrations which enabled scholars to make accurate translations of texts {{that in many cases}} remain the definitive versions to this day. It was also pioneering in its recording of Indian folklore and folktales. It was succeeded by The New Indian Antiquary (1938-47) and the Indian Antiquary (1964-71).|$|E
5|$|The President {{was coming}} into {{increasing}} conflict with Congress on {{the handling of}} the Zone, including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or raised questions about the appointments of replacement commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by Poultney Bigelow, a lecturer and writer for the American Geographical Society, who wrote a scathing report on progress in the Canal Zone—a report that was well-publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> management. Magoon countered this negative press by stressing that Bigelow had visited the Zone for less than two days, one of which was Thanksgiving Day, and that work was naturally lax on the holiday.|$|E

5|$|The Shetland {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} British breeds. The ewes are usually polled (hornless) and the rams usually horned, although horned ewes and polled rams do occur occasionally. The breed is noted for its very fine, soft wool and the high <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> meat, though its smaller size limits its use in commercial meat markets. They are small-bodied animals, with some wool on their faces, noses or legs, but not in excess. The legs are of medium length and finely boned. They have small, erect ears. A distinguishing feature of northern short-tailed sheep is the short, fluke-shaped tail, broad at the base, tapering to a point, and covered towards the tip in hair, not wool.|$|E
5|$|The {{results were}} not immediate. In 1862, cattle sold at La Souterraine weighed about 600kg. The decline of Anglomania {{in favour of}} {{economic}} pragmatism, and the criticism {{and fall of the}} aristocracy aided the development of Limousin cattle. The Limousin breed became renowned for the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> meat and the exceptional performance of its carcase, and was voted best European breed in 1857, 1858 and 1859 during the food animal competitions held in Poissy. The crowning moment was the honour received by the bull Achilles Caillaud to open the competition in Paris for all breeds in 1886 (the year the Limousin Herd Book was created), and the grand champion prize of all breeds won three years later by Charles Léobardy for his team.|$|E
