40|$|Abstract: We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and aggregate productivity in regions and sectors. Using recent Spanish aggregate data for the period 2001 - 2006, we find that <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> {{may be an important}} factor to explain productivity levels in sectors and regions. We use two alternatives definitions of quality in work: one from survey data and the other from a social indicators approach. We also use two different measurements of labour productivity to test the robustness of our results. The estimates are run using a simultaneous equation model for our panel of data, and find important differences between high tech and low tech sectors: a positive relationship between <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and productivity in the former case, and a negative relationship in the latter. Consequently, on the one hand we see that <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> is not only an objective per se, but may also be a production factor able to increase the wealth of regions; on the other hand, at the aggregate level, we may also find that high productivity levels coincide with lower <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> conditions...|$|E

In this chapter we will review how the issue of <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and employment has been introduced in European policy arena through the European Employment Strategy (EES) (section 1) and the related conceptual framework and monitoring indicators (section 2). We will discuss some of the results issued from the research on <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and employment in Europe (section 3).

40|$|This {{research}} project seeks {{to gauge the}} autonomous power of the European Commission within the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), a new mode of governance coined at the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 {{and based on the}} principle of the voluntary cooperation of Member States. Two cases form the basis of this inquiry, namely, <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> a policy issue addressed under the banner of the European Employment Strategy, and child poverty and social exclusion, a key item on the agenda of the OMC for Social Inclusion. A primary impetus {{at the heart of this}} project is one of ontological pluralism. Rejecting a zero-sum interpretation of the rationalist/constructivist debate, this study constitutes a plea for a conversation across paradigms. The domain-of-application model employed here works by preserving the integrity of individual theories while specifying a particular scope condition under which constructivist and rationalist insights are likely to prevail. Selecting two cases on the basis of the critical scope condition of issue sensitivity, a central postulate informing this integrative research design is that high issue sensitivity (<b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work)</b> invites strategic interaction among pre-constituted social actors driven by a behavioural logic of utility-maximization, while low issue sensitivity (child poverty and social exclusion) allows for a fundamentally norm-guided behaviour. Concretely, in effecting this theoretical dialogue, two sets of causal hypotheses are examined. On the one hand, rational choice institutionalism (principal-agent theory) offers a number of suppositions about the Commission’s institutional power, that is, its ability to transform the conditions of action of self-seeking national governments. On the other hand, sociological institutionalism conceptualizes the Commission’s productive power (i. e. its power to constitute the interests and identities of individual agents) through the lens of discourse analysis. Testing theoretical predictions against collected data makes plain the superior explanatory value of independent variables and causal mechanisms of rationalist lineage in capturing the essence of the Commission’s autonomous power in the case of <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and the congruity of sociological institutionalism’s original conjectures in the area of child poverty and social exclusion. Crucially, this strict correspondence corroborates the pertinence of the critical scope condition of issue sensitivity in delineating the explanatory ambit of both theories and attests to the co-existence of different forms of autonomous power wielded by the Commission within the framework of the OMC.

In addressing the assessment of <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> psychology research, we draw on 22 in-depth interviews with work psychologists about their current practices and expectations around qualitative research. Using narrative analysis, the various plots and narratives that constitute how interviewees understand good qualitative research are identified. The implications {{of the use of}} these narratives for both how quality is understood and the use of qualitative research in this area are addressed. Drawing on Weick's concept of sensemaking as a theoretical framework, it is argued that the narratives identified enable the construction of a hegemonic understanding of what is good methodological practice within the work psychology discipline. The implications of this for the work psychology field and the methodological practices of work psychologists are considered. ...|$|E

In the search for improved productivity, manager and executives alike are discovering the important contribution of QWL. QWL entails the design of work systems that enhance the working life experiences of organizational members, thereby improving commitment and motivation for achieving organizational goals. Most, often, this has been implemented through the design of jobs that afford workers more direct control over their immediate work environment.

However, {{little is known about the}} informal aspects of HRP and which social processes actually lead to implementation success or failure. The purpose of this paper is to develop a concept of social processes between managers and employees that can increase the implementation and quality of HR-performance Two studies of HRP within two manufacturing companies are used to illustrate the pros and cons of this new theoretical concept from a performance perspective. Involvement, commitment, and competence development are identified as key aspects of the quality of HRP.

It is an attempt to identify role of QWL to sustain a robust work culture to the employees of the SAGO mills. Primary data were collected through a well structured undisguised questionnaire. This study has highlighted some positive aspects of QWL and the main finding is that employees of different status differ in their preference of QWL factor. The result of this study reveals that the expectation of the flexi-working condition and alternative work schedule is high. The employees perception towards the facets of the QWL was different and the employees have high dissatisfaction with existence of some facets of the QWL, such as welfare measures, recognition and physical working conditions. The strategies which are recommended here is to divergent facets of the QWL to the employees in different status and improve the interpersonal relations, participatory management and physical working conditions to ensure robust work culture...|$|E

40|$|ED EPSInternational audienceThe {{study of}} job quality has known major {{developments}} in the academic field over the last ten years, especially in economics and industrial relations studies. The growing interest for job satisfaction data among labour economists has generated a debate about the preeminent factors explaining workers' judgements {{on the quality of}} their jobs. Besides, many studies question the trend to the decline of job satisfaction observed in national and European surveys, despite rising real wages, which could be explained, among other factors, by some kind of work intensification and its impact on work-life balance. Job quality has also become an economic policy issue, both at international level through the definition of "decent work" by the ILO, and at European level through the inclusion of so-called "quality in work" indicators in the European Employment Strategy in 2001. These definitions involve a range of dimensions, like wage level, social security and representation rights, type of contracts, training opportunities [...] . which can be influenced by labour market and social policies. Nevertheless, these international indicators are rarely used in the literature, and apart from few empirical studies, very little is known about job quality from a comparative perspective. This article tries to fill this gap by implementing, discussing and completing European indicators. The empirical enquiry is based on hypotheses derived from both the literature on job quality, and from usual results from comparative labour market research. We draw policy oriented conclusions, concerning both the European Employment Strategy, in particular the relevant indicators to monitor <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work,</b> and the relationships between national institutions and the quality of employment...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1970 s, income {{inequality}} {{has been on}} the rise in a number of OECD countries, although nowhere it has increased as much as in the UK and the US (Gottschalk and Smeeding 1997). Many factors enter into the determination of income inequality. Low pay and unemployment, especially of people other than head of family, {{play an important role in}} determining households ’ poverty, while government redistributive programs exert an important compensatory role- the latter for instance account for the stability of income in Canada and most European continental countries (Ruiz-Huerta et al. 1999). Income inequality is strongly correlated with the evolution of earnings inequality. While the US (and the UK) have experienced the sharpest increase in wage inequality, recent research seems to suggest an acceleration in the widening of wage differentials and an increase of the “working poor ” also in some continental European countries (cf. Ruiz-Huerta et al. 1999 for comparative analysis of wage dispersion; Howell and Huebler 2001 for a critical assessment; Brandolini et al. 2000 for Italy). As in the US and in the UK, the rise in earnings inequality in the EU countries is to be ascribed to changes at the margin of the labour market: a rise in low pay jobs which is accounted for by the increasing importance of new flexible “non standard ” patterns of employment 1. A EU comparative analysis on <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> and social exclusion (EU 2001, p. 76) concludes that in 1996 almost a quarter of the European workforce were in jobs of low quality, with the highest share among temporary contract workers, and especially temporary workers in part-time jobs 2.

An aptitude test is an effective method for testing the students however the creation of database for conducting aptitude tests is an uphill task, because the organization has to maintain to a very large database consisting of thousands of questions and the content has to be changed periodically to avoid repeating of questions. An Automated & Secure Content Generation System (ASCGS) is a framework that provides automated creation of aptitude questions by converting a single of type of question into multiple questions by altering its variables. Also the system automates the process of calculating the answer for every question by using its formula. Security in the system {{is provided by the}} means of encryption. The present system lags in many perspectives like every question in has to be created manually and also the answer for the question has to be computed manually. Since the entire work is being done manually so there is a high risk that some questions may contain error due to human fault and also the cost and effort required to create the content is large. The proposed system overcomes these shortcomings of the existing system as only one format is required to be created for one type of question thus saving time and human effort. Also it is no longer required to do mathematical calculation manually as it is done by the system, the user has to insert only the formula. The present system requires the organization very long time ranging from few weeks to few months for generating ten thousand questions. With the new system the same work can be done within few days time and with minimal cost. With the development of the system organizations will be relieved from the tedious work of content creation and also management of content will become easier and efficient.

The {{aim of the}} study was to examine work content and to compare working conditions and care quality between work groups specialized on clients with a psychiatric diagnosis with groups working with a heterogeneous client group (old, young with a wide variety of disablement, including psychiatric disablement). Ten work groups from three municipalities were investigated by qualitative methodologies. The results identify three areas of work content: 1) Work areas focused on basic everyday needs : service and caregiving; 2) Medical care and physiotherapy; 3) Work areas aiming for client's independence social education. Analysis of the combination of work areas and client group led to a fourfold table categorization of the work groups as client specialized versus non specialized and task specialized versus non specialized. The best balance between work conditions and care quality were found in the organizational model that combine client specialization with a generalist competence in tasks. The study describes the emotional and intellectual demands of care work and underlines the significance of a professional support. Keywords: Home care work, work-conditions, work-organization, care quality, professionalization, specialization, stress, support, psychiatric reform. Syftet med denna studie var dels att undersöka omsorgsarbetets innehåll i hemtjänst- och boendestödverksamhet, dels att jämföra olika organisatoriska modeller både när det gäller arbetsvillkor och omsorgskvalitet. Från tre kommuner undersöktes med kvalitativ metodik 10 arbetsgrupper som representerade specialisering resp. icke-specialisering på psykiatriska klienter. Resultaten identifierar tre breda klientrelaterade arbetsområden : 1) att ersätta eller komplettera klienternas bristande förmågor och sociala resurser, 2) sjukvård och fysiskt rehabilitering, 3) stöd och utveckling av klienternas egna resurser. Jämförelser mellan gruppernas arbetsinnehåll visade att grupperna även kunde kategoriseras som specialiserade/icke-specialiserade vad gäller arbetsuppgifter. Analys av de fyra kombinationerna tyder på olika konsekvenser för omsorgskvalitet och personalens arbetsvillkor. Den modell som bäst balanserar god omsorgskvalitet och bra arbetsvillkor är klientspecialisering med generalistkompetens i uppgifter.

40|$|Excerpt] The sixteenth {{edition of}} the Employment in Europe appears just after the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s {{enlargement}} to twenty-five Member States in May 2004. This unprecedented enlargement is a milestone {{in the history of}} European integration and has led to a united European continent sharing common values, fostering economic growth and social cohesion and strengthening Europe 2 ̆ 7 s role in a globalised world. The most fundamental objective of the European Union, however, remains unchanged: to help raise the living standards and {{the quality of life of}} its citizens. This implies improving the growth performance of the EU economy on a sustainable basis; pursuing the way back to full employment in Europe; enhancing productivity and <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> (2 ̆ 2 better jobs 2 ̆ 2); and fostering social cohesion and inclusion. Achieving full employment and reinforcing social cohesion will largely depend on an appropriate macroeconomic policy-mix and on effective employment and social policies. First, an appropriate policy setting would ensure high levels of business and consumer confidence and thus help maintain buoyant demand levels throughout the economic cycle. Second, effective employment and social policies are key to reducing poverty, social exclusion and regional imbalances, in turn helping to manage properly the social consequences of economic change. The parallel development of economic and social prosperity is central to the European Social Model. In its diverse forms in the Union, the model has played a crucial role in helping to lift productivity and living standards across Europe. It has also helped to ensure that the benefits are widely shared, recognising that we cannot make our economies stronger by making sections of society poorer. Against this background, the current report shows that the EU 25 is potentially well placed to take advantage of the opportunities provided by enlargement. Following the economic slowdown of recent years, the report also documents some encouraging signs of a global economic recovery which may eventually help put Europe back on track towards the ambitious Lisbon objective for the EU “to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion”...|$|E
40|$|This Master thesis {{was mainly}} {{performed}} at Electrolux Automated Equipment and Tooling (AE&T) in Adelaide, Australia between September 2004 and January 2005. The aim with {{this project was}} to investigate the process and co- operation of the areas CAD, CAM and CNC-machines at the plant and come up with more efficient solutions. The outcome of the project is an investment recommendation and organizational change. The project has been performed at AE&T and finished in Sweden. The current situation has been documented and analysed, literature has been reviewed, benchmarking visits have been made, a questionnaire has been sent out and the future situation and requirements have been analysed. AE&T is a toolmaking company within the Electrolux concern. Though, its "to be or not to be" has been discussed a lot during this last year. The plant was out for sale during fall 2004 as it was {{not a part of the}} core business, according to Electrolux. In December 2005, Electrolux decided to keep the business in the concern anyway. It is a tough situation for tooling companies at the moment and to be competitive on the world market one has to have an optimal and efficient organization, have skills and new technology, be suitable and helpful to meet customer requests, be time saving and have a helpful system to support the business. AE&T have the skills, but need to use them in the right place of organization and update its technology. Our recommendation is in two steps. The first is to train the CNC operators to do the CAM at the shop floor instead of having a designated CAM programmer. They also have to replace the old CNC-machines and increase the total quantity to get higher capacity and more effective production hours. The designers should become project leaders and together with a new information- and planning-system make the manufacturing go smother with lower lead times. The organization change will improve the motivation and <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> <b>work</b> as well as in products. Another change is to employ missing skills, like salesmen. Salesmen are needed to get more work to the shop and fill up all the three coming shifts as planned in this solution. The recommendation concerning the software is to keep the current solution, but be prepared to change software to attract more customers and come by file translation and rework and thereby also save time. The second step is to buy a new set of three CNC-machines and a new information- and planning- system that is self-learning and decision-making. The economical appraisal shows that the changes and investments for both steps are profitable and payback time is two years, which is a demand from Electrolux. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|In most {{professional}} literature about quality improvement and quality management, both authors and interviewed managers imply an inherent positive acceptance of <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> the <b>work</b> place. Thus, quality {{is seen as}} an employee’s natural frame of mind, ready to be implemented as soon as sufficient organizational means to do so are provided by the management. This is why most managers worry about the institution of quality improvement measures rather than the acceptance of these measures by their employees. The article argues that employees and other persons concerned with quality have constructed different representations of <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> both, <b>work</b> and every day life. For the employee these constructs take the place and weight of scientific realities, also called “subjective theories”, and may affect the individual’s degree of acceptance of the company’s decisions and management directives.

30|$|The main {{drawback}} of DIBR {{technology is}} a low one-time image quality. The holes [2, 3], artifacts [4, 5], deformation [6], and abnormal edge [7] will appear after image warping; repair works for these issues, such as inpainting, have high computational complexity. Although {{there are a lot}} of recent work on improving imaging <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> real time [8], Ho [9] and Xiao [10] reduced the computational complexity and improved operational efficiency <b>in</b> their <b>work</b> but still cannot achieve real-time performance. Mori [11] and Zinger [12] enhanced imaging <b>quality</b> <b>in</b> their <b>work</b> but further increased computational complexity.|$|R
