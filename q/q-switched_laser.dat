50|$|Studies {{of various}} tattoo {{pigments}} {{have shown that}} a number of pigments (most containing iron oxide or titanium dioxide) change color when irradiated with <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> energy. Some tattoo colors including flesh tones, light red, white, peach and light brown containing pigments as well as some green and blue tattoo pigments, changed to black when irradiated with <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> pulses. The resulting gray-black color may require more treatments to remove. If tattoo darkening does occur, after 8 weeks the newly darkened tattoo can be treated as if it were black pigment.|$|E
50|$|Lightwave Electronics' first {{significant}} success in industrial markets {{was a series}} of acousto-optically <b>Q-switched</b> <b>lasers</b> at 1047 nm, based on neodymium-doped yttrium lithium fluoride (Nd:YLF), and at 1342 nm, based on neodymium-doped yttrium orthovanadate, which were used to improve yield in semiconductor memory manufacturing. For about 2 decades, from about 1988 to 2008, semiconductor manufacturers used the Lightwave Electronics miniature <b>Q-switched</b> <b>lasers</b> in the link blowing step during the production {{of the majority of the}} worldâ€™s dynamic random-access memory chips. These miniature <b>Q-switched</b> <b>lasers</b> were in systems built by Electro Scientific Industries, GSI, and Nikon.|$|R

50|$|Very rarely, non <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> treatments, like CO2 or Argon lasers, {{which are}} very rarely offered these days, can rupture blood vessels and aerosolize tissue {{requiring}} a plastic shield or a cone device to protect the laser operator from tissue and blood contact. Protective eyewear may be worn if the laser operator chooses to do so.|$|E
50|$|A novel {{method for}} laser tattoo removal using a {{fractionated}} CO2 or Erbium:YAG laser, {{alone or in}} combination with Q-switched lasers, was reported by Ibrahimi and coworkers from the Wellman Center of Photomedicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital. This new approach to laser tattoo removal may afford the ability to remove colors such as yellow and white, which {{have proven to be}} resistant to traditional <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> therapy.|$|E
5000|$|Infrared lasers with {{wavelengths}} {{longer than}} about 1.4 micrometers are {{often referred to}} as [...] "eye-safe", because the cornea tends to absorb light at these wavelengths, protecting the retina from damage. The label [...] "eye-safe" [...] can be misleading, however, as it applies only to relatively low power continuous wave beams; a high power or <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> at these wavelengths can burn the cornea, causing severe eye damage, and even moderate power lasers can injure the eye.|$|E
50|$|Pulsewidth or pulse {{duration}} {{is a critical}} <b>laser</b> parameter. All <b>Q-switched</b> <b>lasers</b> have appropriate {{pulse duration}}s for tattoo removal.|$|R
50|$|<b>Q-switch</b> <b>laser</b> is {{also used}} by beauticians {{around the world to}} treat skin-related issues like acne, pigmentation, dark spots, and fixes for ant-aging. According to The Telegraph, in India, leading skin care specialists like Kaya Skin Clinic, Richfeel, and VLCC make use of <b>Q-switch</b> <b>laser</b> {{technology}} for a variety of purposes. A review of these services provided to the customers at large denote that Q switch is a more effective alternative than most other techniques.|$|R
5000|$|Widely {{considered}} {{the gold standard}} treatment modality to remove a tattoo, laser tattoo removal requires repeat visits. The newer <b>Q-switched</b> <b>lasers</b> are said by the National Institutes of Health to result in scarring only rarely and are usually used only after a topical anesthetic has been applied. Areas with thin skin {{will be more likely}} to scar than thicker-skinned areas. There are several types of <b>Q-switched</b> <b>lasers,</b> and each is effective at removing a different range of the color spectrum. Lasers developed after 2006 provide multiple wavelengths and can successfully treat a much broader range of tattoo pigments than previous individual <b>Q-switched</b> <b>lasers.</b> Unfortunately the dye systems used to change the wavelength result in significant power reduction such that the use of multiple separate specific wavelength lasers remains the gold standard.|$|R
50|$|The use of Q-switched lasers {{could very}} rarely produce the {{development}} of large bulla. However, if patients follow post care directions to elevate, rest, and apply intermittent icing, it should minimize the chances of bulla and other adverse effects. In addition, health care practitioners should contemplate {{the use of a}} cooling device during the tattoo removal procedure. While the infrequent bulla development is a possible side effect of <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> tattoo removal, if treated appropriately and quickly by the health care practitioner, it is unlikely that long term consequences would ensue.|$|E
5000|$|A typical <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> (e.g. a Nd:YAG laser) with a {{resonator}} {{length of}} e.g. 10 cm can produce light pulses of several tens of nanoseconds duration. Even when the average power is well below 1 W, the peak {{power can be}} many kilowatts. Large-scale laser systems can produce Q-switched pulses with energies of many joules and peak powers in the gigawatt region. On the other hand, passively Q-switched microchip lasers (with very short resonators) have generated pulses with durations far below one nanosecond and pulse repetition rates from hundreds of hertz to several megahertz (MHz) ...|$|E
50|$|In a <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser,</b> the {{population}} inversion {{is allowed to}} build up by introducing loss inside the resonator which exceeds the gain of the medium; this can also {{be described as a}} reduction of the quality factor or 'Q' of the cavity. Then, after the pump energy stored in the laser medium has approached the maximum possible level, the introduced loss mechanism (often an electro- or acousto-optical element) is rapidly removed (or that occurs by itself in a passive device), allowing lasing to begin which rapidly obtains the stored energy in the gain medium. This results in a short pulse incorporating that energy, and thus a high peak power.|$|E

5000|$|Local {{allergic}} {{responses to}} many tattoo pigments have been reported, and allergic reactions to tattoo pigment after <b>Q-switched</b> <b>laser</b> treatment are also possible. Rarely, when yellow cadmium sulfide {{is used to}} [...] "brighten" [...] the red or yellow portion of a tattoo, a photoallergic reaction may occur. The reaction is also common with red ink, which may contain cinnabar (mercuric sulphide). Erythema, pruritus, and even inflamed nodules, verrucose papules, or granulomas may present. The reaction will be confined {{to the site of}} the red/yellow ink. Treatment consists of strict sunlight avoidance, sunscreen, interlesional steroid injections, or in some cases, surgical removal. Unlike the destructive modalities described, Q-switched lasers mobilize the ink and may generate a systemic allergic response.

40|$|Graphene-like {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{materials have}} shown remarkable broadband saturable absorption properties. These materials were successfully applied into mode locked lasers to generate laser pulses with the pulse duration from picosecond to femtosecond.
