40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> in conjunction with user fees on the utilization and equality of outpatient services at a range of public sector health facilities in India. Project impact on outpatient visits was estimated via the difference-in-difference method using pooled time series visit data from project and control facilities. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> significantly increased visits at all facility types. The project effect was largest at primary health center (PHC) and community health center (CHC), followed by district hospital (DH) and female district hospital (FDH). Pro-rich inequalities in outpatient visits increased at DHs and FDHs while at CHCs and PHCs the distribution remained equitable. This suggests that <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> at public sector health facilities can increase utilization of outpatient services in the presence of nominal user fees, but can also promote greater inequality favoring the better-off. At the referral hospital level, <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> should be made in conjuction with programs which encourage utilization by the poor. In contrast, the benefit of <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> at PHCs and CHCs is equitably distributed. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

40|$|Many {{policy-makers}} {{and health}} economists {{are interested in}} designing and implementing user fee/quality improvement programs in public facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa on a national scale. This research addresses two design issues for a national program: (1) to what extent would user fees finance the costs of <b>quality</b> <b>improvements,</b> and (2) whether a uniform program could be implemented throughout the country or the user fees should differ between {{urban and rural areas}} or across health regions. A national survey was conducted to determine the population's willingness and ability to pay for seven quality improvements: (1) facility maintenance, (2) supervision of personnel, and drugs to treat (3) diarrheal diseases, (4) acute respiratory infections (ARI), (5) malaria, (6) intestinal parasites, and (7) sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Willingness to pay for <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> was measured by contingent valuation techniques in which subjects were asked about expenditures for care at government facilities under a hypothetical user fee/quality improvement program. Ability to pay was measured by monthly expenditures for health care as a percentage of monthly household consumption. The majority of the population was willing to pay the cost of the <b>quality</b> <b>improvements,</b> which ranged from U. S. $ 0. 40 to U. S. $ 4. 00. Estimates of the percentage of the population that was willing to pay the cost of the <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> ranged from 81 % for facility maintenance (an improvement with the lowest cost) to 64 % for drugs to treat ARI (the improvement with the highest cost). The median willingness to pay ranged from U. S. $ 7. 98 for drugs to treat malaria to U. S. $ 16. 61 for drugs to treat diarrheal diseases. Willingness to pay was greater in rural areas than in urban areas. It was also greater in Health Region I than in Health Regions IV and V. The population was able to pay the estimated cost of all seven <b>quality</b> <b>improvements.</b> Median monthly health care expenditures per episode of illness was 2. 6 % of median monthly household consumption. In comparison, the estimated cost of the <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> ranged from 0. 2 to 2. 4 % median monthly household consumption. The national user fee/quality improvement program has good prospects for financing the <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> because {{the majority of the population}} is willing to pay the estimated costs of the <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> and more than half of the population is willing to pay substantially more than the costs. It also appears that the user fees should differ between urban and rural areas and across some health regions. user fees quality of care child survival contingent valuation health care finance...|$|R

40|$|This study {{develops}} a discrete choice locational equilibrium model {{to evaluate the}} benefits of the air <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> that occurred in the Los Angeles area following the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). The discrete choice equilibrium approach accounts for the fact that air <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> brought about by the 1990 CAAA will change housing choices and prices. The study also provides new evidence for the distributional welfare impacts of the 1990 CAAA in the Los Angeles area. Findings suggest that the air <b>quality</b> <b>improvements</b> that occurred in the Los Angeles area between 1990 and 2000 provided substantial general equilibrium benefits to households. The analysis reveals noticeable differences between partial and general equilibrium welfare gains, demonstrating that ignoring equilibrium effects will likely misrepresent the benefits of large environmental changes. In addition, we find that the equilibrium welfare impacts of the 1990 CAAA in the Los Angeles area varied significantly across income groups.
