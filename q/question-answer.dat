Instances are questions that we can ask, and solutions are desired answers to these questions.|$|E

QUESTION ANSWERING A <b>question-answering</b> system accepts information about some subject areas and answers questions by utilizing this information. The type of <b>question-answering</b> system considered in this paper is ideally one having the following features: 1. A language general enough to describe any reasonable <b>question-answering</b> subjects and express desired questions and answers. 2.

25|$|Huma Shah {{points out}} that Turing himself was {{concerned}} with whether a machine could think and was providing a simple method to examine this: through human-machine <b>question-answer</b> sessions. Shah argues there is one imitation game which Turing described could be practicalised in two different ways: a) one-to-one interrogator-machine test, and b) simultaneous comparison of a machine with a human, both questioned in parallel by an interrogator. Since the Turing test is a test of indistinguishability in performance capacity, the verbal version generalises naturally to all of human performance capacity, verbal as well as nonverbal (robotic).|$|E
25|$|The {{research}} group, {{headed by}} Robert D.

Another major task of the group is to investigate and re-evaluate the status of the information structure primitives (topic, focus, contrast, etc.) as cross-linguistically valid categories. To achieve this, the members of the group combine extensive corpus analysis of the data in their respective languages with production experiments; all findings are further cross-checked through standard information structure tests (<b>question-answer</b> pairs, aboutness tests, association with focus sensitive items).|$|E

40|$|Automatic <b>question-answering</b> is a {{classical}} problem in natural language processing, which aims at designing systems that can automatically answer a question, {{in the same}} way as human does. In this work, we propose a deep learning based model for automatic <b>question-answering.</b> First the questions and answers are embedded using neural probabilistic modeling. Then a deep similarity neural network is trained to find the similarity score of a pair of answer and question. Then for each question, the best answer is found as the one with the highest similarity score. We first train this model on a large-scale public <b>question-answering</b> database, and then fine-tune it to transfer to the customer-care chat data. We have also tested our framework on a public <b>question-answering</b> database and achieved very good performance...|$|R

2500|$|Though {{the company}} had experimented with other subject matter in {{previous}} Carmen Sandiego games, to many critics this title, along with Word Detective (1997) and Math Detective (1998), marked the franchise's debut in subjects other than geography.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of saving various computational resources {{is an argument}} often advanced in favor of permitting <b>question-answering</b> systems to make occasional errors.

Shannon's rate-distortion theory is used to calculate bounds on the memory required for several <b>question-answering</b> tasks. For data retrieval, pattern-classification, and position-matching systems it was found that only small memory gains could be materialized from error-tolerance. In pair-ordering tasks on the other hand, more significant memory savings could be accomplished if small errorrates are tolerated. Similar limitations govern the tradeoffs between error and computation time. 1...|$|R

40|$|Restricted domains such as {{medicine}} set a context where <b>question-answering</b> {{is more likely}} expected {{to be associated with}} knowledge and reasoning (Mollá and Vicedo, 2007; Ferret and Zweigenbaum, 2007). On the one hand, knowledge and reasoning may be more necessary than in open-domain <b>question-answering</b> be-cause of more specific or more difficult questions. On the other hand, it may also be more manageable, since by def-inition restricted-domain QA should not have to face the same breadth of ques-tions as open-domain QA.

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} {{a method of}} using multiple documents with decreasing weights as evidence to improve {{the performance of a}} <b>question-answering</b> system. We also describe how it was used in cross-language question answering (CLQA) tasks. Sometimes, the answer to a question may be found in multiple documents. In such cases, using multiple documents for prediction generates better answers than using a single document. Therefore, our method uses information from multiple documents by adding the scores of candidate answers extracted from the various documents. Because simply adding scores degrades the performance of <b>question-answering</b> systems, we add scores with decreasing weights to reduce the negative effect of simply adding. We used this method in the CLQA part of NTCIR- 5. It was incorporated into a commercially available translation system that carries out cross-language <b>question-answering</b> tasks. Our method obtained relatively good CLQA results. Index Terms—Machine translation, cross-language <b>question-answering,</b> decreased adding, multiple documents...|$|R

40|$|Key Results: This is a {{proposal}} for a <b>question-answering</b> system with a dialogue interface and a user modelling component. The distinguishing feature of the system is that it provides an adaptive output based on a model of the questioner and the type of answer to be returned. How does the work advance the state-of-the-art?: We expose an approach to the interaction between questionanswering systems and dialogue systems, which has been scarcely investigated so far. Moreover, we propose a <b>question-answering</b> system which provides an adaptive output, via the integration of a user modelling component. Motivation (problems addressed) : Two problems are addressed: firstly, the output of current <b>question-answering</b> systems is usually independent of the questioner’s characteristics, goals and needs. Secondly, some questions can have multiple answers and/or answers more complex than a single sentence. Such answers should be delivered more effectively than by returning ranked lists of documents (as usually done by <b>question-answering</b> systems) ...|$|R
