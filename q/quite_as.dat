5|$|Greatest five-by-fives (most of each stat): Hakeem Olajuwon, on March 10, 1987, {{became the}} first in NBA history to record a five-by-six (at least 6 each of all five statistics: points, rebounds, assists, blocks, steals). It took nearly twenty years for the second {{official}} occurrence in NBA history. Andrei Kirilenko, on January 3, 2006, recorded a five-by-six against the Lakers. Though his numbers were not <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> impressive as Olajuwon's, Kirilenko performed the feat in regulation.|$|E
5|$|In a {{great many}} —indeed in most— localities there are wild horses to be found, which, {{although}} invariably of domestic descent, being either themselves runaways from some ranch or Indian outfit, or else claiming such for their sires and dams, yet are <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> wild as the antelope on whose domain they have intruded.|$|E

Root tubercles are present, but they are not <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|E

5|$|A Great Eruption event {{similar to}} Eta Carinae A's {{has only been}} {{observed}} in one other star in the Milky Way—P Cygni—and {{in a handful of}} other possible LBVs in external galaxies. None of them seem to be <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> violent as Eta Carinae's. It is unclear if this is something that only a very few of the most massive LBVs undergo, something that is caused by a close companion star, or a very brief but common phase for massive stars. Some similar events in external galaxies have been mistaken for supernovae and have been called supernova impostors, although this grouping may also include other types of non-terminal transients that approach the brightness of a supernova.|$|E
5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think {{what you want to}} watch as an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} field {{research}} on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E

5|$|Ripken {{was married}} to Violet ("Vi"), whom he met in high school. They had three sons, Cal Jr., Fred, and Billy; and a daughter, Ellen. They lived in a {{split-level}} house on Clover Street in Aberdeen, Maryland. Two of his sons went on {{to play in the}} major leagues. Cal Jr. most notably broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played and had over 3,000 hits in his Hall of Fame career. Billy, while not <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> successful as his brother, went on to play 12 years in the major leagues. Cal Sr. also had two older brothers, Oliver and Bill.|$|E
5|$|The American Chess Congress' final {{proposal}} {{was that the}} winner of a tournament {{to be held in}} New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being, but must be prepared to face a challenge from the second or third placed competitor within a month. Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so. The tournament was duly played, but the outcome was not <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws, and Weiss then wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank, conceding the title to Chigorin.|$|E

5|$|Their {{sense of}} smell, while {{much better than}} that of humans, is not <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> good {{as that of a}} dog. It is {{believed}} to {{play a key role in}} the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.|$|E
5|$|Harrison and Hancock {{counties}} {{were generally}} not affected <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> severely as communities {{closer to the}} Alabama border, but the entire area still suffered extensively. In sections of Gulfport, large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes. Debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires, allowing them to spread. Similar destruction was seen to the east at Biloxi, where the hurricane's winds tore the roofs off many buildings. Beachfront communities were {{in a state of}} disarray, with large trees uprooted, debris littering the ground, and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like U.S. 90. Damage to schools in Harrison County—particularly in Gulfport and Biloxi—was extensive. Most homes in the area survived the storm, which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event, with relatively little damage. Several buildings along the coast in the Biloxi area sustained severe damage, but many of the older houses near the Gulf of Mexico there fared remarkably well. Winds brought down large highway signs, in some cases striking nearby buildings. Along the coast, Elena caused beach erosion, damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities, and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports, several of which were closed pending Coast Guard inspection. Winds over inland Pearl River County damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes, and as in Alabama, the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farms.|$|E
5|$|Ran won several {{awards in}} Japan, {{but was not}} <b>quite</b> <b>as</b> honored there {{as many of the}} director's best films of the 1950s and 1960s had been. The film world was surprised, however, when Japan passed over the {{selection}} of Ran in favor of another film as its official entry to compete for an Oscar nomination in the Best Foreign Film category, which was ultimately rejected for competition at the 57th Academy Awards. Both the producer and Kurosawa himself attributed the failure to even submit Ran for competition to a misunderstanding: because of the Academy's arcane rules, no one was sure whether Ran qualified as a Japanese film, a French film (due to its financing), or both, so it was not submitted at all. In response to what at least appeared to be a blatant snub by his own countrymen, the director Sidney Lumet led a successful campaign to have Kurosawa receive an Oscar nomination for Best Directing that year (Sydney Pollack ultimately won the award for directing Out of Africa). Rans costume designer, Emi Wada, won the movie's only Oscar.|$|E
