40|$|Abstract Background False {{occurrences of}} {{functional}} motifs in protein sequences {{can be considered}} as random events due solely to the sequence composition of a proteome. Here we use a numerical approach to investigate the <b>random</b> <b>appearance</b> of functional motifs with the aim of addressing biological questions such as: How are organisms protected from undesirable occurrences of motifs otherwise selected for their functionality? Has the <b>random</b> <b>appearance</b> of functional motifs in protein sequences been affected during evolution? Results Here we analyse the occurrence of functional motifs in random sequences and compare it to that observed in biological proteomes; the behaviour of random motifs is also studied. Most motifs exhibit a number of false positives significantly similar to the number of times they appear in randomized proteomes (=expected number of false positives). Interestingly, about 3 % of the analysed motifs show a different kind of behaviour and appear in biological proteomes less than they do in random sequences. In some of these cases, a mechanism of evolutionary negative selection is apparent; this helps to prevent unwanted functionalities which could interfere with cellular mechanisms. Conclusion Our thorough statistical and biological analysis showed that there are several mechanisms and evolutionary constraints both of which affect the appearance of functional motifs in protein sequences. </p...|$|R

30|$|It {{is evident}} that records equivalency, in most datasets, {{increase}} in parallel with data growth [19]. Therefore, splitting data nominally may increase the data equivalency. Random data split ignores the distribution of equivalent records amongst tables. For instance, in Adult data, patient’s age, sex, and education attributes may appear similar in the first one thousand records, and then related records may appear again {{at the end of}} the table. Hence, the <b>random</b> <b>appearance</b> of similar records may reduce the number of equivalency on splitting data into small random chunks, which increases data masking.|$|R

50|$|Perlin {{noise is}} a {{procedural}} texture primitive, {{a type of}} gradient noise used by visual effects artists to increase the appearance of realism in computer graphics.

Synthetic textures using Perlin noise are often used in CGI to make computer-generated visual elements - such as object surfaces, fire, smoke, or clouds - appear more natural, by imitating the controlled <b>random</b> <b>appearance</b> of textures in nature.|$|R
5000|$|Out of the Blue has engendered debate amongst some viewers {{concerning}} its precise {{relationship to}} Happy Days.

Television observer and owner of Sitcoms Online, Todd Fuller, maintains that because [...] "Chachi Sells His Soul" [...] aired on September 18, 1979, <b>Random's</b> <b>appearance</b> on this Happy Days episode was a crossover.

This paper makes significant contributions to the empirical literature on the dynamics of firm growth, since it updates the work carried out by previous researchers in this field using micro panel data and GMM estimators.
