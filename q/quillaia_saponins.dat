50|$|Immune {{stimulating}} complexes (ISCOMs) are spherical open cage-like structures (typically 40 nm in diameter) {{that are}} spontaneously formed when mixing together cholesterol, phospholipids and <b>Quillaia</b> <b>saponins</b> under a specific stoichiometry. The complex displays immune stimulating properties {{and is thus}} mainly used as a vaccine adjuvant in order to induce a stronger immune response and longer protection.|$|E
50|$|ISCOM {{technology}} {{was invented in}} 1982 by Professor Bror Morein at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala. The key components of ISCOMs are the Quillaja saponins, which are derived from the bark of the Chilean soap-bark tree Quillaja saponaria Molina. Quillaja saponins are well known {{for their ability to}} activate the immune system. It is also known that saponins in general can have toxic side-effects, including the induction of haemolysis. However, when <b>Quillaia</b> <b>saponins,</b> cholesterol and phospholipids are mixed under the specific stoichiometry that forms ISCOMs, this haemolytic activity is practically eliminated, while the adjuvant activity is retained.|$|E
50|$|The {{inner bark}} of Quillaja saponaria {{can be reduced}} to powder and {{employed}} as a substitute for soap, since it forms a lather with water, owing to the presence of a glucoside saponin, sometimes distinguished as <b>quillaia</b> <b>saponin.</b> It also applied as an agricultural spray adjuvant. The same, or a closely similar substance, is found in soapwort (Saponaria officinalis), in senega root (Polygala senega) and in sarsaparilla; it appears to be chemically related to digitonin, which occurs in digitalis. The wood is used in cabinetry, and scents derived from the tree are used in perfumes and cosmetics.|$|R
