40|$|End {{users and}} service {{customers}} today want to perform <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation for multimedia services and distributed applications. In this undertaking, they need assistance and appropriate procedures and tools. Unfortunately, today's <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> frameworks and <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> management {{products on the}} market do not help. This thesis fills the gap. It argues {{that it is possible to}} find a common simple <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation procedure for end users and that a corresponding evaluation process can be automated. This thesis proposes a new <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation framework that is suited to end user interests and needs, that is application-oriented and networkindependent, that is open and extensible, and that has the potential to complement today's <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> frameworks. It encompasses: 1. A new 5 -step <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation procedure Its purpose is to identify those few quality characteristics that are decision-relevant and that have a major influence on service quality as perceived by an end user. In a first step, all quality characteristics are identified from related international standards or specifications ("identification"). Those that are essential and decision-relevant for end user perception are chosen next ("rating"). They have to be selected for evaluation ('selection') and quantified ("quantification") before simple, objective, and cost-effective evaluation methods can be used ("evaluation") in the last step. 2. A <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation architecture <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation has to be automated to be successful and to provide usable results. An appropriate architecture involving end users, evaluation meth-ods, and the applications and services under test is designed. The usage of intelligent agents is proposed to do automated <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation for applications and services. The architecture introduced includes single agent building blocks and communication and coordination models for <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation agents. 3. A <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation infrastructure A <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation infrastructure is needed to establish a trusted environment in which end users can do <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation. Its first design introduces certification authorities and agent registries as infrastructure prerequisites for standardized and authenticated <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation agents. This thesis is about <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> evaluation and it addresses <b>quality</b> issues <b>of</b> multimedia applications and distributed services. It fulfills end user requirements. It is based on the author's many years of experience in establishing and running value-added services in distributed environments for different customers...|$|R

The research aim of this thesis is {{the evaluation of the}} UML profile for <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> against the following criteria: expressiveness, reusability, understandability, applicability and tool support, as well as further comparison of the profile with other <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> specification languages. To perform that, several tasks and activities were conducted, such as a survey on different QoS specification languages, an examination of the UML profile for <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service,</b> the formulation <b>of</b> the evaluation criteria, and the appliance of the criteria in the evaluation and comparison processes. This study is performed from the perspective of readers and users of the profile that are not UML experts but have sufficient knowledge of UML in terms of software systems analysis and design. The context of the UML profile and <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> aspects include basic concepts of the UML 2. 0 and <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> which will be described along the thesis.

40|$|Shared roadways are a cost {{effective}} method for providing bicycle facilities {{in areas with}} limited right-of-way; shared roadways have automobiles and bicycles operating in the same traveled way. However, shared roadways may negatively affect traffic operations and there is limited guidance on appropriate shared roadways implementation. This thesis has three objectives: evaluate the impact of shared roadways on automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> compare automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> to bicycle <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on shared roadways, and provide guidance on the implementation of shared roadways. The author hypothesizes that shared roadways should only be implemented when automobile Level <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> (LOS), bicycle LOS, and facility safety are "acceptable. " The author accomplishes the objectives by generating data using microsimulation models. The author uses microsimulation model data to evaluate automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on shared roadways. In the evaluation <b>of</b> automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> the measures <b>of</b> effectiveness are automobile LOS threshold (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in automobile LOS) and automobile average travel speed (the average travel time divided by the segment length, a space mean speed). To compare automobile and bicycle <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> the author uses the bicycle LOS model in NCHRP Report 616 to generate bicycle LOS thresholds (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in bicycle LOS). After generating bicycle LOS thresholds, the author compares the bicycle LOS thresholds to the automobile LOS thresholds. Finally, the author uses {{the findings of the}} investigations to provide guidance on the implementation of shared roadways. In this thesis, the author finds automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on shared roadways decreases as automobile free-flow speed, automobile volume, and bicycle volume increase.

40|$|Many {{computations}} {{exhibit a}} trade off between execution time and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> A video encoder, for example, can often encode frames more quickly {{if it is}} given the freedom to produce slightly lower quality video. A developer attempting to optimize such computations must navigate a complex trade-off space to find optimizations that appropriately balance <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and performance. We present a new <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler {{that is designed to}} help developers identify promising optimization opportunities in such computations. In contrast to standard profilers, which simply identify time-consuming parts of the computation, a <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler is designed to identify subcomputations that can be replaced with new (and potentially less accurate) subcomputations that deliver significantly increased performance in return for acceptably small <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> losses. Our <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler uses loop perforation (which transforms loops to perform fewer iterations than the original loop) to obtain implementations that occupy different points in the performance/quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> trade-off space. The rationale is that optimizable computations often contain loops that perform extra iterations, and that removing iterations, then observing the resulting effect on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> is an effective way to identify such optimizable subcomputations. Our experimental results from applying our implemented <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> profiler to a challenging set of benchmark applications show that it can enable developers to identify promising optimization opportunities and deliver successful optimizations that substantially increase the performance with only small <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> losses...|$|R
