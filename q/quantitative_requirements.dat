50|$|<b>Quantitative</b> <b>Requirements</b> are {{specified}} using reliability parameters. The {{most common}} reliability parameter is the mean {{time to failure}} (MTTF), which can also be specified as the failure rate (this is expressed as a frequency or conditional probability density function (PDF)) or the number of failures during a given period. These parameters may be useful for higher system levels and systems that are operated frequently (i.e. vehicles, machinery, and electronic equipment). Reliability increases as the MTTF increases. The MTTF is usually specified in hours, but can also be used with other units of measurement, such as miles or cycles. Using MTTF values on lower system levels can be very misleading, especially if they do not specify the associated Failures Modes and Mechanisms (The F in MTTF).|$|E
50|$|There is a {{challenge}} regarding both Pillar I and Pillar II. Significant changes are underway {{with the introduction of}} Solvency II. Both for pillar I, <b>quantitative</b> <b>requirements,</b> and pillar II, internal control requirements, a real revolution is taking place at the European level and this will have considerable repercussions on the French market. Certain specialised French mutual insurance companies could find themselves facing an own funds requirement that is often five to ten times higher than the current requirement. The introduction and effective follow-up of a well-structured internal control system will pose problems for all small structures (in terms of cost and internal expertise). ROAM, which has been involved in this process since the project’s inception, defends its members position by contributing to the consultation process on an on-going basis and also by directly lobbying the European authorities.|$|E
50|$|Step {{changes in}} reactor coolant leakage can be {{detected}} with moving filter media to satisfy the <b>quantitative</b> <b>requirements</b> of USNRC Regulatory Guide 1.45. description for US Patent Number 5343046 (1994). The mathematical method is highly detailed and it focuses on time-dependent viewable collected activity, rather than concentration, as f(t). The method, among other features, yields the desired fixed-filter degenerate case (filter paper velocity = 0.) The method was first put into use in the 1990s at {{a nuclear power plant}} in the United States. Though originally derived for dominant Kr-88/Rb-88 in leaked reactor coolant, it has been expanded to include Xe-138/Cs-138 and can be modified by replication to include any N similar pairings. Further refinements to the mathematical methodology have been made by the inventor; these developments obviate the described patented collimator apparatus for making quantitative assessment of leak rate step change when rectangular collection grids are employed.|$|E

50|$|For any system, one of {{the first}} tasks of {{reliability}} engineering is to adequately specify the reliability and maintainability requirements allocated from the overall availability needs and, more importantly, derived from proper design failure analysis or preliminary prototype test results. Clear requirements (able to designed to) should constrain the designers from designing particular unreliable items / constructions / interfaces / systems. Setting only availability, reliability, testability, or maintainability targets (e.g., max. failure rates) is not appropriate. This is a broad misunderstanding about Reliability Requirements Engineering. Reliability requirements address the system itself, including test and assessment requirements, and associated tasks and documentation. Reliability requirements are included in the appropriate system or subsystem requirements specifications, test plans, and contract statements. Creation of proper lower-level requirements is critical.Provision of only quantitative minimum targets (e.g., MTBF values or failure rates) is not sufficient for different reasons. One reason is that a full validation (related to correctness and verifiability in time) of a quantitative reliability allocation (requirement spec) on lower levels for complex systems can (often) not be made as a consequence of (1) the fact that the requirements are probabilistic, (2) the extremely high level of uncertainties involved for showing compliance with all these probabilistic requirements, and because (3) reliability is a function of time, and accurate estimates of a (probabilistic) reliability number per item are available only very late in the project, sometimes even after many years of in-service use. Compare this problem with the continuous (re-)balancing of, for example, lower-level-system mass requirements in the development of an aircraft, which is already often a big undertaking. Notice that in this case masses do only differ in terms of only some %, are not a function of time, the data is non-probabilistic and available already in CAD models. In case of reliability, the levels of unreliability (failure rates) may change with factors of decades (multiples of 10) as result of very minor deviations in design, process, or anything else. The information is often not available without huge uncertainties within the development phase. This makes this allocation problem almost impossible to do in a useful, practical, valid manner that does not result in massive over- or under-specification. A pragmatic approach is therefore needed—for example: the use of general levels / classes of <b>quantitative</b> <b>requirements</b> depending only on severity of failure effects. Also, the validation of results is a far more subjective task than for any other type of requirement. (Quantitative) reliability parameters—in terms of MTBF—are by far the most uncertain design parameters in any design.|$|E
40|$|Combitech is an {{independent}} service company providing technical consultancy in system safety and the part commissioning this project. Dealing with system safety is often an issue of providing requirements {{in order to prevent}} the system from constituting danger. System safety also handles the issue of defining requirements to ensure that a pre-defined risk level is satisfied. The risk level is often set by legislative organs with the purpose to ensure that the system is safe enough. When the risk level is communicated in numbers i. e. <b>quantitative</b> <b>requirements,</b> a consequential issue is to provide a logic and consistent methodology.

This study involves a multiple case study, in which three domains have been taken into account; railway signaling industry, the air traffic management industry and the defense industry.

40|$|Abstract. Contractual {{motivation}} {{is needed to}} avoid costly project failures and improve the delivery of stakeholder value. Only if the supplier management is made to feel the pain of project failure will it strive to avoid it. The current culture of rewarding failure, by paying for systems development work regardless of the product delivered, must be altered. Such contractual motivation must be supported by <b>quantitative</b> <b>requirements</b> and evolutionary delivery. <b>Quantitative</b> <b>requirements</b> allow project progress and success to be measured enabling monitoring and testing for contractual compliance. Evolutionary delivery (that is, delivering early high value in small increments and using feedback from deliverables to determine future increments) allows early reporting of the ability of systems development to deliver and so enables any required corrective actions. Note: This paper specifically addresses the software problem, but the ideas most likely apply to the wider systems engineering problem to some interesting degree as well. 1...|$|E

30|$|When {{applying}} <b>quantitative</b> <b>requirements</b> for the 28 genes {{not associated}} with side effects, a few genes clearly stand out as favorable, depending on the pathogen. For blast disease only, the pi 21, PRm, and RBB 12 - 3 genes are amongst the best (disease reduction > 90 %). For bacterial blight disease only, OsDR 10 alone provides more than 95 % reduction of symptoms. For sheath blight only, the best gene so far {{seems to be the}} Dm-AMP 1 gene (Table  1). When applying qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>requirements</b> for the 28 genes without side effects, only a few genes providing resistance to several pathogens can be found. For combined blast and bacterial blight disease resistance, the OsSBP gene is the only one providing increased resistance, although the level of this resistance is rather low (50 %). Defensins (Dm-AMP 1 and Rs-AFP 2) seem to confer good levels of resistance to both blast and sheath blight. These seven genes are amongst the best genes so far for use in transgenic approaches.|$|E
