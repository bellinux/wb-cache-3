40|$|A postflight FORTRAN {{program called}} 'radar' reads and {{analyzes}} ground-based radar data. The output includes position, velocity, and acceleration parameters. Air data parameters are also provided if atmospheric characteristics are input. This program can read data from any radar in three formats. Geocentric Cartesian position {{can also be}} used as input, which may be from an inertial navigation or Global Positioning System. Options include spike removal, data filtering, and atmospheric refraction corrections. Atmospheric refraction can be corrected using the <b>quick</b> White <b>Sands</b> method or the gradient refraction method, which allows accurate analysis of very low elevation angle and long-range data. Refraction properties are extrapolated from surface conditions, or a measured profile may be input. Velocity is determined by differentiating position. Accelerations are determined by differentiating velocity. This paper describes the algorithms used, gives the operational details, and discusses the limitations and errors of the program. Appendices A through E contain the derivations for these algorithms. These derivations include an improvement in speed to the exact solution for geodetic altitude, an improved algorithm over earlier versions for determining scale height, a truncation algorithm for speeding up the gradient refraction method, and a refinement of the coefficients used in the White Sands method for Edwards AFB, California.

The new {{building}} wall material solid composite sandwich panel consists of panel and inserted layer material-steel wire nets of composite light bar, {{and it is}} called ALC (Autoclaved Lightweight Concrete) wallboard. The transportation, installation of ALC wallboard is required to meet certain strength requirement, and the wallboard can carry the aseismatic behavior and the bending capacity when it is laid into the wall. Therefore, {{in order to ensure}} the ALC wallboard can be better applied in practical engineering, the experimental research need to be done on the wallboard mechanical properties, such as impact resistance, hanging force, bending resistance, etc. ALC board is a kind of high performance light aerated concrete board [1] with high pressure steam curing, which is based on the raw materials-high quality fly ash (silica <b>sand),</b> <b>quick</b> lime and cement, and with antirust processing steel inside.

[...] He is followed on the program by a cameraman and a sound engineer. Directors oversee location filming and the final edit of each program. Season One directors included Dominic Stobart, Scott Tankard and Mark Westcott. Grylls said, [...] "I suppose to bear in mind that this is a worst-case scenario show, and therefore, of course things have to be planned. Otherwise, it would just be me in the wild and nothing happening, you know, 'cause textbook survival says you land, you get yourself comfortable, you wait for rescue, you don't do anything.

40|$|Piles {{are long}} slender columns {{installed}} {{deep into the}} ground to support heavy structures such as oil platforms, bridges, and tall buildings where the ground is {{not strong enough to}} support the structure on its own. In seismic prone zones, in the areas of soft soils (loose to medium dense soil which liquefies like a <b>quick</b> <b>sand)</b> piles are routinely used to support structures (buildings / bridges). The pile and the building vibrate, and often collapse, in liquefiable soils during major earthquakes. In this paper an experimental and analytical approach is taken to characterize this vibration. The emphasis has been given to the dynamic instability of piled foundations in liquefied soil. The first natural frequency of a piled-structure vibrating in liquefiable soil is obtained from centrifuge tests. The experimental system is modelled using a fixed-free Euler-Bernoulli beam resting against an elastic support with axial load and tip mass with rotary inertia. Natural frequencies obtained from the analytical method are compared with experimental results. It was observed that the effective natural frequency of the system can reduce significantly during an earthquake. Total number of pages in the manuscript: 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} the present study is {{concerned}} with the university candidates’ educational and career choices against an unstable economic background that may necessitate the reformulation and readjustment of choices to innovative concepts of advancement and future development as they may apply to youngsters of different social class and gender. The sudden call to precipitated maturity is a shock, as eighteen- year olds are now expected to sit for exams and simultaneously opt for an education- conduit to vocational security. More specifically, a case study concentrating on two different geographical areas: the Northern suburbs and western Attica was designed, taking into consideration the class-related socio-economic and political traits of their population. It is also estimated the extent to which educational choices are determined by gender. Close and open- end questions are utilized to unravel the societal considerations and selection tactics of the subjects, which is semantically revealed to lead to gingerly realistic steps on the <b>quick</b> <b>sand</b> of political and economic instability. There was also considerable profit from a multitude of interpretative versions and research bibliographies, so as to uncover the role that gender and class-related inequality plays in shaping and directing educational and vocational choices. The crux of our problematic is centered in a liquid status quo with individuals making judgments according to the social and educational capital established in the class and gender-related correlations within the collectivity. The research proceeds to expose vast vistas of continually re-definable prospects, renewable explorative models and a systemic complexity that regenerate youngsters' choices. It is noteworthy that information has for the first time become available on education being tied to vocation, not only against the backdrop of an economic and value crisis but also the end decade- long governmental providence. </p...|$|E
40|$|Higher Education {{is being}} {{challenged}} to change and grow like never before {{in response to a}} new cohort of connected, self-motivated, well-informed and savvy generation of students. The drive to develop new and innovative methods for teaching online and distance education students is accompanied by a roller coaster ride through uncharted loops and tunnels. This poster presents a graphical account of the frustrations, challenges and small successes experienced at various points in the road during {{the development and implementation of}} an innovative solution for enhancing the educational experiences of incarcerated students. Incarcerated offenders face a number of additional challenges to those faced by most other students studying at a distance. Lack of internet access is especially problematic for those studying in a sector that is increasingly characterised by online course offerings. In July 2011 the authors formally embarked on a project to develop a solution for some of the barriers to participation in HE experienced by incarcerated students. The project involved collaboration between a number of departments within the university and with external stakeholders including Queensland Correctional Services. The original aim of the project was to develop a version of Moodle, called Stand-Alone Moodle or SAM that would function on a network of computers used from education inside the prison that were independent of the internet and separated from the main prison computer network. The version of Moodle would provide the students with the same learning experience and study desk functionality that was available to other students. The use of SAM in would also be supported by the use of eBook readers. The inclusion of eBook readers was aimed at enable students to access more course and reference materials than presently available to them as well as alleviate the need to print learning materials in future. The project was to be deployed in project will be deployed in Semester 1 2012 with a maximum cohort of fifteen incarcerated students enrolled in course TPP 7120 Studying to Succeed as part of the Tertiary Preparation Program at the Southern Queensland Correctional Centre near Gatton. It was early on in the project approval application procedure that the authors began to worry that they had bitten off more than they could chew. The first requirement faced was that the e-Readers to be used for the project were not allowed to have any internet access such as Wi-Fi or 3 G capability, no SD card slot and no external battery. We eventually found 17 models of the very unpopular discontinued Sony SD- 350. One reviewer on the website commented, who would ever want an e-reader without internet access or SD card slots. Well, we do! The poster offers a glimpse at these retrospectively amusing project bumps and discuss ways in which future innovation pioneers may be able to overcome some of the <b>quick</b> <b>sand</b> pits along the way. ...|$|E
