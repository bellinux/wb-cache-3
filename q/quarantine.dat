5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law, a set of regulations promulgated by NASA on July 16 to codify its <b>quarantine</b> protocol, the astronauts continued in <b>quarantine</b> out of concern that the Moon might contain undiscovered pathogens and that the astronauts might {{have been exposed to}} them during their Moon walks. However, after three weeks in confinement (first in the Apollo spacecraft, then in their trailer on the Hornet, and finally in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center), the astronauts were given a clean bill of health. On August 10, 1969, the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination met in Atlanta and lifted the <b>quarantine</b> on the astronauts, on those who had joined them in <b>quarantine</b> (NASA physician William Carpentier and MQF project engineer John Hirasaki), and on Columbia itself. Loose equipment from the spacecraft would remain in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of <b>quarantine</b> was increased to forty days in May 1664 as the continental plague worsened, and the areas subject to <b>quarantine</b> {{changed with the}} news of the spread of plague to include all of Holland, Zeeland and Friesland (all regions of the Dutch Republic), although restrictions on Hamburg were removed in November. <b>Quarantine</b> measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic were put in place in 29 other ports from May, commencing with Great Yarmouth. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it {{had been one of the}} last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their <b>quarantine</b> were also subjected to 40 days <b>quarantine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Drawn by the city's prosperous economy, the Blackburns {{relocated}} to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1847. Luke Blackburn quickly became {{an active member}} of the community, helping found a temperance society, joining a militia group, and becoming the administrator of a local hospital. He became a close associate of Jefferson Davis and William Johnson. In 1848, Blackburn served as the city's health officer and implemented the first successful <b>quarantine</b> against a yellow fever outbreak in the Mississippi River valley. Using his own personal funds, he established a hospital for boatmen who navigated the Mississippi River. He also successfully lobbied the Congress to establish a hospital in Natchez; upon its completion in 1852, he was appointed surgeon there. In 1854, he implemented another successful <b>quarantine</b> against yellow fever. The Mississippi Legislature commissioned Blackburn to lobby the Louisiana State Legislature to establish a <b>quarantine</b> at New Orleans to protect cities along the Mississippi River; Louisiana authorized him to organize such a system.|$|E

5|$|In September 2013, an {{outbreak}} of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts into cannibalistic monsters known as infected. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and daughter Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms. In the twenty years that follow, most of civilization is destroyed by the infection. Survivors live in heavily policed <b>quarantine</b> zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess (Annie Wersching) in the <b>quarantine</b> zone in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the <b>quarantine</b> zone authorities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The ShadowNet {{infrastructure}} for insider cyber attack pre-vention {{is comprised of}} a tiered server system that is able to dynami-cally redirect dangerous/suspicious network traffic away from production servers that provide web, ftp, database and other vital services to cloned virtual machines in a <b>quarantined</b> environment. This is done transpar-ently {{from the point of}} view of both the attacker and normal users. Existing connections, such as SSH sessions, are not interrupted. Any malicious activity performed by the attacker on a <b>quarantined</b> server is not reflected on the production server. The attacker is provided ser-vices from the <b>quarantined</b> server, which creates the impression that the attacks performed are successful. The activities of the attacker on the <b>quarantined</b> system are able to be recorded much like a honeypot system for forensic analysis. ...|$|R

5|$|Several {{times in}} 1912, amidst an {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in the Caribbean, Havana operated in violation of Cuban and U.S. <b>quarantine</b> rules. In July 1912, the liner prepared to depart Cuba without an inspection and fumigation, but faced the prospect of seven days <b>quarantine</b> in Havana before the ship {{would be allowed to}} depart. However, a compromise was worked out by the United States Marine Hospital Service which allowed Havana to depart after a one-day delay. In September of the same year, another inspection gaffe resulted in government prosecution of the Ward Line.|$|E

When Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip after occupying it in the 1956 Suez Crisis, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser had al-Shifa hospital expanded and improved. He also ordered {{the establishment of a}} second hospital in the Nasser District with the same name.
