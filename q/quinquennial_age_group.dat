40|$|Proposed in {{this paper}} is a {{technique}} for estimating, from coarsly grouped empirical death data, the age-specific numbers of deaths for the elderly population. This question is primarily of interest in countries where the empirical data are available only in a grouped form, given usually in <b>quinquennial</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> and in a large open-ended interval for the ages 85 and over. The main reason that the official data are given in such a form in some countries of Southern Europe and in the Third World is the existence of heaping in the empirical data, i. e. misstatements in age recording, usually rounding to the nearest integer divisible with five. Our evaluation of the method on Swedish mortality data shows that the technique proposed can be efficiently applied to period mortality data. Heaping, expansion techniques,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} mortality {{in a sample of}} 441 adults aged 55 to 85 at baseline, who were observed for eight years. Subjects living in London, Ontario, Canada, were recruited in 1987 using an approach designed to include at least 35 individuals in each of the six <b>quinquennial</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> from 55 to 85, with roughly equal numbers of males and females. Considerable information was collected on each subject. Demographic and lifestyle data were obtained using a questionnaire, and a variety of physical measurements were taken in a laboratory. We use the well-known proportional hazards model {{to assess the impact of}} these variables on mortality and to quantify mortality rates as a function of age and sex. The variability of the latter results is examined using simulation. Since the sample size is very small by actuarial standards, we are careful about the quantitative conclusions that are made. 1...|$|R
40|$|The sickness-absence {{experience}} of women bus conductors employed by London Transport on their central (red) buses is analysed {{for the years}} 1953 to 1957 inclusive. The {{experience of}} single and married women is given separately, and only absences lasting four days or more (all of which are supported by medical certificate) are included. Results are given in <b>quinquennial</b> <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> for each of 20 broad diagnostic groups and comment is made on each group, emphasis being placed on the comparative experiences of single and married women. Both the numbers of spells of absence and the numbers of days of absence are considered. It is found generally that married women conductors have considerably more sickness absence than single women conductors of the same age: this applies both to spells and days of absence. Analysis of the difference by diagnostic group {{suggests that there is}} a propensity, of social origin, for married women to have more absences...|$|R

Finally, the <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of 65-84 has 158 cases which accounts for 4.25% of all cases of congenital hip dislocation. The epidemiology also shows that females are more prevalent to get congenital hip dislocation compared to their male counterparts. Females had 2,571 cases which is 69.15% of all cases while for men there are 1,136 cases which makes up 30.56% of all cases of congenital hip dislocation.

MethodsFrom the databases at two educational hospitals during the period from January 1978 and December 2007, medical records of lung cancer patients were retrospectively reviewed. The patient population was divided into three age groups: less than 70 years (the < 70 <b>age</b> <b>group),</b> 70 – 79 years (the 70 – 79 <b>age</b> <b>group),</b> and 80 years or older (the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group).</b> Time trends were also studied in two-time intervals: first study period up to 1997, which represents past practice standards, the second study period up to 2007, which represents contemporary practice. ResultsPatients aged 80 years and older comprised 7. 5 % of 2775 consecutive patients with lung cancer, and there was a rapid increase in the proportion of patients aged 80 years or older from the earlier to the later time period. The ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> had higher proportion of poor performance status (PS) and comorbid disease than the < 70 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> and the 70 – 79 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Unchanged proportion of patients with poor PS and advanced disease at presentation were observed in the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> The ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> was less likely to be subjected to surgery or chemotherapy, and had inferior outcomes when compared with the 70 – 79 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> and the < 70 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Survival improvement was not observed in the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> Multivariate analysis showed good PS, early clinical stage and surgery were favorable prognostic factors in the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group.</b> ConclusionIn order to improve the outcome, detection of early stage lung cancer in patients with good PS and thorough pretreatment evaluation for appropriate treatment are indeed essential even for the ≥ 80 <b>age</b> <b>group</b> of patients...|$|R

Women were slower than men in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 25 – 29 to 80 – 84  years, but not in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 85 – 89 to 95 – 99  years over all distances. In 50  m and 100  m, the sex difference decreased in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 40 – 44 (p =  0.007 and p =  0.005), 45 – 49 (p =  0.017 and p =  0.034), 50 – 54 (p =  0.002 and p =  0.040), to 55 – 59  years (p =  0.002 and p =  0.004). In 200  m, the sex difference decreased in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 40 – 44 (p =  0.044) and 90 – 94 (p =  0.011), but increased in <b>age</b> <b>group</b> 25 – 29  years (p =  0.006). In summary, in <b>age</b> <b>group</b> backstroke swimmers, (1) participation increased or remained unchanged (except women in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 55 – 59 and 60 – 64  years in 50  m), (2) swimming performance improved in all <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> from 25 – 29 to 95 – 99  years over all distances, (3) men were faster than women in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 25 – 29 to 80 – 84  years (except <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 85 – 89 to 95 – 99  years) over time and all distances.|$|R

30|$|Another {{explanation}} {{could be}} methodical aspect that the annual top ten athletes for each <b>age</b> <b>group</b> were analysed. Regarding the 100 km races, ten and more men {{were already in}} 1971 considered for nearly all <b>age</b> <b>groups.</b> For women in 100 km races, however, {{for the first time}} at least ten women finished in 1982 in <b>age</b> <b>group</b> 40 – 44 years. It becomes even more obvious for 100 miles races where in 1983 {{for the first time at}} least ten women finished in any <b>age</b> <b>group</b> (35 – 39 years) and in 1979 where at least ten men finished in <b>age</b> <b>groups</b> 25 – 29 to 45 – 49 years. The later appearance of ten and more <b>age</b> <b>group</b> finishers in 100 miles ultra-marathons might explain that more <b>age</b> <b>group</b> athletes showed a linear increase in running speed in 100 miles. The inclusion of a fixed number such as the annual top twenty (Lepers and Cattagni 2012) or annual top fifty (Jokl et al. 2004) for each <b>age</b> <b>group</b> in marathoners or the annual top ten for each <b>age</b> <b>group</b> in ultra-marathoners (Knechtle et al. 2012 b) might lead to a selection bias. An analysis with the inclusion of all recorded finishers for each <b>age</b> <b>group</b> might omit a potential selection bias and may lead to different results.|$|R
