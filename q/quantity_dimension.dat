40|$|Quantity {{skills have}} been {{extensively}} studied {{in terms of}} their development and pathological decline. Recently, numerosity discrimination (i. e., how many items are in a set) {{has been shown to be}} resilient to healthy ageing despite relying on inhibitory skills, but whether processing continuous quantities such as time and space is equally well-maintained in ageing participants is not known. Life-long exposure to quantity-related problems may progressively refine proficiency in quantity tasks, or alternatively quantity skills may decline with age. In addition, is not known whether the tight relationship between <b>quantity</b> <b>dimensions</b> typically shown in their interactions is preserved in ageing. To address these questions, two experimental paradigms were used in 38 younger and 32 older healthy adults who showed typical age-related decline in attention, executive function and memory tasks. In both groups we first assessed time and space discrimination independently using a two-choice task (i. e., “Which of two horizontal lines is longer in duration or extension?”), and found that time and space processing were equally accurate in younger and older participants. In a second paradigm, we assessed the relation between different <b>quantity</b> <b>dimensions</b> which were presented as a dynamic pattern of dots independently changing in duration, spatial extension and numerosity. Younger and older participants again showed a similar profile of interaction between number, cumulative area and duration, although older adults showed a greater sensitivity to task-irrelevant information than younger adults in the cumulative area task but lower sensitivity in the duration task. Continuous quantity processing seems therefore resilient to ageing similar to numerosity and to other non-quantity skills like vocabulary or implicit memory; however, ageing might differentially affect different <b>quantity</b> <b>dimensions...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{data from}} {{national}} household expenditure surveys to explore whether food insecurity is more severe in South Asia or Sub-Saharan Africa. It employs two {{indicators of the}} diet <b>quantity</b> <b>dimension</b> of food insecurity, or the inability to access sufficient food: the prevalence of food energy deficiency and the prevalence of severe food energy deficiency. It also employs two indicators of the diet quality dimension, indicating {{lack of access to}} nutritious food: the prevalence of low diet diversity and the percent of energy from staple foods. It finds the regions' food energy deficiency prevalences to be quite close (51 percent in South Asia, 57 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa). However, the prevalence of severe food energy deficiency, which is more life threatening, is higher in Sub-Saharan Africa (51 percent versus 35 percent in South Asia). From a diet quality standpoint, the regions appear to suffer from a comparable and high reliance on staple foods in the diet to the neglect of foods rich in protein and micronutrients, but that Sub-Saharan Africa may be doing worse, as reflected in less diverse diets. The results confirm that both regions suffer from deep food insecurity problems but point to Sub-Saharan Africa as the region with the more severe problem, {{particularly when it comes to}} the diet <b>quantity</b> <b>dimension</b> of food insecurity. In deciding which region should be given greater emphasis in the international allocation of scarce development resources, the fact that the numbers of people affected by food insecurity are higher in South Asia should be taken into consideration.

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} fundamental liquidity {{measures and}} investigates the pricing implications of shared variation {{in a large}} set of high frequency liquidity measures. Through a common factor analysis we estimate three orthogonal liquidity variables that statistically capture time series variation in market wide liquidity. We uncover three main results. First, we document that {{not one but two}} of the common liquidity factors are significantly related to cross-sectional differences in returns. Interestingly, the two factors are related to the time and <b>quantity</b> <b>dimension</b> of liquidity, not the price dimension. Second, and perhaps more striking, we discover substantial heterogeneity in the liquidity factors. In particular, order-based liquidity measures cannot explain return differences while trade-based liquidity measures can explain returns. This heterogeneity is borne out by asset pricing tests, which indicate substantial differences in the pricing of trade and order-based portfolios. Third, there is strong evidence of parameter instability in the pricing of liquidity...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model of the {{investment}} behavior of a firm that faces a stochastic, downward-sloping demand curve. The firm's challenge is to determine the optimal scale and time of an investment, so there is a potential for market power in the sense of markup pricing along two dimensions: static market power along a <b>quantity</b> <b>dimension,</b> and dynamic market power along a time dimension. Depending on the specific assumptions, either dimension will be more or less relevant. For example, the option to wait may be useless if the uncertainty of demand is low and the demand curve is not very elastic. Then the decision of the firm simplifies to that of a standard monopoly model. In other cases, the option to wait prevails. Typically, the latter happens when there is much uncertainty and the demand curve is fairly elastic. The formal model is illustrated by decisions in the real estate industry...|$|E

They are composed of super hard CBN abrasives and a softer binder. CBN abrasives {{are one of the}} hardest materials. They are embedded in the binder which can be metallic, polymeric or ceramic. The binder supports the abrasives and offers suitable toughness. The two components are consolidated by sintering processes under high pressure and temperature. Hence, abrasive particles exhibit an irregular spatial distribution in terms of size, location and orientation. In this work, X-ray computed tomography (CT scan) is used to investigate the geometrical properties of CBN abrasives in the volume regarding <b>quantity,</b> <b>dimension</b> and shape.
