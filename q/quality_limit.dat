[...] In a quality control procedure, a process {{is said to be}} at an acceptable quality level if the appropriate statistic used to construct a control chart does not fall outside the bounds of the acceptable quality limits.

40|$|Water is an {{important}} resource that is degraded in many rivers, including some in New Zealand. The environmental improvements resulting from regulation to improve water quality are frequently not monitored, the effectiveness of water quality policies is typically unknown and there are often no clear measures of success built in to policy development. Two studies were selected to examine these issues in relation to regional planning in the Manawatu-Wanganui region of New Zealand. In the first study, two successive plans that used numerical limits to improve water quality were assessed. The successes and failures of the first planning approach were examined and compared with more recent use of limits in the regional plan. Seven steps to developing robust water <b>quality</b> <b>limits</b> were recommended. In the second study, the monitoring {{of the effectiveness of}} freshwater policy was considered and a regional approach to plan development which combined science and policy presented. The approach was built on a catchment-based geographic framework of water management zones, water body values and water <b>quality</b> <b>limits.</b> To measure policy success a ranked matrix method was recommended that combined plan objectives and water <b>quality</b> <b>limits.</b> Integrated and collaborative approaches to policy development, setting of water <b>quality</b> <b>limits</b> and policy effectiveness monitoring were key recommendations from both studies and will be increasingly relevant to future water resource management in New Zealand...|$|R

The aim {{of this article is}} to develop procedures for minimum variance ChSP- 4 (c 1, c 2) sampling plans and their determination. In addition to minimum variance sampling plans, a procedure is developed for designing plans with a designated maximum variance, a VOQL (Variance of Outgoing <b>Quality</b> <b>Limit)</b> plan. The VOQL concept is analogous to the AOQL (Average Outgoing <b>Quality</b> <b>Limit)</b> except in the VOQL plan, it is the maximum variance which is established instead of the usual maximum AOQ...|$|E

40|$|The State of Oregon has {{established}} water quality standards {{for meeting the}} goals and requirements of the United States Clean Water Act. The normal model for standards is followed in Oregon where the standard is composed of designated beneficial uses and water quality criteria or action levels which are set to maintain these beneficial uses. Section 303 of the Clean Water Act requires that water bodies that fail to meet water quality, usually through non attainment of beneficial uses and measured through chronic violation of water quality criteria such as temperature, chlorophyll a (as an indicator for excessive algae growth) and dissolved oxygen, be identified as "water <b>quality</b> <b>limited.</b> " When this water <b>quality</b> <b>limited</b> designation is {{in place for a}} water body, the state must establish a total maximum daily load (TMDL). The Columbia Slough in Portland, Oregon, has been designated as water <b>quality</b> <b>limited.</b> The Columbia Slough is an urban water body (see Figure 21. 1) that is significant to the metropolitan Portland community, because of large undevel-oped reaches and potential as a valuable fish and wildlife habitat within an urbanized area.

40|$|Cleanup of {{contaminated}} soils {{to comply with}} soil <b>quality</b> <b>limits</b> currently receives much interest. In-situ remediation {{of contaminated}} soils relies {{on the ability of}} the techniques employed to enhance the rate of release of contaminants from the soil-sorbed and nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) phases into the aqueous or gaseous phases from which they can be more readily removed and treated. Contaminant concentrations in these “environmentally mobile” forms usually decline over time so that the economic efficiency and the overall success of remediation technologies are subject to the “law of diminishing returns”. In this paper we consider the “state of the art” in our understanding of NAPL dissolution and transport, desorption of soilsorbed contaminants and fluid flow in porous media. The extent to which these processes may constrain the success of bioremediation, pump-and-treat remediation and soil venting in relation to established soil <b>quality</b> <b>limits</b> is addressed. Finally, we suggest directions for future research and comment on legislative considerations...|$|R
