On the other hand, they can be characterized {{in terms of the}} group of projectivities with respect to a spread. We explore some properties of these generalized <b>quadrangles.</b> All these results {{can be applied to the}} theory of the glued near hexagons, a class of near hexagons introduced by the author in De Bruyn (1998) On near hexagons and spreads of generalized <b>quadrangles,</b> preprint...|$|R

5|$|After Harrison's {{preliminary}} studies, {{it became}} clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end of the main site, aligned east to west, with a tower at the west end; the upper <b>quadrangle,</b> to the immediate west of the hall and aligned north to south, would have the Warden's Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end; steps would lead down from the upper <b>quadrangle</b> into the lower <b>quadrangle,</b> again aligned east to west, with the main entrance at the far east end of the lower <b>quadrangle.</b> The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street. The sub-committee recommended that Harrison's plans be adopted in January 1939, and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 – he had been abroad for much of the intervening period.|$|E

5|$|Jesus College (in full: Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth's Foundation) {{is one of}} {{the colleges}} of the University of Oxford in England.

A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price (or Ap Rhys), a churchman from Brecon in Wales. The oldest buildings, in the first <b>quadrangle,</b> date from the 16th and early 17th centuries; a second <b>quadrangle</b> was added between about 1640 and about 1713, and a third <b>quadrangle</b> was built in about 1906.
