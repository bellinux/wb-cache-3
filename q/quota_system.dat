These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.|$|E

5|$|A commandery {{consisted}} {{of a group of}} counties, and was headed by an Administrator. He was the top civil and military leader of the commandery and handled defense, lawsuits, seasonal instructions to farmers and recommendations of nominees for office sent annually to the capital in a <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> first established by Emperor Wu. The head of a large county of about 10,000 households was called a Prefect, while the heads of smaller counties were called Chiefs, and both could be referred to as Magistrates. A Magistrate maintained law and order in his county, registered the populace for taxation, mobilized commoners for annual corvée duties, repaired schools and supervised public works.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a ballot initiative {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected it. Some news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E
5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character. In 1948, the Thye-Blatnik Bill authorized {{the government to}} purchase the few remaining privately owned homes and resorts within the area. In 1949, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 10092 which prohibited aircraft from flying over the area below 4,000 feet. The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are today, with limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E

5|$|Kennedy {{returned}} to the Senate in January 1965, walking with a cane. He employed a stronger and more effective legislative staff. He took on President Lyndon B. Johnson and almost succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to explicitly ban the poll tax {{at the state and}} local level (rather than just directing the Attorney General to challenge its constitutionality there), thereby gaining a reputation for legislative skill. He was a leader in pushing through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which ended a <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> based upon national origin and which, despite Kennedy's predictions, would have a profound effect on the demographic makeup of the United States. He played a role in creation of the National Teachers Corps.|$|E
5|$|Khan's {{selection}} {{as a candidate}} was {{seen as part of}} a wider move towards the left in Labour that emerged during the 2015 leadership election that followed Miliband's resignation. Key policies that Khan proposed included a London 'living rent'; a <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> for ethnic minority officers in the Metropolitan Police; increased home building; and a campaign for a London Living Wage. Commentators raised Khan's Muslim religion as a potential barrier to election, after a poll (not mentioning Khan by name) suggested that 31% of Londoners would be 'uncomfortable' with a Muslim mayor. Khan, who was London's first Muslim MP, argued that the election of a Muslim could encourage London to become recognised as a more cosmopolitan city. While Khan had stated that he would serve a full term as MP for Tooting if he were to become Mayor of London, he later announced that would stand down as MP for Tooting if he were elected Mayor.|$|E
5|$|The three {{language}} formula was {{not strictly}} enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. The only real concession {{to the south}} was the assurance that the Official Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort {{to follow through with}} that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, A. K. Sen, Satyanarayan Sinha, Mahavir Tyagi, M. C. Chagla and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on 25 August. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir crisis at that time.|$|E

25|$|The IITs had {{initially}} a <b>quota</b> <b>system,</b> but the <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> was scrapped and the modified scheme described below {{was introduced in}} 1983. This procedure was evolved based {{on the experience of}} implementing a <b>quota</b> <b>system</b> for ten years (1973–1983). The logic cited for this procedure is that IITs being Institutes of National Importance, there should not be any compromise on the quality of students studying in them; accordingly, students admitted through the reserved quota have no relaxation in requirements for passing courses or getting the degree. They are, however, allowed to complete the program at a slower pace (take longer to get the degree).|$|E

40|$|Within {{the last}} 20 years, {{the problem of}} women’s {{participation}} in formal power positions has been mobilising women, especially feminists, throughout Latin America. After over half a century since gaining the right to vote, Latin-American women have recognised that, in practice, this fought for right did not guarantee {{the right to be}} elected as well. Indeed, Latin American women have remained marginalised from power, kept from participating in greater numbers in deliberative power structures. In these circumstances, the implementation of <b>quota</b> <b>systems</b> for women in a context of affirmative action policies has figured as a major goal in the mobilisation of women in their struggle for access to power structures. In some countries, thanks to the implementation of <b>quota</b> <b>systems</b> such as in Costa Rica and Argentina, women have been able to effect changes in the balance of power, reaching significant levels of participation in legislative bodies. However, in the great majority of Latin American countries that adopted <b>quota</b> <b>systems,</b> major changes have yet to come through. This is true even in the case of Brazil, despite the presence of a strong and well articulated women’s movement. The objective of this paper, which was presented to presented to the 'Pathways: What are we Learning?' Analysis Conference held in Cairo, 20 - 24 January 2009, is to analyse these different Latin American experiences with <b>quota</b> <b>systems,</b> identifying the factors that have contributed to their success or failure, the implications for women’s actual access to formal power, as well as the role of women and feminist movements in articulating these demands.
