40|$|Erosion related {{maintenance}} {{activities of the}} Infrastructure Services Group (ISG) of Queensland Rail (QR) within Central Queensland coal railway network have an annual budget tag of about $ 0. 5 M Research into erosion control strategies (HEFRAIL Project) has been centred on <b>quick</b> <b>grass</b> establishment {{with the aid of}} cost effective drip irrigation system, limited use of erosion control blankets, and use of waste ballast as mulch. This paper presents a large scale field trial as set up at a site on the Goonyella-Riverside branch near Riverside Mine in 2001. Initial results after 18 months of implementation were very encouraging. In particular, it is demonstrated how a site could be treated progressively in sections in order to cut down irrigation costs. It is expected that the treatments imposed provide a long-term protection of the batters against erosion. Additional benefits of the treatments include provision of aesthetically pleasing bolters and minimisation of sediment delivery to nearby watercourses...|$|E

60|$|He {{had lived}} there {{long enough to see}} the dull monotony of one season lapse into the dull monotony of the other. The bleak {{northwest}} trade-winds had brought him mornings of staring sunlight and nights of fog and silence. The warmer southwest trades had brought him clouds, rain, and the transient glories of <b>quick</b> <b>grasses</b> and odorous beach blossoms. But summer or winter, wet or dry season, on one side rose always the sharply defined hills with their changeless background of evergreens; on the other side stretched always the illimitable ocean as sharply defined against the horizon, and as unchanging in its hue. The onset of spring and autumn tides, some changes among his feathered neighbors, the footprints of certain wild animals along the river's bank, and the hanging out of party-colored signals from the wooded hillside far inland, helped him to record the slow months. On summer afternoons, when the sun sank behind a bank of fog that, moving solemnly shoreward, at last encompassed him and blotted out sea and sky, his isolation was complete. The damp gray sea that flowed above and around and about him always seemed to shut out an intangible world beyond, and to be the only real presence. The booming of breakers scarce a dozen rods from his dwelling was but a vague and unintelligible sound, or the echo of something past forever. Every morning when the sun tore away the misty curtain he awoke, dazed and bewildered, as upon a new world. The first sense of oppression over, he came to love at last this subtle spirit of oblivion; and at night, when its cloudy wings were folded over his cabin, he would sit alone with a sense of security he had never felt before. On such occasions he was apt to leave his door open, and listen as for footsteps; for what might not come to him out of this vague, nebulous world beyond? Perhaps even SHE,--for this strange solitary was not insane nor visionary. He was never in spirit alone. For night and day, sleeping or waking, pacing the beach or crouching over his driftwood fire, a woman's face was always before him,--the face for whose sake and for cause of whom he sat there alone. He saw it in the morning sunlight; it was her white hands that were lifted from the crested breakers; it was the rustling of her skirt when the sea wind swept through the beach grasses; it was the loving whisper of her low voice when the long waves sank and died among the sedge and rushes. She was as omnipresent as sea and sky and level sand. Hence when the fog wiped them away, she seemed to draw closer to him in the darkness. On one or two more gracious nights in midsummer, when the influence of the fervid noonday sun was still felt on the heated sands, the warm breath of the fog touched his cheek {{as if it had been}} hers, and the tears started to his eyes.|$|R

Its control is done with some difficulty, being a monocot species (grass) and perennial. Studies of fruit diversity is considered important to describe cross-type both existing and for new ways of management. The average data obtained showed that the species formed finger-panicle of 6. 2 cm length, with each 5. 71 spike number and 57. 2 cm spike length. Spikelets were no. of 43 /spike, had length 1. 97 mm and width 0. 81 mm. Between the different characters of the panicle obtained in positive/negative correlations we used the comparison with theoretical significant levels. Significant related were between no. of spike/panicle with panicle length, r= 0. 437 **; between spikelet number/spike with spike width, r= 0. 492 ***; between spikelet dimensions (length and width), r= 0. 543 ***; between spike length with spikelet length r= 0. 261 ** and between spike length with spikelet width, r= 0. 305 **.

This paper presents the hydraulic modeling effort for the drip irrigation lateral network. Estimated hydraulic model parameters of commercially available pressure compensating laterals are given. A few examples of irrigation network bays based on the basic subunit of 3 laterals placed at the top section of the batters are presented. Simulation results have shown that for the fire-fighter petrol pump used on the HEFRAIL Project, a bay consisting of a maximum of 4 subunits can be run at the same time to ensure that the emitter pressures are within the pressure compensating range. For sites where more than 4 subunits are required, multiple bays are set up with controllers to schedule irrigation...|$|E

It is noticed that in the crop agrocoenosises {{there is a high}} infestation level caused by Japanese barnyard millet (Echinochloa crus-galli (L) Pal. Beauv), field sowthistle (Sonchus arvensis L), chickweed (Stellaria media (L) Vill), <b>quick</b> <b>grass</b> (Agropyron repens (L) Pal Beauv), matricary (Matricaria perforate Merat), creeping thistle (Circium arvense (L) scop), marsh woundwort (Stachus palustris L) wild buckwheat (Polygonum convolvulus L), bristle stem hemp nettle (Galeopsis tetrahit L), common horsetail (Equisetum arvense L), field forget-me-not (Myosotis arvensis (L) Hill), shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L) Med) etc. Due to non-observance of preventive and separate agrotechnical techniques especially in spring-summer period, such weeds as bedstraw (Galium aparine L), white campion (Melandrium album (Mill) Garcke), green amaranthus (Amaranthus retroflexus L) started to appear in the crops. To protect sugar beet effectively, two variants of herbicides application are proposed. The first one - a combined, one stipulating soil action herbicides application before planting or before sugar beet seedlings emergence and on seedlings - to carry out two treatment by post-emergence preparations. The second variant, a split post- -emergence herbicide application (two-three times spraying) on growing weeds at small application rates. In the next 5 - 6 years, a combined method will be of a primary importance in the conditions of the Republic...|$|E
40|$|Cover Crop: Sorghum {{is used as}} {{a drought}} tolerant, summer annual {{rotational}} cover crop either alone or seeded in a warm season cover crop mixture. There are multiple cultivars of sorghum available for use as a cover crop including sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids (Sorghum bicolor x Sorghum bicolor var. sudanense). However, all sorghum and Sudangrass-related species have the potential to smother weeds, suppress nematode species, and penetrate compacted subsoil (Clark, 2007). Sorghum cover crops can also be used as livestock forage in a cropping system (Magdoff and Van Es, 2009). Sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids can produce up to 4, 000 - 5, 000 pounds of dry matter per acre (Clark, 2007). Soil Compaction: Sorghums and sorghum-Sudangrass hybrids have extensive root systems that can penetrate up to 8 feet into the soil and extend more than 3 feet away from the stem (Shoemaker and Bransby, 2010). These aggressive root systems alleviate subsoil compaction. To encourage more significant root growth, sorghum stalks should be cut at least once during the growing season when they reach 3 – 4 feet tall (Clark, 2007). Weed Management: Sorghums are <b>quick</b> growing <b>grasses</b> that have the potential to shade out and/or smother weed populations when planted at a high density. In addition, root exudates of sorghum have been shown to reduce the growth of weeds such as velvet leaf, thorn apple, redroot pigweed, crabgrass, yellow foxtail and barnyardgrass (Stapleton et al., 2010). Sorghum is also recommended for control of nutsedge infestations (Clark, 2007). Flowering sorghum seed head and vegetation in Tucson, Arizona...|$|R
40|$|In 1943 a new {{ryegrass}} {{appeared on}} the New Zealand market, known first as H 1, but later as short rotation ryegrass. This new grass was a hybrid produced by the Grasslands Division, Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, and combined {{some of the more}} valuable features of its parents Italian and perennial ryegrass. Since that time the grass has been tried over a wide range of soils and climate with varying management and utilisation, so that the picture of its sphere of usefulness is now fairly clear. The characteristics of the grass as first produced are as follows :- The fertility and moisture requirements for optimum production are high, being intermediate between ItaIian and perennial ryegrass; a very <b>quick</b> establishing <b>grass,</b> producing a large flush of feed in the first season; one of the earliest spring grasses; non-productive in hot, dry weather and subject to severe mortality;a phenomenal power of regeneration from shed seed under conditions of high fertility; permanence variable, depending on fertility, moisture, and management; habit of growth upright and open, demanding rotational grazing; palatability excellent. In other words, this grass leans towards the Italian parent, but is capable of becoming more or less permanent on a wider range of soils. Since the first release subsequent selections have aimed at eliminating its lack of permanence. There is some evidence that this has been achieved in part with the nucleus seed of 1948. At Lincoln College great use has been made of this grass. Since 1943 eighteen fields have been sown in which short-rotation ryegrass was a dominant constituent of the mixture. One original pasture still remains, E. 8; now in its seventh year, it is still a good pasture & the present time 242 acres of our 542 acres of pasture contain short-rotation ryegrass as a dominant. We have made some use of it on the lighter land at Ashley Dene and we have results of observations at the Kirwee Experimental Farm. Over the last two seasons measurements of seasonal production have been made so that we have accumulated some evidence. But first a word of warning as to our experiences: we extended the use of short-rotation ryegrass during a cycle of rainfall of over 30 inches per year. We now appear to have entered a cycle of about 20 inches, so that our earlier experiences may be of limited value under conditions of lower rainfall...|$|R

Also the environment is degraded and sediments transported from sites {{have the potential to}} pollute the nearby water bodies downstream. This paper provides an overview of advances made in Queensland, Australia, to mitigate the erosion problems of railway formation batters. Our research effort has been focused on strategies to aid <b>quick</b> establishment of <b>grasses</b> on the batters. The strategies include defining the topsoil quality of the batters, modification of batter topsoils to provide a conducive growth medium for the grasses, and seed treatment including pre-germination to accelerate the germination process. Provision of a cheap mulch to protect grass seeds/ seedlings and ameliorants from washout by high intensity and short duration rainfall events is another strategy. Development of a cost-effective drip irrigation system that sources water from either an existing pressurised water main or a temporary excavated pond/ dam (with solar pump) to supplement the unpredictable natural rainfall ia a major strategy. It has been established that the target of 60 % grass cover reduces erosion by over 90 % compared with the bare scenario. The plot-scale verification work and experiences have already been successfully incorporated into large scale railway projects such as the 110 km Bauhinia Regional Railway Project spur line construction...|$|R
