40|$|The CD 4 {{count is}} the best {{surrogate}} marker for monitoring HIV. The reference method for assessing CD 4 counts (flow cytometry, FCM), as expensive technique, is not widely used in non-OECD countries. To make HIV-monitoring available to more patients in these countries, we modified a commercially available density-based negative selection assay (RosetteSepTM) to make it applicable for low-cost cell enumeration. For evaluation (Step 1), blood taken from 25 HIV patients and 29 healthy donors was assayed with the modified negative selection method (MNS) and compared with FCM. For validation (Step 2), this method was performed in blind <b>quintuplicates</b> on 12 HIV+ blood samples according to FDA guidelines. Association of MNS with the FCM is given by regression models for both steps: Step 1 : slope = 1. 091, intercept = - 46. 5. Step 2 : slope = 1. 074, intercept = - 38. 3 (Step 2). The imprecision of MNS assessed during Step 2 was 21. 2 % (intraserial) and 18. 8 % (interserial). The results suggest that MNS is capable of providing an approximate CD 4 count. At a cost of 0. 30, it is affordable to patients living in resource-restrained areas. The technique {{has the potential to}} deliver an accurate, precise, low-cost test to monitor HIV+ patient...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} obtaining reliable laboratory scale flotation test data for the Merensky ore type found in the Bushveld complex of South Africa. The complex nature of the platinum-group element (PGE) deportment in this ore renders the normally-practiced procedures inappropriate for this particular testwork. A more robust and thorough procedure is necessary because of the diverse mineralogical forms in which the PGE are found. The evaluation of the mass and value balances has accordingly to take these factors into account. The major features of the evaluation of input and output errors across the laboratory scale flotation test are analysed. It is found that unless size-by-size variance of PGE in a conventionally crushed mill feed is taken into account the mill feed sample size is underestimated by some 176 %. Further the preparation of a reference distribution of assayed head material is necessary to provide the 95 % confidence limits of grade estimate. The need for repeating flotation tests and compositing the adjudicated products is discussed, concluding that <b>quintuplicates</b> are suitable to achieve a desirable level {{of confidence in the}} built-up head grade. The sample preparation of the flotation products has a critical role in minimising evaluation errors, {{as is the case with}} fire assaying of samples where minimum numbers of replicate determinations have been calculated. An outlier rejection model for adjudication of the replicate built-up head grades is proposed, and a complete flowsheet of the quality control model is developed from first principles. The effect of this model on the PGE total balance is analysed. It is concluded that workable controls are defined, since a metal balance with < 1 % error has been achieved...|$|R

In one of these studies [12], a <b>quintuplicate</b> measurement was applied, and the authors recommended: “If system should be paused, at least reject the first measurement or wait until blood temperature has normalized.” In our study, we could also show that the variability for the CI and GEDVI of the triplicate measurements at paused RRT was higher than ongoing RRT. We calculated the mean differences {{between the first and}} the two other measurements, but did not find a meaningful difference between the first and consecutive measurements. Nevertheless, we also detected that the change from running to paused RRT influenced the variability of TPTD results, and therefore, time should be given allowing to reach a steady state before TPTD measurements after pausing/stopping the RRT.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the linkages between output growth and output volatility {{for the sample}} of G 7 countries over the period 1958 M 2 - 2011 M 7, thereby paying particular attention to spillovers within and between countries. Using the VAR-based spillover index approach by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012), we identify several empirical regularities: i) output growth and volatility are highly intertwined, with spillovers taking place into all four directions; ii) the importance of spillovers has increased after the mid 1980 s and reached unprecedented levels during the recent financial and economic crisis; iii) the US has been the largest transmitter of output and volatility shocks to other countries. Generalized impulse response analyses point to moderate growth-growth spillovers and sizable volatility-volatility spillovers across countries, suggesting that volatility shocks <b>quintuplicate</b> in the long run. The cross-variable effects turn out negative: volatility shocks lead to lower economic growth, growth shocks tend to reduce output volatility.

We postulated that CRMP- 2 levels affects the actions of LCM on VGSCs. CRMP- 2 labeling by LCM analogs was competitively displaced by excess LCM in rat brain lysates. Manipulation of CRMP- 2 levels in the neuronal model system CAD cells affected slow inactivation of VGSCs without any effects on other voltage-dependent properties. In silico docking was performed to identify putative binding sites in CRMP- 2 that may modulate the effects of LCM on VGSCs. These studies identified five cavities in CRMP- 2 that can accommodate LCM. CRMP- 2 alanine mutants of key residues within these cavities were functionally similar to wild-type CRMP- 2 as assessed by similar levels of enhancement in dendritic complexity of cortical neurons. Next, we {{examined the effects of}} expression of wild-type and mutant CRMP- 2 constructs on voltage-sensitive properties of VGSCs in CAD cells: 1) steady-state voltage-dependent activation and fast-inactivation properties were not affected by LCM, 2) CRMP- 2 single alanine mutants reduced the LCM-mediated effects on the ability of endogenous Na+ channels to transition to a slow inactivated state, and 3) a <b>quintuplicate</b> CRMP- 2 alanine mutant further decreased this slow inactivated fraction.

The percentage observed difference for the commercial calibrators was calculated from the observed mean against the given value of the calibrator: Bio-Rad (bias + 1. 4 % in both methods); Chromsystems (bias + 5. 4 % [first method] and + 5. 0 % [second method]); and RECIPE (bias − 8. 9 % [first method] and − 9. 8 % [second method]). Conclusions: Results demonstrate an overall discordance between the commercial calibrators that is greater than the assay uncertainty. It is observed that the greatest deviation of the three calibrators is traceable to a different standard reference material. This lack of harmonization means that results from different laboratories may not be comparable...|$|E

However, they are not validated by the manufacturers for this purpose. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the ability of the Bactec system (Becton-Dickinson, Le Pont-De-Claix, France) to detect the microorganisms that could contaminate cell therapy products. Three types of vials and conditions were tested: Plus Aerobic/F and Anaerobic/F media incubated at 35 °C and Mycosis IC/F medium incubated at 30 °C. All vials were incubated 10 days. We tested 18  microorganisms, including slow growers and some with fastidious nutritional requirements (10 bacteria, four yeasts, four filamentous fungi), each with four inocula (10 - 10 (4) colony-forming units) performed in <b>quintuplicate.</b> The combination of Plus Aerobic/F and Plus Anaerobic/F vials detected all the tested pathogenic bacteria, all the tested Gram-positive skin commensal or environmental bacteria, all the tested yeasts, and three of four tested filamentous fungi. The addition of the Mycosis IC/F vial extended the range of detected microorganisms to one fungal environmental contaminant. Two bacterial environmental contaminants were not detected by our method. Low inocula of the skin contaminant Propionibacterium acnes were detected only after 7 days of incubation. These data suggest that (i) the prolongation of the incubation time of Plus Aerobic/F and Plus Anaerobic/F vials from 7 to 10 days and (ii) the use of Mycosis IC/F medium make minor contributions in the sterility testing of cell therapy products. We have validated the Bactec method using aerobic and anaerobic vials incubated 7 days at 35 °C...|$|E
