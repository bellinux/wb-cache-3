6000|$|To common {{eyes the}} ground hereabouts has no {{peculiar}} military strength: a wavy champaign, with nothing of abrupt or high, {{much of it}} actual plain, excellent for cavalry and their work;--this latter, too, is an advantage, which Friedrich has well marked, and turns to use in his scheme. The area he takes in is perhaps some seven or eight miles long, by as many broad. On the west side runs the still-young Striegau Water, defensive more or less; and on the farther bank of it green little Hills, their steepest side stream-ward. Inexpugnable Schweidnitz, with its stores of every kind, especially with its store of cannon and of bread, {{is on the left}} or east part of the circuit; in the intervening space are peaceable farm-villages, spots of bog; knolls, some of them with wood. Not a village, bog, knoll, but Friedrich has caught up, and is busy profiting by. [...] "Swift, BURSCHE, dig ourselves in here, and be ready for any <b>quotity</b> and quantity of them, if they dare attack!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile such things, cheering as they are, tend {{little to}} cheer the {{national}} creditor, or indeed the creditor of any kind. In {{the midst of}} universal portentous doubt, what certainty can seem so certain as money in the purse, and the wisdom of keeping it there? Trading Speculation, Commerce of all kinds, has {{as far as possible}} come to a dead pause; and the hand of the industrious lies idle in his bosom. Frightful enough, when now the rigour of seasons has also done its part, and to scarcity of work is added scarcity of food! In the opening spring, there come rumours of forestalment, there come King's Edicts, Petitions of bakers against millers; and at length, in the month of April--troops of ragged Lackalls, and fierce cries of starvation! These are the thrice-famed Brigands: an actual existing <b>quotity</b> of persons: who, long reflected and reverberated through so many millions of heads, as in concave multiplying mirrors, become a whole Brigand World; and, like a kind of Supernatural Machinery wondrously move the Epos of the Revolution. The Brigands are here: the Brigands are there; the Brigands are coming! Not otherwise sounded the clang of Phoebus Apollos's silver bow, scattering pestilence and pale terror; for this clang too was of the imagination; preternatural; and it too walked in formless immeasurability, having made itself like to the Night (Greek.)! ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{exploitation}} of the sea yields in Guina is {{the bulk of the}} trade-export. The reshaping of this activity, implying mostly the frenchisation of the industrial shrimp fishing, led to deep changes in the export of sea produces either in the traded <b>quotities</b> or the diversification of both produces and custumers. La francisation des pêches industrielles de crevettes en Guyane a entraîné de profondes mutations des exportations des produits halieutiques, tant dans les volumes commercialisés que dans la diversification des produits ou de la clientèle...|$|R
60|$|What Friedrich Wilhelm {{did with}} such a mass of wild pork? Not an ounce of it was wasted, every ounce of it brought money in. For there exist Official Schedules, lists as for a window-tax or property-tax, drawn up by his Majesty's contrivance, in the chief Localities: every man, {{according}} to the house he keeps, is bound to take, at a just value by weight, such and such <b>quotities</b> of suddenly slaughtered wild swine, one or so many,--and consume them at his leisure, as ham or otherwise,--cash payable at a fixed term, and no abatement made. [Forster, Beneckendorf (if they had an Index I).] For this is a King that cannot stand waste at all; thrifty himself, and the Cause of thrift.|$|R
