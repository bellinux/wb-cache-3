40|$|In {{the wake}} of the M�bius {{spiralling}} of relativism and reflexivity, much of the theoretically inclined literature within human geography has turned to the motifs of difference and otherness as a possible basis for fostering a coining together and rapprochement of previously incommensurate theoretical-practices. Much of this effort has been undertaken in an explicit attempt to maintain political, moral, and ethical responsibility {{in the face of a}} dangerous slide into passive nihilism and indifference. In the first half of the paper I argue that the attempt to forge a universal currency which would enable difference to circulate freely within contemporary human geography is flawed for three interrelated reasons. First, by working through a libidinal economy of negation it forces difference to conform to the Same. Specifically, difference is captured as so-many standard deviations from the Norm. Second, this apparatus of capture is predestined to yield a state of confusion, imprecision, and indistinction which can only be contained within a <b>quotation</b> <b>market.</b> Third, by dwelling upon negation and appropriation, and through capturing difference within a normalized economy of the Same, the forging of a universal currency within a <b>quotation</b> <b>market</b> deprives itself of the ability to effectively affirm difference, othemess, alterity, and singularity in and of themselves. Such an affirmation would require an act of ex-appropriation, rather than one of appropriation. Consequently, by drawing upon the liminal materialism of a deconstructive experience, in the second half of the paper I explore four movements of ex-appropriation: radical passivity, destabilization on the move, telephony, and picnolepsy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ethics of the event. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{extends the}} literature on the efficacy of technical analysis {{in the direction of the}} `risk premium view' as an explanation for excess trading rule returns. First, we generally rely on the theoretical alternatives to the efficient market hypothesis which encourages possibilities for markets to be inefficient. We then investigate the link between the risk involved in trading rule strategies and the resulting excess returns. The empirical analysis is based mainly on a sample of stocks drawn from the London Stock Exchange, (LSE), portfolios constructed from three US markets; the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE), the American Stock Exchange, (ASE), and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated <b>Quotation</b> <b>market,</b> (NASDAQ). Data from ten small emerging markets of Africa is also used in empirical analyses. Focusing on documented evidence of differences in risk levels among several markets or market segments, the empirical analyses examined whether these risk differentials can explain excess trading rule profits as compensation for bearing risk. The empirical analyses find that, to a large extent, liquidity, book-to-market ratio, and institutional arrangements can explain the excess profits from technical analysis. These empirical analyses are carried out in chapters three, four and six. As part of the analysis, I conduct empirical tests to assess the appropriateness of some risk estimates for trading rules. Using recently developed techniques, the evidence in chapter five is consistent with the notion that certain risk estimates may not be appropriate for adjusting trading rule returns for risk.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a comprehensive time series analysis of real and nominal exchange rates for the following Pacific-Basin countries: Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand in the seventies and eighties. The largest part of the research concentrates on the behaviour of real exchange rates. Contrary to most research that {{has been carried out}} so far, the exchange rate quotations for the calculation of the real exchange rate are not the official ones but the black <b>market</b> <b>quotations.</b> The black <b>market</b> exchange rates were used because the official ones for most of these countries were fixed and determined by the governments for our sample period and therefore the black <b>market</b> <b>quotation</b> was the one that corresponded to the forces of the market. A comprehensive analysis of the black market real exchange rate is carried out by applying different methods of time series analysis to these series. Each method gives some information about the underlying process of the series and so by combining all this information, a more detailed picture can be drawn. Furthermore, a comparison of tfie quantity and quality of the information gained by each approach is made. For some of the approaches more than one technique is applied to the same data set and therefore a very interesting comparison between these techniques can be made. In this case the current research {{can be seen as a}} critique of the popular time series methods and of their performance on the actual data. Another objective of the thesis is to investigate the underlying international economic relationships and international parities that result in a given behaviour of exchange rates. Purchasing power parity is the main underlying parity that we question through the behaviour of the real exchange rate for most of our research. A final objective is to examine the dynamic relationship between the mean of the black and official market exchange rates and between the variance of the rates...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a model of}} default dependency based on Lévy subordinator. It is a tractable one-factor model with an architecture {{similar to that of}} the standard Gaussian copula model, providing easy calibration to individual hazard rate curves and efficient pricing with Fast Fourier Transform techniques. The subordinator is a stable Lévy process with a probability distribution function known as the Lévy distribution. The model provides a reasonable fit to market data with two parameters necessary to assess dependency risk, a measure of correlation and a measure of catastrophe. Correlation products are derivatives sensitive to default correlation among a collection of credit names. Pricing of these involves either directly or indirectly modeling default dependency among the credit names. Market standard among such models is still the Gaussian copula model, a one-parameter model that enables easy <b>quotation</b> of <b>market</b> prices.
