While sport participation rates for women have grown exponentially, data on the Sydney Scoreboard indicate that women remain markedly under-represented on sport boards globally including in Australia. A significant body of research has emerged to explain women’s under-representation in sport governance. The majority of studies have investigated the gender distribution of the board’s composition and related issues such as factors that inhibit women’s participation in sport governance. Few {{studies have examined the}} underlying gender dynamics on sport boards once women have gained a seat at the boardroom table, yet this line of investigation may disclose important reasons for the lack of gender equality on sport boards. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine how gender works on boards of National Sport Organisations (NSOs) in Australia with the following research questions: 1. 	What are the gender relations that characterise the composition and operation of sport boards in NSOs in Australia in terms of a ‘gender regimes’ approach, that is, one that draws on categories associated with the gendered organisation of production, power/authority, emotional attachment and symbolic relations? 2. 	In view of the above, what are the implications or prospects for gender equality on these boards in terms of the barriers and opportunities created by the specific configurations of gender relations and dynamics? The theoretical framework was based on the notions that organisations are intrinsically gendered (Acker, 1990) and that gender is actively created through social practice (Connell, 1987; West & Zimmerman, 1987). According to Connell, systematically determining where and how people ‘do gender’ in an organisational context depends on being able to identify a pattern of practices or ‘gender regime’ (2009, p. 72) associated with four main areas of social life. The four dimensions of a gender regime are: a) gender division of labour, that is, the way in which production or work are arranged on gender lines; b) gender relations of power, that is, the way in which control, authority, and force are exercised on gender lines, including organisational hierarchy, legal power and violence, both individual and collective; c) emotion and human relations, that is, the way attachment and antagonism among people and groups are organised along gender lines, including feelings of solidarity, prejudice, sexual attraction and repulsion and d) gender culture and symbolism, that is, ways in which gender identities are defined and gender is represented and understood, including prevailing beliefs and attitudes about gender. Such an approach permits the possibility of identifying how organisational processes, such as sport board governance, are gendered and whether the configurations identified reproduce gender inequalities or promote gender change. The research design for the study comprised two stages. Stage one involved an audit of gender representation on 56 NSO boards. Stage two contained in-depth interviews with board directors and chief executive officers (n= 26; 9 women and 17 men) from five NSOs, and collection of documents in relation to gender equality on boards of these organisations. In terms of data analysis I used both a deductive, theory-inspired, approach and an inductive, data- inspired, approach (Amis, 2005). To ensure credibility and legitimacy of the study, I produced a detailed audit trail which contains an explicit account of the research methodology used. In relation to the research questions informing this study, I found that gender dynamics, understood from a ‘gender regimes’ perspective, were not uniform. The following three gender regimes were identified: masculine hegemony, masculine hegemony in transition, and gender mainstreaming in progress. The gender regime of masculine hegemony, found on boards in sports A, B and D, offered the least prospects for gender equality. These boards were deeply hierarchical in terms of gender: men were numerically dominant and held the most influential positions. Yet such a situation was not challenged by any of the directors, men or women. The male dominance that characterised board membership and executive positions was normalised and accepted. It was not identified and understood as a problem for which the board had any responsibility. Most members of these boards believed that the problem of gender inequality on sport boards lay well beyond the control of their organisations. Women were simply not putting themselves forward for board membership or did not have the appropriate qualifications and experience to participate. By contrast, the gender regime of masculine hegemony in transition, found on sport board C, demonstrated a more dynamic pattern of gender relations with prospects for gender equality more positive than the previous regime. Here, a highly qualified and experienced woman occupied the chair and she was supported by an alliance of the male CEO and two board members, one of whom was a woman. Together they comprised a formidable foursome – two men and two women – who explicitly assumed responsibility to address gender equality in their sport, including in relation to board membership and practice. Nevertheless, this regime displayed some barriers to the advancement of gender equality, primarily through the presence of a masculine ethic in leadership, some marked hostility towards the woman chair, and generalised support for meritocracy over gender equality. To the extent that this regime was characterised by structures of practice that both maintained and contested masculine dominance in sport governance, it expressed tensions in gender dynamics that rendered the board’s regime status one of transition between acceptance of masculine dominance and opposition to it. The gender regime of gender mainstreaming in progress, found on the board of sport E, was the most conducive for the advancement of gender equality. Here women occupied significant board positions, senior and influential male board members were supportive of the women on the board, the constitution included a gender <b>quota</b> <b>clause</b> that required a minimum of three directors of either gender, and friendly, collegial emotions characterised the working relationships of the directors. The regime was one in progress because, although the prospects were most positive compared to the two other regimes, gender equality had not yet been achieved. Men still occupied the most influential positions of president and CEO, and women’s representation on the board (33...|$|E

In the absence of such a clause, a tenant under either the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 or the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 also seemed, in principle, to be free to sell the quota attaching to the land he rented on the open market. This has been called quota [...] "massage" [...] or even quota [...] "theft", though Williams (2011) calls this last term [...] "inelegant and inappropriate", such a transfer being apparently lawful.|$|R

Some writers {{have pointed out that}} if there are some production externalities in the fishery, ITQs {{will not be able to}} generate a first-best solution. In this paper, it is argued that this is incorrect. It is proved that ITQs solve the production externalities associated with crowding, as well as the stock externality they are primarily designed to solve. In a more general setting, ITQs can form a basis for trade in the production externalities and generate a first-best solution. In this case, the contracts for transfer of <b>quotas</b> must include <b>clauses</b> that restrict further sales of quotas. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

None of these {{projects}} had involved negotiations or discussions with any representatives of the academic community. Education Minister Xavier Darcos, who was already caught in an impasse following the failed introduction of a reform for secondary schools (ultimately shelved), presented a plan in October that would affect the training of primary and secondary school teachers. Until that point, teachers had enjoyed the status of public servants. They first had to successfully pass a national exam with entry <b>quotas</b> (numerus <b>clauses),</b> after which they spent a year in a university teacher training institute (Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres IUFM) with numerous work placements, and finally became fully qualified teachers. There were two such exams: the CAPES (following a bachelor's degree, or more often a Master's) and the Agrégation, following a master's degree and an additional preparatory year. Those who passed the Agrégation had a direct route into Higher Education teaching. Most university lecturers, especially in humanities departments, are former Agrégés who have been awarded a doctorate. Following the reform, they would have to take a master's degree in theory of education (Master Enseignement). Preparation for the exam would then become part of the second year's syllabus, during which there would also be work placements, in order for teachers to access teaching posts immediately after qualifying. However, the technical implementation of this plan has proved to be extremely complex, and opponents have stressed the fact that there would be many more candidates than work placements on offer. Moreover, the training they would receive in their original area of interest would suffer, since the hours of educational theory and exam preparation would leave less time available time for the coursework for the master's degree. Union members denounced the draft law as an attack against teachers' status as public servants and stated that Graduate students who failed the numerus clausus would then become [...] "crowds of precariously employed teachers without any status". The academic community had already begun fighting this proposal, which they saw as threatening the status of French teachers. Meanwhile, Valérie Pécresse unveiled her own proposals.|$|R
