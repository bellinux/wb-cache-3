40|$|The high hazard {{mechanical}} system (HHMS) has three characteristics in the petroleum and petrochemical industry (PPI) : high risk, high cost, and high technology requirements. For a HHMS, part, component, and subsystem failures {{will result in}} varying degrees and various types of risk consequences, including unexpected downtime, production losses, economic costs, safety accidents, and environmental pollution. Thus, obtaining the quantitative risk level and distribution in a HHMS to control major risk accidents and ensure safe production is of vital importance. However, {{the structure of the}} HHMS is more complex than some other systems, making the <b>quantitative</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> process more difficult. Additionally, a variety of uncertain risk data hinder the realization of <b>quantitative</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis.</b> A few <b>quantitative</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> techniques and studies for HHMS exist, especially in the PPI. Therefore, a study on the <b>quantitative</b> <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> method for HHMS was completed to obtain the risk level and distribution of high-risk objects.

40|$|Abstract. The {{analysis}} {{of information systems}} (IS) <b>risk,</b> especially <b>quantitative</b> <b>analysis,</b> is fraught with inaccuracy and unreliability {{for a variety of}} reasons. First, the metrics required as input data to virtually all types of <b>quantitative</b> IS <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> methods are based upon data that are virtually impossible to collect accurately. These data require a thorough understanding of detailed threats and impacts on an asset-by-asset basis. In most organizations those data usually are not recorded accurately, consistently or over a long enough period of time to be reliable for quantifying, ranking and predicting risk. The second weakness of current IS <b>risk</b> <b>analysis</b> approaches is that they tend to be asset-based. In an environment where IS assets can run {{in the tens of thousands}} it is impractical to have a complete inventory of such assets, let alone a clear understanding of the individual asset loss impacts under varying types of threats. Finally, vulnerability assessments and risk analyses usually are performed infrequently in large enterprises due to cost and inconvenience. This means that such assessments and analyses are, at best, snapshots that may not be repeated for months or, even, years. Certainly, any annualized loss expectancy figures, unreliable under the best of circumstances, soon become, essentially, useless. That makes effective ongoing IS risk management almost impossible in a practical sense...|$|R
