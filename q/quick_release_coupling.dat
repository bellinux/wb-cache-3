50|$|A {{quick connect}} fitting, also called a quick {{disconnect}} or <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>coupling,</b> is a coupling {{used to provide}} a fast, make-or-break connection of fluid transfer lines. Operated by hand, quick connect fittings replace threaded or flanged connections, which require wrenches. When equipped with self-sealing valves, quick connect fittings will, upon disconnection, automatically contain any fluid in the line.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>couple,</b> fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible valve nipples, but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8‚Äù male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|R
50|$|Locking skewers {{replace the}} {{existing}} <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewers on a bicycle's wheels and Seatpost clamp (<b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewers enable removal without tools). This reduces {{the need to}} lock these parts of the bike since now their removal requires tools. One type of locking skewer uses the same design as a normal <b>Quick</b> <b>release</b> skewer, except after clamping the skewer the (keyed) handle may be removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{debate over}} <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> use as {{illustrated}} by Brown, has become a national issue due to several lawsuits brought on by various people including a group of mothers who claim their children were injured due to innocently incorrect use of <b>quick</b> <b>releases.</b>|$|R

50|$|A side-effect is {{that the}} <b>quick</b> <b>release,</b> which was {{developed}} to allow the wheel to be removed without having to unscrew any components, no longer works as designed: the skewer must be unscrewed in order to remove the wheel (although tools do remain unnecessary). This means that the tension on refitting must be adjusted again. Some cyclists file off the lawyer tabs so the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> works as originally intended.|$|R

50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>release</b> {{harnesses}} {{are already}} widely in use, {{and make it}} possible for sailors to unhook themselves from the wire from all angles while it is under tension, thus decreasing the chance of getting trapped underwater or in dangerous conditions. The adoption of <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> harnesses has not been universal due to the reduced reliability of the moving parts; stories of such systems releasing unexpectedly have caused many to shun them in favour of traditional fixed hooks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>releases</b> are {{sometimes}} recommended against {{with the use}} of disk brakes because of the need for the axle attachment to withstand braking forces.|$|R

50|$|Lawyer lips or lawyer tabs (a type of {{positive}} retention device) are tabs fitted to the fork ends {{on the front}} fork of bicycles sold in some countries (particularly the U.S.) to prevent a wheel from leaving the fork if the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewer comes undone. They were introduced in response to lawsuits supported by experts including John Howard, in cases where incorrectly adjusted <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> wheels {{came out of the}} forks. Lawyer tabs are designed to compensate for the fact that many riders {{do not know how to}} operate a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> properly: some riders treat them as a folding wing nut, and others do not tighten them enough for fear of snapping them or shearing the skewer (both are not likely given the normal range of human strength, and the mechanical advantages involved, as long as the skewer is not damaged or flawed).|$|R
