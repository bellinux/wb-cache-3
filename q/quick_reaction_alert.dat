5|$|In 1982, {{during the}} Falklands War, three Phantom FGR2s of No. 29 Squadron were on active <b>Quick</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Alert</b> duty on Ascension Island {{to protect the}} base from air attack. After the Falklands War, 15 {{upgraded}} ex-USN F-4Js, known as the F-4J(UK) entered RAF service to compensate for one interceptor squadron redeployed to the Falklands.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of <b>Quick</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Alert</b> (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E
25|$|On 16 December 2005, the Typhoon reached initial {{operational}} capability (IOC) with the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare). Its Typhoons were put into service as air defence fighters at the Grosseto Air Base, and immediately assigned to <b>Quick</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Alert</b> (QRA) at the same base.|$|E
50|$|Following Operation Desert Storm, the {{dissolution}} of the Soviet Union and the de facto end of the Cold War, President George H. W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney directed SAC to take all bomber and refueling aircraft and Minuteman II ICBM's off of continuous nuclear alert on 27 September 1991 and placing said aircraft on <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> ground <b>alert.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During {{periods of}} {{increased}} {{tension in the}} early 1960s, SAC kept part of its B-52 fleet airborne at all times, to allow an extremely fast retaliatory strike against the Soviet Union {{in the event of}} a surprise attack on the United States. This program continued until 1990 when the bomber wings were placed on <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> ground <b>alert</b> and were able to take off within a few minutes. SAC also maintained the National Emergency Airborne Command Post (NEACP, pronounced [...] "kneecap"), also known as [...] "Looking Glass," [...] which consisted of several EC-135s, one of which was airborne at all times from 1961 through 1990. During the Cuban missile crisis the bombers were dispersed to several different airfields, and also were sometimes airborne. For example, some were sent to Wright Patterson, which normally didn't have B-52s.|$|R
5000|$|At 03:45, the Ranger <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> {{force was}} <b>alerted</b> by the DCG to the area. Though they weren't given a {{specific}} mission, {{they were to}} establish communication for further instructions upon reaching Gardez, 10 minutes from the mountain. The <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> force (QRF) consisted of 19 Rangers, a Tactical Air Control Party (Tacp), and a three-man USAF special tactics team carried by two Chinooks, Razor 01 and Razor 02. As Air Force rules prohibited AC-130 aircraft from remaining in hostile airspace in daylight after the crash of an AC-130 in Khafji in the Gulf War, the AC-130 support protecting Mako 30 {{was forced to leave}} before Razor 01 reached the LZ, although the leadership was aware that Razor 01 was incoming. Unfortunately, the Razor Chinooks had not been equipped with functioning satellite radios to maintain communication with the HQ in Bagram or, even more critically, the AFO Teams lead. Also unfortunate, the pilot of the Razor 01 was not told about the enemy's anti-aircraft location on top of the mountain. Due to the satellite communications difficulties, Razor 01 was mistakenly directed to the [...] "hot" [...] LZ on the peak at [...] Because of this, the Razor 01 flew into the same enemy trap that the SEALs had flown into, with no one able to communicate the reality of the situation.|$|R
25|$|In early October 1973 Nachumi {{was among}} two F-4 Phantom crews on <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>alert</b> duty at Ofir air force base, near Sharm el-Sheikh at the {{southern}} tip of the Sinai. Neither pilots were qualified as pair leaders, but on the morning of October 6, {{when it became clear that}} war was imminent, Nachumi was promoted on the phone by squadron leader Yiftah Spector.|$|E
25|$|The 4133d SW was redesignated as the 319th Bombardment Wing (319th BW) on 1 February 1963 in a name-only redesigation and was {{assigned}} to SAC's Second Air Force, 810th Strategic Aerospace Division. Upon redesignation, the wing placed aircraft on peacetime <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>alert</b> duty, and conducted global bombardment training for Emergency War Order operations and air refueling operations to meet SAC commitments. The aircraft in the 1960s at GFAFB were the latest models: B-52H bombers and KC-135A tankers.|$|E
25|$|As {{fighting}} intensified {{along the}} Suez Canal, the Israeli Air Force now dispatched its fighter squadrons on regular deployments to the airfield, with four pilots and aircraft rotating {{every two or}} three weeks. Two aircraft regularly stood on <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>alert</b> (QRA) at the base, ready to scramble within 5 minutes. Many of the kills achieved by Israeli fighter pilots between 1967 and 1973 were claimed by the Rephidim QRA aircraft, and many pilots sought to be stationed there during times of tension, eager to improve their chances of achieving a victory. The base was also the forward recovery base for any aircraft damaged or low on fuel, as well as the premier medical station for soldiers wounded in the fighting along the Canal, from which they were then ferried to Israel.|$|E

25|$|Romm was 22 at the {{outbreak}} of the Six Day War and in the span of three days became the IAF's first jet ace, shooting down five enemy aircraft. When Israel launched operation Focus on June 5, 1967, Romm {{was one of the few}} pilots who were not tasked with striking Egyptian air bases, remaining at Tel Nof on <b>quick</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>alert</b> instead. When Israeli Mysteres attacking the air base at Abu Suwayr encountered Egyptian Air Force MiG-21s, Romm and fellow pilot Eitan Karmi were scrambled to the scene. In the ensuing dogfight, each pilot shot down a pair of MiG-21s. That same afternoon, Romm was part of a 119 squadron formation that struck T-4 Syrian Air Force base. Two MiG-21s attempting to defend the base were shot down, one by Romm and the other by Asher Snir.|$|E
500|$|Four squadrons of Canberras {{were based}} in Germany, with their Mark 7 bombs stored at RAF Germany bases at RAF Bruggen, RAF Geilenkirchen, RAF Laarbruch and RAF Wildenrath. The crews practiced the Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS) for {{tactical}} nuclear attacks. There were also four squadrons of nuclear-armed Canberras {{based in the}} UK at RAF Coningsby and RAF Upwood; these were capable of using either the Mark 7 or the British Red Beard nuclear weapons. They too {{were assigned to the}} SACEUR in October 1960. The Air Ministry decided to replace these Canberras with Valiants as the long-range Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor V-bombers became available. A Valiant squadron at RAF Marham was assigned to SACEUR on 1 January 1961, followed by two more in July. The UK-based Canberra squadrons were then disbanded. Each of the 24 Valiants was equipped with two of the more powerful Project E Mark 28 nuclear bombs. These were replaced by the newer Mark 43 nuclear bombs in early 1963. Only the aircraft on <b>Quick</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Alert</b> (QRA) were armed with a pair of live bombs. QRA aircraft were kept armed and fuelled on hardstands surrounded by [...] high chain-link fences. The Valiants were taken out of service in 1965.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Ark Royal {{embarked}} 892 NAS {{as part of}} her air {{group for}} the first time, with a total of 12 aircraft. The first operational use of the Royal Navy's Phantoms had come in 1969, when 892 NAS had embarked for training with the US aircraft carrier [...] in the Mediterranean, and had undertaken air defence missions alongside the ship's own F-4Js. This deployment showed the necessity for the modifications fitted to Ark Royal, as the heat from the afterburners of the Spey, combined with the increased angle of attack resulting from the extendable nosewheel, during the initial launches from Saratoga caused the deck plates to distort, leading to subsequent catapult launches being undertaken at reduced weight without the use of re-heat. During Ark Royals first three-year commission, 892 NAS, which had initially used RNAS Yeovilton in Somerset as its home base, moved to RAF Leuchars in Fife where, during the periods when it was not embarked, it undertook <b>Quick</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Alert</b> (QRA) duties alongside the RAF's 43 Squadron. The Phantom served in the Fleet Air Arm until 1978, when Ark Royal was finally withdrawn from service, leaving no ship in the Royal Navy capable of operating the type. The final catapult launch from Ark Royal was a Phantom of 892 NAS on 27 November 1978 during the disembarkation of the air group following the ship's final deployment; the squadron's aircraft were delivered to RAF St Athan in Wales, where they were handed over to the RAF. During the type's service with the Royal Navy, 10 of the total FAA fleet of 28 were lost in crashes.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{the serious}} {{nature of the}} Cold War, {{everything}} that flew into the Canadian Northern Air Defence Region had to be detected and identified within two minutes by RCAF or USAF Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron personnel. If an aircraft was unknown at two minutes, fighters were scrambled to intercept, {{to find out why}} the aircraft could not be identified, to force it to land, or to shoot it down. [...] Receiving interception notification from No.3 ADCC at RCAF Stn Edgar, 428 AW(F) fighters, on Alert Status, were airborne within five minutes, when under reduced status 15 minutes, and one hour was permitted. To meet the standard, and when on exercise, squadron aircraft with alert crews were positioned fuelled and armed, 24 hours a day/seven days a week, in special <b>Quick</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Alert</b> hangars.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 August 2010, a Spanish twin-seat Typhoon crashed at Spain's Morón Air Base {{moments after}} {{take-off}} for a routine training flight. It was being piloted by a Lieutenant Colonel of the Royal Saudi Arabian Air Force, who was killed, and a Spanish Air Force Major, who ejected safely. Following this incident, the German Air Force grounded its 55 planes on 16 September 2010, amidst concerns that after ejecting successfully the pilot {{had fallen to}} his death. In response to the crash's investigation, the RAF temporarily grounded all Typhoon training flights on 17 September 2010. <b>Quick</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>Alert</b> duties were unaffected. On 21 September, the RAF announced that the harness system had been sufficiently modified to enable routine flying from RAF Coningsby. The Austrian Air Force also said that all its aircraft had been cleared for flight. On 24 August 2010, the ejection seat manufacturer Martin Baker commented: [...] "... under certain conditions, the quick release fitting could be unlocked using the palm of the hands, rather than the thumb and fingers and that this posed a risk of inadvertent release", and added that a modification had been rapidly developed and approved [...] "to eliminate this risk" [...] and was being fitted to all Typhoon seats.|$|E
