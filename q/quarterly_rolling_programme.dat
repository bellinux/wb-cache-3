40|$|Addressing {{the dearth}} of studies on rolling budgets, we {{investigate}} how the importance of rolling budgets for various planning, control and evaluation reasons relate to a business unit's strategy and uncertainty, and report on the variation in these responses when partitioned into <b>quarterly</b> and monthly <b>rolling</b> budget types. We use a survey instrument with responses from 182 rolling budget firms in our investigation. Our findings reveal consistencies as well as deviations between our sub-samples (<b>quarterly</b> and monthly <b>rolling</b> budgets), and the total rolling budget sample. We report that the way rolling budgets relate to uncertainty and strategy in organisations are substantively different for monthly and <b>quarterly</b> <b>rolling</b> budget types, and vary across planning, control and evaluation budget reasons. Our findings show a greater sensitivity between monthly rolling budgets and uncertainty/strategy, and virtually nil relations between <b>quarterly</b> <b>rolling</b> budgets and uncertainty/strategy. We posit that monthly rolling budgets are used in a manner more traditionally associated to rolling budgets in prior studies, while <b>quarterly</b> <b>rolling</b> budgets might be used relatively more symbolically or in response to external pressures such as earnings forecast requirements, and are less sensitive to establish organisational antecedents such as uncertainty/strategy...|$|R

5000|$|The {{district}} courts was abolished in a <b>rolling</b> <b>programme</b> between 10 March 2008 and 22 February 2010, {{following the}} passage of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 by the Scottish Parliament. The 2007 Act enabled the Scottish Ministers to replace district courts by [...] "justice of the peace courts". This allowed the Scottish Government to unify the administration of the sheriff courts and district courts in Scotland, but retaining lay justices of the peace. The new justice of the peace courts are managed by the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service and are organised by sheriffdom.

30|$|The {{implications}} for the rail freight sector, in terms of wagon fleet capacity and capability in general, are significant, as is the availability of infrastructure (e.g. line capacity and train paths) to accommodate the much higher expected demands. Recently, a Strategic Freight Network (SFN) has {{been put in place}} to benefit the British rail freight industry. This facilitates opinion gathering from stakeholder groups that include ports, shipping lines, manufacturing, logistics service providers, retailers, quarrying, construction and British rail freight service users. The SFN is a <b>rolling</b> <b>programme</b> of planned investment in infrastructure to allow the efficient operation of longer, larger and more freight trains, to meet the forecast growth in demand (Network Rail 2010 p. 35). The SFN consists of a series of linked schemes, with a <b>rolling</b> <b>programme</b> of investment in more productive locomotives, wagons and terminals, aimed to improve the performance, economic efficiency and capacity of freight on rail (Network Rail 2013 c). The current research recommends that, in combination with this freight forecast, similar action be taken at the European level and SHIFT 2 RAIL ([URL] has kicked off its journey towards this.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with all}} Vari-lite products, the VL2 range {{was subject to}} a <b>rolling</b> <b>programme</b> of {{improvements}} and retrofits, designed to increase the reliability of what was still, in many ways, cutting-edge technology. In particular, {{the design of the}} original APS lamp power supply was notoriously unreliable but was ultimately cured by the application of the [...] "X-mod" [...] upgrade, whichâ€”with additional tweaks to the lamp ignitor cardâ€”vastly reduced the number of APS-related and lamp strike problems. Upgraded APS units were suffixed with [...] "-X".|$|R

The aim was to form 25 kV AC overhead-wire electrified links northward from the Port of Southampton to major cities in northern and central England and a dry port container terminal in the Midlands. The government wanted efficient electric-hauled freight trains to compete with road haulage.|$|R
