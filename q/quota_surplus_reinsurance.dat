Theoreticians have not been particularly interested in analysing the optimality properties of these types of reinsurance covers. In this paper, we will use a real-life insurance portfolio in order to compare four proportional structures: quota share reinsurance, variable <b>quota</b> share <b>reinsurance,</b> <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> and <b>surplus</b> <b>reinsurance</b> with a table of lines.

In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedant would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.|$|R

25|$|A {{final point}} {{needs to be}} explained. It was noted above that when a {{candidate}} polls more votes than the <b>quota,</b> their <b>surplus</b> vote is distributed to other candidates. Thus, in the example given above, Hutchins's surplus was 909,698, or 1,446,231 (his primary vote) minus 536,533 (the quota). It may be asked: which 909,698 of Hutchins's 1,446,231 primary votes are distributed? Are they chosen at random from among his votes? In fact they are all distributed, but at less than their full value. Since 909,698 is 62.9% of 1,446,231, each of Hutchins's votes is transferred to other candidates as 62.9% of a vote: each vote {{is said to have}} a transfer value of 0.629. This avoids any possibility of an unrepresentative sample of his votes being transferred. After each count the candidate's progressive total is rounded down to the nearest whole number. This means that a small number of votes are lost by fractionation in the final count.|$|R
50|$|The Assembly has 25 members, elected for {{a term of}} up to four years, {{with five}} members being elected in each of five electorates, called {{division}}s. Each division has approximately {{the same number of}} electors. Voting for the House of Assembly is by a form of proportional representation using the single transferable vote (STV), known as the Hare-Clark electoral system. By having multiple members for each division, the voting intentions of the electors are more closely represented in the House of Assembly, and a division's minority party usually wins at least one seat. Since 1998, the quota for election in each division, after distribution of preferences, has been 16.7% (one-sixth). Under the preferential proportional voting system in place, the lowest-polling candidates are eliminated, and their votes distributed as preferences to the remaining candidates. If a candidate achieves a <b>quota,</b> their <b>surplus</b> votes are redistributed as preferences. The last election for the House of Assembly took place on 15 March 2014.|$|R

40|$|Reinsurance is a {{mechanism}} {{the insurance industry}} uses to spread the risk it assumes from policyholders. Through reinsurance, the industry's losses are absorbed and distributed {{among a group of}} companies so that no single company is overburdened with the financial responsibility of offering coverage to its policyholders. Catastrophes, unexpected liabilities, and a series of large losses that might be too great for an individual insurer to absorb can be handled through reinsurance. Without it, most insurers would be able to cover only the safest of ventures, leaving many risky but worthwhile ventures without coverage.

40|$|Output quotas {{are known}} to be more {{efficient}} than input <b>quotas</b> in transferring <b>surplus</b> from consumers to producers. Input quotas, by distorting the shadow prices of inputs, lead to inefficient production and generate larger deadweight losses, for a given amount of surplus transferred. Yet, input quotas have been a ubiquitous tool in agricultural policy. Practicality considerations, as well as the difficulty to control outputs that heavily depend on stochastic weather conditions, are arguments that help understand why policy makers may favor input quotas over output quotas. In this paper, we offer an additional explanation that rests on efficiency considerations. Assuming that the regulator only has limited knowledge about the market fundamentals (supply and demand elasticities, among others), seeks to transfer at least a given amount of surplus to producers and is influenced by the industry in his choice of the quota level, we show that an input quota becomes the optimal policy.

40|$|Although the key {{concept of}} a quota is simple to set a limit on {{production}} the market and welfare implications of operating a quota system are relatively complex. The purpose of the analysis reported in {{this paper is to}} address two aspects relevant to an evaluation of quota systems. First, quota is typically contingent on the existence of another policy, namely market price support, and as such, interacts with other policy tools in pursuing defined policy objectives. The paper examines analytically and empirically the trade-offs that exist among the individual policy tools for a given policy objective. Second, the paper discusses some important welfare effects of quota systems that are not often considered in the literature. It illustrates that if parts of the primary factors of production are not owned by the milk farmer and prices for purchase farm inputs are not perfectly elastic the conventionally used measure of producer surplus may understate net benefits to farmers of a quota system. Under the quota, the share of benefits flowing to owners of farm resources is magnified at the expense of input suppliers and the rent accruing to <b>quota</b> reduces the <b>surplus</b> accruing to traditional resources.

40|$|Abstract only. Concerns about declining {{stock and}} {{profitability}} in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry {{led to the}} introduction of individual transferable quota (ITQ) management in 1998. In this study, fisher groups were categorised by effort and quota ownership traits to examine response to revised management, and how profit drivers moderated this change. The number of investors who are not active fishers has steadily grown with a commensurate expansion of the lease quota market. The number of lease dependent fishers has remained steady through time while quota owner fishers have declined. In contrast to many other ITQ fisheries, the investor group has not consolidated into a small number of entities and there is little processor involvement. This was a result of fisheries rules explicitly designed to retain benefits of diverse ownership though a cap on the maximum allowed number of quota units per legal entity. Three categories of active fishers participate in the lease trade. Quota-transferring fishers lease quota both in and out, usually to secure access to quota {{at the start of the}} season with <b>surplus</b> <b>quota</b> being leased off later. Large-scale, lease quota dependent fishers have increased through time and are characterised by high fishing effort and high annual turnover but low profit per unit of fish. Small-scale lease quota dependent fishers utilise capital less fully and have less capacity to survive in the long run. These small scale lease fishers face barriers to entry into the large scale category through high upfront capital investment costs, which could hamper industry renewal. Potential issues for management that arise from lease-reliant fishers are (i) that their higher financial stress increases compliance risk and (ii) their lack of investment in quota assets reduces incentive for stewardship of the resource...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. peanut program restricts {{domestic}} sales with poundage <b>quota</b> but allows <b>surplus</b> production to be exported or crushed. Empirical analysis of North Carolina peanut production {{reveals that the}} marginal (and lower) price received by production above quota, that is the world price, {{is far more important}} in determining acreage than is the inframarginal subsidy of the quota support price. Key words: marketing quotas, peanuts, price supports, supply response, yield uncertainty. Many commodity markets are restricted by government-imposed supply controls. Ex-amples include milk, poultry, and eggs in Canada, milk in Australia, and tobacco and pea-nuts in the United States. Where firm-level quotas are used to restrict supply, failing to pro-duce enough to meet one's quota can be costly. The cost will depend upon the price received on quota production and the regulations governing unused quota. To reduce the probability of these losses, producers may on average produce more than their quota. The costs of this precau-tionary over-production depend, in part, on the marketing alternatives for excess production. In many quota schemes, excess production can be sold in a surplus market, where it receives a lower price. Alston and Quilkey examined this phenom-enon in milk production in New South Wales. They argued that farmers produce "insurance milk " in excess of the quota to guard against production uncertainty. Alston and Quilkey noted two opportunity costs of not meeting quota. The first is the loss of revenue and the second is the potential loss of future quota share. Excess production, in their view, is cho-sen to balance the marginal benefit of reducing Robert B.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 As {{the capital}} {{requirements}} for the modern dairy enterprise increase, the Oregon milk producer and his lender need more information concerning the profitability, solvency and liquidity of the enterprise {{on which to base}} their financial decisions. This research examines three areas where more information could be used to evaluate financial feasibility and credit use for Oregon dairy enterprises. The areas of investigation are (1) an analysis of factors important in determining the profitability of the enterprise, (2) an analysis of the alternatives for acquiring Oregon milk market quota and (3) an analysis of the risk that the dairy enterprise will not generate sufficient cash flows to meet various loan repayment requirements. For the first area of investigation the statistical technique of discriminant analysis was used to estimate a linear function using variables common to 63 sample dairy enterprises. The resulting discriminant function is the one that best separates the 63 observations into two groups, those with a net profit per cow greater than the mean average and those with a net profit per cow less than the mean. Fifty-seven of the 63 sample enterprises were correctly classified by the function. Standardizing the coefficients of the function revealed that production per cow, labor requirement (in minutes) per cow-day and the amount of concentrates per cow-day were the most important variables in correctly classifying the observations. The scaled discriminant function provides dairymen and their lenders with a method to assess the profit potential of an enterprise and to predict the effect of possible management changes on profit potential. Oregon milk market quota cannot only be bought and sold, subject to certain regulations, but can also be earned by producing and selling milk in excess of the produce rs quota allotment. Acquisition of additional quota increases the amount of milk sold at the higher quota blend price increasing the producer's revenue. Due to differences in the timing of cash flows, a present value analysis was used to determine which alternative for acquisition, purchase or earn, is most profitable for given sets of circumstances. The present value {{of the differences between the}} cash flows for the alternatives is the maximum amount a producer could profitably pay for some amount of quota rather than earning it.

40|$|A canvass of the {{resource}} economics literature of {{the last thirty years}} yields a limited number of applications of economic theory to the problems of recreational fishing, especially compared to the depth of contributions to commercial fisheries over this era. This neglect may be linked to the relatively short shrift given to the control of recreational fisheries (relative to commercial fisheries) by fisheries managers in the past. This asymmetry may be justified when recreational takes are sufficiently small to be negligible for the purposes of stock management. However, it has become increasingly clear that recreational mortality, far from being insignificant, is often comparable to or greater than the commercial mortality for many species (Coleman, et al., 2004). With fisheries managers scrambling to find solutions for the control of recreational mortality, economists have entered the policy arena promoting innovative rights-based policies that are grounded in the past successes of economic prescriptions for the management of commercial fisheries (Johnston, et al., 2007, Sutinen and Johnston, 2003). Despite the merits of these proposals, there remains a sense that findings from the commercial fishing experience may not be as immediately transferable to recreational settings as often imagined. In the first place, our understanding of the mechanisms of the rent dissipation process under open access is imperfect at best. Experience from the rationalization of commercial fisheries has yielded many surprises, with drastic behavioral changes occurring at unanticipated margins (Wilen, 2005). These experiences demonstrate the inadequacies of simple single-factor models in capturing the complexities of real-world rent dissipation. Second, while the recreational for-hire sector may seem similar to commercial fisheries operations in many ways, there are key differences that may limit our ability to readily transfer knowledge from commercial rationalization programs. These observations point toward the need for a more developed theoretical foundation in order to make sense of recreational fishery rationalization programs - such as those under consideration for the Gulf of Mexico - and their likely effects. As a step along this path, we develop a simple bioeconomic model of optimal and open access management for a for-hire recreational fishery. We restrict our attention to the for-hire sector for three reasons. First, charter and headboat trips are a substantial part of total fishing effort for many species and often contribute in a significant way to many coastal economies. Second, given the relative ease of observing fishing activities on for-hire vessels compared to solitary fishing trips, they are widely considered easier targets for regulation and are thus likely to be of some importance in recreational fisheries policy making over the near horizon. Finally, as we shall demonstrate, the interaction of consumer preferences with the supply behavior of vessel owners creates the potential for an array of fascinating distortions and feedbacks with great relevance for fisheries policy. Our model rests upon elements of the bioeconomic framework pioneered by McConnell and Sutinen (1979) and Anderson (1993). However, it extends their approach by incorporating a realistic and flexible theory of the choice of inputs of the for-hire fishing firm. This synthesis of traditional analytical bioeconomics with a production economics treatment of firm behavior is unique, both in commercial and recreational fisheries applications. Combining the supply and demand sides of the problem allows us to examine the long run distortions arising under open access in a manner that reflects feedbacks between angler preferences and the decisions of vessel owners. We find that open access conditions in charter fisheries lead to numerous distortions including excess investments in catch-augmenting inputs on vessels, excessive catch of target species and excessive entry of vessels (resulting in idle vessel capacity for a potentially substantial portion of the season). More subtle perverse incentives include the presence of too few anglers per vessel (due to incentives to reduce losses to catch rates due to congestion), possible underinvestment in valuable but non catch enhancing factor inputs and an incentive for anglers to land an excessive fraction of their catch {{to the detriment of the}} future stock. Many of these findings are reflective of recreational fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. We then utilize our model to consider various options for the rationalization of chartered recreational fisheries. Interestingly, achieving the first best outcome requires a minimum of two policy instruments, a tax/quota on fishing mortality and a levy/quota on entry. The levy on entry is necessary to prevent new entry into a profitable fishery where all charter boat owners are fully employed leading to a situation of less than full employment of vessel capital and the inflation of industry-wide fixed costs. We discuss at length the problems of monitoring and enforcement for a system of tradable landings and discard quotas and discuss the merits of a single-quota system based on a single estimated mortality variable where both landings and discards are, to some degree, observable. Under this system, fishermen are able to exchange landings quota for discards at a prescribed relative mortality ratio. Vessels vie for certification into a discrete number of mortality classes (and thus discard/landings exchange ratios) based upon easily observed factors such as enforcement of quick catch and release behavior, use of gears with lower mortality characteristics and the employment of accepted post-catch techniques to enhance survival. Vessel owners would face positive incentives to achieve a high degree of certification because doing so would allow them to generate a greater number of landings for a given holding of mortality quota. This increases the effective number of anglers the vessel can serve with their holdings thus leading to an increase in the asset value of their quota - a gain they can capitalize on directly by serving more anglers or, indirectly, by selling their <b>surplus</b> <b>quota.</b> Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
