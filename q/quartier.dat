5|$|The {{cultural}} {{process was}} somehow intensified in Sophiatown, as in Soho, the Greenwich Village, the <b>Quartier</b> Latin or Kreuzberg. It was akin to what Harlem was to New York in the 1920s Harlem Renaissance and is {{sometimes referred to}} as the Sophiatown renaissance.|$|E
5|$|The disused {{channels}} {{of the central}} boulevards later facilitated {{the construction of the}} north-south line of the premetro, which opened in 1976. The conversion of the existing tunnels to metro tunnels ensured that there was minimal disruption on the surface. Some of the former pipes also served as storm drains. The Anspach Fountain was transferred to the <b>Quartier</b> des Quais/Kaaien.|$|E
5|$|Day {{wished for}} the girls to be {{isolated}} from external influences while he educated them so, {{at the beginning of}} November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le <b>quartier</b> des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English-speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began in}} March 1958 {{to enlarge the}} village to house a {{population}} of 15,000 and the basics were completed {{by the time that}} the French granted independence on 28 November 1960. Nouakchott was planned with the expectation that commerce and other economic activities would not take place in the city. Nouakchott's central business district was planned with broad streets and a grid-like structure; the new Cinquième <b>Quartier</b> (Fifth District) was located close to this area and became the location of a large open-air market and residential area within a few years. During the 1960s, the city obtained its own local government. By the 1970s, these new areas had grown so much that they replaced the old ksar in terms of importance, as they also hosted the governmental buildings and state enterprises.|$|E
5|$|The 21st {{century has}} {{brought with it}} {{a revival of the}} city's {{economic}} and cultural landscape. The construction of new residential skyscrapers, two super-hospitals (the Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal and McGill University Health Centre), the creation of the <b>Quartier</b> des Spectacles, reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange, reconfiguration of the Decarie and Dorval interchanges, construction of the new Réseau électrique métropolitain, gentrification of Griffintown, subway line extensions and the purchase of new subway cars, the complete revitalization and expansion of Trudeau International Airport, the completion of Quebec Autoroute 30, the reconstruction of the Champlain Bridge, and {{the construction of a new}} toll bridge to Laval are helping Montreal continue to grow.|$|E

25|$|The {{corner of}} Saint Lawrence and Saint Catherine streets is still {{known as a}} red-light district, {{although}} its days appear numbered as a proposed $167-million development is slated to transform the area, {{now part of the}} city's new <b>Quartier</b> des Spectacles. In 2007 and 2008, a section of the street between Sherbrooke street and Mont-Royal avenue underwent extensive construction work, which forced some businesses to close.|$|E
25|$|The {{friends are}} {{interrupted}} by Benoît, the landlord, who arrives {{to collect the}} rent. They flatter him and ply him with wine. In his drunkenness, he begins to boast of his amorous adventures, but when he also reveals that he is married, they thrust him from the room—without the rent payment—in comic moral indignation. The rent money is divided for their evening out in the <b>Quartier</b> Latin.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} was founded as a satellite {{campus of the}} Université Laval in 1878.

25|$|Born at Cahors, Gambetta {{is said to}} have {{inherited}} his vigour and eloquence from his father, a Genoese grocer who had married a Frenchwoman named Massabie. At the age of fifteen, Gambetta lost the sight of his right eye in an accident, and it eventually had to be removed. Despite this handicap, he distinguished himself at school in Cahors, and in 1857 went to Paris to study law. His temperament gave him great influence among the students of the <b>Quartier</b> latin, and he was soon known as an inveterate enemy of the imperial government.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May 1940 Germany {{invaded the}} Low Countries, {{overrunning}} Luxembourg within hours and the Netherlands within a week. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and French First Army advanced into Flanders to reinforce Belgian forces, and each sent a liaison mission to coordinate with the Belgian Grand <b>Quartier</b> Général ("High Command"). The British mission {{was named after}} its leader, the staff officer Major-General Henry Needham. Abukir was also sent to Belgium, where she arrived later in May at the Port of Ostend and unloaded a cargo of Army stores for the BEF.|$|E
25|$|In May and September 1654, Courish and Dutch colonies were {{reestablished}} successfully. The Courish {{colony of}} Neu-Kurland ("New Courland") was centered at Fort Jacob on Great Courland Bay. The Dutch colony {{on the other}} side of the island had three forts: Lampsinsberg, Beveren, and Bellavista. In 1658, 500 Frenchmen joined the Dutch colony but formed their own settlement called Three Rivers (Le <b>Quartier</b> des trois Rivières). On 11 December 1659, the Courlanders peaceably surrendered their colony to the Dutch. At the time, the island held about 1,500 Europeans and around 7,000 African slaves working on 120 plantations, supporting six or seven sugar mills and two rum distilleries.|$|E
25|$|Before {{becoming}} {{a member of}} Parliament, Duceppe worked as a hospital orderly and later became a trade union negotiator.

25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon <b>Quartier</b> (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help but notice the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges {{sat at a table}} in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks before the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E
25|$|Under Napoleon III, Baron Haussmann {{demolished}} the poorest, most {{crowded and}} historical {{neighborhoods in the}} center of the city to make room for the new boulevards and squares. The working-class Parisians moved out of the center toward the edges of the city, particularly to Belleville and Ménilmontant in the east; to Clignancourt and the <b>Quartier</b> des Grandes-Carrières to the north; and on the Left Bank to the area around the Gare d'Austerlitz, Javel and Grenelle, usually to neighborhoods that were close to their places of work. Small quarters of working-class Parisians still remained {{in the center of}} the city, mainly on the sides of the Montagne Sainte-Geneviève in the Latin Quarter near the Sorbonne and the Jardin des Plantes, and along the covered Bièvre River, where the tanneries had been located for centuries.|$|E
25|$|A strong {{historical}} emigration {{has created}} a Breton diaspora within the French borders and in the overseas departments and territories of France; it is mainly established in the Paris area, where {{more than one million}} people claim Breton heritage. Many Breton families have also emigrated to the Americas, predominantly to Canada (mostly Quebec and Atlantic Canada) and the United States. People from the region of Brittany were among the first white settlers to permanently settle the French West Indies, i.e. Dominica, Guadeloupe and Martinique, where remnants of their culture can still be seen to this day. The only places outside Brittany that still retain significant Breton customs are in Île-de-France (mainly Le <b>Quartier</b> du Montparnasse in Paris), Le Havre and in Îles des Saintes, where a group of Breton families settled in the mid-17th century.|$|E
25|$|By late 1939, the Belgians had {{improved}} their defences along the Albert Canal {{and increased the}} readiness of the army; Gamelin and Grand <b>Quartier</b> Général (GQG) began {{to consider the possibility}} of advancing further than the Escaut. By November, GQG had decided that a defence along the Dyle Line was feasible, despite the doubts of General Alphonse Georges, commander of the North-Eastern Front about reaching the Dyle before the Germans. The British had been lukewarm about an advance into Belgium but Gamelin talked them round and on 9 November, the Dyle Plan was adopted. On 17 November, a session of the Supreme War Council deemed it essential to occupy the Dyle Line and Gamelin issued a directive that day detailing a line from Givet to Namur, the Gembloux Gap, Wavre, Louvain and Antwerp. For the next four months, the Dutch and Belgian armies laboured over their defences, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) expanded and the French army received more equipment and training. Gamelin also considered a move towards Breda in the Netherlands; if the Allies prevented a German occupation of Holland, the ten divisions of the Dutch army would join the Allied armies, control of the North Sea would be enhanced and the Germans denied bases for attacks on Britain.|$|E
