40|$|Abstract –Today {{flavoured}} milks {{have become}} very popular as they contain nutrients compared to soft drinks. Coffee {{is the second most}} important product in the international market in terms of volume trade and the most important in terms of value. Multiple linear regression (MLR) model was developed to predict the shelf life of roasted coffee <b>sterilized</b> <b>milk</b> drink. Colour and appearance, flavour, viscosity and sediment were taken as independent variables, and overall acceptability as dependent variable. MSE, RMSE, R 2 and E 2 were used in order to compare the prediction potential of the developed model.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effect of the sterilization process and the age of the medium at the time of inoculation on the development of Clostridium botulinum type 62 A. Whole milk was autoclaved at 121 C for 18 or 30 min and inoculated with C. botulinum so as to contain 2, 000 to 5, 000 spores per milliliter. No effort was made to remove dissolved oxygen or to reduce the oxidation-reduction (O/R) potential of the medium by adding sodium thioglycolate. A 3 - and a 5 -day-old medium were used to study the influence of aging. Eh determinations were made periodically on inoculated and uninoculated samples. Culture development was followed by use of an oval tube counting procedure. The technique used to <b>sterilize</b> the <b>milk</b> influenced the initial O/R potential as well as the autoreductive capacity of the medium. The initial Eh of whole <b>milk</b> <b>sterilized</b> in 500 -ml volumes for 18 min was 234 mv. In <b>milk</b> <b>sterilized</b> for 30 min it was 192 mv. The lag phase was 7 days in the former and 5 days in the latter. The exponential growth phases were similar. Autoreduction occurred in <b>sterilized</b> <b>milk.</b> The Eh of uninoculated <b>milk</b> <b>sterilized</b> for 18 min decreased 45 mv in 6 days. In <b>milk</b> <b>sterilized</b> for 30 min the decrease was 63 mv. In milk inoculated 3 or 5 days after sterilization the lag phase was shorter than when the medium was inoculated within 2 hr after autoclaving, regardless of the sterilization procedure employed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Stale flavor {{development}} has been recognized as a defect of stored dry milk powders for several years. Recently, stale flavor {{development has}} been found to occur upon storage of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk,</b> and is recognized as the principal limiting factor to commercial utilization of this process (Seibert, 1963). Some {{attempts have been made to}} identify the volatile flavor components of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> (Patel et al, 1963; Bingham, 1964). The flavor components responsible for the stale flavor defect as it occurs in <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> have not been identified, however. The purpose of this work was to identify the compounds responsible for the stale flavor defect of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk.</b> It was felt that this information was essential to an understanding of the staling phenomenon, which in turn might eventually lead to correction of the defect. Commercial samples of <b>sterilized</b> concentrated <b>milk</b> were obtained. Stale flavor development was hastened in some of the samples by storing them at 21 °C. Subjective flavor panel evaluation of stored and fresh samples revealed significant differences between the two. Gas chromatographic analysis of the volatile head space components by the procedure described by Morgan and Day (1965) revealed only minor differences between the fresh and stale samples. It was reasoned, therefore, that the compounds responsible for the stale flavor defect were primarily of a less volatile nature, A technique for isolating the higher-boiling flavor components was developed. This technique consisted of lyophilization of the sterile concentrated milk, uniform wetting of the lyophilized milk with water to 10...|$|R

40|$|Thirty-eight {{strains of}} Bacillus sporothermodurans {{isolated}} from ultra-high-temperature (UHT) -treated <b>milk</b> or <b>sterilized</b> <b>milk</b> (UHT isolates) and from animal feed or raw milk (farm isolates) {{were characterized by}} automated ribotyping and by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) -PCR fingerprinting. By investigating the genetic relationships among isolates from these various sources, {{the relative importance of}} different contamination sources could be evaluated. The results of the separate clustering analyses of the PvuII and EcoRI ribopatterns and the REP-PCR patterns were largely consistent with each other and revealed the existence of two main clusters; there was one homogeneous group containing all (REP-PCR) or most (ribotyping) of the UHT isolates, and there was a second more diverse group comprising the farm isolates. A combined three-dimensional analysis of all data showed that three German UHT isolates did not belong to the compact group containing the majority of the UHT isolates. These results demonstrate that B. sporothermodurans is more heterogeneous than previously assumed and that most of the UHT isolates form a genetically distinct subgroup and are capable of producing highly heat-resistant spores. The close genetic relationship of these UHT isolates suggests a clonal origin of a few predominant strains of B. sporothermodurans that can be found in UHT-treated or <b>sterilized</b> <b>milk</b> products...|$|R

Besides, even small changes caused by presence of spoilage microorganisms lead to decreased quality of milk and various dairy products. Despite of the importance for the overall quality, the control of spoilage microorganisms for dairy industry is not obligated and therefore, only a few producers control them.

Materials and Methods: Commercial milk samples of 187, including 154 pasteurized and 33 <b>sterilized,</b> <b>milk</b> samples were collected from the market between early January 2012 and late July of the same year. The presence of antibiotic residues was detected using the microbiological detection test kit, Eclipse 100, as a semi-quantitative method. Results: The results showed that 37 of the samples (19. 8 %) have contained antibiotic residues above the European Union Maximum Residues Limits (EU-MRLs), of which 28 samples (14. 97 %) {{were found to be}} contaminated but at the concentrations below the EU-MRLs.

40|$|Background: Aflatoxins are severe toxic {{secondary}} metabolites {{found in}} most plant products. When animals consume contaminated feed stuff to Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1), the toxin is metabolized by liver and is excreted as Aflatoxin M 1 (AFM 1) via milk. Aflatoxins are acute toxic compounds, immunosuppressive, mutagen, tratogen and carcinogen. "nMethods: During the winter of 2006, pasteurized and sterilized (ultra high temperature) (UHT) milk packages were collected from supermarkets in Babol city. 78 pasteurized and 33 <b>sterilized</b> <b>milk,</b> totally 111 samples were tested for AFM 1 by competitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Solid phase in plastic micro wells coated whit anti-Aflatoxin M 1 antibodies. We added 100 microliter skimmed milk and Aflatoxin M 1 standard solutions in each well. In each plate, we appointed seven wells for standards. Plates were incubated at 20 - 25  centigrade for 45 min. Each well was washed four times by washing buffer 20 X concentration. Then 100 micro liter conjugated solution (100 X) was added to each well, and the plate was incubated at 20 - 25 centigrade for 15 min. After that, the wells were washed. After adding the substrates to wells, we incubated the plate at 20 - 25  centigrade in a dark place for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by stop solution. After one hour, light absorption was read at 450 nm by ELISA reader. "nResults: AFM 1 were detected in 100 % of all samples. 100 % of samples were above of European community regulations (50 ng/l).
