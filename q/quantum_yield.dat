Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and enamels because they easily wet them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the <b>quantum</b> <b>yield</b> of caesium cathodes. Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300°C produces a permanent magnet and magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the 10–100kHz range and in magnetic memory devices.|$|E

Therefore, photoinhibition occurs at all light intensities and the rate constant of photoinhibition is directly proportional to light intensity. Some measurements suggest that dim light causes damage more efficiently than strong light.|$|E
25|$|A {{new class}} of {{fluorescent}} protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M−1 cm−1) and has a modest <b>quantum</b> <b>yield</b> (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and ~2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties {{are similar to the}} organic dye Cy5.|$|E

25|$|The {{generation}} of CIDNP {{in a typical}} photochemical system (target + photosensitizer, flavin in this example) is a cyclic photochemical process shown schematically in Figure 1. The chain of reactions is initiated by a blue light photon, which excites the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) photosensitizer to the singlet excited state. The fluorescence <b>quantum</b> <b>yield</b> of this state is rather low, and {{approximately half of the}} molecules undergo intersystem crossing into the long-lived triplet state. Triplet FMN has a remarkable electron affinity. If a molecule with a low ionization potential (e.g. phenols, polyaromatics) is present in the system, the diffusion-limited electron transfer reaction forms a spin-correlated triplet electron transfer state – a radical pair. The actual kinetics are rather complicated and may involve multiple (de)protonations and hence exhibit pH dependence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The photophysical and {{photochemical}} measurements {{have been}} made on 3 series of novel alpha octa(alkyl-substituted) phthalocyanines.

It is well documented that the phthalocyanine molecule possesses several distinct properties, including absorption in the red, low fluorescence and high triplet <b>quantum</b> <b>yields</b> that make it an ideal candidate as a potential photosensitiser in photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy is an alternative treatment to cancer using a photosensitiser, which is preferentially absorbed by malignant cells and remains dormant until activated by red light. This results in the formation of singlet delta oxygen via the excited state of the photosensitiser. The generation of singlet oxygen leads to cell death.
