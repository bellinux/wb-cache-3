40|$|International audienceFor general quantum systems the semiclassical {{behaviour}} of eigenfunctions {{in relation}} to the ergodic properties of the underlying classical system is quite difficult to understand. The Wignerfunctions of eigenstates converge weakly to invariant measures of the classical system, the so called <b>quantum</b> <b>limits,</b> and one would like to understand which invariant measures can occur that way, thereby classifying the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions. We introduce a class of maps on the torus for whose quantisations we can understand the set of <b>quantum</b> <b>limits</b> in great detail. In particular we can construct examples of ergodic maps which have singular ergodic measures as <b>quantum</b> <b>limits,</b> and examples of non-ergodic maps where arbitrary convex combinations of absolutely continuous ergodic measures can occur as <b>quantum</b> <b>limits.</b> The maps we quantise are obtained by cutting and stacking...|$|R

Our primary concern was the non-destructive testing (NDT) of Aluminum (Al) for hidden corrosion by detection of Aluminum Hydroxide (AI(OH) 3).

The parameters for using both have been evaluated. The largest limitations of counting circuits for practical applications are the high cost of fast frame rate CCDs and the high cost of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) boards required to process the information.
