5|$|After Britain {{declared}} war on Germany in September 1939, Auden told the British embassy in Washington that {{he would return to}} the UK if needed. He was told that, among those his age (32), only <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel</b> were needed. In 1941–42 he taught English at the University of Michigan. He was called for the draft in the United States Army in August 1942, but was rejected on medical grounds. He had been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for 1942–43 but did not use it, choosing instead to teach at Swarthmore College in 1942–45.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel</b> on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (rutherfordium) which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The Khmer Rouge leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer Rouge and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer Rouge at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel,</b> as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer Rouge regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E

25|$|Arguably {{the mission}} to Cambodia {{represented}} {{a significant change in}} Australian thinking towards peacekeeping, and its level of commitment. Previously, although a frequent contributor to UN operations, Australia had contributed small numbers of individual personnel to fill technical positions (e.g. signals, engineers or medical personnel) or as observers, however in Cambodia the ADF deployed a significant sized force, albeit again providing higher level technically <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel</b> and support staff, rather than combat troops. This approach however, placed significant strain on the ADF, with the mission denuding it of the bulk of its communications specialists. Subsequently Australia became increasingly involved in UN peacekeeping operations throughout the mid-1990s, deploying significant forces—including combat troops—to Somalia and Rwanda, and later still to East Timor.|$|E
25|$|For the {{development}} of its water infrastructure, Jordan needed to build strong organizations with <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel.</b> For that purpose, two laws were passed in 1959 to create respectively the East Ghor Canal Authority responsible for {{the development}} of irrigation infrastructure, and the Central Water Authority responsible for {{the development of}} drinking water supply infrastructure. These institutions operated outside of government routine and offered better pay than the regular public service in order to attract the motivated and talented employees required for the important task to develop the country’s water sector. These efforts, however, were thwarted when Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel, and with it about a third of its population, in the Six-Day War of 1967, and during an ensuing period of internal disorder and violence known as the Black September that lasted until 1971.|$|E

During the Second World War members of the 1st Parachute Battalion also wore the dull cherry beret, which they adopted from airborne units of the British Army. A range of cloth parachute badges were also worn by trained parachutists, including those of the 1st Parachute Battalion and its supporting arms (artillery and engineers), as well as the Services Reconnaissance Department (Z Special Unit) and the 1st Australian Parachute Training Depot (Army Wing).|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the school year 1918–19, Slovakia had 3,642 elementary schools. Only 141 schools taught in the Slovak language, 186 in Slovak and Hungarian and 3,298 in Hungarian. This large deformation was a direct result of previous magyarization activities of the Hungarian government. After system reform, Czechoslovakia provided an educational network for the Hungarian minority which was several times larger than the Kingdom of Hungary had for the whole Slovak nation before 1918. Due to the lack of <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel</b> among Slovaks – a lack of schools above elementary level, banned grammar schools and no Slovak teacher institutes – Hungarian teachers were replaced in large numbers by Czechs. Some Hungarian teachers resolved their existential question by moving to Hungary. According to government regulation from 28 August 1919, Hungarian teachers were permitted to teach only if they took an oath of allegiance to Czechoslovakia.|$|E
25|$|Factors such {{as nature}} {{of work and}} lack of {{influence}} within their jobs leads some theorists {{to the conclusion that}} most Americans are working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs. Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating a high degree of scarcity for <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel.</b> The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment. In 2009, Dental assistants made roughly $14.40 an hour, about $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients. They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists' instructions. Here we see that a dental assistant being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.|$|E

500|$|In May 1945, as German {{forces were}} ousted from Norway, the airport {{was taken over}} by the Allies and the Royal Norwegian Air Force.

In addition to previous lines, a route was started to Northern Norway, although it had to be terminated for the winter. Due to the lack of <b>qualified</b> <b>personnel,</b> the international services had to be terminated as well. In early 1946, management of the airport was transferred back to the municipality.
