Will Durant, Fielding H.

40|$|Abstract Background Several <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> for benefit-harm {{assessment}} {{of health care}} interventions exist but {{it is unclear how}} the approaches differ. Our aim was to review existing <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> for benefit-harm assessment and to develop an organizing framework that clarifies differences and aids selection of <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> for a particular benefit-harm assessment. Methods We performed {{a review of the literature}} to identify <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> for benefit-harm assessment. Our team, consisting of clinicians, epidemiologists, and statisticians, discussed the approaches and identified their key characteristics. We developed a framework that helps investigators select <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> for benefit-harm assessment that are appropriate for a particular decisionmaking context. Results Our framework for selecting <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> requires a concise definition of the treatment comparison and population of interest, identification of key benefit and harm outcomes, and determination of the need for a measure that puts all outcomes on a single scale (which we call a benefit and harm comparison metric). We identified 16 <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> for benefit-harm assessment. These approaches can be categorized into those that consider single or multiple key benefit and harm outcomes, and those that use a benefit-harm comparison metric or not. Most approaches use aggregate data and can be used in the context of single studies or systematic reviews. Although the majority of approaches provides a benefit and harm comparison metric, only four approaches provide measures of uncertainty around the benefit and harm comparison metric (such as a 95 percent confidence interval). None of the approaches considers the actual joint distribution of benefit and harm outcomes, but one approach considers competing risks when calculating profile-specific event rates. Nine approaches explicitly allow incorporating patient preferences. Conclusion The choice of <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> depends on the specific question and goal of the benefit-harm assessment as well as on the nature and availability of data. In some situations, investigators may identify only one appropriate approach. In situations where the question and available data justify more than one approach, investigators may want to use multiple approaches and compare the consistency of results. When more evidence on relative advantages of approaches accumulates from such comparisons, it will be possible to make more specific recommendations on the choice of approaches. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSince the {{emergence}} of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), many {{studies have focused on}} the integration of uncertainties. Nevertheless, Data Quality Assessment (DQA) and statistical approaches are not yet widely used to quantify uncertainty, and when used, methodologies are neither uniform nor rigorous. Moreover, the data required to propagate and estimate the overall uncertainty are often lacking. Finally, the quantification of uncertainty could introduce more confusion in decision-making. In this context, we propose joint implementation of both the qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> to estimate uncertainties when performing Life Cycle Assessment of complex systems. Using an existing LCA on grocery bags, this study first attempts to demonstrate the usefulness of both the qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> to deal with uncertainty. Secondly, given that data collection is very time-consuming, the usefulness of both the qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> will be discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{discussion}} of qualitative or <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> {{has been going}} on for many years. One way to reduce the most dogmatic standings is to use mixed methods consisting of combinations of qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches.</b> In this paper, we have analysed usage experiences from combining qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>approaches</b> in different ways. We refer to these combinations as method configurations. Our findings point out that a researcher should commence with a qualitative approach when: 1) the researcher has a lower pre-knowledge of phenomenon to be studied, 2) the phenomenon to be studied is abstract and 3) there is an uncertainty if the questions asked are the right questions. On the contrary, there is a tendency in our results that the researcher should start with a quantitative study when 1) the researcher has a good pre-knowledge of the phenomenon or 2) the phenomenon is more concrete...|$|R
