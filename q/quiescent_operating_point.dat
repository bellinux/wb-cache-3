50|$|In a {{great many}} circuit designs, the dc bias {{is fed to a}} {{non-linear}} component via a resistor (or possibly a network of resistors). Since resistors are linear components, it is particularly easy to determine the <b>quiescent</b> <b>operating</b> <b>point</b> of the non-linear device from a graph of its transfer function. The method is as follows: from linear network analysis the output transfer function (that is output voltage against output current) is calculated for the network of resistor(s) and the generator driving them. This will be a straight line (called the load line) and can readily be superimposed on the transfer function plot of the non-linear device.
