50|$|On 17 April 2014, Deshchytsia {{negotiated}} with John Kerry, Catherine Ashton and Sergei Lavrov at a <b>quadrilateral</b> <b>meeting</b> in Geneva {{in an attempt}} to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. The resulting Geneva Statement on Ukraine laid ground for de-escalating the crisis. However, Russia has repeatedly breached its commitments under the Geneva agreement, according to official statements {{of the leaders of the}} EU and the United States. One week after the joint Geneva Statement, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry accused Russia of failing to adhere to Geneva commitments by orchestrating armed resistance in eastern Ukraine. U.S. President Barack Obama stated that Vladimir Putin has 'not lifted a finger' to ease tensions. President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy acknowledged that Russia has not lived up to its Geneva commitments.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 April, Ukraine, the United States, Russia and the European Union {{agreed to}} hold a 17 April <b>quadrilateral</b> <b>meeting</b> in Geneva to try to {{negotiate}} {{an end to the}} crisis in Ukraine. The meeting produced a document, called the Geneva Statement on Ukraine, which stated that all sides agreed that steps should be taken to [...] "de-escalate" [...] the crisis. All four parties agreed that all [...] "illegal military formations in Ukraine" [...] must be dissolved, and that everyone occupying buildings must be disarmed and leave but that there would be an amnesty for all anti-government protesters under the agreement. These steps will be overseen by monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). The sides also agreed that the Constitution of Ukraine is also to be revised in a process that is [...] "inclusive, transparent and accountable". The agreement put on hold additional economic sanctions against Russia by the United States and the European Union.|$|E
50|$|At BÃ¼rgenstock, the Turkish side wanted <b>quadrilateral</b> <b>meetings</b> (the two Cypriot {{delegations}} plus Greece and Turkey), but the Greek Cypriots objected {{that this}} had been discussed and rejected at the New York meetings. The role of the Greek and Turkish representatives {{was not supposed to}} include participating directly in the negotiations.|$|R
40|$|The superconvergent patch {{recovery}} (SPR) with bilinear interpolation functions usually gives good {{values of}} recovered stresses in an element patch. However, when 4 -node <b>quadrilateral</b> elements <b>meeting</b> at a node are rigidly rotated with the essential and natural boundary conditions unchanged, the recovered stresses {{obtained by the}} SPR change and depend upon the local rotation of the patch. This can be remedied either by including higher-order terms in the polynomials for the assumed stress distribution in an element patch, or by using linear interpolation functions, which gives inferior accuracy of the recovered stresses near {{the boundaries of the}} domain. Additional sampling points are suggested to compute the higher-order terms...|$|R
