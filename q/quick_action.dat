5|$|After Maine and Missouri entered service, {{they were}} {{assigned}} to the North Atlantic Fleet, while Ohio, built on the West Coast of the United States, was instead sent to serve as the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet based in the Philippines. In April 1904, a turret fire killed 36 men aboard Missouri, but the <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> of three men prevented the fire from reaching the magazines and destroying the ship, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1907, Ohio returned from the western Pacific and joined her sisters in what was now the Atlantic Fleet. During this period, Maine served as the flagship of the Atlantic Fleet until she was relieved in April 1907.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused {{an offer}} of help from the CNT and UGT, proclaiming that nowhere outside Spanish Morocco had joined the rebels and that the populace should trust legal methods {{to deal with the}} uprising. Handing out weapons would be illegal. The CNT and UGT proclaimed a general strike, in effect mobilising. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings. The {{paramilitary}} forces, better trained than the army, often waited to see the outcome of militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. <b>Quick</b> <b>action</b> by either the rebels or anarchist militias was often enough to decide the fate of a town. General Queipo de Llano managed to secure Seville for the rebels, arresting a number of other officers.|$|E

5|$|Two {{shipboard}} accidents {{occurred during}} Tritons post-launch fitting-out. On 2 October 1958, {{prior to the}} nuclear reactor fuel being installed, a steam valve failed during testing, causing a large cloud of steam that filled the number two reactor compartment, and on 7 April 1959, a fire broke out during the testing of a deep-fat fryer and spread from the galley into the ventilation lines of the crew's mess. Both incidents, neither nuclear related, were quickly handled by ship personnel, with Lt. Commander Leslie B. Kelly, the prospective chief engineering officer, being awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> during the incident on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Villiers, {{his case}} {{was not to}} be prosecuted with the utmost rigour. He was to some degree {{protected}} by the joint efforts of Boringdon's friends and the Whig George Tierney, as well as his own <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> in surrendering his property through writs of extent; and the delinquency of Joseph Hunt, Treasurer of the Ordnance attracted attention and saved Villiers from the full wrath of the finance committee. Their report on the matter noted that the writ of extent had been to the amount of £264,000, but only £91,000 had been raised from the sale of his property, and about £30,000 from securities and the bond posted for him when he took office. The committee recommended the abolition of the office of Paymaster of Marines and the transfer of its duties to the Treasurer of the Navy, a recommendation which was not immediately acted upon. Villiers was left, in Boringdon's estimation, with a debt of £1,500–2,000, an annual income of £2,000–3,000, and the property in Cranbourne Lodge.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company on 7 February 1900, the third member of the class to be begun. She was {{launched}} on 28 December 1901 and commissioned into the fleet on 1 December 1903. The ship {{was assigned to the}} North Atlantic Fleet after entering service. She steamed out of Norfolk to begin her sea trials off the Virginia Capes on 4 February 1904 before joining the rest of the fleet in the Caribbean for training exercises. On 13 April, the ship suffered an accident during gunnery training; the port 12-inch gun in her rear turret flared backward on firing and ignited three propellant charges in the turret. The resulting fire suffocated 36men in the turret, though <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> among surviving members of the turret crew prevented the fire from spreading to the magazines, where it would have destroyed the ship. For their actions, three men were awarded the Medal of Honor. Missouri returned to Newport News for repairs, which were completed by early June.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosion}} killed 159 men, {{and destroyed}} {{both of the}} rear turrets. The fire was prevented from spreading to the shell magazines, which could have destroyed the ship, by the <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> of the executive officer, who ordered both magazines be flooded. The Pumpenmeister Wilhelm Heidkamp was severely injured when he turned the red-hot valves to flood the magazines. At 11:01, Seydlitz struck back at Lion, and with a single 28cm shell, knocked out two of Lions engines. Shortly thereafter, a pair of 30.5cm shells fired by Derfflinger struck Lion, one at the waterline. The penetration allowed water to enter the port feed tank—this hit eventually crippled Lion, the sea water contamination forced the ship's crew {{to shut down the}} port engine. At 11:25, Seydlitz was struck on her armored belt amidships by a third and final shell, which did little damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, Pakistani {{officials}} set up 26 relief camps where residents were offered food and shelter. Roughly 3,000 people sought refuge in these shelters. Mobile units were also set up by the District Health Department to minimize the impacts of any post-storm diseases. On October3, Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh expressed his grief over the damage caused by Cyclonic Storm Onil and stated that he would be touring the affected region within the following days. At least 40million Pakistani rupee ($469,000USD) was allocated in relief funds by Sindh Minister Syed Papoo Shah. On October4, port officials stated that it was safe for fishermen to resume their activities in the Arabian Sea. Later that day, a rain emergency was declared for Hyderabad and emergency shelters were set up in the city. All officers in the Hyderabad Development Authority who were initially put on leave ahead of the cyclone were told to resume work to assist in clearing drainage systems. Several days after the storm, reports indicated that there were more than 300 instances where the city's drainage system collapsed across the area, resulting in standing water in many structures. Residents in these areas, frustrated by the lack of <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> by the government, began holding protests about the flooding. In response to these protests, Shaukat Hayat Bhutto suspended Assistant Engineer Sewage manager, Qamar Memon, for his negligence on draining flood waters.|$|E
5|$|The revolt in East Anglia was {{independently}} {{suppressed by}} Henry le Despenser, the Bishop of Norwich. Henry was in Stamford in Lincolnshire when the revolt broke out, {{and when he}} found out about it he marched south with eight men-at-arms and a small force of archers, gathering more forces as he went. He marched first to Peterborough, where he routed the local rebels and executed any he could capture, including some who had taken shelter in the local abbey. He then headed south-east via Huntingdon and Ely, reached Cambridge on 19 June, and then headed further into the rebel-controlled areas of Norfolk. Henry reclaimed Norwich on 24 June, before heading out with a company of men to track down the rebel leader, Geoffrey Litster. The two forces met at the Battle of North Walsham on 25 or 26 June; the Bishop's forces triumphed and Litster was captured and executed. Henry's <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> was essential to the suppression of the revolt in East Anglia, but he was very unusual in taking matters into his own hands in this way, and his execution of the rebels without royal sanction was illegal.|$|E

5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E

The <b>quick</b> <b>action</b> of Nicholas's cousin, Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who parried the second blow with his cane, saved his life.
