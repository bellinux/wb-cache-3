25|$|Anecdotal {{claims for}} an {{antimicrobial}} effect {{are based on}} abstract scientific experiments which show some antimicrobial activity in commercial grapefruit seed extracts and ethanol grapefruit seed extract but not natural GSE. The preliminary studies for the antimicrobial effect state that the Citricidal commercial brand of GSE was used for testing. There is considerable scientific evidence that the anti-microbial activity associated with grapefruit seed extract {{can be attributed to}} the contamination or adulteration of commercial GSE preparations with synthetic antimicrobials or preservatives. According to a 2001 study, branded commercial GSE preparations were contaminated with synthetic benzethonium chloride that was unlikely to have been made from grapefruit seeds. Some of the marketers claimed that their product did not contain benzethonium chloride and the error was due to the similarity in molecular weight of the <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>compound</b> which was formed through a proprietary manufacturing process. It is highly improbable that the preservative benzethonium chloride is formed during any extraction and/or processing of grapefruit seeds and pulp. Researchers conclusively demonstrated the presence of benzethonium chloride in commercial GSE using various analytical methods including HPLC, one- and two-dimensional NMR, PIXE analysis, and electrospray ionization MS. Another in vitro study claimed GSE had antibacterial properties. As with the branded in vitro test this extract was contaminated. The ethanolic grapefruit seed and pulp extract tested was prepared or contaminated with ethanol, a chemical solvent used in the extraction process. Ethanol, also known as ethyl alcohol, is effective in inhibiting bacteria.|$|E

[...] Many other quaternary ammonium compounds are known to have antimicrobial properties (e.g. alkyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride and didecyldimethylammonium chloride). [...] These last two are membrane active compounds; against S. aureus the first forms a single monolayer coverage of the S. aureus cells on the outer membrane, while the second forms a double monolayer. This leads to cell leakage and total release of the intracellular potassium and 260nm-absorbing pools in this order.|$|E

2500|$|Carnitine (β-hydroxy-γ-N-trimethylaminobutyric acid, 3-hydroxy-4-N,N,N- trimethylaminobutyrate) is a <b>quaternary</b> <b>ammonium</b> <b>compound</b> {{involved}} in metabolism in most mammals, plants and some bacteria. Carnitine may exist in two isomers, labeled D-carnitine and L-carnitine, {{as they are}} optically active. [...] At room temperature, pure carnitine is a white powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with low toxicity. [...] Carnitine only exists in animals as the L-enantiomer, and D-carnitine is toxic because it inhibits the activity of L-carnitine. [...] Carnitine was discovered in 1905 {{as a result of}} its high concentration in muscle tissue. It was originally labeled vitamin BT; however, because carnitine is synthesized in the human body, it is no longer considered a vitamin. [...] Carnitine can be synthesized by most humans; about 1 in 350 males is unable to synthesize it due to genetic causes on the X chromosome. Carnitine is {{involved in}} the oxidation of fatty acids, and involved in systemic primary carnitine deficiency.
