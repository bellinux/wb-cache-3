40|$|We study a {{regression}} characterization for the <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> of weak lensing, developed by Hu and Okamoto (2001, 2002), for {{cosmic microwave background}} observations. This characterization motivates a modification of the <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> by an adaptive Wiener filter which uses the robust Bayesian techniques described in Strawderman (1971) and Berger (1980). This technique requires the user to propose a fiducial model for the spectral density of the unknown lensing potential but the resulting estimator is developed to be robust to misspecification of this model. The role of the fiducial spectral density {{is to give the}} estimator superior statistical performance in a "neighborhood of the fiducial model" while controlling the statistical errors when the fiducial spectral density is drastically wrong. Our estimate also highlights some advantages provided by a Bayesian analysis of the <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator...</b>|$|E
40|$|We propose an {{estimator}} {{defined in}} real {{space for the}} reconstruction of the weak lensing potential due to the intervening large scale structure from high resolution maps of the cosmic microwave background. This estimator was motivated {{as an alternative to the}} <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> in harmonic space to surpass the difficulties of the analysis of maps containing galactic cuts and point source excisions. Using maps synthesised by pixel remapping, we implement the estimator for two experiments, namely one in the absence and one in the presence of detector noise, and compare {{the reconstruction of the}} convergence field with that obtained with the <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> defined in harmonic space. We find good agreement between the input and the reconstructed power spectra using the proposed real space estimator. We discuss interesting features of the real space estimator and future extensions of this work. Comment: 25 pages, 8 figures. Accepted for publication in PR...|$|E

40|$|We develop {{two methods}} for {{estimating}} the power spectrum, C_l, {{of the cosmic}} microwave background (CMB) from data and apply them to the COBE/DMR and Saskatoon datasets. One method involves a direct evaluation of the likelihood function, and the other is an estimator that is a minimum-variance weighted quadratic function of the data. Applied iteratively, the <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> is not distinct from likelihood analysis, but is rather a rapid means of finding the power spectrum that maximizes the likelihood function. Our results bear this out: direct evaluation and quadratic estimation converge to the same C_ls. The <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> {{can also be used to}} directly determine cosmological parameters and their uncertainties. While the two methods both require O(N^ 3) operations, the quadratic is much faster, and both are applicable to datasets with arbitrary chopping patterns and noise correlations.

40|$|Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing is a {{powerful}} probe of the matter distribution in the Universe. The standard <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator,</b> which is typically {{used to measure the}} lensing signal, is known to be suboptimal for low-noise polarization data from next-generation experiments. In this paper we explain why the <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> will also be suboptimal for measuring lensing on very small scales, even for measurements in temperature where this estimator typically performs well. Though maximum likelihood methods could be implemented to improve performance, we explore a much simpler solution, revisiting a previously proposed method to measure lensing which involves a direct inversion of the background gradient. An important application of this simple formalism is the measurement of cluster masses with CMB lensing. We find that directly applying a gradient inversion matched filter to simulated lensed images of the CMB can tighten constraints on cluster masses compared to the <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator.</b> While the difference is not relevant for existing surveys, for future surveys it can translate to significant improvements in mass calibration for distant clusters, where galaxy lensing calibration is ineffective {{due to the lack of}} enough resolved background galaxies. Improvements can be as large as ∼ 50 % for a cluster at z = 2 and a next-generation CMB experiment with 1 μK-arcmin noise, and over an order of magnitude for lower noise levels. For future surveys, this simple matched-filter or gradient inversion method approaches the performance of maximum likelihood methods, at a fraction of the computational cost.

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in high sensitivity Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization experiments {{opens up a}} window on large scale structure (LSS), as CMB polarization fluctuations on small angular scales can arise {{from a combination of}} LSS and ionization fluctuations in the late universe. Gravitational lensing effects can be extracted from CMB datasets with <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimators</b> but reconstructions of electron density fluctuations (EDFs) with <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimators</b> are found to be significantly biased by the much larger lensing effects in the secondary CMB fluctuations. In this paper we establish a bispectrum formalism using tracers of LSS to extract the subdominant EDFs from CMB polarization data. We find that this bispectrum can effectively reconstruct angular band-powers of cross correlation between EDFs and LSS tracers. Next generation CMB polarization experiments in conjunction with galaxy surveys and cosmic infrared background experiments can detect signatures of EDFs with high significance.

Recently the minimum variance <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> has been derived using this mode-coupling signal, {{and found that the}} optical depth fluctuations could be detected with (S/N) ^ 2 ~ 100 in futuristic experiments like CMBPol. We first demonstrate that the non-Gaussian signal from gravitational lensing of CMB is the dominant source of contamination for reconstructing inhomogeneous reionization signals, even with 98 % of its contribution removed by delensing. We then construct unbiased estimators that simultaneously reconstruct inhomogeneous reionization signals tau(n) and gravitational lensing potential phi(n). We apply our new unbiased estimators to future CMB experiment to assess the detectability of inhomogeneous reionization signals. With more physically motivated simulations of inhomogenuous reionizations that predict an order of magnitude smaller optical depth power spectrum than previous studies, we show that a CMBPol-like experiment could achieve a marginal detection of inhomogeneous reionization,(S/N) ^ 2 ~ O(1) with this <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> to ~O(10) with the analogous maximum likelihood estimator.

40|$|An {{unbalanced}} mixed {{linear model}} with two variance components is considered, one variance component (say [sigma] 12 >= 0) corresponding to a random effect (treatments) {{and a second}} variance component (say [sigma] 2 > 0) corresponding to the experimental errors. Sufficient conditions are obtained under which there will exist a nonnegative invariant <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> (IQE) having a uniformly smaller mean squared error (MSE) than every unbiased IQE of [sigma] 12. In particular, for the one-way unbalanced ANOVA model, necessary and sufficient conditions are also obtained for a multiple of the usual treatment sum of squares to uniformly dominate the ANOVA estimator of [sigma] 12. For estimating [sigma] 2, it is shown that the best multiple of the residual sum of squares can be improved by using nonquadratic estimators. One such estimator is obtained using {{the idea of a}} testimator ([13], Ann. Inst. Statist. Math. 16 155 - 160). A second estimator is obtained following the approach in [14], Ann.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the CMB lensing potential {{is based on a}} Taylor expansion of lensing effects which is known to have poor convergence properties. For lensing of temperature fluctuations, an understanding of the higher order terms in this expansion which is accurate enough for current experimental sensitivity levels has been developed in Hanson et. al. (2010), as well as a slightly modified Okamoto and Hu <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> which incorporates lensed rather than unlensed spectra into the estimator weights to mitigate the effect of higher order terms. We extend these results in several ways: (1) We generalize this analysis to the full set of quadratic temperature/polarization lensing estimators, (2) We study the effect of higher order terms for more futuristic experimental noise levels, (3) We show that the ability of the modified <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator</b> to mitigate the effect of higher order terms relies on a delicate cancellation which occurs only when the true lensed spectra are known.

40|$|Future {{experiments}} {{will produce}} high-resolution temperature {{maps of the}} cosmic microwave background (CMB) and are expected to reveal the signature of gravitational lensing by intervening large-scale structures. We construct all-sky maximum-likelihood estimators that use the lensing effect to estimate the projected density (convergence) of these structures, its power spectrum, and cross-correlation with other observables. This contrasts with earlier quadratic-estimator approaches that Taylor expanded the observed CMB temperature to linear order in the lensing deflection angle; these approaches gave estimators for the temperature-convergence correlation in terms of the CMB three-point correlation function and for the convergence power spectrum in terms of the CMB four-point correlation function, which can be biased and nonoptimal due to terms beyond the linear order. We show that for sufficiently weak lensing, the maximum-likelihood estimator reduces to the computationally less demanding <b>quadratic</b> <b>estimator.</b> The maximum likelihood and quadratic approaches are compared by evaluating the root-mean-square (rms) error and bias in the reconstructed convergence map in a numerical simulation; it is found that both the rms errors and bias are of order 1 percent for the case of Planck and of order 10 – 20 percent for a 1 arcminute beam experiment.
