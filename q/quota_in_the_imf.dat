The Fund was charged with managing various nations' trade deficits so that they would not produce currency devaluations that would trigger a decline in imports.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} whether China {{tries to}} gain more power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> staying within <b>the</b> current international U. S. -dominated system. The analysis focuses on China's behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> during <b>the</b> reform process of the last decade. The thesis examines <b>the</b> ways <b>in</b> which China can gain more power staying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF.</b> However, current power structures {{make it difficult to}} implement changes and China might therefore use political groups such as the BRICS and their New Development Bank to exert pressure. But the intention of the BRICS is not to overthrow the system but to reform it. Using official statements and speeches delivered by Chinese, U. S. or <b>IMF</b> staff <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>IMF</b> as well as articles published in newspapers Chinese claims and US reactions were analyzed. The results suggest that China stays within the international system and does not try to overthrow it. Nevertheless, pressure is created through the establishment of the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB). The intention of this thesis is to give a current account of Chinese behavior <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international community, supporting the understanding of underlying dynamics.
