25|$|It was at {{this time}} that Richard Eden joined Ferrières' service as a secretary, {{according}} to Arber because he was an 'excellent linguist'. Ferrières, Eden, and 3000 English soldiers under the command of Sir Adrian Poynings sailed from Portsmouth on 2 October, arriving at Le Havre, then called by the English Newhaven, two days later. On 11 November a warrant authorized that a pension of £300 be paid to Ferrières in <b>quarterly</b> <b>instalments.</b> By 29 July 1563 {{a large part of the}} English force at Le Havre had been slain in action or had died of the plague, forcing the surrender of the town to the French. The survivors returned to England, bringing the plague with them.|$|E
2500|$|Paget's {{income was}} drawn from the pew rents and offerings of his congregation. The rent was due in <b>quarterly</b> <b>instalments,</b> as an episcopal {{confirmation}} of 1631 makes clear: the collection dates were Christmas (25 December]], Annunciation (25 June), John the Baptist's Day (24 June) and Michaelmas (29 September). This was just after Paget left, as the clerk {{at the time was}} his successor, William Rathband. A plan, dated 1603, shows the layout and rentals of the pews, with the most expensive, nearest the front, being 8 shillings. One of the seats is assigned to Mr Paget, giving rise to the belief that Thomas Paget was minister at Blackley in 1603. The minister at that date was Oliver Carter, who served from 1598 until his death in March 1605, and Paget's university admission date makes it impossible that he was serving in Manchester in 1603: there is an unexplained discrepancy in the sources. The plan gives considerable insight into who were the key lay supporters of the Puritan preaching at Blackley, with the Travis family still featuring strongly. It seems that lay offerings and support were considerable, as the old building was completely renovated during Paget's incumbency. Sometimes Paget, like other ministers, benefited from bequests, as in 1624, when Judith Foxe left him 20 shillings in her will, as well as various sums for other ministers and more to be distributed by Bourne. Depending on this strong congregational base, the Presbyterian ministers also seem to have attempted a form of regional voluntary presbytery. Richard Hollinworth, a 17th-century Manchester Presbyterian minister, reports in his Mancuniensis that Bourne, with Paget and other ministers he approved, [...] "often mett in a kind of consultatiue classis." [...] They also took part together in preaching exercises, in which two or more sermons would be delivered at a particular chapel, with visiting preachers adding variety.|$|E

50|$|Instances of perpetuities are the {{dividends}} {{upon the}} public stocks in England, France {{and some other}} countries. Thus, although it is usual to speak of £100 consols, the reality is the yearly dividend which the government pays by <b>quarterly</b> <b>instalments.</b> The practice of the French in this is arguably more logical. In speaking of their public funds (rentes) they do not mention the ideal capital sum, but speak of the annuity or annual payment that is received by the public creditor. Other instances of perpetuities are the incomes derived from the debenture stocks of railway companies, also the feu-duties commonly payable on house property in Scotland. The number of years' purchase which the perpetual annuities granted by a government or a railway company realize in the open market, forms a very simple test of the credit of the various governments or railways.|$|E
