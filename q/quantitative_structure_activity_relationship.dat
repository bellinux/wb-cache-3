40|$|ABSTRACT A <b>Quantitative</b> <b>Structure</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Relationship</b> (QSAR) {{study has}} been {{established}} using combination of most influencing physiochemical parameters viz. thermodynamic, electronic, geometric & quantum mechanical descriptors, and H 1 -antihistaminic activity {{of a series of}} thienopyrimidines, the novel Histamine H 1 receptor antagonists. Genetic function approximation (GFA) technique was used to identify the descriptors that have influence on biological activity. Dipole, AlogP 98, Jurs and LUMO descriptors were found to influence biological activity significantly. Lipophilicity of compounds was found to have a significant role in H 1 Histaminic inhibition along with other thermodynamic, spatial and electronic descriptors. Positive contribution of Dipole, AlogP 98 descriptors suggests that molecules with lipophilic-electronic substituents are more likely to improve the potency. Developed models were found to be significant and predictive as evidenced from their internal and external cross-validation statistics.   Keywords: H 1 -receptor antagonists; thienopyrimidines; molecular descriptor; genetic function approximations; cross-validation; <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure</b> <b>activity</b> <b>relationship</b> Abbreviations: QSAR : <b>Quantitative</b> <b>structure</b> <b>activity</b> <b>relationship</b> GFA    : Genetic function approximation LOF    : Friedman’s lack of fit VIF     : Variance inflation factor  </p...|$|E

In recent years, {{a large number of}} herbal drugs are promoted in treatment of tuberculosis especially due to the emergence of MDR (multi drug resistance) and XDR (extensive drug resistance) tuberculosis. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is resistant to front-line drugs (isoniazid and rifampicin, the most powerful anti-TB drugs) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) is resistant to front-line and second-line drugs. The possibility of drug resistance TB increases when patient does not take prescribed drugs for defined time period. Natural products (secondary metabolites) isolated from the variety of sources including terrestrial and marine plants and animals, and microorganisms, have been recognized as having antituberculosis action and have recently been tested preclinically for their growth inhibitory activity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related organisms. A <b>quantitative</b> <b>structure</b> <b>activity</b> <b>relationship</b> (QSAR) studies were performed to explore the antituberculosis compound from the derivatives of natural products. Theoretical results are in accord with the in vitro experimental data with reported growth inhibitory activity towards Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related organisms. Antitubercular activity was predicted through QSAR model, developed by forward feed multiple linear regression method with leave-one-out approach. Relationship correlating measure of QSAR model was 74 % (R 2 = 0. 74) and predictive accuracy was 72 % (RCV 2 = 0. 72). QSAR studies indicate that dipole energy and heat of formation correlate well with anti-tubercular activity.
