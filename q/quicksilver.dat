5|$|Abandoned mercury mine {{processing}} sites often contain very {{hazardous waste}} piles of roasted cinnabar calcines. Water run-off from such sites is a recognized source of ecological damage. Former mercury mines may be suited for constructive re-use.

5|$|Based on {{the success}} of Cryptonomicon, a New York Times bestseller with sales of about 300,000 copies, the initial {{print-run}} for <b>Quicksilver</b> was 250,000 copies. Five months before the release date, a web campaign was initiated to advertise the work. The novel was originally published in a single volume; in 2006 HarperCollins republished the books in three separate paperback volumes.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Quicksilver,</b> Stephenson {{places the}} {{ancestors}} of the Cryptonomicons characters in Enlightenment Europe alongside a cast of historical individuals from Restoration England and the Enlightenment. Amongst the cast {{are some of the}} most prominent natural philosophers, mathematicians and scientists (Newton and Leibniz), and politicians (William of Orange and Nassau) of the age. In an interview, Stephenson explained he deliberately depicted both the historical and fictional characters as authentic representatives of historical classes of people, such as the Vagabonds as personified by Jack, and the Barbary slaves as personified by Eliza. In his research for the characters, he explored the major scholarship about the period.|$|E
50|$|In May 1977, the Las Vegas <b>Quicksilvers</b> traded Welch to the Washington Diplomats in {{exchange}} for Tom Galati.|$|R

5|$|The Monmouth Rebellion and {{the events}} {{surrounding}} it have {{formed the basis for}} several works of fiction. John Dryden's work Absalom and Achitophel is a satire partially concerned with equating biblical events with the Monmouth Rebellion. The Monmouth Rebellion {{plays a key role in}} Peter S. Beagle's novel Tamsin, about a 300-year-old ghost who is befriended by the protagonist. Arthur Conan Doyle's historical novel Micah Clarke deals directly with Monmouth's landing in England, the raising of his army, its defeat at Sedgemoor, and the reprisals which followed. Several characters in Neal Stephenson's trilogy The Baroque Cycle, particularly <b>Quicksilver</b> and The Confusion, play a role in the Monmouth Rebellion and its aftermath.|$|E
5|$|The first {{champion}} was crowned on February 19, 1999 at CZW's first show, Opening Night. The Sensational One {{was recognized}} as champion by CZW. He went on to defend the title that night against <b>Quicksilver,</b> who defeated him to become the new champion. As such, The Sensational One's first reign became the shortest reign in the title's history at less than one day, until September 9, 2006 when Sonjay Dutt defeated SeXXXy Eddy at CZW's Chri$ Ca$h Memorial Show ndash& Down With The Sickness 2 event to become the new champion. Dutt {{then went on to}} lose the title to Jigsaw later that day at CZW's Expect the Unexpected show.|$|E

5|$|Through {{connections}} that Cohen had with record producer Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, {{just as the}} label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to branch out into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and <b>Quicksilver</b> Messenger Service. The event was a prelude to the Summer of Love and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love {{and the use of}} illicit drugs.|$|E
5|$|In April, Singer {{announced}} that American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga {{had joined the}} cast as Dazzler, but it was later revealed as an April Fools' Day prank.

5|$|The Briscoes {{have been}} {{involved}} with the promotion since its early days, debuting at PWG's fourth-ever show Are You Adequately Prepared to Rock? in October 2003, losing to Super Dragon and B-Boy. Due to the costs of bringing them in from the East coast and the sabbatical from the sport the brothers took, they would not appear again until May 20, 2006, at Enchantment Under the Sea, falling to Cape Fear (<b>Quicksilver</b> and El Generico). At the 2006 Battle of Los Angeles, the Briscoes' numerous no-shows were worked into the company's kayfabe when PWG announced days before that they had been pulled from the tournament as punishment. They wound up appearing anyway, attacking Commissioner Dino Winwood on Night One. The next night, they wrestled in a three-way tag team match for the PWG World Tag Team Championship against Homicide and B-Boy and defending champions Arrogance (Chris Bosh and Scott Lost), who went on to retain the titles.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1976 {{season of}} the North American Soccer League, the San Diego Jaws decided to {{relocate}} and become the Las Vegas <b>Quicksilvers.</b> Despite a roster featuring international superstar Eusébio, the <b>Quicksilvers</b> could only manage an 11-15 record and a 5th-place finish in their division. They averaged an attendance of 7,092 per game. When the 1977 season ended, the franchise opted {{to move back to}} San Diego after only one year and became the San Diego Sockers. They were followed by the Las Vegas Seagulls, who played in the American Soccer League. They compiled a record of 7-18-3 in their only season in 1979.|$|R

5|$|The novel <b>Quicksilver</b> {{is written}} in various {{narrative}} styles, such as theatrical staging and epistolary, and follows {{a large group of}} characters. Though mostly set in late 17th century England, France, and the United Provinces, the first book includes a frame story set in early 18th century Massachusetts. In order to write the novel, Stephenson researched the period extensively and integrates events and historical themes important to historical scholarship throughout the novel. However, Stephenson alters details such as the members of the Cabal ministry, the historical cabinet of Charles II of England, to facilitate the incorporation of his fictional characters. Within the historical context, Stephenson also deals with many themes which pervade his other works, including the exploration of knowledge, communication and cryptography.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Toby Jones, Maximiliano Hernández, and Garry Shandling reprise {{their roles}} from {{previous}} Marvel Studios films as Arnim Zola, Jasper Sitwell, and Senator Stern, respectively.

5|$|Max and the Goody {{sisters are}} soon {{involved}} in a streetfight with henchwoman Eiko (Ji Ling). After Max saves the sisters, and is {{involved in a}} further fight with <b>Quicksilver</b> (Johnny Trí Nguyễn), he is contacted by the leader of the criminals, Aya (Marie Matiko), who is also Eiko's lesbian lover.

They are helped by locals, including beach vendor Debbie (Carmen Electra) and Moko, with whom Max reconciled at the scene of Tahsi's killing.

5|$|When {{merchant}} ships docked, {{the merchandise}} {{was taken into}} official custody and taxes levied on all items sold. The security of the merchandise was guaranteed by the administration officials. Traders of many nationalities (Arabs, Persians, Guzerates, Khorassanians) settled in Calicut, drawn by the thriving trade business. Ship building prospered and keeled ships of 1000–1200 bahares (burden) were built without decks by sewing the entire hull with ropes rather than fastening them with nails. Ships sailed to the Red Sea ports of Aden and Mecca with Vijayanagara goods sold {{as far away as}} Venice. The empire's principal exports were pepper, ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, myrobalan, tamarind timber, anafistula, precious and semi-precious stones, pearls, musk, ambergris, rhubarb, aloe, cotton cloth and porcelain. Cotton yarn was shipped to Burma and indigo to Persia. Chief imports from Palestine were copper, <b>quicksilver</b> (mercury), vermilion, coral, saffron, coloured velvets, rose water, knives, coloured camlets, gold and silver. Persian horses were imported to Cannanore before a two-week land trip to the capital. Silk arrived from China and sugar from Bengal.|$|E

60|$|And now, {{my little}} auditors, shall I tell you {{something}} {{that will make you}} open your eyes very wide? It is really one of the oddest circumstances in the whole story. <b>Quicksilver's</b> staff, you recollect, had set itself up {{against the wall of the}} cottage. Well; when its master entered the door, leaving this wonderful staff behind, what should it do but immediately spread its little wings, and go hopping and fluttering up the door steps! Tap, tap, went the staff, on the kitchen floor; nor did it rest until it had stood itself on end, with the greatest gravity and decorum, beside <b>Quicksilver's</b> chair. Old Philemon, however, as well as his wife, was so taken up in attending to their guests, that no notice was given to what the staff had been about.|$|R
