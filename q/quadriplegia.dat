5|$|A further, albeit rare, {{complication}} of CSF leak is transient <b>quadriplegia</b> {{due to a}} sudden and significant loss of CSF. This loss results in hindbrain herniation and causes major compression of the upper cervical spinal cord. The <b>quadriplegia</b> dissipates once the patient lies supine. An extremely rare {{complication of}} SCSFLS is third nerve palsy, where {{the ability to move}} one's eyes becomes difficult and interrupted due to compression of the third cranial nerve.|$|E

5|$|Schizophrenia is a {{major cause}} of disability, with active {{psychosis}} ranked as the third-most-disabling condition after <b>quadriplegia</b> and dementia and ahead of paraplegia and blindness. Approximately three-fourths of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses and 16.7million people globally are deemed to have moderate or severe disability from the condition. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. Some evidence suggests that paranoid schizophrenia may have a better prospect than other types of schizophrenia for independent living and occupational functioning. In people with a first episode of psychosis a good long-term outcome occurs in 42%, an intermediate outcome in 35% and a poor outcome in 27%. Outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world. These conclusions, however, have been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic <b>quadriplegia</b> and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in acute flaccid paralysis. The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to <b>quadriplegia</b> and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to post-polio syndrome. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Spastic {{tetraplegia}} (all four limbs affected equally). People with spastic <b>quadriplegia</b> are {{the least}} {{likely to be able to}} walk, or if they can, to want to walk, because their muscles are too tight and it is too much effort to do so. Some children with <b>quadriplegia</b> also have hemiparetic tremors, an uncontrollable shaking that affects the limbs on one side of the body and impairs normal movement.|$|E

25|$|Whiplash {{can occur}} at speeds of fifteen {{miles per hour}} or less; it is the sudden jolt, as one car hits another, that causes ones head to be {{abruptly}} thrown back and sideways. The more sudden the motion, the more bones, discs, muscles and tendons in ones neck and upper back will be damaged. Spinal cord injuries are responsible for about 6,000 deaths in the US each year and 5,000 whiplash injuries per year result in <b>quadriplegia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neurological: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} and {{mononeuritis multiplex}} may occur. The most common problem is {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist. Rheumatoid disease of the spine can lead to myelopathy. Atlanto-axial subluxation can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process and/or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine's connection to the skull. Such an erosion (>3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to <b>quadriplegia</b> or even death.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Sicking {{turned his}} {{attention}} to impact energy management in sports. Serious neck injuries in hockey are relatively infrequent but can be catastrophic. Impacts with the rigid walls can produce decelerations of over 100 G’s, causing severe concussions and even <b>quadriplegia.</b> Sicking led the creation of energy absorbing walls that have been shown to successfully reduce head decelerations by 50% under severe impact conditions. These walls are designed to flex and extend during impacts, reducing peak G’s on the player’s head by absorbing the energy of the impact. Sicking is now applying this same concept to develop both improved helmet impact performance standards and a helmet that is more flexible and can decouple head rotation from helmet rotation, thus reducing peak G’s on the head.|$|E
25|$|The acute porphyrias are acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP), {{variegate porphyria}} (VP), amino levulinic acid dehydratase deficiency (ALAD) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate). The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to <b>quadriplegia</b> (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes. Porphyria is not a cause of chronic psychiatric illness, though an association with anxiety and depression has been suggested.|$|E
25|$|He had {{a fairly}} slow start to his racing career, using {{his own money}} to help work his way up the ranks. After {{considerable}} success in kart racing, he moved to the Formula Ford series to the disapproval of his father. In 1976, Mansell won six of the nine races he took part in, including his debut event at Mallory Park. He entered 42 races the following year and won 33 to become the 1977 British Formula Ford champion, despite suffering a broken neck in a qualifying session at Brands Hatch. Doctors told him he had been perilously close to <b>quadriplegia,</b> that he would be confined for six months and would never drive again. Mansell discharged himself from the hospital and returned to racing. Three weeks before the accident he had resigned from his job as an aerospace engineer, having previously sold most of his personal belongings to finance his foray into Formula Ford. Later that year he was given the chance to race a Lola T570 Formula 3 car at Silverstone. He finished fourth and decided that he was ready to move into the higher formula.|$|E
500|$|The Paralympic Games {{is a major}} {{international}} multi-sport event involving athletes {{with a range of}} disabilities, including impaired muscle power (e.g. paraplegia and <b>quadriplegia,</b> muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, spina bifida), impaired passive range of movement, [...] limb deficiency (e.g. amputation or dysmelia), [...] leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, [...] ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and [...] intellectual impairment. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC).|$|E
500|$|A {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI) is damage to the spinal cord that causes changes in its function, either {{temporary}} or permanent. These changes translate into loss of muscle function, sensation, or autonomic function {{in parts of the}} body served by the spinal cord below the level of the lesion. Injuries can occur at any level of the spinal cord and can be classified as complete injury, a total loss of sensation and muscle function, or incomplete, meaning some nervous signals are able to travel past the injured area of the cord. [...] Depending on the location and severity of damage along the spinal cord, the symptoms can vary widely, from pain or numbness to paralysis to incontinence. [...] The prognosis also ranges widely, from full recovery in rare cases to permanent tetraplegia (also called <b>quadriplegia)</b> in [...] injuries {{at the level of the}} neck, and paraplegia in lower injuries. Complications that can occur in the short and long term after injury include muscle atrophy, pressure sores, infections, and respiratory problems.|$|E
500|$|Roshan then {{collaborated with}} {{director}} Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the drama Guzaarish (2010) {{in which he}} had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from <b>quadriplegia,</b> who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, [...] "I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things." [...] He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they [...] "break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes". Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|Brain-computer {{interfaces}} (BCIs) are {{a developing}} technology that clinicians hope {{will one day}} bring more independence and agency to the severely physically disabled. Those the technology {{has the potential to}} help include people with near-total or total paralysis, such as those with tetraplegia (<b>quadriplegia)</b> or advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); BCIs are intended to help them to communicate or even move objects such as motorized wheelchairs, neuroprostheses, or robotic grasping tools. Few of these technologies are currently in regular use by people with disabilities, but a diverse array are in development at an experimental level. One type of BCI uses event-related desynchronization (ERD) of the mu wave in order to control the computer. This method of monitoring brain activity takes advantage of the fact that when a group of neurons is at rest they tend to fire in synchrony with each other. When a participant is cued to imagine movement (an [...] "event"), the resulting desynchronization (the group of neurons that was firing in synchronous waves now firing in complex and individualized patterns) can be reliably detected and analyzed by a computer. Users of such an interface are trained in visualizing movements, typically of the foot, hand, and/or tongue, which are each in different locations on the cortical homunculus and thus distinguishable by an electroencephalograph (EEG) or electrocorticograph (ECoG) recording of electrical activity over the motor cortex. In this method, computers monitor for a typical pattern of mu wave ERD contralateral to the visualized movement combined with event-related synchronization (ERS) in the surrounding tissue. This paired pattern intensifies with training, and the training increasingly takes the form of games, some of which utilize virtual reality. Some researchers have found that the feedback from virtual reality games is particularly effective in giving the user tools to improve control of his or her mu wave patterns. The ERD method can be combined with one or more other methods of monitoring the brain's electrical activity to create hybrid BCIs, which often offer more flexibility than a BCI that uses any single monitoring method.|$|E

Munson suffered a broken neck and would have most likely suffered from <b>quadriplegia</b> had he lived. Munson died of asphyxiation due to the inhalation of superheated air and toxic substances. The NTSB investigation into the crash stated that the probable cause was [...] "...the pilot's failure to recognize the need for, and {{to take action to}} maintain, sufficient airspeed to prevent a stall into the ground during an attempted landing. The pilot also failed to recognize the need for timely and sufficient power application to prevent the stall during an approach conducted inadvertently without flaps extended. Contributing to the pilot's inability to recognize the problem and to take proper action was his failure to use the appropriate checklist and his nonstandard pattern procedures which resulted in an abnormal approach profile." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term palsy {{in modern}} {{language}} {{refers to a}} disorder of movement, but the word root [...] "palsy" [...] technically means [...] "paralysis", {{even though it is}} not used as such within the meaning of cerebral palsy.

In fact, as of the early 21st century some clinicians have become so distressed at common incorrect use of these terms that they have resorted to new naming schemes rather than trying to reclaim the classic ones; one such example of this evolution is the increasing use of the term bilateral spasticity to refer to spastic diplegia.
