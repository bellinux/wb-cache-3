5|$|In {{the third}} round, one {{contestant}} from each team faces the same <b>question</b> simultaneously. Contestants {{have their own}} money countdown, which starts at $1,000 and decreases by $50 per second. The other contestant from each team then faces a more difficult <b>question,</b> with an opening value of $2,500 and decreasing by $100 per second. The host usually reads the <b>question</b> to the contestants during this round. After this second <b>question,</b> the team that has more money wins and plays the bonus round for $10,000.|$|E
5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same <b>question</b> individually. While the first {{contestant}} is asked the <b>question,</b> the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the <b>question.</b> The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the <b>question.</b> If one team member answers the <b>question</b> correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} the teachers’ <b>questions</b> in promoting thinking skills at SMP N 8 Yogyakarta. This research was descriptive qualitative research, but it used both qualitative and quantitative data. The {{data were collected from}} the <b>questions</b> performed by two teachers of 8 th grade at SMP N 8 Yogyakarta in 22 meetings. The <b>questions</b> were classisfied into types of <b>questions</b> and cognitive domains. The results of the research show that the teacher performed four types of <b>questions,</b> which include factual <b>questions,</b> empirical <b>questions,</b> evaluative <b>questions,</b> and productive <b>questions.</b> Factual <b>questions</b> occured dominantly rather than other types of <b>questions.</b> It implies that teachers’ <b>questions</b> promote more lower-order thinking skills (LOTS) instead of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). The teachers’ <b>questions</b> were also determined comprising a negotiation of meaning as the questioning strategies...|$|R
5|$|Questions can {{be formed}} {{in several ways}} in Nafaanra. Basic yes–no {{questions}} are constructed by adding a sentence-final <b>question</b> marker rá.

50|$|Normative {{philosophical}} educology is {{the same}} as normative knowledge about education or normative philosophy of education. This arrangement of educology again requires the use of the three disciplines (analytic, normative, empirical). <b>Questions</b> of what is desirable and undesirable for and in the educational process (normative <b>questions)</b> lead on to <b>questions</b> of meaning (analytic <b>questions)</b> and <b>questions</b> of the actual consequences of actions or practices (empirical <b>questions).</b> To settle normative <b>questions</b> competently, one must also be able to settle <b>questions</b> of meaning and <b>questions</b> of actual consequences.|$|R

5|$|Each {{contestant}} had {{the same}} decision facing them as before, which was whether to attempt to answer the <b>question</b> or walk away with their pre-tournament total intact. Attempting the <b>question</b> and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play, with a reduction of their pre-tournament winnings to $25,000. If the <b>question</b> was answered correctly, the player that did so became the tournament leader. If another player after him/her answered correctly, that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre-tournament winnings. The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their <b>question</b> {{at the end of}} the tournament on November 20, 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series' third millionaire.|$|E

50|$|Basic or focus <b>questions</b> are interpretive <b>questions</b> which {{comprehensively}} address {{an aspect}} of interpreting a selection. Resolving basic or focus <b>questions</b> typically requires investigation and examination of multiple passages within a selection. Cluster <b>questions,</b> which need not be interpretive <b>questions,</b> are optionally prepared by discussion leaders and are often organized to help to resolve the answers to basic or focus <b>questions.</b> Cluster <b>questions</b> may additionally serve as catalysts for further discussions.|$|R
30|$|Science {{instructors}} need <b>questions</b> {{for use in}} exams, homework assignments, class discussions, reviews, {{and other}} instructional activities. Textbooks never have enough <b>questions,</b> so instructors must find them from other sources or generate their own <b>questions.</b> In order to supply biology instructors with <b>questions</b> for college students in introductory biology classes, two algorithms were developed. One generates <b>questions</b> from a formal representation of photosynthesis knowledge. The other collects biology <b>questions</b> from the web. The <b>questions</b> generated by these two methods were compared to <b>questions</b> from biology textbooks. Human students rated <b>questions</b> for their relevance, fluency, ambiguity, pedagogy, and depth. <b>Questions</b> were also rated by the authors according {{to the topic of}} the <b>questions.</b> Although the exact pattern of results depends on analytic assumptions, it appears that there is little difference in the pedagogical benefits of each class, but the <b>questions</b> generated from the knowledge base may be shallower than <b>questions</b> written by professionals. This suggests that all three types of <b>questions</b> may work equally well for helping students to learn.|$|R

5|$|In January 2001, when no {{contestant}} had won $1 {{million in}} any show that aired {{over a period}} of five months, the top prize was then changed from a flat $1 million to an accumulating jackpot that increased by $10,000 for each episode where the top prize was not won. On April 10, 2001, Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the final <b>question</b> and won $2,180,000, making him the biggest winner in television history at the time. The top prize for correctly answering the final <b>question</b> returned to $1 million following Olmstead's win and has remained unchanged since; just five days after Olmstead's win, the standard $1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen. The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant, on the episode aired September 7, 2001; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31, 2001 when the jackpot was $1,860,000, where he was ruled to have answered his $16,000 <b>question</b> incorrectly, but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that <b>question,</b> Toutant was invited back and won the $1,860,000 jackpot. On the Super Millionaire spin-off, Robert Essig won $1,000,000 after answering the twelfth <b>question</b> and then walked away, not reaching the final <b>question</b> for $10,000,000.|$|E

It was found that open <b>questions</b> were expected to derive longer responses than closed <b>questions,</b> and that among open <b>questions,</b> why and could <b>questions</b> were expected to derive longer responses than what and how <b>questions.</b> In Study II, {{on the basis of}} the results of Study I, 6 items of open and closed <b>questions</b> were selected for an experimental interview, in which 10 male and 10 female students were individually asked by the experimenter to respond to the <b>questions.</b> The results revealed that open <b>questions</b> produced greater numberof syllables and longertime of response than closed <b>questions,</b> and that open <b>questions</b> led to longer latency than closed <b>questions.</b> These results confirm Ivey's definition about the effect of open and closed <b>questions...</b>|$|R
50|$|There are two {{different}} types of <b>questions</b> that survey researchers use when writing a questionnaire: free-response <b>questions</b> and closed <b>questions.</b> Free-response <b>questions</b> are open-ended, whereas closed <b>questions</b> are usually multiple-choice. Free-response <b>questions</b> are beneficial because they allow the responder greater flexibility, but they are also very difficult to record and score, requiring extensive coding. Contrastingly, closed <b>questions</b> can be scored and coded much easier, but they diminish expressivity and spontaneity of the responder.|$|R
