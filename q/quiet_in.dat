5|$|Since the {{eruption}} of 1932 Quizapu has been <b>quiet.</b> <b>In</b> 1949 and 1967 small ash clouds were reported, while in the 1980s {{there were no signs}} of activity other than fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|Research {{involving}} {{the reaction was}} relatively <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> subsequent years, until in the mid-1980s when several syntheses employing the Nazarov cyclization were published. Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of Trichodiene and Nor-Sterepolide, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne-allene isomerization that generates the divinyl ketone.|$|E

5|$|The Mac Pro's Xeon {{processors}} generated {{much less}} heat {{than the previous}} dual-core G5s, so {{the size of the}} internal cooling devices were reduced significantly. This allowed the interior to be re-arranged, leaving more room {{at the top of the}} case and doubling the number of internal drive bays. This also allowed the elimination of the large clear plastic air deflector used as part of the cooling system in the Power Mac G5. Less heat also meant less air to move out of the case for cooling during normal operations; the Mac Pro was very <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> normal operation, quieter than the much noisier Power Mac G5, and proved difficult to measure using common sound pressure level meters.|$|E
5|$|Tragedy marred Sunday's final years. His {{three sons}} engaged {{in many of}} the {{activities}} he preached against, and the Sundays paid blackmail to several women to keep the scandals relatively <b>quiet.</b> <b>In</b> 1930, Nora Lynn, their housekeeper and nanny, who had become a virtual member of the family, died. Then the Sundays' daughter, the only child actually raised by Nell, died in 1932 of what seems to have been multiple sclerosis. Their oldest son George, rescued from financial ruin by the Sundays, committed suicide in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) becomes {{frustrated}} when Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) {{refers to}} Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) as his boss. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Gabe invite the office over to Gabe's {{house for a}} Glee viewing party. When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over how high the volume should be. After taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has been {{having a hard time}} with getting her daughter CeCe to go to sleep at night, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down. Pam is stunned that CeCe becomes completely <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> Dwight's hands.|$|E
40|$|Speech-evoked {{auditory}} brainstem responses (ABRs) {{and speech}} recognition measures were evaluated {{in children with}} unilateral hearing loss (UHL) and normal hearing (NH).

5|$|Things {{remained}} <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> the Khe Sanh area through 1966. Even so, Westmoreland {{insisted that}} it not only be occupied by the Marines, but that it be reinforced. He was vociferously opposed by General Lewis W. Walt, the Marine commander of I Corps. Walt argued heatedly that the real target of the American effort should be the pacification and protection of the population, not chasing NVA and the NLF in the hinterlands. Westmoreland won out, however, and the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment (1/3 Marines) was dispatched to occupy the camp and airstrip on 29 September. By late January 1967, 1/3 returned to Japan and was relieved by Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9 Marines). A single company was replacing an entire battalion.|$|E
5|$|To the north, the Bulgar {{frontier}} remained quiet, {{except for}} a Bulgar raid that was defeated, leading to the renewal of the 30-year peace treaty of 815, which was later reconfirmed by the new Bulgar khan Boris (r. 852–889). Byzantium thus enjoyed a period of peace except in the West, where the Byzantine government proved unable to halt the ongoing Muslim conquest of Sicily. Modica fell in 845, but although Constantinople used the relative <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> the East to send reinforcements to the island, these were heavily defeated at Butera, where the Byzantines lost about 10,000 men. In the wake of this disaster, Leontini in 846 and then Ragusa in 848 fell to the Muslims, while {{an attempt by the}} Byzantine fleet to land troops near Palermo in winter 847/848 failed. Over the next few years, the Muslims raided the Byzantine territories on the eastern half of the island unopposed, capturing several minor fortresses and securing ransom and prisoners from others.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Parachute Brigade was {{the first}} unit of the Airborne Division to arrive in Palestine, {{disembarking}} at Haifa on 3 October 1945. The brigade then moved to Gaza to acclimatise and regain their fitness after the voyage from England. On 21 October the brigade was deployed around the Lydda district, with responsibility for Tel Aviv and Jaffa. The first incident involving the brigade came on 14 November 1945, when the Jewish National Council called for a 12-hour strike, which resulted in rioting in Tel Aviv. By 18:15 the Palestine Police Force was unable to cope and sent for reinforcements from the 8th Parachute Battalion. The complete battalion was deployed and the riot was under control by 21:40 and a curfew imposed {{for the rest of}} the night. Early the following day the curfew was broken by large crowds gathering to loot and burn buildings, so the remainder of the brigade was deployed to the city under the codename Operation Bellicose. Night time curfews remained in place until 05:20 on 20 November, when all troops returned to their barracks. All was <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> the brigade area until the night of 26/27 December, when police stations in Jaffa and Tel Aviv, the railway at Lydda and an armoury at Tel Aviv were attacked. The brigade again imposed a curfew around Tel Aviv. This was followed by cordon and search operations: Pintail on 29 December, Heron on 8 January, and Pigeon on 30 January.|$|E

5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause trouble, making Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> exchange for Amy. When Tracy is brutally attacked, Becky is arrested for the incident until Claire admits she was responsible but Becky admits looting Dev's shop, Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati) is furious but does not report her. When Liz finds out she makes life hard for Becky. Becky gets drunk and attacks Kylie and forces Liz out of the pub. Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson) offers to buy the Rovers— with the money Becky and Steve decide {{to start a new life}} abroad and steal Amy. Jim's attempts to rob a bank fail and they are forced to cancel their plans. Steve calls Social Services to check on Max and they take him into care. Becky believes Tracy made the call and smashes her front room up with a sledge-hammer. Before she can hit Tracy, Steve confesses. Becky walks out on Steve and goes off the rails once more.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} to a low-pressure compressor for gas supply is high-pressure storage cylinders feeding through a pressure regulator which will be set to the required supply pressure for the depth and equipment in use. In practice HP storage {{may be used for}} either reserve gas supply or both main and reserve gas supplies to a gas panel. High-pressure bulk cylinders are <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> operation and provide gas of known quality (if it has been tested). This allows the relatively simple and reliable use of nitrox mixtures in surface-supplied diving. Bulk cylinders are also <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> operation compared to a low-pressure compressor, but have the obvious limitation of amount of gas available.|$|E
25|$|The De Lisle carbine or De Lisle Commando carbine was a British firearm {{used during}} World War II that was {{designed}} with an integrated suppressor.

25|$|The police {{dismissed}} Police Constable Thiel, {{a prominent}} {{member of the}} force and a union organiser, for union activities. This action was a catalyst for the 1918 strike, a spark for many grievances over pay and conditions. The authorities grossly underestimated the strength of rank-and-file support for positive action to address their grievances and to defend Constable Thiel. The day before the strike began, Police Superintendents reported at their weekly meeting with the Commissioner that all was <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> the force.|$|E
25|$|Command {{and control}} {{at all levels}} of the new army was {{extremely}} difficult, as Pakistan had received six armoured, eight artillery and eight infantry regiments compared to the twelve armoured, forty artillery and twenty-one infantry regiments that went to India. In total, the size of the new army was about ~150,000 men strong. To fill the vacancy in the command positions of the army, British Army officers had to be retained, which was <b>quiet</b> <b>in</b> larger number, under the command of Lieutenant-General Frank Messervy, the first Commander in Chief.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} English consonant identification by Greek listeners {{and the role}} of phonological short-term memory (PSTM) in listeners’ identification ability. Twenty Greek university students who had received formal instruction in English identified 24 English consonants (embedded in VCV syllables) presented <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> and <b>in</b> two noise types, a competing talker at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of - 6 dB and an 8 -speaker babble at an SNR of - 2 dB. Participants’ PSTM was assessed via a serial non-word recognition task in Greek. The results showed that identification scores <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> were significantly higher than in noise. There was no difference in scores between the two noise conditions. PSTM correlated with English consonant identification <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> and <b>in</b> the two types of noise; listeners with greater PSTM capacity were also better in identifying English consonants <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> and noise, a finding that extends previous research <b>in</b> <b>quiet</b> to L 2 perception in adverse listening conditions. English consonant confusion patterns are interpreted as caused by a combination of first-language interference (at both the phonetic and phonological levels) and spectral/articulatory factors...|$|R
