40|$|Job Opportunities in the Navy (JOIN) is a {{pictorial}} and textual interest measurement instrument. Originally conceived to work {{in conjunction}} with a newly designed job <b>qualification</b> <b>engine</b> (Rating Identification Engine [RIDE]), these two new measurement instruments provide the Navy with both a qualification algorithm and an interest inventory. Quantitative measures of individual cognitive ability and medical, moral, and legal qualification (i. e., RIDE) will be linked with measurable vocational interests to produce job classification assignments individuals ' both qualify for and have demonstrated vocational interest in. JOIN is a computerized interest inventory designed to assess recruits ' vocational interests with respect to four domains of Navy jobs (community area, work style, work environment, and work activity). By using a hierarchical model of work development (Schippmann, 1999), analyses among job families (e. g., aviation, construction, intelligence, etc.), work styles (e. g., mental, physical, etc.), work environments (e. g., indoor, outdoor, etc.), and work activities (e. g., analyze communications, direct aircraft, maintain documents, etc.) were conducted to guide the development of instrument items. The overarching goal was to construct a tool that is capable of discriminating individual interests across all entry-level ratings, thereby increasing individuals' person-job (P-J) fit. Additionally, JOIN serves as a tool to inform potential recruits of the Navyâ€™s world-of-work, providing a more precise person-organization (P-O) and person-environment (P-E) fit...|$|E
50|$|Aestus was {{developed}} by the Ottobrunn Space Propulsion Centre between 1988 and 1995 with first flight as an upper stage of Ariane 5 G flight 502 and performed as designed. The first improvements were developed between 1999 and 2002 improving the frame performance and adjusting propellant mixture ratio from 2.05 to 1.90 with a first flight on an Ariane 5 flight 518 on 26 February 2004. Ignition <b>qualification</b> programme preparing <b>engine</b> for handling new Automated Transfer Vehicle that requires 3 ignitions per flight was completed in 2007 and flew with Jules Verne ATV on Ariane 5 flight 528.|$|R
5000|$|The {{objectives}} {{also included}} testing {{the use of}} the new facility at Jackass Flats for flight <b>engine</b> <b>qualification</b> and acceptance. Total run time was 115 minutes, including 28 starts. NASA and SNPO felt that the test [...] "confirmed that a nuclear rocket engine was suitable for space flight application and was able to operate at a specific impulse twice that of chemical rocket system sic." [...] The engine was deemed adequate for Mars missions being planned by NASA. The facility was also deemed adequate for flight qualification and acceptance of rocket engines from the two contractors.|$|R

The STG-ET {{has been especially}} designed for electric space thruster testing with a vacuum chamber that measures 12. 2 m in length and 5 m in diameter. Thrust measurement is a basic requirement for propulsion <b>engine</b> <b>qualification.</b> Ion and Hall effect space thrusters usually produce thrust levels in the milli newton range. A thrust measurement system used on these engines has to carry {{the weight of the}} thrusters which are of the order of several kg and measure these low force values. Within this paper, we analyze issues when using a thrust measurement device, and give some hints on how to mitigate these. Stability of the balance carrying structure, decent cable and fluid pipe routing, and good thermal conditioning are the most important points to take care of for minimizing issues...|$|R
40|$|The German Aerospace Center DLR {{brought into}} {{operation}} a test facility for electric space propulsion in Goettingen, Germany, called STG-ET. This facility {{has been especially}} designed for electric propulsion with a vacuum chamber that measures more than 12 m in length and 5 m in diameter. Besides thruster performance tests {{the focus is on}} plume interaction with spacecraft components and on long-term testing. Thrust measurement is a fundamental measurement method for propulsion <b>engine</b> <b>qualification.</b> Ion and Hall effect space thrusters usually produce thrust levels in the milli-Newton range, and thrust balances have to deal with these low values. For the thrust balance of the STG-ET we adopted a thrust balance design based on a counter-balanced, electromagnetic force compensated device. The measurable thrust range is 250 mN, but the design can easily accommodate an upgrade to 1 N. The maximum allowed thruster assembly mass is 40 kg.

40|$|FY- 92 accomplishments {{centered}} on conceptual design and analyses for 25, 50, and 75 K engines {{with emphasis on}} the 50 K engine. During the first period of performance, flow and energy balances were prepared {{for each of these}} configurations and thrust-to-weight values were estimated. A review of fuel technology and key data from the Rover/NERVA program established a baseline for proven reactor performance and areas of enhancement to meet near-term goals. Studies were performed of the criticality and temperature profiles for probable fuel and moderator loadings for the three engine sizes, with a more detailed analysis of the 50 K size. During the second period of performance, analyses of the 50 K engine continued. A chamber/nozzle contour was selected and heat transfer and fatigue analyses were performed for likely construction materials. Reactor analyses were performed to determine component radiation heating rates, reactor radiation fields, water immersion poisoning requirements, temperature limits for restartability, and a tie-tube thermal analysis. Finally, a brief assessment of key enabling technologies was made, with a view toward identifying development issues and identification of the critical path toward achieving <b>engine</b> <b>qualification</b> within 10 years...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{has been}} the leading nation in space technology, as space is a vital asset in {{military}} dominance. But to sustain {{its position in the}} area of space lift, the current U. S. second stage liquid propulsion engine, the RL 10 (developed in 1958) needs to be replaced. This replacement requires systems engineering methods and new technological advances to adhere to mission requirements and constraints of current platforms. This thesis provides a history of the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV), U. S. liquid propulsion, and the RL 10 LH 2 /LOX engine to analyze tradeoffs between major requirements in new upper stage development and to provide a recommendation of evaluation measures. The results are a proactive case presenting the benefits of a new upper stage engine on EELV, a tradeoff comparison between rocket propulsion engine cycles, a waterfall model for <b>engine</b> <b>qualification</b> and testing of liquid propulsion rocket engines, and testing recommendations for NGE qualification. Additionally, the thesis recommends specific impulse, thrust, and thrust-to-weight values that should be used as a design baseline for the next generation upper stage engine on EELV. These recommendations should be of value to engineers or program managers who are or will be responsible for acquiring replacement propulsion systems. Captain, United States Air Forc...|$|R
40|$|Article {{describe}} organisation of gearboxes Hypertronic CVT and Extroid CVT (FIg. 1, 2, 3) with controlled frictional transmission with coherent {{gear ratio}} change and hydromechanic changemoment. Used simple frictional transmission has not reserve motion ability (Fig. 5) and then car accelerating {{by force of}} gear ratio change is unable. To enable fluent car accelerating classical gearboxes CVT contain hydrodynamic changer before controlled frictional transmission. Hydrodynamic changer solves car acceleration, but not reverse motion of car. To create reverse motion gearbox Extroid contain, (sun and planet reversing reducer), between hydrodynamic changer and frictional transmission. (Fig. 2). Simple frictional transmission has maximum gear ratio to fast. Output of controlled frictional transmission contains decelerating reducer to be maximum gear ratio of gearbox CVT unitary. (Fig. 2, 4). Hydrodynamic changer in gearboxes CVT deteriorates driving attributes of car at starting and at overtaking slowly car to the acclivity. Inconvenient attributes of serial wiring of hydrodynamic changer and simple frictional transmission can eliminate wiring of frictional transmission to branched flow system with distribution differential at output. (Fig. 9). So come into existence differntial controlled frictional transmission (DRTP) with reverse motion ability and ability to realise controlled starting of car. Examples of configuration DRTP are at pict. 10, 11, 12. Comparing of static moment qualifications of classical gearbox CVT and gearbox DRTP is at pict. 13. Gearboxes CVT with hydrodynamic changer oppress engine at starting according to pump qualification of changer. Gearbox DRTP controlled moment oppresses engine. Controlled oppress moment behaviour is arbitrary workable, for example according to optimal oppress <b>qualification</b> of <b>engine.</b> (L 3). Fig. 15 contains oppress qualification of DRTP and parabolic oppress qualification of hydrodynamic changer CVT. Fig. 16. Driving moment at input DRTP grows faster. Time behaviour of speed at overtaking to the acclivity is compared ad Fig. 18. Car with gearbox DRTP has better dynamic of motion. Fig. 19 contains trajectory at overtaking to the acclivity. Fig. 20 contains car speed behaviour at accelerating at plain. Car with gearbox DRTP actives speed 100 km/h in 4, 8 sec, and car with gearbox CVT hydrodynamic gear 7, 5 sec...|$|R
40|$|The Global Aerospace Centre for Icing and Environmental Research Inc. (GLACIER) {{facility}} {{is located in}} Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. This facility provides icing certification tests for large gas turbine engines, as well as performance, endurance and other gas turbine <b>engine</b> <b>qualification</b> testing. This globally unique outdoor engine test and certification facility was officially opened back in 2010. The prime purpose of this {{facility is}} for icing certification of aero gas turbines. As a generic engine test facility, it includes the infrastructure and test systems necessary for the installation of both current and future gas turbine engines. The GLACIER facility completed its commissioning {{in the winter of}} 2010 / 2011, and has now experienced five years of full icing seasons. Rolls-Royce and Pratt and Whitney have both successfully performed certification and engineering icing testing with 5 engines completing their icing certification. Behind the successes there have been some aspects that could have gone better. Some could be considered an inevitable part of engine testing in the real world, but there have been some learning experiences that can be usefully shared with the wider community. This paper aims to examine and publicize the lessons learnt from these first five years of operation, including how the facility hardware has performed, what availability has been achieved, what we have learnt about the icing spray system and how we plan to develop the facility for the future, including the possibility of incorporating ice crystal and mixed phase testing, as well as SLD (Supercooled Large Droplet) testing.

40|$|The {{results of}} the high mixture ratio {{qualification}} testing of the RL 10 engine for the Shuttle/Centaur program are presented. The objective of the <b>engine</b> <b>qualification</b> test was to demonstrate the suitability of the RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B engine for space vehicle flight by subjecting it to the testing specified in RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B Model Specification Number 2295 dated February 1986. The applicable section of the specification is presented. Due to payload volume advantages which {{can be achieved by}} increasing the operating mixture ratio of the RL 10, a decision was made to qualify the engine to run at a higher mixture ratio. A program was created to qualify the RL 10 engine for operation at 15, 000 pounds thrust and a nominal 6. 0 to 1 mixture ratio. This model of the engine was designated the RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B. The qualification program included three test series as follows: (1) hardware durability and limits test in which the engine completed 23 firings and 4605. 7 seconds with 1588. 7 seconds at less than 6. 6 mixture ratio; (2) preliminary qualification test in which the engine completed 26 firings and 5750 seconds; and (3) qualification test in which the engine completed 26 hot firings and 5693. 4 seconds with 905. 9 seconds at 6. 7 mixture ratio. Several changes in engine hardware were required for operation of the RL 10 A- 3 - 3 B engine in the Space Shuttle which include a duel pressure switch ignition, an oxidizer flow control, and helium plumbing changes...|$|R
40|$|The Global Aerospace Centre for Icing and Environmental Research (GLACIER) {{facility}} has been constructed in Thompson, Manitoba, Canada. This project involves {{the construction and}} operation of a facility which will provide icing certification tests for large gas turbine engines, as well as performance, endurance and other gas turbine <b>engine</b> <b>qualification</b> testing. MDS Aero Support, {{in partnership with the}} National Research Council of Canada (NRC), Pratt and Whitney Canada, and Rolls Royce Canada, has developed a globally unique outdoor engine test and certification facility. The prime purpose of this facility is for icing certification of aviation gas turbine engines, initially for Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney, two of the three largest gas turbine manufacturers in the world. The facility will provide the aviation industry with the required environmental conditions (by virtue of its location), and capability to meet the growing demands for icing certifications and other adverse cold weather conditions. It will also cater to other performance, endurance and specialty testing outside of the icing season. As a generic engine test facility, it includes the infrastructure and test systems necessary for the introduction of both current and future gas turbine engines. The facility is operated by MDS AeroTest which is a subsidiary of MDS Aero Support, while the icing technology and hardware {{that is part of the}} entire GLACIER facility is supplied, owned and operated by NRC on a full cost recovery basis. This paper describes the new icing facility and provides insight into the design criteria used to create the unique icing spray system developed to meet the large engine testing requirements.

40|$|The X- 33, {{reusable}} space plane {{technology demonstrator}} is on course {{to begin the}} flights of the X- 33 {{by the end of}} 2002 that will serve as a basis for industry and government decisions that could lead to VentureStar(Trademark). Lockheed Martin has placed the VentureStar(Trademark) LLC in it's Space Company and is now competing in an industry wide effort that will permit NASA to select a Second Generation RLV source by 2005. This move provides the focus for firm business planning needed to enable the decision by the time X- 33 flies in mid 2002 and possibly with upgraded technologies a year or so later. Since the IAF 50 th Congress in Amsterdam, most of the major hardware elements of X- 33 have been through their assembly and test. The flight liquid oxygen tank was the first major element to complete final assembly. Aerospike <b>Engine</b> <b>qualification</b> testing has progressed successfully through its test objectives and the two flight engines are in preparation to be delivered to the Assembly Facility in Palmdale. All Thermal Protection System (TPS) metallic panels have completed qualification testing and have been delivered to Palmdale and all remaining TPS elements have been assembled and are ready for delivery. Flight Software and Avionics have been delivered and are in integration testing. In November 1999, the first graphite composite liquid hydrogen tank experienced a debond between the tank inner skin and the honeycomb core in testing.

T. {{due to a}} sensor redundancy failure in the liquid hydrogen system of ME- 2 (Engine 2033). The event description and time line are summarized. Propellant loading was initiated on 12 Aug. 1993 at 12 : 00 AM EST. All space shuttle main engine (SSME) chill parameters and Launch Commit Criteria (LCC) were nominal. At engine start plus 1. 34 seconds a Failure Identification (FID) was posted against Engine 2033 for exceeding the 1800 spin intra-channel (A 1 -A 2) Fuel Flowrate sensor channel <b>qualification</b> limit. The <b>engine</b> was shut down at 1. 50 seconds followed by Engines 2032 and 2030. All shut down sequences were nominal and the mission was safely aborted. SSME Avionics hardware and software performed nominally during the incident. A review of vehicle data table (VDT) data and controller software logic revealed no failure indications other than the single FID 111 - 101, Fuel Flowrate Intra-Channel Test Channel A disqualification. Software logic was executed according to requirements {{and there was no}} anomalous controller software operation. Immediately following the abort, a Rocketdyne/NASA failure investigation team was assembled. The team successfully isolated the failure cause to an open circuit in a Fuel Flowrate Sensor. This type of failure has occurred eight previous times in ground testing. The sensor had performed acceptably on three previous flights of the engine and SSME flight history shows 684 combined fuel flow rate sensor channel flights without failure. The disqualification of an Engine 2 (SSME No. 2033) Fuel Flowrate sensor channel was a result of an instrumentation failure and not engine performance. All other engine operations were nominal. This disqualification resulted in an engine shutdown and safe sequential shutdown of all three engines prior to ignition of the solid boosters...|$|R
