40|$|A notable {{way that}} social change affects {{personal}} <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life would {{rely on the}} person’s experience with social change. This experience may influence societal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work life, which may in turn affect personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Additionally, the experience of social change is possibly less detrimental to personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life later {{in the presence of}} higher existing personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. These influences over time become transparent through a three-wave panel study of 531 working people in Hong Kong, China. Findings show that although social change experienced did not generally impair subsequent <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life, it tended to be more detrimental to the person with lower <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life before. In addition, social change experienced tended to erode societal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> work life experienced, which appeared to be predictors <b>of</b> personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Hence, there are possible ways for social change to predict personal <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Introduction: Despite many {{advances}} {{in the treatment of}} chronic renal failure, the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> sleep in patients who suffer from this disease is at the risk. The high prevalence of sleep disorders in hemodialysis patients, which is concomitant with physical, behavioral, and psychological problems, has always affected these patients’ <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life (QOL). This study aimed to determine the relationship between <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> sleep and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life in hemodialysis patients. Methods: By using a descriptive and correlational design, this study was conducted on 245 hemodialysis patients in 2012. Patients were selected by convenience sampling from the hemodialysis ward of four training hospitals of Tabriz and Maragheh. <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> sleep was measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life for patients was measured by the Kidney Disease <b>Quality</b> <b>Of</b> Life questionnaire (KDQOL-SF). Results: 83. 3 % of hemodialysis patients had poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> sleep. Poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life was significantly associated with poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> sleep. There was a significant negative correlation between global PSQI and important aspects <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life including physical health, symptoms and problems, the impact of kidney disease on daily life, burden of kidney disease, mental health, social support, and sexual function. Conclusion: The low <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> sleep in hemodialysis patients has an effect on the deterioration <b>of</b> their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life.
