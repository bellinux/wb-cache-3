5000|$|Slip forming, {{continuous}} poured, continuously formed, or slipform {{construction is}} a construction method in which concrete is poured into a continuously moving form. [...] Slip forming {{is used for}} tall structures (such as bridges, towers, buildings, and dams), as well as horizontal structures, such as roadways. Slipforming enables continuous, non-interrupted, cast-in-place [...] "flawless" [...] (i.e. no joints) concrete structures which have superior performance characteristics to piecewise construction using discrete form elements. Slip forming relies on the <b>quick-setting</b> properties of concrete, and requires a balance between <b>quick-setting</b> capacity and workability. Concrete needs to be workable enough to be placed into the form and consolidated (via vibration), yet <b>quick-setting</b> enough {{to emerge from the}} form with strength. This strength is needed because the freshly set concrete must not only permit the form to [...] "slip" [...] by the concrete without disturbing it, but also support the pressure of the new concrete as well as resist collapse caused by the vibration of the compaction machinery.|$|E

5000|$|The primary {{engineering}} {{feature of}} the line was the tunnel through Richmond Hill in Leeds. It was 700 yd long, with its western entrance at 8 chain m from the Leeds terminus. The tunnel's cross section {{was that of a}} horseshoe arch, 22 ft at its widest, and 17 ft high from the level of the rails. The construction of the tunnel required the sinking of three shafts, subsequently retained for ventilation. Excavation of the tunnel yielded mostly shale and coal, with the remaining third being stone which was used as foundations for other parts of the line. The arch was lined with two courses of brickwork, lengthways to a thickness of 20 inches. In some places three courses were used, depending on the strength of the surrounding ground. Volcanic matter was used in the mortar, to obtain a <b>quick-setting</b> and strong cement. The entrances of the tunnel were faced with stone.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the impact of electrical stimulation frequency on muscle force and fatigue and propose application modalities in regards to sports or clinical rehabilitation training. MethodsThe maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) force of the quadriceps femoris muscle was recorded before, during and after electrical stimulation in 26 healthy adults during 20 -minute sessions corresponding to 60 of 5 -second contractions separated by 15 -second rest periods. Three different frequencies were used: 100, 50 and 20 Hz. ResultsWith a frequency of 100 Hz, we obtained 71 % of the MVC force at the beginning of the session (MVCb). The decrease in muscle force at the end of the session is significantly greater for the highest frequencies respectively 27, 33 and 38 % of MVCb for 100, 50 and 20 Hz. ConclusionThe impact of electrical stimulation to improve muscle force seems to be dependent on frequency, intensity pulse trains and number of contractions per session. Higher intensity and higher frequency induce stronger muscular contractions, but also a stronger decline in force and thus <b>quick-setting</b> muscle fatigue. Classical 20 -minute training sessions with many contractions (60 or more) do not seem appropriate for sports training or clinical rehabilitation programs...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a disintegrating core-body for use in an art bronze foundry, which employs the ceramic shell investment process, begins with an investigation of four principal materials that will constitute the core formula. The specifications for {{the disintegration of the}} designed core-body formula fall within the parameters that are normally set and used in the ceramic shell art bronze casting process. The raison d’ être for the disintegrating formula is {{based on the premise that}} cement breaks down (spalling) after being subjected to heat above a certain temperature. It was shown that pure cement in the form of naked test bars 100 mm x 20 mm x 20 mm does indeed break down into separate pieces when fired to and above 9000 C; where 9000 C is the lowest recommended temperature required for sintering the ceramic shell investment mould. The addition of calcium carbonate to pure cement in the form of naked test bars, produced a more unified formula that did not break into separate pieces when fired to 9450 C. However this combination of cement and calcium carbonate had a slow setting time of 12 hours and a shrinkage value of 2, 3 %, which were both above the parameters being sought for a <b>quick-setting</b> formula with a shrinkage value of below 1 %. The combination of cement, plaster of paris and silica produced formulae that set within six hours and had shrinkage values of less than 1 % but did not disintegrate within 72 hours. It was only after the addition of calcium carbonate to the these mixes that formulae resulted that set within six hours, had relatively low shrinkage values and showed signs of breaking up after 60 hours. It was further shown that by altering the ratios of cement, plaster of paris, calcium carbonate and silica, that the parameters for <b>quick-setting</b> formulae with shrinkage values of 1 % and below, that also disintegrated within 55 hours, could be achieved. xvi It was also proved by subjecting these formulae to higher relative humidity conditions that the disintegrating times could be reduced and brought to below 48 hours. Selected formulae were then subjected to temperatures of between 9000 C and 10000 C. It was found that as the temperatures were increased so the disintegration times were reduced and were even further reduced under higher relative humidity conditions. It was found from the above experiments that the selected formula determined to be suitable in all respects as a disintegrating core-body was too difficult to remove from the hollow bronze cast when subjected to an actual bronze pour. Further experimentation using increased proportions of silica in the formula resulted in a final core-body that could be quickly and easily removed from its bronze cast as soon as the core-body had cooled to room temperature. The selected core-body formula (F 21 D) that was used in the final set of bronze casting procedures was found to function optimally when fired to a temperature of 9000 C and could be quickly and easily removed from the bronze casts leaving a clean inner bronze surface, free from any remnants of the fired core. The document concludes by recording the delimitations and advantages of the final core-body formula F 21 D, as well as making recommendations based on these parameters for further study relating to disintegrating core-body formulations...|$|E
40|$|Consistency {{is one of}} {{the major}} issues during the Nondestructive Test 2 ̆ 6 Evaluation (NDT 2 ̆ 6 E) of {{flexible}} pavement, i. e., asphalt pavement, by Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Portable Seismic Property Analyzer (PSPA). In some recent nondestructive tests on instrumented pavement section at Milepost (MP) 141 on Interstate- 40 (I- 40), New Mexico, it is observed that 2 -way travel time of GPR signal in unbound layers transmitted by Ground-Coupled Antenna (GCA) varies in different months which leads to different values of layer thickness at a same section and it is believed that the reason is moisture variation. In case of PSPA, tests on Asphalt Concrete (AC) surface show higher level of inconsistency at repeated drops on the same test locations which is believed due to irregular contact between the sensors and surface. To date, unbound materials were collected from the pavement section to measure dielectric constant by Percoemeter in laboratory at varying moisture content. Later, the dielectric constants at varying moisture content are incorporated during the post-processing of GPR data, and thus, the level of consistency is improved. In case of PSPA, <b>quick-setting</b> capping, i. e., a mixture of Plaster of Paris and fine content, is made on AC surface at different locations prior to the tests to ensure firm and smooth contact surfaces. It is observed that consistency of PSPA measurements and interpreted results is improved significantly.

40|$|A {{borehole}} drilled at Fiumicino (Rome) down to only 27 m {{depth in}} a zone where no gas emission {{at the surface}} was known, caused a gas blowout from a pressurized gas pocket confined beneath a clay cover. Gas slowly diffused from the borehole within superficial permeable sand. Seven persons living in three ground floor flats of a near building had to be hospitalized due to CO 2 exposure. All the houses in the proximity were evacuated. At {{the request of the}} Fire Brigade two additional boreholes were drilled nearby, hoping that this could rapidly exhaust the gas stored underground. To the contrary the soil gas flux near houses increased and indoor CO 2 air concentration rapidly rose to lethal values (15 to 30 vol. %). As a remediation we suggested to restore the continuity of the impervious gas cover by squeezing <b>quick-setting</b> cement into the formation through new boreholes to be drilled near the existing ones. Although the first cement squeeze reduced drastically the CO 2 soil flux and indoor concentration, six additional squeezes had to be carried out in order to lower the gas emission below the gas hazard threshold. The gas was mostly made of CO 2 (98 vol. %) with minor N 2 and CH 4. Its chemical and isotopic composition (δ 13 CCO 2 = − 1. 55; 3 He/ 4 He = 0. 314 Ra) {{is similar to that of}} the gas manifestations of Mts. Sabatini and Alban Hills volcanic areas. Though being somewhat contaminated by crustal and shallow organic volatiles, these gases likely have a component originated in the mantle, that beneath the volcanic Roman Comagmatic Province is probably deeply contaminated with crustal material.

Several ideas have been put forwards about marine animals' ability to orientate and navigate at sea (Mills Flemming et al. 2006, Lohmann et al. 2008, Chapman et al. 2011). However, little work {{has been carried out}} on seals (but see Matsumura et al. 2011). A number of experiments have been conducted on captive seals in order to test their sensory systems and orientation capacities (e. g., Kowalewsky et al. 2006, Mauck et al. 2008), but such experiments are difficult to conduct on free-ranging seals. Modeling the animals' movements at sea in relation to environmental variables may elucidate the cues they use to orient and navigate. However, such free-ranging animal movements are always subject to the influence of local currents (Lohmann et al. 2008). Thus the incorporation of current data is necessary to reveal underlying navigational capabilities and strategies (Willis 2011). In this study, we model the observed sea surface tracks of two gray seals (Halichoerus grypus) that had crossed the English Channel in September 2011 (Fig. 1, 2). The seals (referred to as B 23 and B 24), were tracked by Fastloc GPS/GSM telemetry techniques. Their surface positions were drawn from the series of Fastloc GPS locations transmitted by GPS phone tags developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit. 2 These were glued to the animal's fur on the neck behind the head with <b>quick-setting</b> epoxy.

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} arising {{during construction}} and restructuring of {{buildings and structures}} in urban areas are considered in the article. A brief analysis of the knowhow used {{in the course of}} construction and restructuring of new and old construction facilities shows that the construction works that are most hazardous to the environment consist in demolition of buildings or their parts using the explosive method of demolition and stone dressing using high-speed cutting and grinding machines. These types of work generate a lot of construction waste and dust harmful for the environment. Despite any scheduled environmental protection actions, construction wastes pollute each component of the environment to a different extent. Environmental protection is a complex problem of vital importance, and the international community must concentrate its efforts to tackle it as soon as possible. Analysis of unauthorized landfills and methods of urban waste management help local communities to develop and implement methods of environmental protection. New effective know-hows are employed to reduce the impact of soil pollutants and to prevent further pollution of urban ponds in the course of construction works within urban areas. Advanced patented methodologies have been developed at Samara State University of Architecture and Civil Engineering. They include the use of <b>quick-setting</b> substances capable of generating impervious elements. Implementation of these methods will reduce pollution of urban areas, their atmosphere, ground waters and ponds. The authors also describe particular aspects of the impact produced by the mining industry on the environment. Values of river water quality indices have been studied, and new effective actions aimed at protection of ponds from pollution are proposed. The actions prevent access of pollutants to the pond.

Several analytical techniques were used such as digital videomicroscopy, optical microscopy, digital image analysis, scanning electron microscopy coupled with EDS analysis and Quantitative Powder X-ray Diffraction. A multi-layer technology characterised the plasters; the scratch coat was made with lime mortars mixed with a pozzolanic lightweight aggregate and cocciopesto, required ingredients providing a <b>quick-setting</b> and a better adhesion with the support. As far as the arriccio layer is concerned, the mix-design is a lime mortar with volcanic sand as the aggregate and a minor content of pozzolan and/or cocciopesto to enhance the workability of the mortar in order to correct any error due to the roughness of the scratch coat. The plaster s. s. was the removable support in case of mistakes, and gave a lighter colour to the preparation layer of the frescoes. The last thin layer, prepared with lime mortars and a carbonate aggregate, is characterised by low porosity in order to avoid pigment adsorption. The painting technique was a fresco with encaustication. In contrast, the mortars of the building structures were made with lime added to a pozzolanic aggregate (volcanics and cocciopesto), giving a quick setting during the implementation of the yellow tuff opus reticulatum. The rudera and nuclei of the mosaics were built with abundant volcanic sand and cocciopesto mixed with the lime, producing a more resistant surface, and finally the tesserae were fixed exclusively with lime. The white and black colours of the mosaics were produced by local limestone and tephritic lava. The results permitted an evaluation of the high level of specialization of both the workers and the artists that built and decorated these maritime villas. Moreover, the collected data highlighted the wide potentiality of the materials cropping out in the environs of the Somma-Vesuvius volcanic complex. This research aims at furnishing a useful reference for future restoration action in Villa San Marco and the other Roman villas in this area...|$|E

The NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory (PRL) cooperated with HeiTech Corp. of Virginia, Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd. of Queensland, Australia, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) in three separate research programs to evaluate the strength characteristics and air leakage resistance of numerous innovative seal designs and ventilation control structures for use in underground coal mines. For each phase of the program, various full-scale seals, stoppings, and an overcast design were constructed in PRL's Lake Lynn Experimental Mine near Fairchance, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. The seals and stoppings were built in crosscuts and were subjected to explosions to evaluate their strengths. Four pumpable cementitious seal designs ranging in thickness from 610 to 915 mm (24 to 36 in) were evaluated in the first cost-reimbursable research program with HeiTech Corp. A simple wooden framework with brattice liner {{was used as a}} form to contain the cementitious slurry during the curing period. As the seal designs decreased in thickness, higher compressive strength cementitious grout was used. All four seals withstood an explosion pressure pulse of at least 138 kPa (20 psi) while maintaining acceptable air leakage resistance. In the second cost-reimbursable research program with Barclay Mowlem Construction Ltd. of Australia, several innovative seal and stopping designs and an overcast design were evaluated. Each of the seal designs and the overcast side and wing walls used one or more air-inflated vinyl bladder assemblies anchored to the mine roof and hitched into the ribs and floor. The air within these bladders was displaced with a high-strength cementitious grout. The overcast deck consisted of a 200 -mm (7. 8 -in) thick reinforced cementitious slab. This {{was the first time that}} an overcast structure had been explosion tested under full-scale conditions. All of the seals, stoppings, and overcast design passed the air leakage tests before being subjected to a series of explosions with static pressure pulses ranging from 14 to 475 kPa (2 to 69 psi). Instrumentation measured seal and overcast wall displacement as a function of time. The 450 -mm(17. 7 -in) thick seal in the 2. 8 -m(9 -ft) high third crosscut withstood an explosion pressure of 170 kPa (25 psi), but failed during a later test, which generated a peak static pressure of 475 kPa (69 psi) at the seal location. A similar 450 -mm-thick seal in the 2. l-m (7 -ft) high second crosscut withstood three explosion tests, which generated peak static pressures of 195, 205, and 370 kPa (28, 30, and 54 psi) at the seal location. Next, the overcast design withstood four explosions, which generated static overpressures ranging from 16 to 47 kPa (2. 3 to 6. 8 psi). A third program at the request of MSHA evaluated the effectiveness of using pressurized grout bags (Packsetter bags) along the mine roof and ribs in lieu of floor and rib hitching for a standard-type solid- concrete-block seal. This program was initiated to address an unusual geological mining condition encountered when building seals in entries where required rib hitching is not a viable option due to soft friable coal. Results showed that the use of these <b>quick-setting</b> grout-filled Packsetter bags pressurized internally to 300 kPa (44 psi) not only provides a seal that can withstand a l 38 -kPa static pressure explosion, but also provides a sealing option where rib hitching is not possible.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated rotary percussive drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a rotary percussive bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a <b>quick-setting,</b> two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks. The adhesion strength of the test core is determined by converting the maximum hydraulic pressure value, saved on the pressure gauge's digital display, to the maximum tensile stress acting normal to the core's failure surface. Typical adhesion test results comparing tensile strength with shotcrete curing age are shown in Figure 4. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "June 2011.
