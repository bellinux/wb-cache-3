5|$|Gyges– Featured in the God of War comics #4, #5, and #6, {{he was one}} of {{the three}} Chaos Giants with one hundred arms and fifty heads. During Kratos' first <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ambrosia, his battle with Cereyon burned off the hundred arms of Gyges. During Kratos' second quest, Gyges {{revealed}} that he had planned to use the Ambrosia to revive his brothers, Briareus and Cottus, and then reclaim the world, but Kratos' initial retrieval thwarted that plan. Kratos destroyed both Gyges and the Tree of Life — which contained the Ambrosia — with the Fire of Apollo.|$|E

5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to retire from the role of James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, which was fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films were negotiated on a film-by-film basis. Given his reluctance to return for Octopussy, the producers engaged in a semi-public <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next Bond, with both Timothy Dalton and James Brolin being suggested. However, when the rival Never Say Never Again was announced, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against Sean Connery.

Before For Your Eyes Only had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy. George MacDonald Fraser wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.|$|E

5|$|In November1906 the American Robert Peary {{returned}} from his latest unsuccessful <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> North Pole, claiming a new Farthest North of 87°6′—a record disputed by later historians. He immediately began raising funds for a further attempt. In July1907 Dr Frederick Cook, a former shipmate of Amundsen's from Belgica, set off northwards on what was ostensibly a hunting trip but was rumoured to be an attempt on the North Pole. A month later Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition sailed for Antarctica, while Robert Falcon Scott was preparing a further expedition should Shackleton fail. Amundsen {{saw no reason to}} concede priority in the south to the British, and spoke publicly about the prospects of leading an Antarctic expedition—although his preferred goal remained the North Pole.|$|E
5|$|Intent {{on keeping}} his {{succession}} secure, Cnut sent Ironside's two infant sons, Edward and Edmund Ætheling, {{to his brother}} in Sweden, where {{they were to be}} murdered. Instead, the princes were spared and sent to safety to the Kingdom of Hungary, where they remained in the care of King Stephen I. After fleeing assassins hired by Cnut, the Æthelings arrived at the royal court of Kievan Rus' in 1028. The princes remained under the tutelage of Prince Yaroslav the Wise until adulthood. In 1046, the Æthelings both traveled to Hungary and helped the exiled Andrew of Hungary in his <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> throne. Edmund died shortly after marrying a Hungarian princess, before 1054.|$|E
5|$|Rivalries were renewed in 1999–2000 {{following}} Manchester City's promotion back to {{the second}} tier. Stockport County beat Manchester City at Maine Road {{for the first time}} in history (1999–2000) thanks to goals from former City youngster Alan Bailey and County legend Tony Dinning. Manchester City were famously defeated once more by Stockport County in 2001–02, when 2 late goals from John Hardiker handed bottom of the table Stockport victory, and in the process City were prevented from gaining 100 points in their <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Division One title. Stockport County and Manchester City met six times between 1997 and 2002, with Stockport County winning three times, losing once and drawing twice. The defeats suffered at the hands of County clearly touched a raw nerve with many Manchester City supporters, some of whom have celebrated County's downfall on the 'bluemoon' forum. The rivalry with City is made all the more complex by the fact that Stockport is a hotbed for Manchester City support.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, the talking weasel Koppa, on a <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Land of the Golden Condor. They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling woman who has the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at the condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking away into the night.|$|E
5|$|Thuyet {{had already}} decided to place Hàm Nghi {{at the head of}} the Phong Trào Cần Vuơng (Loyalty to the Emperor Movement), which sought to end French rule with a royalist rebellion. Phan helped the cause by setting up bases in Hà Tĩnh and {{creating}} his own guerrilla army. Thuyet had hoped to secure support from the Qing Dynasty of China, but Phan thought that Vietnam's best chance of effective support came from Siam. Gia Long, the founder of the Nguyễn Dynasty and great-grandfather of Tự Đức, had married his sister off to the King of Siam. He had also used Siam as a base-in-exile during his <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> throne in the 1780s. However, direct appeals to the Siamese government only yielded a few pack trains of firearms and ammunition. In preparation for the revolt, Thuyet had been building up an armed base at Tan So for over a year.|$|E
5|$|Weaver privately {{supported}} Bryan's <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Democratic {{nomination in}} 1896, which their convention awarded {{him on the}} fifth ballot. When the Populist convention gathered the next month in Chicago, they divided between endorsing the silverite Democrat and preserving their new party's independence. Weaver backed the former course, holding the issues the party stood for to be of more importance than the party itself. A majority of delegates agreed, but without the enthusiasm that had marked their convention of four years earlier. At the same time, Weaver joined with anti-fusionists to keep the Populist platform from deviating from the party's ideological principles. Against the fusion candidate stood Republican William McKinley of Ohio, a hard-money conservative. Bryan succeeded in uniting the South and West, Weaver's longtime dream, but with the more populous North solidly behind McKinley, Bryan lost the election.|$|E

5|$|Athena was the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos' {{mentor and}} ally {{throughout}} the Greek {{era in the}} series. In Chains of Olympus, Athena initially tasked Kratos to find Helios as {{in the absence of}} light, the god Morpheus had caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber. In God of War, she gave Kratos the mission of killing Ares, as Zeus had forbidden divine involvement, and was instrumental in allowing Kratos to become the new God of War. Although she begged Kratos to stop his second <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ambrosia of Asclepius in the God of War comic series and lied to him about his brother Deimos in Ghost of Sparta, Athena was still sympathetic towards Kratos even after he renounced the gods and was betrayed by Zeus in God of War II. Athena died trying to protect Zeus from Kratos, and was resurrected and elevated to a new level of understanding in God of War III. With ulterior motives, Athena became Kratos' ally once more and guided him to the Flame of Olympus surrounding Pandora's Box, which allowed Kratos to kill Zeus and end the reign of Mount Olympus.|$|E
5|$|The King of Sparta– Featured in God of War comic #6. The King's Guard was {{convinced}} by Kratos' wife Lysandra to allow Kratos {{to embark on}} a <b>quest</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Ambrosia that would restore their plague-stricken daughter, Calliope. Kratos and his men were given until the next full moon to return before the King executed his daughter. Ultimately successful, Kratos returned, saved Calliope, and gave the rest of the elixir to the King. The King then officially awarded Kratos with the rank of Captain. The King of Sparta also appears as an illusion created by Tisiphone in Ascension where he honors Kratos for his service as his best general. Kratos believed what he was seeing at first until he saw Tisiphone's ring on the king's finger. He kicked Tisiphone off the balcony, dispelling her illusion. When Kratos {{was on the verge of}} victory over the Furies, Tisiphone changed into the form of the King once again, telling him that he was unworthy of being called a Spartan. The character was voiced by Crispin Freeman in Ascension.|$|E
