50|$|The Demaree {{method is}} a frame-exchange method, {{and as such}} it is more labour {{intensive}} than methods that do not involve rearranging individual frames. It requires no special equipment except for a <b>queen</b> <b>excluder.</b> In this method, the queen is confined to the bottom box below the <b>queen</b> <b>excluder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the modern}} Demaree method, the queen {{is placed in}} the bottom box, along with one or two frames of brood (but {{containing}} no open brood), as well as one or two frames of food stores, and empty combs or foundation. A <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> is placed above the bottom box, thereby restricting the queen to the bottom box but allowing bees to move freely between the bottom box {{and the rest of the}} hive. The original hive, along with all open brood, is placed above the <b>queen</b> <b>excluder.</b> The method works best if the nurse bees are remove far away from the queen. The distance between the queen and nurse bees can be increased by placing the brood nest at the very top of the hive, with the honey supers between the brood nest and the <b>queen</b> <b>excluder.</b> If any swarm cells are present, these must be destroyed by the beekeeper. The relative absence of queen pheromone in the top box usually prompts the nurse bees to create emergency cells. After 7-10 days, the beekeeper destroys the emergency cells, and then either removes the <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> (thereby ending the [...] "demaree") or repeats the process a second or a third time until the swarming impulse is over.|$|E

50|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> is a mesh grid, {{usually made}} of wire or plastic, sized such that worker bees can pass through, but queens ({{generally}}) cannot. When used, {{it is generally}} placed between the hive body and the honey supers. The purpose of the <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> {{is to keep the}} queen from laying eggs in the honey supers, which can lead to darker honey and can also complicate extraction. Many beekeepers reject the use of queen excluders, however, claiming that they create a barrier for workers and result in lower levels of honey collection and storage.|$|E
50|$|In beekeeping, the <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> is a {{selective}} barrier inside the beehive that allows worker bees {{but not the}} larger queens and drones to traverse the barrier.

40|$|The {{effects of}} miticides on the {{reproductive}} physiology of queens and drones were examined. The first {{study examined the}} effects of Apistan ® (fluvalinate), Check Mite+ (coumaphos), and Apilife VAR ® (74 % thymol) on sperm production and viability in drones. Drones from colonies treated with each miticide were collected at sexual maturity. Sperm production was determined by counting the number of sperm in the seminal vesicles. Sperm for viability assays was analyzed by dual fluorescent staining. Apilife VAR ® and coumaphos significantly lowered (P< 0. 0001) sperm production and coumaphos treatments caused a significant decrease (P< 0. 0001) in the sperm viability. The effects of miticides on queens was examined by treating queen-rearing colonies and examining the number and viability of sperm in the spermathecae of newly mated queens.

50|$|The {{intent of}} the <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> is to limit the queen's access to the honey supers. If the queen lays eggs in the honey supers and a brood {{develops}} {{it is difficult to}} harvest a clean honey product and it makes fall management more difficult. Queen excluders are removed in the autumn; otherwise, the queen {{would not be able to}} move with the winter cluster and would die from exposure. The death of the queen in winter will doom the hive as the beekeeper will not be able to have any new queen introduced in the spring accepted by the hive.|$|E
5000|$|Prokopovych {{studied the}} biology of bee colonies and strove to improve {{existing}} methods of beekeeping. His main intention was to develop methods that allowed the least disturbance and damage to bees. These efforts resulted in 1814 in {{the invention of the}} world's first frame hive, which allowed an easier honey harvest. [...] Another invention was a wooden partition with apertures passable only by worker bees, now called a <b>queen</b> <b>excluder.</b> It made possible the harvest of pure honey from the frames. Prokopovych's inventions represented a landmark in the history of beekeeping and marked the beginning of commercial beekeeping. His scientific work resulted in more than sixty articles in printed media such as newspapers and magazines.|$|E
50|$|Some beekeepers {{believe that}} queen excluders result in less {{efficient}} movement for worker bees, and therefore {{prefer not to}} use queen excluders, but rather to control {{the location of the}} queen by other methods. This belief is based on the observation that the bees tend to be less prone to move up the hive into the supers when a <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> is used, preferring to fill cells in the brood box with nectar and honey first. This behaviour constrains the size of the brood nest which the queen can lay eggs in, which has two effects on the colony: the buildup rate of workers is constrained and a dearth of space for the queen to lay can lead to swarm preparations.|$|E
50|$|Langstroth {{also found}} that several {{communicating}} hive boxes can be stacked one above another and that the queen can be confined to the lowest, or brood, chamber, {{by means of a}} <b>queen</b> <b>excluder.</b> In this way, the upper chambers can be reached only by the workers and therefore contain only honey-comb. This made hive inspection and many other management practices possible and turned the art of beekeeping into a full-scale industry. At the time of Langstroth's contributions, honey was the chief sweetener in American diets, so Langstroth's new beekeeping techniques were of great importance. His discoveries and inventions allowed beekeeping to be done more cost-effectively on a large scale. Since four to twelve pounds of honey, and many hours of bee time, are consumed by bees in the production of one pound of beeswax, honey production was increased from reuse of the comb.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{removable}} frame hives the nursery area {{is in the}} brood chamber, which beekeepers prefer {{to be in the}} bottom box. In the late winter and early spring as the brood cycle begins, the queen starts to lay eggs within the winter cluster in proximity to available honey stores. Honey bees tend to greatly expand the brood chamber as the season progresses. The relative location of the brood chamber within the beehive may also change as bee keepers add more boxes or as wild bees build fresh comb into available cavities. Some beekeepers ensure that the queen will not go into the upper boxes (called supers or honey supers) by placing a screen called a <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> between the boxes. The screen has precisely measured open spaces through which a worker bee can pass, but not a queen. Some beekeepers do not use excluders, but try to keep the queen within the intended brood area by keeping a honey barrier of capped honey, which the queen is reluctant to cross, above the brood. In feral hives the honey bees tend to put the brood at bottom center of the cavity, and honey to the sides and above the brood, so beekeepers are trying to follow the natural tendency of the bees.|$|E
5000|$|Hattie Ellis {{describes}} John Evelyn's hive as [...] "stripped down", {{as it was}} in one of Christopher Wren's first architectural drawings, (it was) a {{stack of}} wooden boxes with small holes between them so the bees could leave their honey in one box and crawl down to the next". Ellis uses Evelyn's illustration of this hive but overlooks that, whereas Wren's drawing does show [...] "small holes", there is no corresponding hole in Evelyn's drawing: the central area is occupied by a fixed board with moveable boards on either side. These function {{in exactly the same way}} as the top bars and sliders in the Stewarton Hive. Thus, Evelyn appears to have invented a <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> system about 150 years before anyone else. Furthermore, close examination of Evelyn's drawing seesm to show quite clearly that Evelyn began to draw a hexagonal hive, but changed his mind and completed it as an octagon. Thus Ellis is probably wrong when she claims that the octagonal hive [...] "was the cabinet-maker's approximation of the honey bee's round nest". If this was so in Evelyn's hive, then he would have drawn an octagon at the outset. The octagon was necessary to allow the insertion of the queen excluding board. This was no cabinet-maker's fancy, but a deliberate technological device.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the actual}} {{elementary}} biologic principles of the introduction of queen is that the recipient co­lo­ny has to be queenless.

40|$|In honeybees (Apis mellifera L.) {{the queen}} monopolises reproduction. However, {{especially}} after queen loss, workers can lay eggs, but {{are unable to}} mate. They produce haploid male offspring (drones) from unfertilised eggs via arrhenotokous parthenogenesis. In contrast, workers of the honeybee subspecies Apis mellifera capensis Eschscholtz typically produce diploid female offspring from unfertilised eggs thelytokously. After queen loss and without queen-derived brood A. m. capensis colonies can successfully requeen from worker-derived brood. This, however, is a relatively rare event in wild populations. Moreover, workerderived queens were described to be smaller, more worker-like and reproductively inferior. On the other hand, the fixation of the thelytokous trait relies mainly on sufficient numbers of viable drones produced by worker-derived queens. Small numbers of reproductively inferior worker-derived queens in A. m. capensis populations would be clearly counterintuitive. It is therefore necessary to quantify the significance of worker-dependant queen rearing pathways on the individual (queen) and on population level. Reproductive inferiority of worker-derived queens could not be confirmed on the individual (queen) level when comparing parameters indicating potential reproductive success of queen- and worker-derived queens. Queen- and worker-derived queens clearly showed a congruent range of reproductive performance. In queen rearing preference tests, increased acceptance of worker-derived female larvae was exactly counterbalanced by increased mortality, resulting in {{an equal number of}} eclosing virgin queens from an equal number of grafts in both test groups. Larval survival and successful eclosion is a prerequisite for a queen’s reproductive success. I found no difference in eclosion success for queen- and worker-derived virgin queens, indicating a similar potential for reproductive success in both queen types. Assessments of the developmental patterns of colonies headed by both queen and worker-derived queens in long-term experiments revealed no significant differences in reproductive success. Colonies headed by queen-derived queens and colonies headed by worker-derived queens could not be separated when comparing the different developmental pathways observed or from differences in worker-force. Reproductive dominance in A. m. capensis appeared tobe determined by a function of relative compositional and absolute quantitative pheromonal patterns, where individuals, which produce compositionally most queen-like blends in highest quantities, occupy top positions. Queen- and worker-derived virgin queens occupied intermediate positions between pseudoqueens and mated queens. However, {{no significant differences between the}} pheromonal status of queen- and worker-derived virgin queens were observed, suggesting a similar range of reproductive dominance for both queen types. In behavioural bioassays queen- and worker-derived virgin queens appeared to be similarly attractive to clustering workers and to drones in a drone congregation area, indicating no differences in potential reproductive success for queens from both origins for those parameters. The significant influence of the queen substance 9 -ODA on attractiveness to workers and drones was confirmed. Rare requeening events from worker-derived female brood in queenless A. m. capensis do not satisfactorily explain the fixation of the thelytokous trait at a population level. I observed A. m. capensis worker ovipositing into empty artificial queen cell cups in queen-right colonies. The queen was confined behind a <b>queen</b> <b>excluder</b> grid in a separate compartment of the colony, to imitate reduced pheromonal flow, similar to swarming or superseding colonies. Eggs oviposited by workers in artificial queen cell cups were readily accepted for queen rearing and successful eclosion of viable virgin queens was observed. Consequently I suggested an alternative worker-dependant reproductive pathway in A. m. capensis, which was never described before: In swarming or superseding queenright colonies, laying workers may directly compete with the queen for reproductive success by ovipositing (instead of the queen) into natural queen cell cups. At a population level this reproductive tactic may result in large numbers of worker-derived queens of high reproductive quality in natural populations of A. m. capensis. ...|$|E
