Decisions of arbitral tribunal reveal that there is no single attitude in defining of an investment. Several approaches can be seen: (i) the investment shall pass the critetia of an investment pursuant to the relevant BIT and the criteria of an investment of ICSID Convention which have been elaborated by the case-law (Salini test and its modifications), (ii) the investment shall fulfil criteria of an investment of ICSID Convention which have been elaborated by the case-law, while the criteria provided in the relevant BIT are not so important, (iii) the only relevant definition of an invesment is provided in the relevant BIT, as there is no explicit definition of an investment in the ICSID Convention, [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Suitable legal fund {{structures}} for private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) investments and their tax treatment {{have been considered}} as a key factor for stimulating the business environment. The Czech Venture Capital Association stresses that legal barriers are an important reason behind the limited scope of resources available to domestic PE/VC funds. Legal barriers prevent {{the establishment of a}} standard PE/VC fund in the territory of the Czech Republic, which fact in turn has a negative impact on the level of development of the domestic PE/VC market. In order to encourage the development of the market, this paper addresses filling the existing research gap concerning the following issues of the Czech PE/VC market: How the current Czech legislation regulates the legal fund {{structures for}} PE/VC investments? What is the tax treatment of PE/VC funds and individual investors in the Czech Republic? What are the legal and tax regulations on the main European markets for PE/VC? What are the key requirements for improvements of the current situation on the Czech PE/VC market? The nature of this study is explorative and it relies on primary and secondary data. Results of the study stress that the non-existence of the Limited Partnership legal form in particular is a weak spot of the current Czech legislation. The only Czech legal structure for PE/VC investments – the <b>Qualified</b> <b>Investor</b> Fund – does not sufficiently accommodate the requirements of market participants. Inadequate manner of market regulations can also be pointed out in addition to inflexible corporate law, tax obstructions and non-transparency of the current structures. In conclusion this study formulates proposals how to change the existing corporate law and the regulation of the PE/VC financial market segment in the Czech Republic. The proposals are based on models provided by selected European countries and create suitable conditions for a successful development of the Czech PE/VC market.
