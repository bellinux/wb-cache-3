50|$|A bailout valve is an {{open circuit}} demand valve fitted to the {{mouthpiece}} of a rebreather with a manually operated mechanism to switch from closed circuit to open circuit. The position selecting the open circuit demand valve may substitute for the closed state of a dive-surface valve (DSV) as the breathing loop is effectively sealed when on bailout. A bailout valve allows the diver to switch from closed circuit to open circuit without the need to change mouthpieces. This can save time in an emergency, as the bailout demand valve is in place for immediate use. Gas supply to the BOV is often from the on-board diluent cylinder, but arrangements {{can be made for}} off-board gas to be plumbed in using <b>quick</b> <b>connectors.</b>|$|E

The cylinders are normally rigged with open circuit regulators in the standard DIR configuration for bailout, and a supply hose with <b>quick</b> <b>connector</b> on each for the rebreather supply.|$|R
50|$|A few {{secondary}} highways remain gravel-surfaced, {{although most}} have been paved. The speed limit on {{nearly all of}} these routes is 80 km/h (50 mph), although Highway 655 is posted at 90 km/h (56 mph). The majority of length in the secondary highway system consists of a single continuous yellow centerline, though some segments are up to King's highway standards either because they serve as a <b>quick</b> <b>connector</b> to them (like Highway 655), or because they are former alignments of King's Highways, or because they approach an intersection with a King's Highway.|$|R
5000|$|Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath came to Birch's shop {{after having}} his ideas {{rejected}} by the major guitar manufacturers of the time, such as Gibson and Fender. Iommi was {{looking for someone to}} make him a guitar with a 24-fret fingerboard and high-power/low-noise pickups. Iommi's red Gibson SG Special received some modification {{in the form of a}} re-covered Gibson P-90 in the bridge position and John Birch's own Superflux in the neck position. This guitar is in the Times Square Hard Rock Cafe. In 1975, Birch built Iommi his black 24-fret, cross-inlay SG Special. This was the main guitar used on the albums Technical Ecstasy, Never Say Die, Heaven and Hell, and Mob Rules. This guitar is now in the Miami Hard Rock Cafe. Around the same time Birch's SG was built, John Diggins also built Iommi's Jaydee SG, which features a custom-wound pickup by Diggins in the bridge position and a standard Biflux in the neck position. The guitar also has peeled and cracked paint due to a rushed finish job. During the Cross Purposes tour, the guitar was left in a hot car on a date in Brazil, and the finish bubbled and cracked due to the heat. This guitar was first used for some overdubbing on Heaven and Hell, but quickly became Iommi's main guitar. The Birch shop also built a guitar for Tony that featured the ability to remove and replace pickups. The pickups plugged through the back into slots which had <b>quick</b> <b>connectors</b> that allowed them to be pulled and replaced easily, and didn't require any soldering. This allowed for more tonal options than any standard guitar, no matter how complex its wiring. Geezer Butler also had some basses made by Birch, one of which can be seen in the music video for Black Sabbath's [...] "A Hard Road." ...|$|E
40|$|Underwater cables {{have been}} {{connecting}} continents since the 1860 s. Over time, {{the process of}} laying cables at sea has developed into a state-of-the-art operation. Now these operations are becoming more technologically advanced {{and it is possible}} to lay large diameter electric cables over large distances. One method is to lay cables in two or more lengths to have them jointed together mid-sea. A particular challenge will occur in case an unplanned splicing will be necessary. In this thesis, we will explore the design criteria for such cables and the procedures and challenges of installation. Furthermore, the effects of how dynamic motions of the vessel and sea influence the situation in deep water will be explored. The OrcaFlex software will be used to simulate and analyze the effects of waves on vessel motion, and how this may affect the cable during a jointing operation of two cables at different water depths. The effects of current forces on the cable are to be analyzed and how the cable reacts to both current and wave forces. This analysis method can assist in determining the weather criteria for a jointing operation to prevent excessive bending, compression or fatigue damage in the cable. When installing a cable in an area with currents, one needs {{to take into account the}} direction of the currents relative to the cable, as tension and bending of the cable are highly affected by the direction and strength of the current. From the OrcaFlex analysis, one can see that vessel motion due to waves are more critical to the cable with respect to fatigue damage in shallow water (100 m) than in deep water (1200 m). The residual bottom tension in the cable at the touch down point is, however, more sensitive to the vessel motion at deep water than in shallow water. In areas with waves and currents, a current approaching the cable at 0 degrees will decrease the critical parameters. The bottom tension is less affected by the vessel motion and the cable will experience less bending cycles over the laying wheel. With a large current approaching at 180 degrees (i. e. toward the vessel), the bending of the cable increases and hence the cable may experience fatigue damage sooner. The bottom tension in the cable will become more sensitive to vessel motions in this situation and the risk of loops developing will increase as tension decreases. By changing the location of the laying wheel, one can improve the situation. Placing the wheel closer to the center of the stern will reduce the effect of vessel motion on cable tension. The cyclic bending of the cable is, however, less affected by changing the laying wheel location. A HAZID carried out for cable installation, shows that there are many risks and hazardous events that may occur during the operation in connection to the cables integrity. Handling these risks early may reduce both their probability of occurring and the related consequences. One finding in the analysis is that there are different requirements for laying cable and jointing operations. The suitable sea states for jointing are more limited than for laying. When vessel and cable are standing still, all bending occurs at the same place in the cable, resulting in increased risk of fatigue damage, hence it is necessary with a calmer sea state for this kind of operation. Future work might emphasis on developing <b>quick</b> <b>connectors</b> to quickly join cable ends offshore. Reference is here made to the offshore oil and gas industry’s underwater connectors...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, the Department of Highways assumed the route {{north of the}} Hamilton & Queenston Provincial Highway (Highway 8) as Provincial Highway 8A, a <b>quick</b> <b>connector</b> to Highway 2 via Hamilton Beach (the site of the current Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway bridge). It was renamed Highway 20 when the route {{connecting}} it to Niagara Falls was completed, and a traffic circle (bisected by a railway) was created for the intersection with the Queen Elizabeth Way, completed in 1939. A series of provincial downloads in the late 1990s saw the majority of Highway 20 downloaded to municipal and regional authorities; the City of Hamilton now maintains the entire route within its borders as (Upper) Centennial Parkway, or [...] "Hamilton Highway 20".|$|R
40|$|Several {{commonly}} used mechanical connectors {{in the field}} of medical equipment was enumerated and analyzed in this paper. A mechanical <b>quick</b> <b>connector</b> for medical equipment was designed. The mechanical structure was designed for quick connection needed {{in the field of}} mechanical equipment. It could save valuable emergency time and make it easier for changing or cleaning medical equipment. Several calculations were done to make sure the mechanical structure would work. The actual mechanism was processed, and it could connect/disconnect quickly and stably, which proved the feasibility of the design. The force that needed from an operator to disconnect the holding device was 1. 2 N, which was in the comfortable range of the force that human could provide by a single hand. The whole design conformed to the requirement of miniaturization and facilitation for medical equipmentIEEE Robotics and Automation Societ...|$|R
50|$|In the UK, male/female <b>quick</b> release <b>connectors</b> (red line or emergency), have {{a female}} {{on the truck}} and male on the trailer, but a yellow line or service has a male on the truck and female on the trailer. This avoids {{coupling}} errors (causing no brakes) plus the connections will not come apart if pulled by accident.

50|$|Likewise, only {{second to}} the BMW i3 REx, the 53 mi all-electric range is the second longest-range {{achieved}} by any plug-in hybrid car available for sale. Chevrolet expects that many 2016 Volt owners will run on battery only for 90% of their daily trips, up from 80% for the first generation owners based on OnStar data and other studies. To increase the electrically driven miles, the Volt would need better charging capabilities. The Volt's onboard charger can only handle 3.6 kW though, which is sufficient for overnight charging at the owner's home but falls short of the capabilities of public chargers. The Volt also lacks a DC <b>quick</b> charging <b>connector.</b>|$|R
50|$|SnapN was {{originally}} designed by Rosenberger Hochfrequenztechnik in 2006 {{and is a}} quick locking replacement for the threaded interface of the widely applied Type N connector. Though part of the Quick Lock Formula Alliance (QLF), engineers at Rosenberger independently designed the SnapN in order to correct the performance problems of QLF’s version of the <b>quick</b> lock N <b>connector,</b> QN. This design achieves better electronic performance because, unlike the QN, this new version maintains the basic structural parameters of the original Type N in which the inner dimensions of the outer conductor are 7.00 mm, and the inner conductor’s outer dimensions are 3.04 mm. A male N-connector can plug into an female SnapN.|$|R
50|$|Open heel fins are {{secured to}} the foot by a strap which passes {{around the back of}} the ankle. These are usually elastic and may be adjustable. Early fins used rubber straps {{connected}} to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, <b>quick</b> release <b>connectors</b> and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include stainless steel spring straps and bungee straps, which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like net, line and seaweed. Some heel straps have a loop for better grip with wet hands or gloves.Some fins designed for surf use have integral straps which can neither be replaced nor adjusted, but are simple and have no projections which can snag or scratch the swimmer's legs. They are much like full foot pocket fins without the back part of the sole, but do not trap as much sand when used in the surf.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the Space Station Freedom tasks that are compatible with both telerobotic as well as extravehicular activity is a necessary redundancy {{in order to insure}} successful day to day operation. One task to be routinely performed aboard Freedom will be the changeout of various <b>quick</b> disconnect fluid <b>connectors.</b> In an attempt to resolve these potentially contradictory issues of compatibility, mock-ups of couplings suitable to both extravehicular as well as telerobotic activity were designed and built. An evaluation performed at the Remote Operator Interaction Laboratory at NASA's Johnson Space Center is discussed, which assessed the prototype couplings as well as three standard coupling designs. Data collected during manual and telerobotic manipulation of the couplings indicated that the custom coupling was in fact shown to be faster to operate and generally preferred over the standard coupling designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this project}} are to develop <b>connectors</b> (<b>quick</b> disconnects and umbilical systems) that can be repetitively and reliably mated and de-mated during Lunar surface extra-vehicular activities. These standardized interfaces will be required for structural integrity and commodities transfer between linked surface elements. QD's fittings are needed for EVA spacesuit Primary Life Support Systems as well as liquid cooled garment circulation and suit heat rejection. Umbilical electro-mechanical systems (connectors) are needed between discrete surface systems for transfer of air, power, fluid (water), and data must be capable of being operated by extra vehicular astronaut crew members and/or robotic assistants. There exists an urgent need to prevent electro-statically charged dust and debris from clogging and degrading the interface seals and causing leakage and spills of hazardous commodities, contaminating the flowstream, and degrading the mechanisms needed for umbilical connection. Other challenges include modularity, standardization, autonomous operation, and lifetime sealing issues...|$|R
30|$|Most of the non-weld {{connectors}} are {{supplied by}} offshore oil-gas service companies from America and Europe, such as Oil states industries Inc, Cameron, FMC Technologies, Oceaneering International Inc, Quality Connector LLC and Hydratight. Static metal seal based Connectors include tapping connector and method of using same [5], swivel ring flange, external hydraulic tieback connector [6], subsea tool for tie in of pipeline ends [7] and adapter sleeve for wellhead housing [8]. Rubber sealed connectors include pipeline joint [9], over 2000 morgrip connector and coupling device [10]. The other connectors with metal and rubber seal include griplock end connector, smart flange plus <b>connector,</b> <b>quick</b> flange morgrip pipeline connector and hydraulic smart flange connector. The above typical connectors are reliable to connect subsea pipelines, but their design is too complicated. Too many bolts {{have to be}} pre-tightened and operation tools have {{to be used for}} connection, which result in a long lead time and high cost. Gottfried [11] presented a simple metal sealing connector for the connection of water supply and drainage pipelines with diameter less than 168.3 mm under low or zero pressure on land. This paper presents an improved design of subsea pipeline mechanical connector (SPMC) {{that can be used for}} a bigger diameter and a higher pressure in the complicated subsea environment.|$|R
5000|$|Langford is {{the fastest}} growing {{community}} in British Columbia attracting new residents from all over Greater Victoria, the Lower Mainland, and Alberta due to new housing developments; strong real estate market and affordability; desirable temperate climate with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters; ample amenities as the commercial centre of West Shore; and year-long recreational activities. Although the pace of development and some planning decisions (particularly [...] "big-box" [...] retail developments and aggressive suburban sprawl) have attracted criticism - some would argue the city is expanding too quickly {{at the expense of}} natural surroundings and existing infrastructure, and city council is too pro-development - the community continues to grow rapidly and attract residents. It is the largest municipality in the Western Communities, and third-largest in the Capital Regional District after Saanich and Victoria. Activities in Langford include shopping at the many retail stores at Millstream Village and Westshore Town Centre (formerly Canwest Mall) with its 55 stores and services including major department, grocery, and retail chain stores as well as a seven-screen Cineplex movie theatre. Many city parks are attractions in Langford including City Centre Park, with a family-friendly entertainment zone including a Family Fun Park, and Veterans Memorial Park located in the heart of downtown, and at the center a cenotaph commemorating {{the men and women of}} the Canadian Forces who have given their lives in the line of duty and where Langford holds its yearly Remembrance Day ceremony. Community events include many parades, seasonal Goldstream farmer's market, the Summer Festival, and Luxton Fair. Rugby Canada has its headquarters in Langford practicing at Westhills Stadium. A new $30 million YMCA/YWCA Aquatic Centre opened in May 2016, acclaimed by the mayor to be the [...] "biggest project in the history of Langford", and features multiple pools, recreation facilities and a new library. Visitors can also participate in go-karting and mini-golfing, and watch stock-car racing and demolition derby at Western Speedway. Langford is home to world-class golf courses including Bear Mountain Resort on Skirt Mountain. The large community resort offers a system of mountain bike trails as the training centre for the Canadian National Mountain Bike Team and is currently planning the development of clay tennis courts for the national team and a professional disc golf course. There are many lakes in the area for fishing, swimming and non-motorized boating including Langford, Glen and Florence Lake. Langford is known for the many nature parks and network of trails popular with hikers and walkers alike including Mill Hill Park, Mount Wells, Thetis Lake Regional Park and the challenging high-elevation Mount Finlayson. Cyclists enjoy the picturesque multi-use Galloping Goose Trail, formerly a railway line, that moves through urban and rural parts of Langford and is used as a commuter trail to downtown Victoria taking only approximately 45 minutes on bicycle starting at Goldstream Village using the Wale Road <b>connector</b> (<b>quicker</b> than rush hour traffic).
