40|$|Introduction: This study aims {{to explore}} {{the ways in which}} Asperger’s Syndrome and High Functioning Autism are {{understood}} by those who have received a diagnosis in adulthood. The experience and understanding of diagnosis in adulthood has been little researched with {{only a small number of}} qualitative studies having been completed (Cousins, 2001; Molloy & Vasil, 2004; Punshon, 2006). These studies all highlight the importance of the beliefs held about Asperger’s Syndrome on the experience of diagnosis and post-diagnostic identity development. Due to the increasing awareness and diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome in adulthood, research into how the diagnosis is understood is invaluable for clinicians supporting individuals through the process. Method: This study uses a Q-methodology (Stephenson, 1953) to build upon recent qualitative research. The methodology is based on two techniques, the <b>Q-sorting</b> process and Q-factor analysis. For the <b>Q-sorting</b> process a set of 52 statements were developed which attempted to provide coverage of the understanding of Asperger’s Syndrome currently in the public domain. A wide range of sources were used to develop the Q-set, including a focus group with six adults with Asperger’s Syndrome. Eighteen individuals who had received their diagnosis in adulthood were recruited to complete the <b>Q-sorting</b> process, which involved them having to rank the statements based upon their agreement with them. Additionally a semi-structured interview was completed to gather information regarding the sort and supplementary demographic information. Results: Q-factor analysis involving principal components analysis and varimax rotation was then carried out. This led to four statistically significant and theoretically meaningful factors being extracted. The four factors were interpreted using the additional information gathered, and were labelled ‘An important part of me’, ‘It is a lifelong disability’, ‘Confused about myself, and ‘Support can bring improvement’. Discussion: The findings were discussed with consideration of the clinical implications and scope for further research. Particular emphasis was placed on discussing three main areas ‘acceptance and adjustment’, ‘consequences of diagnosis’ and ‘theoretical conceptualisations’. The importance of further research into the links between understanding and mental health were highlighted. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This may be a major {{constraint}} when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that in Japan (see Miyake et al., 1985), where infants are rarely separated from their mothers in ordinary circumstances. Also, because older children have a cognitive capacity to maintain relationships when the older person is not present, separation may not provide the same stress for them. Modified procedures based on the Strange Situation {{have been developed for}} older preschool children (see Belsky et al., 1994; Greenberg et al., 1990) but it is much more dubious whether the same approach can be used in middle childhood. Also, despite its manifest strengths, the procedure is based on just 20 minutes of behaviour. It can be scarcely expected to tap all the relevant qualities of a child's attachment relationships. <b>Q-sort</b> procedures based on much longer naturalistic observations in the home, and interviews with the mothers have developed in order to extend the data base (see Vaughn & Waters, 1990). A further constraint is that the coding procedure results in discrete categories rather than continuously distributed dimensions. Not only is this likely to provide boundary problems, but also {{it is not at all}} obvious that discrete categories best represent the concepts that are inherent in attachment security. It seems much more likely that infants vary in their degree of security and there is need for a measurement systems that can quantify individual variation".|$|E

Using a <b>Q-sorting</b> technique and cluster analysis, preliminary research identified five perspectives occurring {{in a small}} sample of rail passengers who varied in their frequency and location of rail travel as well as certain sociodemographic characteristics. Revealed perspectives (named to capture the gist of their content) included "Rail travel is about the destination, not the journey"; "Despite challenges, public transport is still the best option"; "Rail travel is fine"; "Rail travel? So far, so good"; and "Bad taste for rail travel. " This paper discusses each of the perspectives in detail and considers them in relation to tailored policy implications. An overarching finding from this study is that improving railway travel access requires attention to physical, psychological, financial, and social facets of accessibility. For example, designing waiting areas to be more socially functional and comfortable has the potential to increase ridership by addressing social forms of access, decreasing perceived wait times, and making time at the station feel like time well spent. Even at this preliminary stage, the <b>Q-sorting</b> technique promises to provide a valuable, holistic, albeit fine-grained, analysis of passenger attitudes and experiences that will assist industry efforts in increasing ridership...|$|R

40|$|Q-methodology is a {{technique}} incorporating the benefits of both qualitative and quantitative research. Q-method involves <b>Q-sorting,</b> a {{method of data collection}} and factor analysis, to assess subjective (qualitative) information. The use of <b>Q-sorting</b> and factor analysis has often resulted in the misconception that Q-methodology involves psychometric or quantitative assessment, although Q as a methodology actually enables the systematic assessment of qualitative data. Misconceptions regarding Q have resulted in a heterogeneous collection of Q-applications in the extant literature, which has obscured the fundamental principles of Q-methodology. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a systematic review of Q-based research to investigate the criteria researchers have used to develop Q-studies. Published research studies between January 2008 and December 2008 that employed Q-techniques and methodology were assessed. Data were extracted and synthesized through the development and use of the Assessment and Review Instrument for Q-methodology (ARIQ). Fourteen research studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The Q-methodological studies were disparate in their application of terminology, instrument development, and factor analysis, although data extraction and synthesis processes revealed two types of studies: those which aimed to apply conventional Q-methodology and those which applied variations of Q-techniques. It is concluded that variations of Q-technique and its methodology are unavoidable. However, this does not obviate the need for researchers to explicitly state their rationale for decisions to deviate from conventional Q-methodology if they are to produce demonstrably valid research. The review instrument (ARIQ) developed for this review will facilitate this end...|$|R

Fifty statements originally developed for a UK study and translated into Urdu were <b>Q-sorted</b> by 60 participants. The use of factor analytic techniques identified three independent accounts and qualitative data collected during the <b>Q-sorting</b> exercise supported their interpretation. In two accounts, the 'will of God' was central {{to an understanding of the}} existence of people with DS although perceptions about the value and quality of life of the affected individual differed significantly between these accounts as did views about the impact on the family. The third account privileged a more 'scientific worldview' of DS as a genetic abnormality but also a belief that society can further contribute to disabling those affected. Attitudes towards prenatal testing and termination of pregnancy demonstrated that a belief in the will of Allah was not necessarily associated with a rejection of these technologies.

Our {{aim was to}} identify various viewpoints and beliefs concerning the preventive CVD management of patients with low CVD risk using preventive cardiovascular medication. Furthermore, we investigated whether certain viewpoints were related to a preference for deprescription or the continuation of preventive cardiovascular medication. Methods: In 2015, we purposively sampled patients from the intervention arm of the Evaluating Cessation of STatins and Antihypertensive Treatment In primary Care (ECSTATIC) trial in the Netherlands for this study. Participants made <b>Q-sorts</b> by ranking 43 statements concerning preventive CVD management from “totally disagree” to “totally agree”. These <b>Q-sorts</b> were analyzed using PQMethod 2. 35 software. A varimax procedure presented the distinguishing viewpoints that were favored by our participants. We used group discussion quotations to underline our findings. For validation purposes, we asked participants how well each viewpoint fitted them. Results: Of 291 invited patients, 33 participated. Thirty-one <b>Q-sorts</b> were analyzed. The following three viewpoints were found: 1) a controlling viewpoint, in which patients held the belief that monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol levels is important (n= 13, of which seven had their medication deprescribed and six continued their medication); 2) an autonomous viewpoint, in which patients showed a dislike of medication (n= 8, of which seven had their medication deprescribed and one had it continued); and 3) an afraid viewpoint, in which patients were fearful of developing CVD (n= 8, of which two had their medication deprescribed and six had it continued). Seventy-four {{percent of the participants}} believed that the viewpoint to which they were assigned was a good fit.

Should messages be framed as a gain or a loss? Which format (text vs. pictorial vs. both) is more salient? Design and Methods: Mixed methods are employed. Implicit evaluations towards hand hygiene messages (pictorial and textual) are investigated in a series of experiments and the subjective meaning of these messages for hand-washing activity is explored using <b>Q-sorts.</b> Analyses: Experimental protocols have been created for the evaluation of hygiene messages using response time measures with student participants (n= 120). In the main studies (generally of mixed factorial designs, N per study = 100), the protocols will be combined with additional <b>Q-sorts.</b> Together, this will yield a rich implicit-explicit attitudinal data set comprising non-conscious positive-negative evaluations towards the hand hygiene messages along with their multidimensional subjective meanings for both women and men.

And, certain kinds of textual message content are likely to be differentially effective for women and men.

The {{purposes of this study}} were: first, to explore the pain intensity descriptors used among Chinese. Second, it was to construct a verbal rating scale for pain assessment. Methods: It consisted of two stages. Stage One was a cross-sectional descriptive survey to explore the pain intensity descriptors used among adult Chinese in Hong Kong. Stage Two was a <b>Q-sorting</b> technique to array the pain intensity descriptors obtained in Stage One. This was to construct a verbal rating scale (VRS) for pain assessment. Results: Nine hundred and eighty six healthy Chinese adults participated in Stage One. The ten pain intensity descriptors obtained were bearable （可以忍受）, crushing the heart and lungs （痛摧肺腑）, crucifying pain（痛到死） excruciating pain（劇痛）， indescribable（難以形容）, quite painful （頗痛）, painful (好痛), slight pain （微痛）, unbearable （不可忍受） and very painful （十分痛）. In Stage Two, fifty-four baccalaureate-nursing students participated in the <b>Q-sorting</b> procedure.
