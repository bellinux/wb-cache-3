5|$|Large-scale {{limestone}} <b>quarrying</b> {{has been}} a particular area of contention. Most of the mineral extraction licences were issued by national government for 90 years in the 1950s, and remain legally binding. The Peak District National Park Authority has a policy of considering all new <b>quarrying</b> and licence renewal applications within {{the area of the}} National Park in terms of the local and national need for the mineral and the uniqueness of the source, in conjunction with the effects on traffic, local residents and the environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{small amount}} of <b>quarrying</b> {{activity}} {{takes place in the}} city, with 46 active mines and quarries in Gyeongju. Most are engaged in the extraction of kaolin, fluorspar and Agalmatolite and Kaolin is exported.|$|E

Brushes Clough Reservoir was constructed in the 19th century by the Oldham County Borough Council, using stone quarried from this site. The area is now managed by United Utilities.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Kentish Quarryman Public House, {{which was}} the former Ditton Working Men's Club located {{on the western side}} of New Road, was opened. The house took its name from the {{historic}} connection of the parish with ragstone <b>quarrying,</b> which is acknowledged by a large slab of ragstone at its front entrance (see photograph).|$|E
5|$|Iron ore <b>quarrying</b> {{was a major}} {{industry}} in and around Wellingborough from the 1860s until the 1960s. James Rixon and Wiliam Ashwell opened a major ironworks {{on the north side}} of the town in 1870, supplied by the extensive ironstone quarries around Finedon to the east of the town. Three narrow gauge tramways served the iron ore industry, the Wellingborough Tramway, Neilson's Tramway and the Finedonhill Tramway. The Wellingborough Tramway served Rixon's ironworks until 1966.|$|E

50|$|Until {{well into}} the 1920s, the area was largely undeveloped, the only notable {{buildings}} being farms (such as White Stone Farm, <b>Quarry</b> Farm and Thorn Hill) and a few large houses (such as Hazelwood and <b>Quarry</b> House). Apart from agriculture, the only industry in the area was quarrying: <b>Quarry</b> Farm (and later <b>Quarry</b> Lane) was built next to Attleborough <b>Quarries,</b> while <b>Quarry</b> House, further east, was named after an older <b>quarry.</b>|$|R
5|$|Marble <b>quarrying</b> and {{processing}} are major activities in Romblon. Among {{the most common}} marble products are categorized into the following: novelty items (gifts, ashtray, table bars), furniture (dining tables, baptismal fonts) and construction materials (tiles, balusters, marble chips). Other mineral resources with considerable quantity include nickel ore and gold mostly {{to be found in}} Sibuyan Island. Gold panning and small-scale mining is a lucrative undertaking in Magdiwang.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the human}} history of South Dakota was shaped by its geology. Gold seekers founded most of the larger cities around the Black Hills, and <b>quarrying</b> was an {{important}} economic activity in several areas in eastern South Dakota. Mines and quarries in present-day South Dakota produce gold, Sioux quartzite, Milbank granite, sand, gravel, limestone, mica, and uranium. The state also produces a very limited amount of oil and natural gas.|$|E
5|$|Nablus has {{a bustling}} modern {{commercial}} center with restaurants, and a shopping mall.

5|$|<b>Quarrying</b> ceased in {{the early}} 1960s (1962â€“1965), when the stones {{extracted}} were no longer of sufficient quality. Between 1971 and 1978, the quarry was gradually filled with marl from the Bellignies quarry. Since then, the site has been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession, forming tree, shrub and herb layers.|$|E
5|$|The Kowloon Bay salt-fields {{were rich}} in salt, and this brought wealth to the {{residents}} near the bay. Gradually, Ham Tin Shan became villages. Because of the region's shoreline location, agricultural activities started with the plantation of high-salinity crops. With a quarry found in So Mo Ping (now Sau Mau Ping), the region gradually became a small fishing, farming and <b>quarrying</b> town.|$|E
5|$|The {{virtues of}} slate as a {{building}} and roofing material {{have been recognized}} since the Roman period. The Roman fort at Segontium, Caernarfon, was originally roofed with tiles, but the later levels contain numerous slates, used for both roofing and flooring. The nearest deposits are about five miles (8km) away in the Cilgwyn area, indicating that the slates were not used merely because they were available on-site. During the mediaeval period, there was small-scale <b>quarrying</b> of slate in several areas. The Cilgwyn quarry in the Nantlle Valley dates from the 12th century, and {{is thought to be}} the oldest in Wales. The first record of slate <b>quarrying</b> in the neighbourhood of the later Penrhyn Quarry was in 1413, when a rent-roll of Gwilym ap Griffith records that several of his tenants were paid 10 pence each for working 5,000 slates. Aberllefenni Slate Quarry may have started operating as a slate mine as early as the 14th century. The earliest confirmed date of operating dates from the early 16th century when the local house Plas Aberllefenni was roofed in slates from this quarry.|$|E
50|$|Coombefield <b>Quarry</b> is {{an active}} stone <b>quarry</b> located on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It is {{situated}} near the island's southernmost village Southwell.

5000|$|In the 1800s {{there were}} 24 small <b>quarries</b> {{operating}} on the hill employing some 200 men. This continued into the Victorian era with over 200 small family run <b>quarries</b> and masonry businesses. Many of these small <b>quarries</b> had ceased working by 1910. Today hamstone is only <b>quarried</b> in two areas {{at the top of}} Ham Hill. The North <b>quarry,</b> near the modern stone circle and war memorial, is the longest running hamstone <b>quarry</b> in existence. The southern, Norton <b>Quarry</b> extracts its stone from some 20-30 metres below the surface and is <b>quarried</b> by Harvey Stone. This <b>quarry</b> was reopened around 15 years ago, having been the last <b>quarry</b> abandoned in the 1930s due to there being, according to the masons working the hill [...] "no good quality stone left". Both <b>quarries</b> are owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.|$|R
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign; the Egyptian state continued to maintain trade relations with Byblos on the Levantine coast and to send mining and <b>quarrying</b> expeditions to Sinai and Lower Nubia. Nyuserre's reign saw {{the growth of the}} administration, and the effective birth of the nomarchs, provincial governors who, for the first time, were sent to live in the provinces they administered rather than at the pharaoh's court.|$|E
5|$|Tourism is {{the major}} local {{employment}} for park residents (24%), with manufacturing industries (19%) and <b>quarrying</b> (12%) also being important. 12% are employed in agriculture. The cement works at Hope is the largest single employer within the park. Tourism is estimated to provide 500 full-time jobs, 350 part-time jobs and 100 seasonal jobs.|$|E
5|$|While A.bradleyi {{is easily}} outcompeted by other plants in more fertile habitats, {{it is well}} adapted to the thin, acidic soil and harsh {{environment}} of its native cliffs, where it finds few competitors. Its isolated situation on these cliffs protects it from most threats, but <b>quarrying</b> and mining of the cliffs, rock climbing, and other activities that disturb the cliff ecosystem can destroy it.|$|E
