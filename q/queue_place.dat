40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the headway {{distribution}} of queued vehicles (less than 16 vehicles) at signalized intersections. Existing studies usually take the average statistics of headway at any <b>queuing</b> <b>place.</b> When different percentile points of statistical data are assigned to headway, the passing rate (the rate of all queued vehicles passing the stop line) under the ideal signal timing scheme varies. When selecting the mean value, the passing rate of a queue of fewer than 16 vehicles is no more than 65 %. When selecting 75 % as the percentile, the passing rate is up to 94 %. The queue length also decides the assigned percentile of headway to ensure the passing rate reaches a certain level. The value assignation of headway directly affects lane capacity and start-up loss time.

40|$|Purpose: {{to explore}} the {{experiences}} of employees in a local bank merger in the United States and examine the concept of job exit queues. We introduce {{the concept of a}} job exit queue, which describes how workers position themselves or are positioned by employers to leave jobs and enter new jobs following the announcement of a corporate merger. Design/methodology/approach: Qualitative interviews with mid-level managers, technical specialists and low status workers during the sale and merger process were conducted and coded thematically. We explore: 1) how workers and managers describe the job search as an “opportunity” or as a recurring cycle of low-wage, high-turnover work and 2) how severance packages structure the job exit queue to meet corporate needs. Findings: The role of severance pay is pivotal in understanding women’s and men’s job relations to job exit queues. We conclude that employers create job exit <b>queues,</b> <b>placing</b> low status workers and mid-level women managers with less formal education at a disadvantage in re-employment.

The reason is that publishers have stringent requirements for the placement of figures with respect to the text while neither Plain nor Urn provides good control of this placement. Currently a set of macros is being developed to help in solving this problem. The macros are based on a FIFO queue. Basically, the algorithm is quite simple. When making up a page the FIFO queue is checked. If the queue is not empty and if the first figure on the queue fits on the current page, it is removed from the <b>queue</b> and <b>placed</b> on the current page at the top. If the queue is still not empty, and the second figure on the queue also fits on the page it is removed from the <b>queue</b> and <b>placed</b> {{at the bottom of the}} current page.

40|$|Abstract—Fair Queuing (FQ) {{algorithms}} provide isolation between packet flows, allowing max-min fair {{sharing of}} a link even when flows misbehave. However, fairness {{comes at the}} expense of per-flow state. To keep the memory requirement independent of the flow count, the router can isolate aggregates of flows, rather than individual flows. We investigate the feasibility of protecting individual flows under such aggregate isolation in the context of Multiple Queue Fair Queuing (MQFQ), where the router maintains a fixed number of queues and allows each flow to access multiple <b>queues.</b> MQFQ <b>places</b> packets into the shortest queue associated with their flow. The extra queues protect the flow against congestion caused by a misbehaving flow in a shared queue. However, multiple per-flow queues also enable the misbehaving flow to increase its unfairly acquired fraction of the link capacity. We discuss avoidance of packet reordering within a flow and compare MQFQ with prior schemes for aggregate scheduling. I...|$|R
40|$|Architectures {{based on}} a {{non-blocking}} fabric, such as a crosspoint switch, are attractive for use in high-speed LAN switches, IP routers, and ATM switches. These fabrics, coupled with memory bandwidth limitations, dictate that <b>queues</b> be <b>placed</b> at the input of the switch. But {{it is well known}} that input-queueing can lead to low throughput, and does not allow the control of latency through the switch. This is in contrast to output-queueing, which maximizes throughput, and permits the accurate control of packet latency through scheduling. We ask the question: Can a switch with combined input and output queueing be designed to behave identically to an output-queued switch? In this paper, we prove that if the switch uses virtual output queueing, and has an internal speedup of just four, it is possible for it to behave identically to an output queued switch, regardless of the nature of the arriving traffic.
