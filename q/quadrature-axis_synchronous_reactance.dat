40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis and}} performance of a three-phase ac generator with an inset, neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) permanent-magnet (PM) rotor. Such a rotor construction gives rise to an inverse saliency effect (i. e., the direct-axis synchronous reactance {{is less than the}} <b>quadrature-axis</b> <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance).</b> This feature results in an improvement in the voltage regulation characteristics when the generator supplies an isolated, unity-power-factor load. By solving the equations derived from the two-axis theory, it is found that there exists, in general, two values of load current at which zero voltage regulation is obtained. The relationship between armature resistance, inverse saliency ratio, and the operating speed to give zero voltage regulation is investigated. The finite-element method (FEM) is used for computing the pertinent generator parameters for performance evaluation, namely the no-load voltage and the synchronous reactances. Flux plots are presented to confirm the origin of inverse saliency in the inset PM rotor. The theoretical analysis is validated by experiments carried out on a 2. 5 -kVA prototype generator.

40|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{electric}} energy used for numerous applications in today's world, regardless of the assembly of the used prime movers, is generated by means of synchronous generators. These generators can be connected together in small-scale or large-scale generation power systems depending on the load demand. Indeed, it is of utmost necessity to pay serious attention to those electric machines, their performance characteristics, various operation conditions and their design parameters. One {{of the most important}} parameters of the synchronous generator that can be a good asset for synchronous machines designers is the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance.</b> The importance of this reactance lies in the significant role it plays in the quality of the produced electric power and thus the stability of the voltage obtained across the terminals of a synchronous generator.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{determining}} the operational saturated <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactances</b> (Xd,sat and Xq,sat) and the rotor angle (δ), under the normal operating condition, was presented in this paper. At the power station the voltages (U), active (P) and reactive power (Q) are recorded. It is necessary to fit the no load generator saturation curve with appropriate analytical function. The output results obtained by corresponding calculations includes values of Xd,sat, Xq,sat and power angle δ, that reflect the level of generator saturation. Procedure by proposed method is following: - first the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> Xd,sat value is determined by no load saturation curve using the voltage behind from leakage reactance (Xℓ) value or the voltage behind Potier reactance (XP), then - quadrature-axis reactance (Xq,sat) and load angle (δ) are determined by corresponding per-unit equations that connects generator parameters and characteristics d-axis and q-axis. The proposed method was verified using reported case study of 500 MW generator [1], where are used, besides U, P, Q and E(if) curve, the recorded rotor load angle value δ at rated load. Obtained results by new method differ up to 1 - 2 % from results in [1] obtained by more complex procedure, i. e.

40|$|Abstract &# 150; In {{this article}} the {{possibility}} of exchanging the rotor of an IM with a high performance PM rotor to increase the motor&# 146;s efficiency and PF is investigated. A standard industrial IM {{is used as a}} reference motor and has been rebuilt and tested. The motor has been investigated both electrically and mechanically to obtain all motor data. Analytical calculations complemented by FEM calculations have been used to calculate the motor&# 146;s performance and to investigate the motor&# 146;s dependency on the magnetic loading and the mechanical dimensions while driven by a converter. In the analytical calculations simplicity has been emphasized and compared to the FEM results the calculation methods match well. Two motors have been analyzed, one with a 1. 5 mm air gap and one with 2. 5 mm giving a high and a low <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance.</b> For the voltage, flux density and torque calculations the values match within a few percents. The inductance calculation shows that the analytical and FEM methods give the same self inductance while the mutual inductance which is assumed to be 1. 5 times the self inductance in the analytical calculation is 68. 5 % higher in the FEM calculation giving a 23. 7 % higher <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance.</b> 	It is shown how small deviations in the air gap or magnet length cause &# 177; 10 % change in the back EMF and magnetic loading. The combination of the chosen control strategy (MTPC) and the high reactive voltage drop in the PM motor leads to a demanded terminal voltage in excess of the converter&# 146;s voltage limit for cases with a high back EMF and high reactance. 	The simulations show how the motor having a high <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> is more sensitive to the magnetic loading than the one with a low <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance.</b> For a motor having a 10 % higher back EMF than the reference motor and a high reactance, a 105 rpm reduction in speed is needed to deliver the rated torque giving 7 % reduction in the delivered power. A motor having a 10 % lower back EMF than the reference motor and low reactance is able to deliver 14. 7 % higher power than the nominal staying within the converter&# 146;s voltage limit and the motor&# 146;s current limit. For the reference motor the voltage limit is reached before the nominal speed which limits the speed and power capability slightly. Made with low reactance the reference motor could have increased the power rating by 27. 3 %. 	The reference motor is built with arc shaped magnets which has drawbacks due to delivery time and price. Simulations for motors with rectangular magnets show promising results and in combination with a possible 66 % magnet cost reduction this could be a good solution. 	The final test of the motor as a generator shows a 92. 5 % efficiency at full load and that the efficiency stays high for the whole speed and load range. The measured no-load back EMF of the motor is seen only to differ by 2 V for the calculated one. The measured reactance at full load is 6. 9 % higher than the analytical and 15. 2 % lower than the FEM calculated. Hence both the analytical and FEM calculations coincide well with the measured values on the rebuilt motor. </p...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{permanent}} magnet (PM) synchronous brushless machines often have magnetic circuits {{in which the}} patterns of saturation are complex and highly variable with {{the position of the}} rotor.

40|$|Linear {{synchronous}} motors can be {{used for}} large scale electromagnetic launch. The machines are short time rated and can therefore use substantial values of stator current loading. This leads to high values of armature flux and the risk of demagnetising the excitation magnets. In order to mitigate this risk by reducing the armature flux, quadrature axis flux barriers can be positioned in the permanent magnet backing iron. These reduce the armature field but leave the permanent magnet excitation field largely unchanged. In addition to improving the force due to the larger usable stator current loading, the barriers are beneficial in reducing the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> and hence improving the power factor and reducing the Volt Amps per Newton of useful force (VA/N) of a linear motor.

40|$|For {{education}} and research purposes, a design calculation program for hydropower generators has been made. The user can change design parameters to optimize the generator. However, manual optimization is a slow and tedious process and the user might make mistakes which will lead to wrong results. With an implemented optimization in a computer program, the optimization could be made faster and more reliable. In this assignment, a genetic algorithm is implemented in MATLAB to optimize the synchronous generator {{with respect to the}} total cost of the machine, which include cost of materials and losses. The purpose of the optimization was to find the lowest machine cost by varying chosen geometrical parameters. The variables were selected during conversations with supervisor Arne Nysveen and Ph. D. candidate Erlend Engevik. MATLAB has embedded functions that can perform genetic algorithms when provided with objective function, number of variables and constraints. The design calculation program mentioned has been used actively and made the foundation for the objective function to the implemented optimization. It has been adjusted {{to meet the demands of}} objective functions for optimization problems in MATLAB. Furthermore, limits to the machine design has been implemented as nonlinear constraints. These are gathered in a script under the function name nonlcons. For every set of variable values, the algorithm call this script to check if the constraints are met. To test the implemented optimization, the price of load dependent losses was increased to see if this made the algorithm reduce these losses. Furthermore, the power factor was increased which should make the machine cheaper. Lastly, the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> was increased. For high values of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance,</b> the air gap drops which lead the total magnetization to reduce, and consequently the total cost of the machine. There were performed 10 optimizations for each case as the genetic algorithm is not likely to give the same result every time. The results were then gathered in Excel and compared to examine how the algorithm had performed. Results show that the optimization perform as expected. The load dependent losses dropped by 8. 1 % when the cost of these increased from 15000 to 20000 kroner per kW. The cost of constant losses were at 30000 kroner per kW for both cases. They did not change considerably. When the power factor was increased from 0. 8 to 1. 0, the total cost of the machine dropped by 4. 4 %. This is because of a reduced magnetization of the machine which reduce the required field current and consequently the copper losses. For the case of a varying <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance,</b> the magnetization of the machine reduced with 9. 3 % as the reactance moved from 1. 2 pu to 4. 9 pu. Consequently the total machine cost reduced with 7. 6 %. The results also showed a large variation of the best solution from one optimization to the next. It is believed that a larger population could bring down this variation. However, the genetic algorithm include randomly generated mutation which for complex problems necessarily leads to varying results. Furthermore, the ratio between cost of losses and materials which are set by the user to a great extent affect the machine design. Increasing the cost of losses while keeping the material costs constant causes the use of copper in the machine to increase significantly. The constraints added are important to ensure that the algorithm designs reliable machines that fulfill demands to generators in the Norwegian grid. It is important that the user can adjust these constraint to the problem at hand when they inflict the machine design greatly...|$|R
40|$|This work {{is focused}} on direct-driven {{permanent}} magnets synchronous generators (PMSG) with diode rectifiers for use in offshore wind turbines. Reactive compensation of the generator, power losses {{and control of the}} generator are studied. Configurations for power transmission to onshore point of common connection are also considered. Costs, power losses, reliability and interface with the PMSG are discussed. The purpose of the laboratory tests and simulations are to learn how a PMSG with diode rectifier behaves. A 55 kW PMSG is tested in "Vindlabben", with and without reactive compensation. The generator current and generator voltage are measured and the total harmonic distribution (THD) of the current and the voltage are calculated. The results are compared to simulations on an equal generator in PSCAD/EMTDC. A 2 MW PMSG is also simulated to compare parallel and series compensation and to find how the generator efficiency varies with the wind speed. The generator is also simulated with constant DC-link voltage and varying local wind to find how much the turbine and generator efficiency decreases when a Cluster step-up configuration is used. The DC-link voltage is in this case equal for parts of the wind farm or the whole wind farms. A 3 MW ironless PMSG with very low <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> is simulated to find how this generator behaves with a diode rectifier. The laboratory tests and PSCAD simulations show that the maximal generator power increases when reactive compensation of the generator is used. The measured and simulated generator voltage and current shapes are found to be approximately equal. Series compensated PMSGs have lower generator current rms and lower current THD than parallel compensated PMSGs when the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> is large. Therefore, the generator losses are 2 - 15 % lower and the diode rectifier losses are 0 - 1 % lower, depending on the wind speed. The diode rectifier losses are lower than 1 %. The losses can be reduced even more if the diodes are connected in parallel. If a Cluster step-up configuration is used, the turbine efficiency is reduced by 3 - 4 %. %The generator efficiency is more or less the same. The ironless PMSG has a low <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> and reactive compensation is not needed because the reactive power produced by the generator is low. Parallel connected capacitors have no positive effect and series connected capacitances must be very large and can therefore not be used. The generator current THD is very large when no reactive compensation is used. However, the current THD can be reduced by connecting an inductance to the DC-link. Cluster step-up, two-step DC/DC system, turbine step-up and series connected wind turbine are the most relevant layouts of the wind farms transmission system discussed in this thesis. The cluster step-up system has low power losses since only one large DC/DC converter is used. Also, the power equipment in the turbine is very reliable. However, the turbine efficiency is reduced since the generator torque and generator speed could not be controlled for one specific turbine. The other transmission systems require DC/DC converters in the turbines and they are therefore probably not as reliable. The total cost is crucial for the chose of the transmission system. Further cost accountings for the different DC systems are needed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Superconducting {{generator}} (SCG) with superconducting {{field winding}} has many advantages such as small size, light weight, high generation efficiency. In particular, {{the property of}} low <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactances,</b> which is not realized in conventional generators, is able to improve power system stability. In addition, transient stability can be improved by effect of high response excitation of self-excited SCG which enables the rapid change of field current and in turn of excitation power. The field winding connected to the power system through converter is considered as a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES); hence, the effect is called “SMES effect”. In this paper, excitation control system for SCG with high response excitation considering SMES effect is proposed for stability improvement by employing eigenvalue sensitivity.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the stability of}} diode bridge rectifier-loaded synchronous generators characterized by large values of synchronous, transient and subtransient reactances in the d- and q-axis, {{with the possibility of}} connecting a battery-bank. The <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactances</b> are in the range 2. 5 - 5. 5 pu. The electrical system studied is installed in two tug-ships using two different types of generators, with different ranges of generator reactances and performance. One of the tugships studied uses generators with a capacity of 3333 kVA, has <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactances</b> is the lower layer of 2. 5 - 5. 5 pu and is characterized as stable during operation. The other ship uses generators with a capacity of 1940 kVA, has <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactances</b> is the upper layer of 2. 5 - 5. 5 pu and is characterized as unstable during operation. The observed oscillations in this ship have a frequency of approximately 2 Hz. The diesel-electric, variable speed propulsion DC-system used on the two ships is delivered by Siemens. The synchronous generators deliver power to a dc-bus through six-pulse diode bridge rectifiers. The main motors and thrusters are supplied by the dc-bus through inverters, and a battery can be attached to the dc-bus for redundancy. The object of this thesis is to find the reason why rectifier-loaded synchronous generators with high reactances become unstable. The same system was under study for a specialization project conducted at the Department of Electrical Power Engineering during the fall of 2014. The main findings in this project are included in the present thesis, where simulations indicate that the studied generators become unstable when the gain of the voltage regulator is increased, and no rectifier is included in the model. This happens faster for the 1940 kVA generator than for the 3333 kVA generator, and when reactive power is consumed. A literature study of articles and other work concerning the stability of similar systems is also conducted. It is in literature found that local mode problems often is associated with rotor angle oscillations, and usually has a frequency of 0. 7 - 2 Hz. Stability criteria is found concerning diode bridge rectifier-loaded synchronous The stability criteria found have requirements for the <b>synchronous</b> and transient <b>reactance,</b> but not for the subtransient reactance. It is claimed that small-frequency oscillations starts in the rectifier causing instability of rectifier-loaded synchronous generators. It is also found a criterion saying that stability is easier achieved by adding a short-circuited q-axis winding on the rotor. The work of the specialization project is continued, and a rectifier is added to the model established in DIgSILENT PowerFactory in the fall of 2014. The battery is modeled as a constant DC-voltage source, and the rectifier is modeled as a PWM rectifier with no modulation and a firing angle set to zero. The generator stability is studied when the gain of the voltage regulator is increased from 50 - 500. The simulation is made for both producing and consuming reactive power, both cases of which the generator produces active power. The gain directly affects the nature of the linearization constant K 5 making it negative resulting in a negative feedback when the external impedances is high. The hypothesis is that this also happens when the internal reactances in the generator is high. This is shown through simulations to be true. It was expected that the 1940 kVA generator reaches instability faster than the 3333 kVA generator, as was the result in the specialization project, but this was not the case. It is believed that the rectifier chosen does not imitate the real system well enough. By using the parameters of the 3333 kVA and 1940 kVA generators, as well as knowledge of the ship components, simplified models are established in the simulation tool MatLab/SimPowerSystems. The battery in MatLab/SimPowerSystems is modeled as an infinitely large capacitor and a series resistance, and the rectifier is a diode-bridge rectifier. A sensitivity analysis for parameter values is conducted, by varying parameter values of the main components such as the synchronous generator, battery, rectifier and voltage regulator, and the stability is studied. The impact of the presence of the main components on the stability is studied as well. Neither of the criteria found in Teil 1 and siemens has requirements for the subtransient reactance, and the impact of the subtransient reactance on the stability is studied through sensitivity analysis. Different load-situations are simulated and generator stability is examined. The main phenomena observed on the ship are successfully recreated through simulations, and the model established in the simulation tool is verified due to this. It is through simulations found that the presence of the diode-bridge rectifier is crucial to detect stability problems, and that the load-situation impacts the stability. When the 1940 kVA generator supplies a load of 1. 9 MVA, it becomes stable, but is unstable during no-load and for all other loads less than 1. 9 MVA. It is also found that the transient and subtransient reactances play an equally important role as the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactances</b> when it comes to generator stability in this context. The sensitivity analysis conducted is used as a basis for the development of stability limits. The results found through simulations are compared with stability criterions and theories presented in articles found in the literature study concerning the same problems as addressed in this thesis. Stability criteria are found for the 1940 kVA generator with emphasis on the transient and subtransient reactance. By combining the stability criterion for the transient reactances obtained in this thesis with equations found in literature, it is found that stability can be achieved by adding a short-circuited q-axis winding to the generator rotor. Recommendations for further work is to replace the PWM rectifier with a diode-bridge rectifier in the DIgSILENT PowerFactory model and redo the varying of the gain in the voltage regulator to study the stability of the 3333 kVA and 1940 kVA generators. It is also suggested that the interaction between the synchronous generator and diode-bridge rectifier is further investigated. Last, but not least should simulation be conducted, where a short-circuited q-axis winding is added to the generator rotor, to verify the results found in this thesis from the stability criteria obtained...|$|R
40|$|A {{lightweight}} 'coreless' (100 kW), 2 -pole HTS rotor, {{designed and}} built at the University of Southampton has been completed {{and is now in}} the testing phase of the project. By removing the iron core from the new cold rotor, the weight has been halved in comparison to the previous rotor. The 'cold' components of the rotor assembly make up a sixth of the total weight, which has provided significant time and cost savings in the cool down process. A lightweight doughnut shaped cryostat houses the HTS winding. The winding itself is constructed from sixteen double pancake coils, wound from BSCCO HTS tape. Practical testing of the generator began with a series of stationary tests. The critical current (Ic) of the HTS winding is 77 A at liquid nitrogen temperature (77. 4 K) and increases to 156 A, when cooled with liquid air (61. 6 K). The air-gap flux density is ~ 0. 3 T at 156 A. The machines total harmonic distortion (THD) was predicted to be around 5. 4 % with the measured THD= 5 % and this despite using an unoptimized stator. Finally, the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance,</b> Xs was evaluated to be 0. 24 p. u. This is a 1 / 5 of the value found for conventional synchronous machines and is largely due to its air-core structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} {{installed}} wind turbines is growing every {{year as the}} need for energy increases in an exponential manner. As the wind turbines are trying to fulfil these requirements, the demand for output power from each individual turbine is increasing as well. Although this is great, implementation of new technologies such as direct drive superconducting generators are required as they have a great potential for becoming a great contender for satisfying the increasing demand of individual turbine power output. The efficiency and the mass reduce by using this technology but other issues have to be checked regarding its transient performance. Due to the low sub-transient, transient and <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance,</b> compared to a conventional machine, the transient properties such as short-circuit current, field current and electromagnetic torque is much higher. This may cause problems as high values may damage the windings and turbine properties and even cause the superconducting field windings to lose its superconducting property. The thesis report will try to model a superconducting generator for a 10 MW wind turbine and analyse its transient properties. Also several important parameter calculations will be made taking into account the saturation due to iron in the generator. This simulation will be made for three different topologies of generator while taking into account their own individual generator geometry...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{partitioned}} {{stator flux}} reversal permanent magnet (PM) (PS-FRPM) machine and the conventional magnetically geared (MG) machine operating in both stator-PM (SPM) and rotor-PM (RPM) modes are comparatively analyzed {{in terms of}} electromagnetic performance to provide design guides for a MG machine regarding: (a) a SPM or RPM type machine and (b) a higher or lower gear ratio machine. It is found that a SPM type machine is recommended, since both PS-FRPM and MG machines operating in SPM modes have a higher phase back-EMF and hence torque than their RPM counterparts, respectively, {{as a result of}} a similar phase flux-linkage but a higher electric frequency since the iron piece number is larger than the PM pole-pair number. Moreover, a smaller gear ratio machine is preferred from the perspective of a higher power factor and hence a lower inverter power rating, as the conventional MG machines with higher gear ratios suffer from larger flux-leakage, higher <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> and hence lower power factors, as well as higher iron losses, than the PS-FRPM machines. However, higher gear ratio machines feature lower cogging torques and torque ripples due to the smaller difference between the PM pole-pair number and iron piece number. Both prototypes of PS-FRPM machine operating in SPM mode and MG machine operating in RPM mode are built and tested to verify the FE predicted results. ...|$|R

Measurements {{have been carried out}} using both static and dynamic test methods. The test data has been compared with simulation results from analytical design programs and finite element models. The effects of mutual coupling on the magnetisation characteristics are investigated through measurement and simulation. Results show that the degree of mutual coupling is strongly dependent on the winding arrangement of the machine. In the next section, the difficulties in measuring the properties of permanent-magnet machines are discussed in detail, and solutions to common problems proposed. The measurement and analysis methods used for the switched-reluctance motor are further developed for analysis of permanent magnet machines. Techniques for determining the variation in <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactances</b> and permanent magnet flux are presented. Finite element simulations are used to show the variation of magnet flux under loading, a condition ignored in classical analysis methods. The final section discusses the analysis of magnetisation characteristics of electrical sheet steels. Comparison is made between measurements carried out on single sheet tester and Epstein square test rigs. The iron losses of a typical non-grain-orientated steel are measured under both sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal flux density conditions. The iron losses are shown to increase significantly when higher harmonic components are introduced to the flux density waveform. The difficulties in modelling the nonlinear iron loss characteristics of electrical steels are considered. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} partly a deeper study of which was {{presented}} in the specialization project, fall of 2014. The main objective have been to develop and design a permanent magnet synchronous machine for hydro power plant application. In this study, an analytical design tool for this purpose was developed through a Matlab script. The analytical calculations have been veried by use of nite element method analysis in machine no-load operation, and the design tool is found suciently accurate for this study. As background, a literature survey was performed, {{which resulted in the}} base for developing the analytical design tool. The relevant equations are presented in the theoretical part of this thesis. A synchronous machine at 18 MVA with eld windings have been redesigned by use of permanent magnet magnetization. The stator bore diameter was kept constant at 3. 51 m in all machines simulated. At a decreased air gap of 11. 0 mm, the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> of the permanent magnet synchronous machine was computed to be 0. 6 pu, and the usage of permanent magnet material to 1247 kg at minimum, in case of the desired input parameters. In this machine, the height of the surface mounted magnets were 35. 3 mm, distributed in 12 poles. It has been observed possibilities for reduction in both mass and size by redesign to a permanent magnet synchronous machine, the former in greatest extent.

40|$|Recently, due {{to rising}} {{environmental}} concerns and predicted future shortages of fossil fuels, {{there is a}} movement towards electrification of the transportation industry. A {{vast majority of the}} current research uses permanent magnet synchronous machines as the main traction motor in the drivetrain. This work proposes to add a special damper to a conventional permanent magnet synchronous machine to further improve the suitability of this machine for electrified vehicles. Firstly, an equivalent circuit model is developed to simulate the operation of a conventional PMSM with a damper. A synchronous loading test is proposed to determine the <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> of the machine. A modified blocked rotor test is used to find the damper parameters assuming that the rotor cage construction is known. Also a single-phase AC test {{that can be used to}} determine the damper parameters without prior knowledge of the rotor construction is proposed and presented as an alternative to the blocked rotor test. Thereafter, the models of a 50 kW traction motor and the same machine with damper bars are developed and simulated. The performance of both machines are compared and evaluated. The damper parameters are selected based on the dynamic and steady state performances. It is also shown that the machine with a damper has faster response to a three-phase short circuit fault. In addition, this study also looks into integrated charging which utilizes the existing drivetrain components for vehicle to grid and grid to vehicle operation. The damper is shown to be effective in mitigating the saliency condition caused by the buried magnets of IPMSM at stand-still condition. As a result, the machine windings can be used as line inductors for integrated charging...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} and economical constraints, {{it is difficult}} to build new power lines and to reinforce the existing ones. The continued growth in demand for electric power must therefore to a great extent be met by increased loading of available lines. A consequence of this is reduction of power system damping, leading to a risk of poorly damped power oscillations between generators. This thesis proposes the use of controlled active and reactive power to increase damping of such electro-mechanical oscillations. The focus of this thesis is a FACTS device known as the Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC). With its unique capability to control simultaneously real and reactive power flows on a transmission line as well as to regulate voltage at the bus where it is connected, this device creates a tremendous quality impact on power system stability. These features turn out to be even more significant because UPFC can allow loading of the transmission lines close to their thermal limits, forcing the power to flow through the desired paths. This providdes the power system operators much needed flexibility in order to satisfy the demands. A power system with UPFC is highly nonlinear. The most efficient control method for such a system is to use nonlinear control techniques to achieve system oscillation damping. The nonlinear control methods are independent of system operating conditions. Advanced nonlinear control techniques generally require a system being represented by purely differential equations whereas a power system is normally represented by a set of differential and algebraic equations. In this thesis, a new method to generate a dynamic modeling for power network is introduced such that the entire power system with UPFC can be represented by purely differential equation. This representation helps us to convert the nonlinear power system equations into standard parametric feedback form. Once the standard form is achieved, conventional and advanced nonlinear control techniques can be easily implemented. A comprehensive approach to the design of UPFC controllers (AC voltage control, DC voltage control and damping control) is presented. The damping controller is designed using nonlinear control technique by defining an appropriate Lyapunov function. The analytical expression of the nonlinear control law for the UPFC is obtained using back stepping method. Then, combining the nonlinear control strategy with the linear one for the other variables, a complete linear and nonlinear stabilizing controller is developed. Finally, an adaptive method for estimating the uncertain parameters is derived. This relaxes the need for approximating the uncertain parameters like damping coefficient, transient <b>synchronous</b> <b>reactance</b> etc., which are difficult to be measured precisely. The developed controller provides robust dynamic performance under wide variations in loading condition and system parameters, and provides a significant improvement in dynamic performance in terms of peak deviations. The proposed controller is tested on different multi-machine power systems and found to be more effective than existing ones...|$|R
