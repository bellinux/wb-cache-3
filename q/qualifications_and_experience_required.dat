40|$|Institutions {{of higher}} {{learning}} should be doing leadership development of females to enhance the gender balance. The number of females employed in South African higher education is almost equal {{to the number of}} males, yet the highest proportions of females continue to hold the lowest academic and support positions. To compound the problem, after attracting suitable female staff, institutions do not have programmes to encourage them to remain within the system. Females need to surmount extra hurdles to be considered as leaders, <b>and</b> have different <b>experiences</b> of organisations from those of their male peers. Research suggests that women have the <b>qualifications,</b> skills <b>and</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>required</b> for leadership. This study aimed to look at mentoring as a strategy to enhance female leadership development. A literature review was conducted to understand the term mentoring and all related aspects. The aspects included the functions and phases of mentoring, as well as the process of a mentoring programme. Recently organisations have begun to realise how important mentoring can be to their success. Research has shown that mentoring facilitates leadership development through the career and psycho-social functions that the relationship provides. The study also investigated gender and leadership, and highlighted the barriers faced by women. The empirical part {{of this study was to}} determine employees‘ perceptions of mentoring. It was conducted in a Higher Education Institution. Random sampling was used to select respondents. The sample size consisted of 110 respondents. A structured pre-coded questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data was analysed Abstract Page iii using the relevant statistical package. Independent t-tests and analysis of variance techniques were used to determine statistically significant differences in perceptions between groups according to race, qualifications, period of employment and the type of appointment (academic/administrative). Statistically significant differences were found between race groups and the period of employment. <b>Qualification</b> <b>and</b> type of appointment did not significantly affect employees‘ responses. The major findings indicate a general congruence towards mentoring as a suitable strategy to enhance female leadership development. Institutional barriers were identified and the organisation needs to acknowledge and understand the organisational culture before embarking on this process.

40|$|Siri Terjesen, Val Singh and Susan Vinnicombe INTRODUCTION In FTSE 1001 company boards, {{only one}} in 30 {{executive}} directors is female, and overall, women comprise just over 11 per cent of FTSE 100 directors (Sealy et al., 2007). This number is substantially less than in Norway and Slovenia (22 per cent and 16 per cent respectively in 2006) and higher than in Japan and Italy (0. 2 per cent and 2 per cent respectively in 2006) (Terjesen and Singh, 2008). Human capital theory (Becker, 1964) provides an obvious basis for understanding the continued exclusion of women from corporate boardrooms. It is linked with resource dependency theory (Pfeﬀer and Salancik, 1978). Human capital theory suggests that, given an increasingly uncertain business environment, boards should be composed of individuals who can provide access to a breadth of resources. Critical resources include access to prestige and legitimacy, ﬁnancial capital, and functional and geographic market knowledge. During the 1990 s, surveys of chief executives and chairmen in several countries reported that women were generally perceived to lack the <b>qualiﬁcations</b> <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>required</b> from directors (Ragins et al., 1998; Catalyst/Opportunity Now, 2000). Thus, a human capital-based argument was used to explain women’s absence from boardrooms, {{whether or not the}} women lacked human capital in reality. In this chapter, we use human capital theory to explain recent appointments of new female as well as new male directors. Although previous studies examined the human capital of entire boards or of existing directors, we have little knowledge about [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The VET-ArtdeVivre Partnership Programme was {{a two-year}} Partnership {{launched}} in August 2012 {{and funded by}} the EC's Leonardo da Vinci (LdV). The Partnership brought together nine different actors from seven countries of both the wider wine value chain and the Vocational Education & Training (VET) field. The work focused on five different top- ics. The main objective was to identify market & training needs and to develop common approaches on wine, health & social aspects. Methods: A Market and Training Needs Analysis (MTNA) Report, consisting of the respective national versions, was drafted by the Partners and reviewed by international experts. The MTNA Report provided an in depth analysis of the respective wine markets and VET, an assessment of selected key job profiles and a mapping of relevant VET offers. Results: Based on the MTNA Report, the Partnership has developed a VET framework proposal with three different training modules according to the professional needs of Sommeliers (EQF 3 – 5 level), Oenologists (EQF 6 level), and Physicians (EQF 6 – 8 level). Each module lists the expected learning hours and outcomes, the delivery and assessment methods, reading list, the trainers’ minimum formal <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> <b>required.</b> These proposed comprehensive training modules are linked to a database of existing training references. Considering the MTNA results and having established a concrete proposal, the Partnership has initiated the necessary dialogue to introduce and recognise these skills both at formal & informal level and national & EU level in accordance with EQF & ECVET. Conclusions: Taking into account the increasing interest on the topic and the identified gaps, professional training on wine, health and social aspects and responsible business practices should be considered by the respective stakeholders involved in defining job profiles and training programmes for professionals of the wine value chain...|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the sociological}} {{literature}} on professions {{is based on}} the traditional professions that emerged in the nineteenth century in response to the Industrial Revolution. This Portfolio uses literature from the sociology of professions to examine evaluation as a recently emerged area of work. The implications of this are considered for the further professionalisation of the practice of evaluation and contribution {{to our understanding of the}} sociology of professions. Research Stage One This Paper considers four theoretical approaches that have made a significant contribution to the sociology of professions literature. First, the work of the social commentator Herbert Spencer (1896) and his social Darwinian approach is reviewed. Spencer’s work led to the development of the second approach to be considered, trait theory (Chitty, 1997; Flexner, 1915, reprinted 2001; Greenwood, 1957, 1972). Both of these approaches come from within the structural functionalist school of sociology. In response to trait theory and its focus on the attributes of professions that developed under very specific social conditions, feminist approaches and the professional project concept emerged from the symbolic-internationalist school of sociology (Larson, 1977; Maack, 1997; Macdonald, 1995). While structural functionalists are concerned with how professions function in society, symbolic-internationalists are concerned with how occupations are granted professional status by society. This paper considers these different approaches and develops a pluralist model of professionalisation. This approach is then used in Paper 3 to explore the professionalisation of the practice of evaluation and to suggest how this could be further developed in the future. Research Stage Two In the major western economies of the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia, evaluation emerged as a distinct area of work in the 1970 s as a result of the growth of government spending on social services and a need for public accountability. Evaluation has been described as a transdiscipline that serves practitioners from other disciplines (Scriven, 2013) and a metaprofession that draws practitioners from other professions to its workforce (Australasian Evaluation Society, 2013). It is generally accepted that evaluation is not a profession, but is professionalising (Canadian Evaluation Society, 2004; Cousins & Aubry, 2006). Evaluation offers an opportunity to apply learnings from the sociology of professions literature to understand the process of professionalisation in the modern era and consider the implications of this for both the future professionalisation of evaluation and the theoretical base of the sociology of professions. The recent history of evaluation demonstrates a continued process of professionalisation through the establishment of a need for services, the development of a community of practice, the establishment of ethics and development of evaluation specific theories and methods. The process of professionalisation of the practice of evaluation will be considered in Paper 3, using the model developed in Paper 1. Research Stage Three Most of the discourse on sociology of professions is derived from research on two professions – doctors and lawyers (Torstendahl, 1990 b). While this gap in research has begun to be addressed in recent years with studies on the professionalisation of other groups such as nurses (Chua & Clegg, 1990; Johannisson & Sundin, 2007), librarians (Maack, 1997; Sundin & Hedman, 2004), engineers (Ressler, 2011) and others, there remains an opportunity to further contribute to the growing body of knowledge and theory of professions in general and professionalisation in different social contexts in particular. Similarly, the early studies in sociology of professions were based on initial research in the United Kingdom and the United States, then applied to continental Europe and elsewhere, not as a specific-type but as an ideal-type (Torstendahl, 1990 b). This limited the inclusion of many knowledge-based occupations in the field of study (Maack, 1997) and disregarded the impact of the state on the development of professions (Torstendahl, 1990 a). Using the approach developed in Paper 1, which incorporates themes from trait theory and the professional project, this final research stage examines the professionalisation of evaluation since the 1980 s, when the first associations were established in evaluation. These associations established academic journals, professional development programs, international conferences and ethical guidelines for members. Evaluation has developed specific methods and is developing its own theories. The weaknesses of the professionalisation of evaluation generally relate to a lack of occupational closure: no <b>qualifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>experience</b> are <b>required</b> to work as an evaluator and evaluation associations accept non-evaluators as full members. Canada is the only country to have in place an evaluation credentialing system. The Canadian model, led by the Treasury Board of Canada, involves a partnership between educational providers, the Canadian Evaluation Association and the Treasury Board’s Centre for Evaluation Excellence in order to develop and administer a voluntary evaluator credentialing system (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat, 2012 a, 2012 b). Comparison of the Canadian model with the approach taken in Australia demonstrates the important role of government as the main purchaser of evaluation in generating market pressure for improved quality. The Canadian model also demonstrates the importance of engagement with the educational sector to ensure an academic pathway into evaluation with a consistent national curriculum. While at a practical level this research suggests options to improve the professionalisation of the practice of evaluation in Australia, at a theoretical level the research demonstrates how trait theory and the professional project can be integrated in a pluralist model to advance the professionalisation of an occupation. Furthermore, an occupation, by establishing a deliberate plan for professionalisation that includes goals (or objective traits) linked to outputs and outcomes (or subjective traits), develops a framework to test the logic of the relationships within the model. This resolves the issue of untested causal assumptions that have been one of the main limitations of trait theory. This approach takes a continuous improvement perspective, where professionalisation is both an objective and a process. The award of the title profession is controlled by public opinion on the merit and achievements of the goals of the occupation through this process of professionalisation...|$|R
