5|$|Contestants {{are given}} a series of lifelines to aid them with {{difficult}} <b>questions.</b> <b>They</b> can use as many lifelines as desired per question, but each lifeline can only be used once per game. Three lifelines {{are available from the}} start of the game. Depending on the format of the show, additional lifelines may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question. In the clock format, usage of lifelines temporarily paused the clock while the lifelines were played.|$|E
5|$|Divided is an American {{television}} {{game show}} broadcast by Game Show Network (GSN) {{based on the}} British series of the same name. Each episode consists of four contestants playing as one team who must agree on answers to <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> are given. The longer it takes the team {{to come to an}} agreement, the less money the team earns for each question. The series, hosted by Mike Richards, premiered January 19, 2017, with some critics believing that the show's name and timing were appropriate given the tumultuous preceding presidential election and its premiere date coming the day before the inauguration.|$|E
5|$|In a {{range of}} studies, {{participants}} have been requested to answer general knowledge questions, each of which had two possible answers, and also to estimate their chances of answering each question correctly. If the participants had a sufficient degree of self-knowledge, their level of confidence in regard to each answer they gave would be high for the <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> answered correctly and lower for the ones they answered wrong. However, this generally is not the case. Many people are overconfident; indeed, studies show that most people systematically overestimate their own abilities. Moreover, people are overconfident {{about their ability to}} answer questions that are deemed to be hard but underconfident on questions that are considered easy.|$|E

5|$|Sixth-graders Calder Pillay, {{who enjoys}} puzzles and pentominoes, and Petra Andalee, who aspires to be a writer, are classmates at the Middle School in Hyde Park, Chicago. Their young teacher, Ms. Hussey, is very {{interested}} in art and teaches them in a creative way. Through her pressing <b>questions,</b> <b>they</b> discover the artist Johannes Vermeer and his paintings, especially A Lady Writing and The Geographer. Petra also finds a used book called Lo!, written by Charles Fort, at the local Powell's Books, owned {{by a man named}} Mr. Watch. They also meet an elderly neighbor, Mrs. Sharpe, who is also a fan of Vermeer and Fort. Calder receives letters from his best friend Tommy Segovia, who is currently living in New York City with a new stepfather.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{investigation}} into the incident was managed by the Detroit Joint Terrorism Task Force, which {{is led by the}} FBI and includes U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Air Marshal Service, and other law enforcement agencies. Among other <b>questions,</b> <b>they</b> were attempting to find out what training Abdulmutallab received, who else (if anyone) was in the training program, were others preparing to launch similar attacks, was the attack part of a larger plot, was it a test run, and who assisted him.|$|E
5|$|In a Year 3 {{elementary}} {{classroom in}} South Wales a teacher was having difficulty keeping three girls on task during designated private study times. The teacher reached for aid from behavior analysts, and a delayed gratification behavior modification plan {{was put into}} place. The study gave limits on the amounts of questions the children could ask, {{and if they did}} not exceed the limit, they were given tokens for rewards. The token economy for rewards is an example of delayed gratification, by way of cool processing. Instead of having the girls focus on attention-seeking behaviors that distracted the teacher and the students, the teacher had them focus on how many <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> had, and if they needed to ask for help from the teacher. They also focused on gaining tokens rather than focusing on the final reward, which increased their delays. By giving the children this goal and the promise of positive reinforcement for good behavior, the girls dropped their rate of question-asking and attention-seeking.|$|E

If the family scores less than 200 but gives the top answer in each <b>question,</b> <b>they</b> win $1,000 ($2,000 in December 2007). If the team scores less than 200, they win $500.|$|R

25|$|On the ACT, each {{question}} correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice {{part of the}} test. Therefore, a student can answer all questions without suffering a decrease in their score for <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> answer incorrectly. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.|$|E

According to Brown, when Aspinall said that Epstein was already booking concerts for 1967, Lennon and Harrison insisted that their current tour {{would be their}} last. They relayed this decision to Epstein either at the hotel, where he was bedridden with a high fever, or during the flight to London. The decision was also informed by the band's increasing dissatisfaction with the inadequate sound systems at the venues they played and the inane <b>questions</b> <b>they</b> faced at each press conference.|$|E
25|$|Reeves and Nass {{established}} two rules {{before the}} test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same <b>questions.</b> <b>They</b> expected {{people to be}} less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent variable was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.|$|E

They stated that they wished {{to participate in the}} question and answer part of the reception. When told that the cardinal would not be taking <b>questions,</b> <b>they</b> then tried to confront Bertone, who is the Vatican Secretary of State. Security guards hustled them.
