500|$|A {{significant}} practical {{obstacle to}} a completely democratically elected and representative UNPA is that, {{in contrast to}} the situation in which the European Parliament functions, a significant number of UN members, including populous countries such as China are not electoral democracies. In the past, bodies such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights were criticized for being dominated by abusive regimes. If UNPA representatives were to be drawn from member nations' parliaments, it could create legitimacy concerns since some national legislatures are regarded as a rubber stamp for the rulers' decrees. Some global parliament proponents, such as Prof. Lucio Levi, propose starting a federation limited to democracies: [...] "Though the democratization of states all over the world hasnâ€™t been completed, this does not preclude starting the democratization of the UN. Six Western European countries founded the European Community, starting its democratization without waiting for the democratization of the institutions of all the European states." [...] UNA-USA's Jeff Laurenti notes the problems associated with excluding undemocratic countries from membership: [...] "It is one thing to deny membership to a few small [...] "rogue" [...] dictatorships. It is <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> exclude China, the vast majority of Arab countries, and two-thirds of Africa, and imagine that the resulting body can have a formal consultative or oversight role with United Nations agencies, be part of UN-sponsored negotiations on multilateral conventions (the real work of international legislating), or pass on the resolutions of UN political bodies." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the music video for [...] "Hollywood", Samuel Bourdin, the son of Guy Bourdin, filed a federal lawsuit that accused Madonna of ripping off the work of his father. Bourdin said they are [...] "strikingly similar" [...] to {{pictures}} taken by his father from the 1950s to 1980s decades and published in French Vogue magazine. He accused Madonna of copyright infringement over at least eleven of Bourdin's works, including one of Madonna with her legs spread on top of a TV set. [...] "It's one thing to draw inspiration; it's <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> simply plagiarize {{the heart and soul of}} my father's work", Bourdin said at the time. Included in Bourdin's federal complaint were side-by-side comparisons of his father's work with images with stills from the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video. According to Dustin Robertson, editor of the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video, the sequences featuring Madonna in a red dress staring into a mirror are the ones which were pointed by Bourdin's estate in the lawsuit. The lawsuit named Madonna, Warner Bros. Records, and Mondino as defendants. The details presented in the lawsuit read as: [...] "Factors such as composition, background, wardrobe, lighting, narrative, camera angle, decor, and objects depicted are strikingly similar... There are very few scenes or sequences in the 'Hollywood' video that are not directly derived from the Bourdin works." [...] Details of the financial settlement are confidential, and Madonna acknowledged no wrongdoing in her liberal appropriation of the images. Bourdin's lawyer, John Koegel, said the parties reached a [...] "very, very successful settlement", adding that terms of the deal did not allow him to discuss exact dollar amounts. In 2011, news website Independent Online disclosed the settled amount by Madonna to be $600,000.|$|E
2500|$|My So-Called Life was {{produced}} before {{the explosion of}} youth and teen programming. The culture of television changed significantly {{in the years that}} immediately followed, most notably with the rise of The WB and UPN, networks that eventually catered to the teenaged audience My So-Called Life sought, in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) (The WB and UPN launched just two weeks and one week respectively before My So-Called Lifes run on ABC ended). Holzman never intended the show to be exclusively for teens. In the end, not enough viewers of any age were watching the show during its initial network run. ABC was more focused on larger ratings numbers and wider demographics. Holzman said, [...] "It is one thing to have huge ratings, but it is <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> <b>to</b> have smaller ratings but with an extremely passionate following. I don't understand why the network did not understand that." ...|$|E

60|$|Ida quietly met his gaze. The man was well-favored physically, honest, courteous and considerate, and in {{many ways}} she liked him.

60|$|Vanessa {{began to}} arrive at the {{conclusion}} that a husband who added a roving disposition to a settled income was a mixed blessing.

60|$|When the awe-struck savages {{saw that}} the food {{disappeared}} overnight they were filled with consternation and dread, for {{it was one thing}} to put food out to propitiate a god or a devil, but <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> thing <b>to</b> have the spirit really come into the village and eat it.
