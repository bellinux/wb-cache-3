50|$|The K1810VM86 (К1810ВМ86) is a Soviet 16-bit microprocessor, a clone of the Intel 8086 CPU {{with which}} it is binary and pin compatible. It was {{developed}} between 1982 and 1985. The original K1810VM86 supported a clock frequency of up to 5 MHz while up to 8 MHz were allowed for the later K1810VM86M (К1810ВМ86M; corresponding to Intel 8086-2). The K1810VM86 was manufactured plastic 40-pin dual <b>in-line</b> <b>package</b> (as KR1810VM86 / КР1810ВМ86) or in a 40-pin ceramic dual <b>in-line</b> <b>package</b> (as KM1810VM86 / КМ1810ВМ86 for the commercial version or M1810VM86 / М1810ВМ86 for the military version).|$|R

50|$|Like most {{integrated}} circuits {{of the period}} 1963-1990, commercial TTL devices are usually <b>packaged</b> in dual <b>in-line</b> <b>packages</b> (DIPs), usually with 14 to 24 pins, for through-hole or socket mounting. The DIPs were usually made of epoxy plastic (PDIP) for commercial-grade parts or of ceramic (CDIP) for military-grade parts.|$|R

25|$|After a {{redesign}} in 1983, the VIC-II was {{encased in}} a plastic dual <b>in-line</b> <b>package,</b> which reduced costs substantially, {{but it did not}} totally eliminate the heat problem. Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a heat sink. To avoid extra cost, the metal RF shielding doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in Europe shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers. The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic dual <b>in-line</b> <b>package,</b> but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.|$|R
5000|$|The zig-zag <b>in-line</b> <b>package</b> or ZIP was a {{short-lived}} packaging technology for integrated circuits, particularly dynamic RAM chips. It {{was intended as}} a replacement for dual <b>in-line</b> <b>packaging</b> (DIL or DIP). A ZIP is an integrated circuit encapsulated in a slab of plastic with 20 or 40 pins, measuring (for the ZIP-20 package) about 3 mm x 30 mm x 10 mm. The package's pins protrude in two rows from one of the long edges. The two rows are staggered by 1.27 mm (0.05"), giving them a zig-zag appearance, and allowing them to be spaced more closely than a rectangular grid would allow. The pins are inserted into holes in a printed circuit board, with the packages standing at right-angles to the board, allowing them to be placed closer together than DIPs of the same size. ZIPs have now been superseded by surface-mount packages such as the thin small-outline packages (TSOPs) used on single-in-line memory modules (SIMMs) and dual-in-line memory modules (DIMMs).|$|R
