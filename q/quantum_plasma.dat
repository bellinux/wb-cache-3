40|$|A plasma becomes quantum {{when the}} quantum {{nature of its}} {{particles}} significantly affects its macroscopic properties. To {{answer the question of}} when the collective <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma</b> effects are important, a proper description of such effects is necessary. We consider here the most common methods of description of <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma,</b> along with the related assumptions and applicability limits. In particular, we analyze in detail the hydrodynamic description of <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma,</b> as well as discuss some kinetic features of analytic properties of linear dielectric response function in <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma.</b> We point out the most important, in our view, fundamental problems occurring already in the linear approximation and requiring further investigation.

40|$|Propagation of a Gaussian x-ray {{laser beam}} has been {{analyzed}} in collisionless thermal <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma</b> with considering a ramped density profile. In this density profile {{due to the}} increase in the plasma density, an earlier and stronger self-focusing effect is noticed where the beam width oscillates with higher frequency and less amplitude. Moreover, the effect of the density profile slope and the initial plasma density on the laser propagation has been studied. It is found that, by increasing the initial density and the ramp slope, the laser beam focuses faster with less oscillation amplitude, smaller laser spot size and more oscillations. Furthermore, a comparison is made among the laser self-focusing in thermal <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma,</b> cold <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma</b> and classical plasma.

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{attractive}} force between ions that are shielded by degenerate electrons in <b>quantum</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Specifically, {{we show that}} the electric potential around an isolated ion has a hard core negative part that resembles the Lennard-Jones–type potential. Physically, the new electric potential is attributed to the consideration of the quantum statistical pressure and the quantum Bohm potential, {{as well as the}} electron exchange and electron correlations due to electron- 1 / 2 spin {{within the framework of the}} quantum hydrodynamical description of <b>quantum</b> <b>plasmas.</b> The shape of the attractive potential is determined by the ratio between the Bohr radius and the Wigner-Seitz radius of degenerate electrons. The existence of the hard core negative potential will be responsible for the attraction of ions forming lattices and atoms or molecules, as well as for critical points and phase transitions in <b>quantum</b> <b>plasmas</b> at nanoscales...|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{screening}} {{effects of}} dense <b>quantum</b> <b>plasmas</b> on charge exchange processes of a fully stripped ion colliding with a hydrogen atom are studied by the classical trajectory Monte Carlo method. The inter-particle interactions are {{described by the}} exponential cosine-screened Coulomb potentials. It is found that in weak screening conditions, cross sections increase {{with the increase of}} the ionic charge Z. However, in strong screening conditions, the dependence of cross sections on the ionic charge is related to the incident particle energy. At high energies, cross sections show a linear increase with the increase of Z, whereas at low energies, cross sections for Z >= 4 become approximately the same. The He 2 + and C 6 + impacting charge exchange cross sections in dense <b>quantum</b> <b>plasmas</b> are also compared with those in weakly coupled plasmas. The interactions are described by the static screened Coulomb potential. It is found that for both He 2 + and C 6 +, the oscillatory screening effects of dense <b>quantum</b> <b>plasmas</b> are almost negligible in weak screening conditions. However, in strong screening conditions, the oscillatory screening effects enhance the screening effects of dense <b>quantum</b> <b>plasmas,</b> and the enhancement becomes more and more significant with the increase of the screening parameter and the ionic charge.

Quantum diffraction is described by a modified Bohm potential consistent with finite temperature quantum kinetic theory in the long wavelength limit. The dispersion relation of the obliquely propagating electrostatic waves in magnetized <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma</b> with arbitrary degeneracy of electrons is obtained. Using the reductive perturbation method, the corresponding Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation is derived, describing obliquely propagating two-dimensional ion-acoustic solitons in a magnetized <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma</b> with degenerate electrons having arbitrary electron temperature. It is found that in the dilute plasma case only electrostatic potential hump structures are possible, while in dense <b>quantum</b> <b>plasma</b> in principle both hump and dip soliton structures are obtainable, depending on the electron plasma density and its temperature.

We show contribution of the exchange interaction in the dispersion of the Langmuir, and ion-acoustic waves. We consider influence of the spin polarization ratio on strength of the Coulomb exchange interaction. This is important since exchange interaction between particles with same spin direction and particles with opposite spin directions are different. At small particle concentrations $n_{ 0 }> 10 ^{ 25 }cm^{- 3 }$ the Fermi pressure prevails over the exchange interaction for all polarizations.
