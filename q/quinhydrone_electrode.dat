40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} an {{alternative}} concept of biofuelcell functioning {{based on the}} unconventional use of enzymes to create apH difference generating a potential difference between <b>electrodes</b> soaked in <b>quinhydrone</b> solutions. The <b>electrode</b> and <b>quinhydrone</b> solution were confined in a dialysis bag placed into a compartment containing either glucose oxidase and catalase for the biocathode or urease for the bioanode. In presence of 0. 4 mol L− 1 glucose and urea, the enzyme reactions generate apH difference of 3. 55, both compartments being separated by an agar-agar wall. The resulting biofuelcell exhibits an open-circuit voltage and maximum power of 208 mV and 30. 6 μW, respectively, without immobilization and electrical connection of the involved enzymes. In addition, this biofuelcell was able to provide continuously 10 μA during 23 h, producing 0. 133 J and 0. 828 C. A similar biofuelcell configuration based only on dialysis bags was also developed. A graphite disk electrode elaborated by mechanical compression of graphite particles and quinhydrone, {{was placed in a}} dialysis bag itself confined into another dialysis bag containing enzyme solution. The resulting power and open-circuit voltage at saturating substrate conditions are 7. 6 μW and 157 mV, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of hydroquinone for the coulometric generation of hydrogen ions in propylene carbonate (PC) and g-butyrolactone (GBL) is described. The current-potential curves recorded for theid sepolarizer, titrated bases, indicator and the solvents used {{showed that the}} investigated depolarizer is oxidized at lower potentials than the oxidation potentials of other components in the solution. the hydrogen ions generated by the oxidation of hydroquinone {{were used for the}} titration of organic bases (triethylamine, n-butylamine, pyridine, quinoline, aniline, N,N-diphenylguanidine, piperidine, and 2, 2 -bipiridine) in PC and GBL with visual (Crystal Violet as indicator) and potentiometric end-point detection using a <b>quinhydrone</b> <b>electrode</b> as the indicator electrode. The quinhydrone added to the to be analyzed solution served both as a source of hydrogen ions and, together with the immersed platinum electrode, as a <b>quinhydrone</b> <b>electrode.</b> The relative error of the determination of the bases was about 1 %...|$|E

The changes in free energy were calculated from the stabilìty constants, obtained from a potentiometric determination of the concentmtion of free hydrogen ion, using a glass or <b>quinhydrone</b> <b>electrode.</b> The enthalpy values were measured calorimetrically.

40|$|The present {{work is a}} {{continuation}} of the systematic survey of the solubilities, apparent dissociation constants, and thermodynamic properties of the amino acids, which for some time {{have been the subject of}} study in this laboratory (1). We are reporting the solubility in water of d-tyrosine, dl-tyrosine, diiodo-dl-tyrosine, dibromo-ltyrosine, and dichloro-/-tyrosine over a temperature range of from 0 ° to 50 °C.; and the apparent dissociation constants of dibromo-l-tyrosine and dichloro-/-tyrosine at 25 ° and 40 °C. From these data we have calculated the heats of solution of all of the above amino acids and the apparent heats of ionization of dibromo-l-tyrosine and dichloro-/tyrosine. Methods The technique employed for obtaining the solubilities of the amino acids was the same as described by Dalton and Schmidt (2). The concentrations of the amino acids in the saturated solutions were obtained by micro Kjeldahl determinations of nitrogen (3). The criteria of purity of the preparations were constant solubility after repeated recrystallization and constant solubility when there was a small excess and a large excess of the solid phase. For estimating the apparent dissociation constants, the solubilities of the amino acids were determined in aqueous solutions and in solutions containing varying amounts of sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. The hydrogen ion activities of the solutions were determined with the aid of the <b>quinhydrone</b> <b>electrode.</b> They are based on the value 1. 078 for the pall of 0. 1000 molar HC 1 (4), and on the assumption that contact potential differences were eliminated by the use of saturated potassium chloride. It was found impossible to use a hydrogen electrode because dibromo-l-tyroslne and dichloro-l-tyrosine are easily reduced to tyrosine by hydrogen in the presence of platinum black. This procedure fo...|$|E
40|$|Most methods {{available}} for the determination of pH must be sub jected to critical study when applied to sea water. The reason {{lies in the fact}} that sea water is a relatively weakly buffered medium with a high salt content. For instance, the application of the colorimetric method to sea water has required the evaluation of rather large correc tion factors for the so-called salt error. In the case of the <b>quinhydrone</b> <b>electrode,</b> the determinations of sea water are not only subject to a salt error but accuracy is also impaired by the inherent instability of quinone at the pH values encountered. The method of choice would appear to be the glass electrode since it is highly suitable to unbuffered solutions. It is, however, well known that the glass electrode is susceptible to salt effects particularly in the alkaline range. It is the purpose of this paper to show that the salt content of sea water does not interfere with the application of the glass electrode to the determination of its pH and that such determinations may be made with a fair degree of accuracy. PROCEDURE The method of reference in all pH determinations is the hydrogen electrode. It would therefore appear that the simplest procedure for checking the accuracy of the glass electrode would be parallel determina tions on sea water by both procedures. Such a study is unfortunately open to experimental difficulty by reason of the fact that the CO 2 ten sion of sea water and thereby its pH is altered while developing the atmosphere of hydrogen necessary to the use of the hydrogen electrode. Though this experimental difficulty is surmountable by the use of spe cial apparatus of the type described by McClendon (1917), it was felt that a simpler though valid test of the effect of sea salt on the glass electrode might be furnished by parallel determinations by both methods on sea water deaerated with hydrogen. Even though the pH of sea water so treated is altered toward more alkaline values a sample uni formly treated should serve for an adequate comparison of the tw...|$|E
