40|$|This essay {{argues that}} John Cleland's pornographic novel, Fanny Hill, conceals {{coercion}} by employing {{the language of}} materialism to suggest that all sex, commercial or not, produces pleasure. While the ostensible benevolence of human instinct allows the novel to sidestep <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> and rape, they persist until Fanny's marriage, which delivers her to conjugal felicity. Fanny Hill presents an extreme version of the marriage plot, showing that marriage's claim to retroactively pardon harm allows it to sanction violent means. Cleland's novel implicates Pamela by demonstrating that they share a basic structure: materialist pornography, like the marriage plot, transforms injury into the impossibility thereof, forcefully restricting first-person narrative in the process...|$|E

Two cases of Mirizzi syndrome type II are presented.

40|$|The rate of {{diffusion}} {{through the}} non-aqueous {{layer of the}} protoplasm depends largely on the partition coefficients mentioned above. Since these cannot be determined we have employed an artificial system in which chloroform is used {{in place of the}} non-aqueous layer of the protoplasm. The partition coefficients may be roughly determined by shaking up the aqueous solutions with chloroform and analyzing with the spectrophotometer (which is necessary with methylene blue because we are dealing with mixtures). This will show what dyes may be expected to pass through the protoplasm into the vacuole in case it behaves like the artificial system. From these results we may conclude that the artificial system and the living cell act almost alike toward methylene blue and azure B, which supports the notion of non-aqueous layers in the protoplasm. There is a close resemblance between Valonia and the artificial system in their behavior toward these dyes at pH 9. 5. In the case of Nitella, on the other hand, with methylene blue solution at pH 9. 2 the sap in the artificial system takes up relatively more azure B (absorption maximum at 650 mµ) than the vacuole of the living cell (655 mµ). But both take up azure B much more rapidly than methylene blue. A comparison cannot be made between the behavior of the artificial system and that of the living cell at pH 5. 5 since in the latter case there arises a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to cells before enough dye is collected in the sap for analysis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{literature}} on sexual assault has not directly addressed the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> genital <b>injuries</b> in women without prior sexual intercourse experience. Given {{the paucity of}} research and the current importance of physical evidence {{in the criminal justice}} system, {{this study was designed to}} document the type and site <b>of</b> genital <b>injuries</b> from sexual assault in women without and with prior sexual intercourse experience. METHODS: The charts were reviewed of 132 women who had been sexually assaulted and had sought medical treatment at the Sexual Assault Care Centre (SACC), Women's College Hospital, Toronto, within 10 days after the assault. Half (66) of the women reported that, at the time of the assault, they had no prior sexual intercourse experience. The Sexual Assault Evidence Kit in each patient's file was reviewed to ascertain the type and location <b>of</b> genital <b>injuries.</b> Types <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> were classified into 3 categories (nonperforating soft-tissue injuries, lacerations or current bleeding) and locations into 6 categories (labia majora and minora, posterior fourchette and introitus, hymen, vagina, cervix, and anus). RESULTS: Significantly more women without than with prior sexual intercourse experience had visible genital injuries (65. 2 % v. 25. 8 %, p < 0. 01). However, of the women without prior experience, only 9. 1 % had hymenal perforation. Analyses of the data for only women with genital injuries indicated no difference between those without and those with prior sexual intercourse experience in the overall mean number of injured sites (1. 65 and 1. 47 respectively) or in the mean number of sites with nonperforating soft-tissue injuries (0. 349 and 0. 706), lacerations (0. 953 and 0. 471) and bleeding (0. 279 and 0. 294). INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that genital injuries are more common in women without prior sexual intercourse experience but that substantial proportions of all women, regardless of their prior sexual experience at the time of assault, will not have visible genital injuries. Emergency department staff and members of the criminal justice system need to be aware of the variable presentation of genital trauma related to sexual assault in women with and without prior sexual intercourse experience...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay {{is to give the}} reader an insight in the subject of torture. This is done through both an {{historical}} perspective and by showing how torture methods are used today, even though torture is prohibited by law. Many refugees who come to Sweden today have survived torture, and the trauma can cause multiple illnesses related to the tragic memories. In addition to physical damage many also suffer from depression and post traumatic stress, due to the experiences of torture. Together with the Swedish Red Cross we designed a questionnaire which was sent to politicians and elected officials. In the questionnaire we asked <b>questions</b> concerning knowledge <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> due to torture and what treatment options these people have in Sweden. Some <b>of</b> the <b>questions</b> are based in the concept of solidarity. The responses from this survey are the basis for analysis and discussion and are linked to our theories of organization and solidarity. The analysis shows that the knowledge is generally good, and the political parties in general have a collective solidarity approach to the care of people who are victims of torture...|$|R

40|$|In shock-wave lithotripsy—a medical {{procedure}} to fragment kidney stones—the patient {{is subjected to}} hypersonic waves focused at the kidney stone. Although this procedure is widely applied, the physics behind this medical treatment, in particular the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> how the <b>injuries</b> to the surrounding kidney tissue arise, is still under investigation. To contribute to the solution of this problem, two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations of a human kidney under shock-wave loading are presented. For this purpose a constitutive model of the bio-mechanical system kidney is introduced, which is able to map large visco-elastic deformations and, in particular, material damage. The specific phenomena of cavitation induced oscillating bubbles is modeled here as an evolution of spherical pores within the soft kidney tissue. By means of large scale finite element simulations, we study the shock-wave propagation into the kidney tissue, adapt unknown material parameters and analyze the resulting stress states. The simulations predict localized damage in the human kidney in the same regions as observed in animal experiments. Furthermore, the numerical results suggest that in first instance the pressure amplitude of the shock wave impulse (and not so much its exact time-pressure profile) is responsible for damaging the kidney tissue...|$|R

I must admit firstly that this case, on first glance, might not immediately appear to lend itself to the contemporary aims of the movement of ‘Earth jurisprudence’ in Australia. The case is more than 100 years old, Canadian, and relates to a narrow area of common law concerning civil liability for animals. It concerns the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> responsibility for <b>injury</b> inflicted by an escaping bear as between a husband and wife: the husband being the keeper of the bear and the wife being the owner of the property on which it was kept. All the relevant legal ‘persons’ in this case are therefore human, and the environmental implications are somewhat peripheral.

This research project focused on estimating the burden <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> on large federal wildland fires and describing the injury characteristics and risk factors for severity <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> {{in a sample of}} injured federal wildland firefighters. Chapter 2 2 ̆ 2 Peak incident management level affects rates <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> on large federal wildland fires 2 ̆ 2 reports estimates <b>of</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> for large federal wildland fires and assesses the effect of peak incident management level (PIML) as a predictor <b>of</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> After adjusting for seasonal factors and fire characteristics, PIML was a predictor of both rate <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> and odds <b>of</b> any <b>injury</b> occurrence, but the effect was opposite. Fires with higher PIML demonstrated lower incidence rate ratios, but the odds <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> were increased. Chapter 3 2 ̆ 2 Wildland fire job assignment and burden <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> 2 ̆ 2 describes the injury characteristics and severity associated with the firefighter 2 ̆ 7 s job assignment in fire-related injuries reported to the United States Department of Interior.
