25|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>communication</b> {{involves}} encoding {{information in}} quantum states, or qubits, {{as opposed to}} classical communication's use of bits. Usually, photons are used for these quantum states. Quantum key distribution exploits certain properties of these quantum states to ensure its security. There are several different approaches to quantum key distribution, {{but they can be}} divided into two main categories depending on which property they exploit.|$|E
25|$|This protocol, {{known as}} BB84 after its inventors and year of publication, was {{originally}} described using photon polarization states to transmit the information. However, any {{two pairs of}} conjugate states {{can be used for}} the protocol, and many optical fibre based implementations described as BB84 use phase encoded states. The sender (traditionally referred to as Alice) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a <b>quantum</b> <b>communication</b> channel which allows quantum states to be transmitted. In the case of photons this channel is generally either an optical fibre or simply free space. In addition they communicate via a public classical channel, for example using broadcast radio or the internet. Neither of these channels need to be secure; the protocol is designed with the assumption that an eavesdropper (referred to as Eve) can interfere in any way with both.|$|E

25|$|China's {{advanced}} {{technology is the}} result of the integration of various related technological experiences. Early Chinese satellites, such as the FSW series, have undergone many atmospheric reentry tests. In the 1990s China had commercial launches, resulting in more launch experiences and a high success rate after the 1990s. China has aimed to undertake scientific development in fields like Solar System exploration. China's Shenzhou 7 spacecraft successfully performed an EVA in September 2008. China's Shenzhou 9 spacecraft successfully performed a manned docking in June 2012. Furthermore, China's Chang'e 2 explorer became the first object to reach Sun-Earth Lagrangian point in August 2011 and also the first probe to explore both Moon and asteroid by making a flyby of the asteroid 4179 Toutatis. China has launched DAMPE, the most capable dark matter explorer to date in 2015, and world's first <b>quantum</b> <b>communication</b> satellite QUESS in 2016.|$|E

40|$|The counterfactuality of {{recently}} proposed protocols is analyzed. A definition of `counterfactuality' is offered {{and it is}} argued that an interaction-free measurement of the presence of an opaque object can be named `counterfactual', while proposed "counterfactual" measurements of the absence of such objects are not counterfactual. The quantum key distribution protocols which rely only on measurements of the presence of the object are counterfactual, but <b>quantum</b> direct <b>communication</b> protocols are not. Therefore, the name `counterfactual' is not appropriate for recent "counterfactual" protocols which transfer quantum states by <b>quantum</b> direct <b>communication.</b> Comment: Proceedings of presentation in "Quantum Theory: from Problems to Advances", Vaxjo 2015, to be published in IJQ...|$|R

40|$|Broadcast {{encryption}} {{allows the}} sender to securely distribute his/her secret to a dynamically changing {{group of users}} over a broadcast channel. In this paper, we just consider a simple broadcast <b>communication</b> task in <b>quantum</b> scenario, which the center party broadcasts his/her secret to multi-receiver via quantum channel. We present three <b>quantum</b> broadcast <b>communication</b> schemes. The first scheme utilizes entanglement swapping and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state to realize a task that the center party broadcasts the secret {{to a group of}} receivers who share a group key with the center party. In the second scheme, based on dense coding, the center party broadcasts the secret to multi-receiver who share each of their authentication key with the center party.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{eavesdropping}} detection efficiency in two-step <b>quantum</b> direct <b>communication</b> protocol, an improved eavesdropping detection strategy using four-particle GHZ state is proposed, in which four-particle GHZ state is used to detect eavesdroppers. During the security analysis, the method of the entropy theory is introduced, and two detection strategies are compared quantitatively by using the constraint between the information which eavesdropper can obtain and the interference introduced. If the eavesdroppers intend to obtain all information, the eavesdropping detection rate of the original two-step <b>quantum</b> direct <b>communication</b> protocol by using EPR pair block as detection particles is 50 %; while the proposed strategy's detection rate is 88 %. In the end, {{the security of the}} proposed protocol is discussed. The analysis results show that the eavesdropping detection strategy presented is more secure.

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of information theory and cryptography, we analyze the security of two quantum dialogue protocols and a bidirectional <b>quantum</b> secure direct <b>communication</b> (QSDC) protocol, and {{point out that the}} transmitted information would be partly leaked out in them.

This phenomenon should have been strictly forbidden in a <b>quantum</b> secure <b>communication.</b> In fact, this problem exists in quite a few recent proposals and, therefore, it deserves more research attention in the following related study.
