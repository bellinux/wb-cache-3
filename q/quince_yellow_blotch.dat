40|$|A {{wide range}} of fungi, two {{bacteria}} and several viruses and nematodes have been recorded throughout the tropics {{on a group of}} Cassia species defined as taxonomically and geographically related to Cassia rotundifolia. Although limited information was found on the relative importance of these pathogens, the fungi Alternaria cassiae, Corynespora cassiicola, Phomopsis cassiae, Pseudocercospora nigricans, Pseudoperonospora cassiae and Ravenelia berkeleyii and the viruses Cassia Mild Mosaic, Cassia <b>Yellow</b> <b>Blotches</b> and Cassia <b>Yellow</b> <b>Blotch</b> are considered the most serious. Specific recommendations are made to evaluate the reaction of C. rotundifolia cv. Wynn to these pathogens. The attention of Australian pasture scientists is drawn to recent plans to develop mycoherbicides for controlling pantropical Cassia weeds and the implications of their use in South-east Asia and the south-west Pacific.

The body and fins are devoid of any dark markings, with the only breaks in colouration being <b>yellow</b> <b>blotches</b> on the cheeks and a <b>yellow</b> <b>blotch</b> {{on the base of}} the first dorsal fin. The first dorsal fin has a white base, becoming darker dorsally, while the anal fin is white, becoming more yellow {{at the base of the}} fin.
