40|$|Although Japanese {{institutional}} investors continue to favor hedge funds and funds of hedge funds over other alternative investments, {{more and more}} Japanese pensions, banks, and insurance companies are now seriously exploring opportunities in private equity. How can Japanese investors effectively identify and conduct due diligence on promising private equity funds? If such funds prove attractive, how can they obtain access in cases where capacity is limited? Once invested, what methods are available to these investors to accurately value the private equity portfolios and monitor the ongoing operations of their fund managers?

To examine these <b>and</b> related <b>questions,</b> the Program on Alternative Investments hosted its second seminar and roundtable in Tokyo on March 11, 2005.

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was the {{identification}} of effective and efficient means of providing quality staff development for reading instruction within a school-district setting. The study investigated the comparative effectiveness of two staff development delivery systems measured by 1) a cognitive test of a school district's reading program and 2) an affective measure of teacher attitudes toward staff development. The sample was drawn from the teacher population of a large urban school district. The 46 subjects were elementary school teachers in grades K- 5 randomly divided into two groups: Group A (videotape with a trained on-site facilitator) and Group B (face-to-face live presenter). Participants in the study received training using "The Fort Worth Reading Program," a staff development program designed by the researcher. In addition to the presentation of content information, which is the central component, the program features small group discussions, off-line activities, <b>and</b> <b>question</b> <b>and</b> <b>answer</b> <b>periods.</b> Both groups received the same treatment with the following exception. A central component to the Group A training was the presentation of content information in a videotape format. Group B did not view the videotape, but received the same information via live presenter. Two instruments developed by the researcher were used in the study: 1) The Teacher Staff Development Questionnaire, a Likert-type survey to obtain teacher attitudes toward staff development, and 2) The Cognitive Test of Reading Knowledge, an instrument designed to measure cognitive objectives of the district's reading program. A multivariate analysis of covariance revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups. It was concluded that elementary classroom teachers, regardless of their attitudes toward staff development, learn content material equally well with either of the two delivery systems explored in this study. Specific suggestions and recommendations for further studies are addressed and discussed. Examples of the measurement instruments are included...|$|R
