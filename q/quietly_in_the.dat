5|$|The exact {{position}} of the Polish Army is unknown, {{but part of the}} Polish right flank, moving <b>quietly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dense mist, encircled Maximilian's left flank. After the mist began to clear the Archduke realized his force was being flanked and his retreat to Byczyna was threatened. He ordered an attack, but a miscommunication of his orders confused part of his army and the Hungarian regiment began to retreat. The Polish left wing, under command of future Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, dispersed the opposing units. The battle saw more infantry action than many others of the Commonwealth but, even so, the Polish cavalry (Polish winged hussars) played a major part. The battle began with some duels between elears (cavalry champions), soon followed by Polish cavalry charges, on the left flank and in the center, which did not result in any significant breakthroughs for either side. Zamoyski is said to have commanded the battle very well, turning it at several points. Eventually a Polish hussar counterattack on the left flank mauled Maximilan's Hungarian cavalry and forced his army to start giving ground. The bloody retreat quickly turned into a general rout during which the Archduke's army suffered heavy casualties.|$|E

25|$|In shaping legislation, Rayburn {{preferred}} working <b>quietly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{background to}} being in the public spotlight. As Speaker, he won a reputation for fairness and integrity. In his years in Congress, Rayburn always insisted on paying his own expenses, even {{going so far as}} to pay for his own travel expenses when inspecting the Panama Canal when his committee was considering legislation concerning it, rather than exercising his right to have the government pay for it. After he died his estate was valued at just under $300,000, which was mostly land he owned, and the amount of cash he had in various checking accounts was just over $26,000.|$|E

25|$|Rayburn {{was elected}} House Majority Leader in 1937 and was {{elevated}} {{to the position}} of Speaker of the House after the death of William B. Bankhead. He led the House Democrats from 1940 to 1961, and served as Speaker of the House from 1940 to 1947, 1949 to 1953, and 1955 to 1961. He also served as House Minority Leader from 1947 to 1949 and from 1953 to 1955. Rayburn preferred to work <b>quietly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background and allowed committee chairmen to retain much of the power in the House. He refused to sign the Southern Manifesto and was influential in the construction of U.S. Route 66. He served as Speaker until his death in 1961, and was succeeded by John William McCormack.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{situated}} at 3145 Las Vegas Boulevard South, between Desert Inn Road and Sands Avenue. The original name {{for many years}} was Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn. Wilbur Clark, described by Frank Sinatra biographer James Kaplan as a [...] "onetime San Diego bellhop and Reno craps dealer", originally began building the resort with his brother in 1947 with $250,000, but ran out of money. Author Hal Rothman notes that [...] "for nearly two years the framed structure sat in the hot desert sun, looking more like an ancient relic than a nascent casino". Clark approached the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for investment, but it was struggling financially. In 1949, he met with Moe Dalitz, {{the head of the}} notorious Cleveland gang, the Mayfield Road Mob, and Dalitz agreed to fund 75% of the project with $1.3 million, and construction resumed. Much of the financing came from the American National Insurance Company (ANICO), though Clark became the public frontman of the resort while Dalitz remained <b>quietly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> background as the principal owner. The resort would eventually be renamed Desert Inn and was called the [...] "D.I." [...] by Las Vegas locals and regular guests.|$|E

Over {{the span of}} the two animals' lives, man and dog hunt the fox, the Master using over a dozen hunting {{techniques}} in his quest for revenge. With each hunt, both dog and fox learn new tricks and methods to outsmart each other, Tod always escaping in the end. Tod mates with an older, experienced vixen who gives birth to a litter of kits. Before they are grown, the Master finds the den and gasses the kits to death. That winter, the Master sets out leg hold traps, which Tod carefully learns how to spring, but the vixen is caught and killed. In January, Tod takes a new mate, {{with whom he has}} another litter of kits. The Master uses a [...] "still hunting" [...] technique, in which he sits very <b>quietly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wood while playing a rabbit call to draw out the foxes. With this method, he kills the kits; then by using the sound of a wounded fox kit, he is also able to draw out and kill Tod's mate.|$|E

2500|$|The sixth abbot of Coggeshall's abbey (from 1207–18), Lord Ralph {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} chroniclers of his time, described by the historian E. L.

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of 24 February, Clarke and Ryder dined at the British Consulate, finally meeting with Vichaichan. The Governor put before him {{the terms of the}} offer.

2500|$|The {{expanded}} {{portion of}} the ode {{is related to the}} ideas expressed in Wordsworth's The Prelude Book V in their emphasis on childhood memories and a connection between the divine and humanity. To Wordsworth, the soul was created by the divine and was able to recognise the light in the world. As a person ages, they are no longer able to see the light, but they can still recognise the beauty in the world. He elaborated on this belief in a note to the text: [...] "Archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind? Having to wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the [...] "Immortality of the Soul", I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use I could of it as a Poet." [...] This [...] "notion of pre-existence" [...] is somewhat Platonic in nature, and it is the basis for Wordsworth believing that children are able to be the [...] "best philosopher". The idea was not intended as a type of , the reincarnation of the soul from person to person, and Wordsworth later explained that the poem was not meant to be regarded as a complete philosophical view: [...] "In my Ode... I do not profess to give a literal representation {{of the state of the}} affections and of the moral being in childhood. I record my feelings at that time,--my absolute spirituality, my 'all-soulness,' if I may so speak. At that time I could not believe that I should lie down <b>quietly</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> grave, and that my body would moulder into dust." ...|$|E

50|$|Following the 1956 {{parliamentary}} elections the party, {{as well as}} other rebel groups, began to suffer from defections from its armed wing.

[...] Giant third baseman Buck Herzog deliberately collided with Speaker to prevent an inside-the-park home run, but Speaker got up and came home anyway. [...] Becker threw the ball in to cutoff man Tillie Shafer, who threw to the plate but catcher Art Wilson dropped the ball—for New York's fifth error of the game—and Speaker, who was credited with a triple on the play, scored to tie the game 6–6. [...] McGraw claimed, and reporters in the press box agreed, that Speaker had missed first base, but base umpire Cy Rigler ruled that he hadn't on appeal.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Steatornis caripensis (the oilbird) is a {{very unusual}} bird. It {{supposedly}} never sees daylight, roosting in huge aggregations <b>in</b> caves during <b>the</b> day and bringing back fruit to the cave at night. As a consequence {{a large number of}} the seeds from the fruit they feed upon germinate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cave and spoil. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we use newly developed GPS/acceleration loggers with remote UHF readout to show that several assumptions about the behaviour of Steatornis caripensis need to be revised. On average, they spend only every 3 (rd) day in a cave, individuals spent most days sitting <b>quietly</b> <b>in</b> trees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rainforest where they regurgitate seeds. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This provides new data on the extent of seed dispersal and the movement ecology of Steatornis caripensis. It suggests that Steatornis caripensis is perhaps the most important long-distance seed disperser in Neotropical forests. We also show that colony-living comes with high activity costs to individuals...|$|R
