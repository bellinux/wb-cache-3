40|$|The present paper investigates {{a type of}} broad-subject {{construction}} in Egyptian Arabic in which an adjective or participial structurally <b>qualifies</b> the <b>head</b> noun (or subject) but logically qualifies a subsequent noun, as in ir-raagil [il-ħilwiin banaat-u] 'the man the beautiful. PL his daughters'. This Adjectival Relative Construction is interesting in that it incorporates properties of both relative clauses and adjectival phrases. I evaluate the main analytical approaches in the literature and conclude {{that it must be}} analyzed as a hybrid type of nominal modifier that has adjectival and relative characteristics. Binding to the head noun is accomplished through a semantically motivated resumptive pronoun...|$|R

40|$|Exposure of {{children}} to second-hand smoke (SHS) leads to increased risk of health and social problems and uptake of smoking in the future. We aimed to assess the prevalence {{of children}}’s exposure to SHS in their homes, in a deprived area in the North of England and identify what people thought would help them achieve a smoke-free home (SFH). We performed a cross-sectional survey of 318 households {{with at least one}} child aged under 16 years in Beeston Hill, a deprived locality in Leeds, England in June 2008. One hundred and seventy-three households [54 %, 95 % confidence interval (C. I.) 49 – 60] had at least one smoker in the house. In 42 % (95 % C. I. 35 – 50) of these households (n = 73), smoking took place in the presence of children. The odds of allowing smoking in front of children were 2. 2 (95 % C. I. 1. 1 – 4. 5) times greater in households whose head had less than A-level (national exams at 18 years) or equivalent qualification than in homes with a more <b>qualified</b> <b>head</b> of household. 92 % of respondents were aware that SHS has negative effects on children’s health. However, 71 % felt more information about health risks to children would help reduce exposure to SHS in the home. Smoking in the presence of children takes place in a relatively high proportion of households with smoker(s), despite media awareness campaigns regarding the dangers of passive smoking launched alongside the recently enforced smoke-free public and workplaces legislation. Specific promotion of SFHs is needed to protect the health of children...|$|R

This would be the team's only double-points finish {{in the course of}} the season.|$|R
