40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) {{devices are}} widely used in industry. The micro-actuator is an {{important}} component of such devices, transforming external influence into mechanical displacement. The development of a design technique to derive the optimal design parameters for a micro-actuator is a problem of current interest. The present paper describes a technique for determining geometric parameters for a simplified micro-actuator structure (a hemispherical shell), such that under a prescribed critical pressure it will undergo a specified discrete deflection. Such a deflection is commonly referred to as "snap-through". A mathematical model and a Finite Element procedure for the mechanical analysis of a flexible thin-walled shell under large deformation are proposed. Initially the snap-through is modelled as a <b>quasi-static</b> <b>effect,</b> but subsequently, the influence of the inertia is also considered. The optimization procedure was performed using the PSE/MACROS optimization program. The results for an example model numerical optimization are shown...|$|E
40|$|The {{stick-slip}} {{effect is}} a <b>quasi-static</b> <b>effect</b> that can occur with every mass-spring system that is subjected to significant amount of friction forces. It {{is based on the}} difference between the static and kinetic friction coefficient. If the relative velocity between two objects is zero, the sliding object will normally encounter a larger friction force (static) than when the relative velocity is bigger than zero (kinetic). Under certain conditions this friction force can alternate between static and kinetic, which can cause jerky motions between the two sliding objects and finally high spring load peaks. In this study the stick-slip effects on a moored vessel in head-on ice conditions are studied. Although the stick-slip effect in this application will only occur under specific circumstances, it will normally result in large mooring load peaks, which can ultimately {{have an effect on the}} mooring system design. A numerical model is created and validated to research the consequences and the probability of the stick-slip effect.

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) are the crosstie {{beam support}} in railway track systems. They are designed and constructed under flexural constraints {{in order to}} carry and transfer the dynamic wheel loads from the rails to the ground. Under perfect wheel and rail conditions, the dynamic loading on railway tracks could {{be treated as a}} quasi-static load using a dynamic impact factor. The current design method for the prestressed concrete sleepers taking into account the <b>quasi-static</b> <b>effect</b> is based on allowable stress where crack initiation is not permitted. In reality, the impact events are often detected due to the uncertainties of wheel or rail abnormalities such as flat wheels, dipped rails, etc. These loads are of very high magnitude but short duration. Over the design life span of the prestressed concrete sleepers, there exists the feasibility of extreme and repeated impact loading events. These have led to two proposed limit states for the consideration of structural engineers: ultimate limit states and fatigue limit states. Prestressing techniques have been long used to maintain the high endurance of the sleepers under repeated impact cycles. In spite of the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers, their impact behavior and capacity under the repetitions of severe impact loads are unclear. This paper presents the experimental investigation aimed at understanding the dynamic crack propagations in prestressed concrete sleepers in railway track structures under repeated impact loading. The impact forces have been correlated against the probabilistic track force distribution obtained from an Australian heavy haul rail network. The effects of track environment including soft and hard tracks are highlighted in this paper...|$|E

Most investigations {{have been limited}} to static and <b>quasi-static</b> <b>effects.</b> Very few studies deal with the occurrence of RF fields, which can be expected for theoretical reasons. Indirect evidence arises from microdielectrophoretic work that delivers information about the spatial distribution and temporal development of AC electric fields around biological cells. A more detailed investigation is possible by an electronic detection of these fields. A survey of both microdielectrophoretic and electronic work is given, together with some principles that are crucial for the design and interpretation of experiments. We present a multichannel frequency analysis system {{that for the first}} time allows the continuous monitoring of cellular RF activities over a wide frequency range. For the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe rhythmic signal changes with period lengths of about 400 s have been found that could be reproduced in a number of experiments...|$|R

40|$|Dispersion of {{elastic waves}} {{in a thin}} {{orthotropic}} cylindrical shell is considered, {{within the framework of}} classical 2 D Kirchhoff-Love theory. In contrast to direct multi-parametric analysis of the lowest propagating modes, an alternative robust approach is proposed that simply requires evaluation of the evanescent modes (<b>quasi-static</b> edge <b>effect),</b> which, at leading order, do not depend on vibration frequency. A shortened dispersion relation for the propagating modes is then derived by polynomial division and its accuracy is numerically tested against the full Kirchhoff-Love dispersion relation. It is shown that the same shortened relation may be also obtained from a refined dynamic version of the semi-membrane theory for cylindrical shells. The presented results may be relevant for modelling various types of nanotubes which, according to the latest experimental findings, possess strong material anisotropy...|$|R

The question is addressed whether dislocation accelerations may be ignored at high strain rates. Furthermore, the usage of high-velocity stress and displacement fields are studied. The simulations take place in a computational cell representing Al and Cu that is sheared at a strain rate of 10 ^ 6 s- 1. The computations show that the inertial effects may not be neglected. Furthermore, although the high-velocity stress and displacement fields yield significant differences locally with respect to their <b>quasi-static</b> counterparts, their <b>effect</b> on the overall stress-strain curve is negligible. ...|$|R
40|$|Complex {{built-up}} {{structures such as}} vehicles have {{a variety}} of joint types, such as spot-welds, bolted joints, rubber joints, etc. Rubber joints highly contribute to the non-linear level of the assembled structure, and represent a major source of modeling uncertainties and variability. In the general framework of developing engineering tools for virtual prototyping and product refinement, the modeling of the NVH behavior of rubber joints involve the computational burden of including a highly detailed non-linear model of the joint and the uncertainties and variability typical of that joint in a full-scale system model. In addition, certain non-linear visco-elastic behaviors typical of rubber materials are yet not fully understood and consequently not yet implemented in commercial FE codes. However, in an engineering first design phase the knowledge on the joint rubber material properties is typically poor, and the working conditions a rubber joint will experience are generally not known in detail. This lack of knowledge often does not justify the computational burden and the modeling effort of including highly detailed non-linear models of the joint in a full-scale system model. As the majority of rubber joints in NVH applications can be considered as working on a pre-loaded state under vibrations, the focus of this thesis is on the effects at full-scale level of the non-linear quasi-static and the non-linear visco-elastic rubber joint behaviors. This thesis consists of two contributions: first, a single-level non-deterministic modeling methodology is proposed to consider the Payne effect, a specific non-linear visco-elastic rubber behavior, in the evaluation of the dynamic response of a full-scale system; second, the single-level approach is extended to a three-level solution scheme, involving a material, a component and a system level, to reduce the computational burden introduced by the non-deterministic approach and to include non-linear <b>quasi-static</b> <b>effects.</b> The proposed three-level non-deterministic modeling methodology is a consistent step in the development of virtual prototyping and product refinement engineering tools for the modeling of the NVH behavior of rubber joints in real-life applications; and can be considered, in between the fully non-linear and the fully linear modeling approaches, as a tool to evaluate in a computationally convenient way the sensitivity of the dynamic behavior of a full-scale system model to the rubber joint properties most relevant for NVH applications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Multiple-gate MOSFETs with {{superior}} short channel control {{are expected to}} replace planar CMOS in the near future. An accurate and computationally efficient compact transistor model is necessary to simulate circuits in multiple-gate MOSFET technologies. In this dissertation research, a compact multiple-gate MOSFET model, BSIM-MG is developed. BSIM-MG includes independent multi-gate compact model BSIM-IMG and common multi-gate compact model BSIM-CMG. We focus on BSIM-IMG for multiple-gate MOSFETs with independent front- and back-gates. The basic formulations for surface potential, drain current and charge are derived and verified against TCAD simulations with excellent agreements. The model preserves important property of multi-gate MOSFETs such as volume inversion. Non-ideal effects including short channel effects, length dependent back-gate coupling, transport models, leakage currents, parasitic resistances and capacitances, temperature effects and self heating are considered in the model. The model expressions are carefully formulated so that the symmetry of the source and drain is preserved. Rules for maintaining symmetry are discussed in this dissertation. For the common multi-gate transistor model BSIM-CMG, the basic expressions have been improved {{so that it is}} compatible with a novel non <b>quasi-static</b> <b>effects</b> modeling technique — charge segmentation. In addition, a parasitic source/drain resistance model is developed, including three components: the contact resistance, the spreading resistance, and the bias-dependent extension resistance. Both BSIM-CMG and BSIM-IMG models are verified against TCAD and measured data. The use of the FinFET compact model to model manufacturing variation in a FinFET technology is further explored. The model matches measured data well for both the nominal case and the statistical distribution for NMOS threshold voltage as well as the read static noise margin. A non-Gaussian threshold voltage distribution is observed for nFET devices, and the compact model successfully captures the distribution. We further outlined and demonstrated a Monte-Carlo based procedure for designing FinFET SRAM cells using the extracted variation information. Technology scaling has enabled numerous CMOS analog circuits for low cost radio-frequency applications. The modeling of MOSFET thermal noise becomes very important. In the final part of this dissertation research, a new thermal noise model is developed for the industry standard BSIM 4 model that enhances the existing thermal noise formulation in BSIM 4. The model is verified against a segmented channel MOSFET model as well as measured data. It is implemented in Berkeley SPICE 3 and is ready for industry use. A method to port the model to BSIM-MG for thermal noise modeling in multi-gate MOSFETs is also presented...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{three-dimensional}} fundamental equations of {{elasticity of}} quasicrystals with extension to <b>quasi-static</b> electric <b>effect</b> are expresses in both differential and variational invariant forms for a regular region of quasicrystal material. The principle of {{conservation of energy}} is stated for the regular region and the constitutive relations are obtained for the piezoelasticity of material. A theorem is proved for the uniqueness in solutions of the fundamental equations {{by means of the}} energy argument. The sufficient boundary and initial conditions are enumerated for the uniqueness. Hamilton’s principle is stated for the regular region and a three-field variational principle is obtained under some constraint conditions. The constraint conditions, which are generally undesirable in computation, are removed by applying an involutory transformation. Then, a unified variational principle is obtained for the regular region, with one or more fixed internal surface of discontinuity. The variational principle operating on all the field variables generates all the fundamental equations of piezoelasticity of quasicrystals under the symmetry conditions of the phonon stress tensor and the initial conditions. The resulting equations, which are expressible in any system of coordinates and may be used through simultaneous approximation upon all the field variables in a direct method of solutions, pave the way to the study of important dislocation, fracture and interface problems of both elasticity and piezoelasticity of quasicrystal materials...|$|R

An implicit time integration is used to solve the dynamic problem at the macro-scale while the meso-scale model is solved as a <b>quasi-static</b> problem.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} model of suspension components in a railway vehicle {{may have an}} important effect {{on the results of}} vehicle dynamics simulations and their accuracy in reproducing the actual vehicle behaviour. This paper aims to define and compare alternative {{mathematical model}}ling approaches for the secondary airspring suspension and to assess their effect on the accuracy of rail vehicle dynamics multibody simulation. To derive reliable models of the suspension, a quasi-static and dynamic characterisation of the suspension was performed by means of a full-scale laboratory experiment. Based on this, two different modelling approaches were developed for the airspring suspension: a quasi-static one, in which the frequency-dependent behaviour of the suspension is neglected, but the coupling between shear and roll stiffness is included, and a dynamic one in which additionally the frequencydependent behaviour of the suspension in vertical direction is represented using a thermodynamic model, and additionally the dependency of lateral/roll stiffness parameters on the load is incorporated. The results of vehicle dynamics simulations in curved track and/or in the presence of crosswinds and the results of ride comfort calculations are presented, to assess the effect of the models developed, in comparison with a simpler model only reproducing the vertical and lateral stiffness of the suspension. It is demonstrated that the <b>quasi-static</b> coupling <b>effect</b> between shear and roll deformation in the airsprings can have a large effect on the simulation of load transfer effects in curved track and in the presence of crosswinds, and hence remarkably affect the assessment of ride safety and track loading, whereas the dynamic model of the airspring suspension appears to be required when wheel unloading under the action of crosswind is evaluated. Finally, it is shown that a dynamic model of the airspring is required to assess ride comfort correctly, especially when the pneumatic layout of the suspension includes a long pipe between the airspring and the reservoir...|$|R

These data are analyzed by an explicit finite element code using the new microplane constitutive model M 7 for concrete, which was previously shown to provide the most realistic description of the quasi-static uni-, bi- and tri-axial test data with complex loading path and unloading. Model M 7 incorporates the <b>quasi-static</b> strain rate <b>effects</b> due viscoelasticity and to the rate of cohesive crack debonding based on activation energy of bond ruptures, which are expected to extend to very high rates.

40|$|Abstract. Dynamic {{testing of}} statically pre-deformed {{specimens}} of Ti 6 Al 4 V {{shows that the}} total strain to failure increases {{with the level of}} pre-strain. Furthermore, interrupted and various other dynamic tests on Ti 6 AL 4 V show that the temperature rise prior to localization has only a minor influence on adiabatic shear band (ASB) formation. For all the tests, the calculated dynamic deformation energy until ASB formation is found to be relatively constant. This indicates that adiabatic shear banding is dependent almost solely on dynamic deformation processes, with <b>quasi-static</b> and thermal <b>effects</b> prior to localization being very marginal. We suggest the concept of a constant dynamic mechanical energy (toughness) as a quantitative criterion for ASB formation. Physically, this concept is related to the dynamic stored energy of cold work. Adiabatic shear failure is a well know failure mechanism that is uniquely experienced in dynamic loading situations [1, 2]. The homogeneous deformation tends to localize into a narrow band followed by catastrophic failure. Because of the typical short time scales involved, the phenomenon is considered to be adiabatic with large temperature increases, especially inside the band. Many materials fail by adiabatic shear banding, in an uncontrolled manner. A vast body of literature has been dedicated to the material aspects of adiabatic shear failure [1, 2]. A basic criterion has been proposed by Zener and Hollomon [3], stating that ASB is governed by the competition between strain hardening and therma...|$|R
40|$|Neglecting the {{structural}} dynamic {{effects on the}} flight dynamics of modern aircraft may be inadequate. Dynamic coupling between the rigid-body and the elastic degrees of freedom can occur when the design favors strength over stiffness and the frequency separation between the classical flight dynamic modes and the aeroelastic modes becomes small enough. Degraded flying and ride qualities and increased susceptibility to fatigue damage and pilot-induced oscillations are among the possible consequences of the dynamic coupling. The design of control systems is also highly affected. The initial models for the flight dynamics of flexible aircraft considered only <b>quasi-static</b> aeroelastic <b>effects</b> on the aerodynamic coefficients of the rigid aircraft. The dynamically-coupled formulations, on the other hand, have often neglected the inertial coupling between the rigid-body and the elastic degrees of freedom. Indeed, most authors have used linearized mean-axis constraints in deriving simplified equations of motion that remain only aerodynamically coupled. To analyze {{the accuracy of the}} inertially-decoupled formulation in the context of small deformations, a formulation that takes into account all the coupled dynamics and allows an arbitrary choice of the body-axis system is developed in this thesis. The availability of a finite-element model of the aircraft structure, together with lumped mass properties, is required. In the equations of motion, the inertial coupling terms are linearized with respect to the elastic displacements around an equilibrium condition determined with the full nonlinear dynamics. Appropriate modes of vibration are then used as shape functions in the calculation of the dynamic deformation of the structure. The generalized aerodynamic forces are treated as the superposition of the rigid-body contributions and the incremental ones due to elastic deformation. The latter are modeled by the doublet-lattice method, aerodynamically corrected to take into account major transonic and viscous effects. Rational-function approximations are part of the process that allows the representation of the frequency-domain aerodynamics in the time domain, leading to an augmented state-space system that considers the aerodynamic lag phenomenon. The formulation is implemented and tested in the flight simulation of a generic narrow-body airliner (GNBA) model, developed for the purpose of these studies. Results are presented that show that the different body axes lead practically to the same overall motion of the aircraft with respect to an inertial reference frame. The benefits and the limitations in using each different axis system and in considering or not the dynamic and the inertial couplings are analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Demonstration {{of large}} {{components}} integrity under seismic loading is based {{up to now}} on monotonic tearing resistance curves. However, {{it is well known}} that cycles decrease the fracture resistance of the material, mainly according to the loading ratio. Most studies use monotonic methods to analyze reversible cyclic loading and the associated increase of crack propagation: Delta J-R curves are largely used. For monotonic loadings, Turner [1] proposed a decomposition of the rate of dissipated fracture energy. This decomposition led on the determination of an energetic criterion for ductile fracture [2]. This intrinsic criterion allows the fracture prediction on large components. This paper aims to propose an analysis of cyclic ductile fracture which should allow the determination of an energetic criterion under large amplitude cycles. For that purpose, compact tension specimens are taken from a carbon steel pipe (Tu 42 C) used in the secondary circuit of French PWR. A series of cyclic tearing tests are carried out under <b>quasi-static</b> loadings. The <b>effects</b> of loading ratio and incremental plastic displacement are quickly studied. Here, we present an energetic analysis which take into account the crack closure and crack opening. Indeed, displacement fields around the crack tips are measured with digital image correlation and linked with electric potential measurement. That allows an accurate determination of crack closure and crack opening and let a precise calculation of fracture energy possible. The energetic fracture criterion will be confirmed with crack propagation prediction on different geometry like CT specimen and a through-wall-cracked pipe under cyclic reversed loadings...|$|R

Resolving the composition and foreground noise to reduce their large systematic errors. dynamics of either kind of `dark energy', will require complementing the homogeneous expansion observations with observations {{of the growth of}} cosmological fluctuations. Because the 'dark energy' evolution is at least <b>quasi-static,</b> any dynamical <b>effects</b> on the fluctuation growth function g(z) will be minimal. They will be best studied in the weak lensing convergence of light from galaxies at 0 <z< 5, from neutral hydrogen at 6 <z< 20, and ultimately from the CMB last scattering surface at z= 1089. Galaxy clustering also measures g(z), but requires large corrections for baryonic composition and foreground noise. Projected observations potentially distinguish static from dynamic `dark energy', but distinguishing dynamic Dark Energy from Dark Gravity will require a weak lensing shear survey more ambitious than any now projected. Low-curvature modifications of Einstein gravity are also, in principle, observable in the solar system or in isolated galaxy clusters. The cosmological constant can only be fine-tuned, at present.

Particular attention is given to characterizing the shape of the resulting air cavity in the limit where cavity collapse is strongly influenced by surface tension. A parameter study reveals the dependence of the cavity structure on the governing dimensionless groups. A theoretical description is developed to describe the evolution of the cavity shape and yields an analytical solution for the pinch-off time and depth. We also examine low-density spheres that decelerate substantially following impact, and characterize the deceleration rate and resulting change in behavior of the associated water-entry cavities. Theoretical predictions compare favorably with our experimental observations. Finally, we present a theoretical model for the evolution of the splash curtain formed at high speeds, and couple it to the underlying cavity dynamics. In Part II, we {{present the results}} of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the motion of a sphere on an inclined flexible beam. A theoretical model based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory is developed to describe the dynamics, and in the limit where the beam reacts instantaneously to the loading, we obtain exact solutions for the sphere trajectory and descent time.

The first part deals with the delineation of a precision loading facility allowing ultra-precise load or displacement control commensurate with the high resolution measurements of crack tip material response. A method of determining the advance of crack tip through combined microscope and computer-analyzed observation is presented. In particular, the experimental set up and software development is described by which these measurements are achieved. It is shown that automated crack tip location is possible with a precision of one to two microns, which is amply sufficient for present purposes to make definitive statements about the smoothness or discontinuity of crack propagation. The craze and crack opening displacements are measured near the free surface of the specimen both under quasi-static step loading and cyclic loading. Eleven craze opening profiles for equal load increments are acquired during a single cycle under fatigue loading. A multi-linear craze stress model is used to match the opening displacements to the measurements. While the primordial thickness can be defined from the Lorentz-Lorenz equation and from the assumption of a constant index of refraction for the <b>quasi-static</b> loading, the <b>effect</b> of load history may prevent such determinations for cyclic loading. The damage accumulated through cyclic deformation reduces the strength of the fibrils {{in the middle of the}} craze and produces a drop in the middle of the stress distribution.
