50|$|Overfishing {{continues}} {{despite repeated}} warnings {{of the current}} precipitous decline. In 2007, researchers from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)—the regulators of Atlantic bluefin fishing—recommended a global <b>quota</b> of 15,000 <b>tonnes</b> to maintain current stocks or 10,000 tonnes to allow the fisheries recovery. ICCAT then chose a <b>quota</b> of 36,000 <b>tonnes,</b> but surveys indicated that up to 60,000 tonnes were actually being taken (a third of the total remaining stocks) and the limit was reduced to 22,500 tonnes. Their scientists now say that 7500 tonnes are the sustainable limit. In November 2009, ICCAT set the 2010 <b>quota</b> at 13,500 <b>tonnes</b> and said that if stocks were not rebuilt by 2022, it would consider closing some areas.|$|R
50|$|In October 2013, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna {{increased}} the wild catch quota to Australian tuna ranchers. The increases, staged over two years, {{were to take}} the <b>quota</b> to 5665 <b>tonnes</b> in 2015. The tuna <b>quota</b> rose 449 <b>tonnes</b> to 5147 tonnes in 2014 and then by another 518 tonnes in 2015. The quota increases were expected to allow the ranchers to increase their output by approximately 2000 tonnes per year from 2015 onwards.|$|R

The suppliers are Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The Hilton Quota beef enjoys a duty preference vis-à-vis the European Union Most Favoured Nation import regime. Also called [...] "ribs and loins".|$|R
50|$|The {{industry}} commenced in South Australia in 1991 with {{an annual}} catch <b>quota</b> of 1,000 <b>tonnes.</b> In 2003, the fishery's annual quota was set at 36,000 tonnes. By 2014, the annual quota had increased to 38,000 tonnes. The fishery's total landed catch peaked at 56,952 tonnes in the financial year 2004-05 stabilising at around 32,000 tonnes per annum thereafter.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} dairy farmers has reduced to about 3,800 {{with an average}} herd size of 150 cows. The milk <b>quota</b> is 1,142 <b>tonnes.</b> Danish dairy farmers are among {{the largest and most}} modern {{producers}} in Europe. More than half of the cows live in new loose-housing systems. Export of dairy products accounts for more than 20 per cent of the total Danish agricultural export. The total number of cattle in 2011 was approximately 1.5 million. Of these, 565,000 were dairy cows and 99,000 were suckler cows. The yearly number of slaughtering of beef cattle is around 550,000.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Seafish Tasmania {{brought the}} ship (then named the Abel Tasman) to Australia. She was {{originally}} authorized {{to catch a}} <b>quota</b> of 18,000 <b>tonnes</b> of jack mackerel and redbait along the southern shores of the country. After protests against her use by environmental and fishing industry groups, the Australian government passed legislation prohibiting the trawler from fishing in Australian waters for two years. For this reason, Seafish Tasmania subsequently sold its stake in the vessel to Dutch company Parlevliet & Van der Plas. On March 6, 2013, after six months moored in Australian waters, she left Port Lincoln, having reassumed her original name of Margiris.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Worldwide Fund, {{the only}} Hake species not {{currently}} over-fished is Cape hake, found in Namibia. [...] Namibia {{is the only}} country that has increased its hake <b>quota,</b> from 130,000 <b>tonnes</b> in 2009 to 145,000 tonnes in 2010. Furthermore, the Local Ministry of Fisheries adheres to very strict rules regarding the catch of hake. For example, the closed seasons for hake lasts approximately two months, September and October, depending on the level of stock. This rule has been applied to ensure the regrowth of the hake population. Supplemental restrictions include forbidding trawling for Hake in less than 200 m depth (to avoid damaging non-target species habitat)and minimizing by-catch.|$|R

50|$|In October 2009 the {{government}} reduced the commercial <b>quota</b> to 300 <b>tonnes,</b> and delayed {{the start of}} the 2010 season until December. Previously, recreational fishers had been requested to voluntarily limit their catches to 600 per day; however, a new recreational bag limit of 300 per person was now enforceable by law. During the weekend of 9-10 January, fisheries officials patrolled the Victor Harbor and Goolwa Beaches, inspecting over 1000 recreational catches. Four fishers were fined for exceeding the bag limit and 10 for taking undersize individuals; 15,000 undersized P. deltoides were returned to the water. The Fisheries Department is currently investigating increasing the minimum size from 35 mm for the 2011 season.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to {{the economic and social}} crisis in Argentina, EU Agriculture Commissioner Fischler announced the opening of an additional 10, 000 <b>tonne</b> <b>quota</b> for quality beef (Hilton Beef) imports. Argentina now enjoys an annual quota of 38, 000 tonnes on which a duty of only 20 % is applied. Comment: The gradual expansion of duty free access for third countries with whom the EU is seeking to conclude free trade area agreements will progressively erode ACP margins of preference for agricultural exports. This highlights the need for ACP countries to work out how they can improve the marketing and hence financial returns on their beef exports to the EU.

5000|$|In November 2008, ICCAT {{ignored the}} advice of their {{scientists}} that quotas should not exceed 15,000 tonnes per year - which had been determined as the maximum sustainable yield - and instead set <b>quotas</b> at 22,000 <b>tonnes.</b> An independent review of ICCAT, commissioned by the organisation themselves, concluded that their policies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery are a [...] "travesty of fisheries management", and an [...] "international disgrace". Dr Sergi Tudela, head of WWF Mediterranean's fisheries programme, said [...] "Today's outcome {{is a recipe for}} economic as well as biological bankruptcy with the European Union squarely to blame. ICCAT's string of successive failures leaves us little option now but to seek effective remedies through trade measures and extending the boycott of retailers, restaurants, chefs and consumers".|$|R
50|$|The Treaty {{guaranteed}} to Māori their lands, forests and fisheries. Over time, however, New Zealand law began to regulate commercial fisheries, so that Māori control was substantially eroded. To resolve this grievance, in 1989 an interim agreement was reached. The Crown transferred 10 percent of New Zealand's fishing <b>quota</b> (some 60,000 <b>tonnes),</b> together with shareholdings in fishing companies and $50 million in cash, to the Waitangi Fisheries Commission. This commission {{was responsible for}} holding the fisheries assets on behalf of Māori until an agreement was reached {{as to how the}} assets were to be shared among tribes. In 1992, a second part of the deal, referred to as the Sealord deal, marked full and final settlement of Māori commercial fishing claims under the Treaty of Waitangi. This included 50% of Sealord Fisheries and 20% of all new species brought under the quota system, more shares in fishing companies, and $18 million in cash. In total it was worth around $170 million.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2009, ICCAT's {{scientific}} advisors {{announced that}} a total ban on international trade in Atlantic tuna was justified, based on {{the decline in the}} tuna fishery population to less than 15% of its original size. However, later in the same month, ICCAT recommended catch <b>quotas</b> of 13,500 <b>tonnes</b> per year. This was met by sharp criticisms from environmental organisations, and prompted calls for alternative methods to regulate Atlantic tuna fisheries, such as protection under CITES. Susan Lieberman, Director of International Policy for the Pew Environment Group said Since its inception, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas has been driven by short-term commercial fishing interests, not the conservation ethic implied by its name....ICCAT's actions and inactions highlight the need to take these issues to CITES—the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The ICCAT fisheries managers have shown scant interest in the long-term preservation of the key resources they are supposed to manage. It is now time to turn to other bodies to seek the needed protections that ICCAT has failed to provide.The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a statement with strongly worded criticism, saying that the new agreement was [...] "a marked improvement over the current rules, but it is insufficient to guarantee the long-term viability of either the fish or the fishery".|$|R
40|$|Amendment of {{annotation}} ° 604 {{regarding the}} South African population {{to allow the}} initial sale of the Kruger National Park stockpile of ivory, 18 months after {{the adoption of the}} proposal and a subsequent annual <b>quota</b> of two <b>tonnes.</b> This proposal is for the exclusive purpose of allowing {{in the case of the}} population of South Africa: a) trade in hunting trophies for non-commercial purposes; b) trade in live animals for re-introduction purposes into protected areas formally proclaimed in terms of the legislation of the importing country; c) trade in hides and leather goods; d) trade in raw ivory of whole tusks of any size, and cut pieces of ivory that are both 20 cm or more in length and one kilogram or more in weight of Government-owned stocks originating from the Kruger National Park. An initial stockpile of 30, 000 kg is proposed and a subsequent annual quota of 2, 000 kg accumulated each year through annual mortalities and management practices.

5000|$|During the 2008 season, due to surging {{demand and}} {{decreasing}} catches, a <b>quota</b> of 36,800 <b>tonnes</b> {{was introduced to}} manage the resource and commercial fishing was restricted to the Younghusband Peninsula, from a point 2 km east of {{the centre of the}} Murray Mouth to Kingston with recreational fishers banned from catching in these areas. The quota became controversial when it was found that 11 of the licences, primarily multi generational local family fishing companies, were allocated only 1% of the quota each, which would fail to cover their overheads; conversely, 10 licences supplying European markets were allocated up to 15% of the quota each. Two groups were formed to lobby Parliament to protect their interests: the Goolwa Cockle Working Group, to represent the 10 large quota holders, and the Southern Fisherman’s Association representing the small quotas. A politician supporting the small quota holders, Mitch Williams, claimed the government was deliberately trying to cut {{the number of people in}} the industry to possibly just five or six. The South Australian Legislative Council overturned the quotas on 23 June 2008, citing that [...] "they tip the balance in favour of some fishers to the detriment of others". The Fisheries Minister, Rory McEwen threatened to re-promulgate the quotas and the Legislative Council has still to decide whether to disallow the regulation a second time if it is re-introduced. Due to the controversy, it remains unknown whether fishermen would harvest as much and as quickly as possible until the total quota limit is reached, or abide by their existing share allocation for the 2009 season.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of a white clover based dairy system in comparison with a grass/fertiliser-N system was studied during three years. Mixed swards of perennial ryegrass and white clover were established successfully through reseeding or sodseeding. Both systems had 59 dairy cows and a milk <b>quota</b> of 450 <b>tonnes</b> per year. The allocated areas of 41 ha for the grass/clover system and 34 ha for the grass/fertiliser-N system were based on an expected yield difference of 15 to 20 % in favour of the grass/fertiliser-N swards. The grassland management consisted of a rotational grazing system with one to three silage cuts per paddock, depending on herbage growth. The average white clover ground cover was 31, 30 and 26 % in the three subsequent years, but with a large variation between seasons and paddocks. Season, clover variety and sward age × clover variety explained 28 % {{of the variance in}} clover cover, but 72 % remained unexplained. Grass/clover and grass/fertiliser-N swards received 69 and 275 kg N ha− 1 year− 1, respectively, including the inorganic N from applied cattle slurry, but excluding animal excreta during grazing. The average annual net DM yield from grass/fertiliser-N swards was 10. 8 t ha− 1 and from grass/clover swards 10. 1 t ha− 1. The yield difference occurred mainly in spring, but was smaller than expected, causing a relative silage surplus for the grass/clover system. The OMD of grass/clover was slightly, but consistently, higher than that of grass-only, while the CP concentration of grass/clover was consistently higher from July onwards. It is concluded that mixed swards of perennial ryegrass and white clover can function as a sound basis to produce good quality herbage for a dairy system...|$|R
40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{currently}} the main market outlet for imported bananas, with an estimated annual turnover of ECU 2 billion ($ 1. 8 billion) in 1996 (excluding trade between EU members). By 1999, European demand for bananas (excluding EU production) is projected to reach about 3. 3 million tonnes annually. Who are the leading suppliers of bananas to the European Union? In addition to EU producers, suppliers include ACP signatories to the Lomé Convention and some Central and Latin American banana-producing countries. The Common Market Organisation for Bananas, set up in 1993 and extended by the Framework Agreement endorsed in Marrakech (1994), led to allocation of import quotas based on three different banana origins, with a provision for compensation {{to make up for}} any loss of income subsequent to market consolidation. A tariff quota of 2. 2 million tonnes was established for dollar bananas from third country origins, at a tariff of ECU 75 a tonne. In September 1996, USA, supported by Guatemala, Ecuador, Honduras and Mexico, contested the terms of the Marrakech trading agreement and lodged a complaint for violation of trade laws. What is actually at issue? Is the percentages of the third-country tariff quota allocated to four Latin American signatories to the Framework Agreement. It is the quotas designated for non-traditional ACP bananas (80, 000 t) that are being contested. The percentages of the tariff quota allocated to Venezuela and Nicaragua are being disputed, i. e. WTO contends that these two countries do not have a sufficient vested interest in the banana industry. Rejection of the terms of the Marrakech agreements, along with the modified status and increased demands of American multinational corporations (Chiquita, Dole, Del Monte), could create a new order with respect to the import subsector. Many small-scale banana importers or ripeners will be affected by the economic and political implications of the future Common Market Organisation for Bananas. Banana origins Community bananas.

ACP bananas. These are produced by African, Pacific and Caribbean countries signatory to the Lomé IV Convention along with the EU. This category includes: traditional ACP bananas. These are exported to the EU by traditional ACP supply countries (Belize, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Côte d'Ivoire, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Madagascar, St Lucia, St Vincent/Grenadines, Somalia and Suriname). The quota designated for all of these countries collectively is based on a maximum export volume of 857, 700 t of bananas. non-traditional ACP bananas.
