Another group of examples is de Jong’s illustration of ceramic finds. Modern drawings of archaeological ceramics tend to include both a “section”, or profile drawing, of the vessel and an “elevation,” a depiction of its outside face. In contrast, Piet de Jong’s illustrations do not include a section and elevation, but rather tend to depict the entire outside profile of the vessel, often from a distorted perspective, {{in order to make}} as many of the object’s defining attributes visible to the viewer as possible.|$|E

30|$|The new National Planning Policies Framework (NPPF 2012) in England, {{requires}} {{local authorities}} {{to carry out}} a detailed assessment regarding open space (OS) and to propose new quantitative and qualitative OS standards, based on the new needs of local communities. In particular, the paper examines if and how the new <b>quantitative</b> OS <b>standard</b> (Ha/ 1.000 pop.) is researched in the 32 + 1 London Boroughs Open Space Strategies (OSS) and Local Plans (Local Development Frameworks, LDF) (2002 – 2018). The experimentation with the new <b>quantitative</b> OS <b>standard</b> at local level faces a number of challenges, problems and contradictions. A non-compulsory <b>quantitative</b> <b>standard,</b> in several cases, justifies the reduction in quantity of the Public Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land. This makes urgent the need to reaffirm the importance of the quantitative component in order to ensure the POS endowment. Based on content analysis of local plans and interviews, this study identifies and discusses local concerns and proposals. Some local authorities propose a minimum reduced <b>quantitative</b> POS <b>standard,</b> equal for all, that could be integrated at the local level by a quota of POS variable in relation to the diverse qualitative requests of the local communities. On this specific topic, London Boroughs’ experience in the current phase of implementation, can offer interesting solutions and remark of general interest.|$|R

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, PPG n. 17 (ODPM 2002 a), which was {{superseded}} by the NPPF, and the Companion guide (ODPM 2002 b), {{that is still}} in use, do suggest a methodology. If PPG n. 17 is emphasised, local authorities should derive standards within the statutory development plan, and these standards {{should be based on}} the local assessments of needs instead of a national standard. It describes how “appropriate quantity standards should be determined from the analysis of existing quantity provision (Step 2), in the light of local community views (ODPM 2002 a)”. The two documents describe in a different manner the quantitative standard: PPG n. 17 describes it as accessibility, a qualitative parameter, while the Companion guide as a new provision needed. Both definitions are considering the idea that the parameter has to be identified locally by the borough. They don’t specify the <b>quantitative</b> <b>standard</b> only considering POS, and do not indicate a possible range, a minimum, each borough could refer to in order to define a <b>quantitative</b> <b>standard.</b>|$|R
