5|$|According to {{production}} staff, scenes involving the alien <b>queen</b> {{were the most}} difficult to film. A life-sized mock-up was created by Stan Winston's company in the United States to see how it would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the <b>queen</b> flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at 14 feet (4.3 m) tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the full size <b>queen</b> were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation. Additionally, a miniature alien <b>queen</b> was used for certain shots.|$|E

5|$|As a {{daughter}} of the <b>Queen,</b> Louise was a desirable bride; more so as she {{is regarded as the}} Queen's most beautiful daughter by both contemporary and modern biographers. However, she was accused by the press, without substantiation, of romantic affairs. This, coupled with her liberalism and feminism, prompted the <b>Queen</b> to find her a husband. The choice had to suit Victoria as well as Louise, and the <b>Queen</b> insisted that her daughter's husband should live near her, a promise which had also been extracted from the husband of Helena, Louise's sister. Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe: Princess Alexandra proposed her brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark, but the <b>Queen</b> was strongly opposed to another Danish marriage that could antagonise Prussia. Victoria, Louise's eldest sister, proposed the tall and rich Prince Albert of Prussia, but <b>Queen</b> Victoria disapproved of another Prussian marriage that would have been unpopular in England. Prince Albert was also reluctant to settle in England as required. William, Prince of Orange was also considered a suitor, but because of his extravagant lifestyle in Paris, where he lived openly with a mistress, the <b>Queen</b> quickly vetoed the idea.|$|E

We describe some {{of what is known}} about the N + k <b>queens</b> problem, prove a few new results, and propose some open questions. The problem Clearly, we can put no more than N mutually nonattacking <b>queens</b> on the N × N board, since a row (or column) with two <b>queens</b> has <b>queens</b> that attack each other. However, if other pieces (let’s call them pawns) block the attacks, we can place more nonattacking <b>queens.</b> If we place k pawns on the board, we can sometimes place N + k nonattacking <b>queens,</b> but never more than that. So, we have what we call the N + k <b>queens</b> problem...|$|R

50|$|In {{this study}} {{they found that}} their sample virgin <b>queens</b> were mostly miniature, while mating <b>queens</b> were mostly normal. However, {{excluding}} the colonies with abnormal gyne production, there was an equal proportion of miniature mating and virgin <b>queens.</b> In <b>queens</b> the oviposition rate {{is determined by the}} number of ovarioles. When comparing the normal sized <b>queens</b> with the miniature <b>queens,</b> Ribeiro found a constant number of four ovarioles. Also when <b>queens</b> of different sizes were under the same conditions for oviposition, they were both equally active in laying eggs. All these results show that miniature <b>queens</b> can mate and head colonies just as well and just as likely as normal sized <b>queens.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Stingless bees {{may produce}} both large <b>queens</b> and "miniature " <b>queens,</b> but the {{adaptive}} {{significance of this}} is uncertain. Using biometry and statistical analysis we determined the proportion of miniature <b>queens</b> in Plebeia remota that were either mated (14 %) or virgin (45 %). Mated <b>queens</b> were mostly normalsized which {{indicated that they were}} more successful. Nevertheless, the presence of miniature mated <b>queens</b> heading colonies confirmed that they also are viable. The egg-laying capacity of mated <b>queens</b> of different sizes was determined using colony exchange experiments. The results showed that egg laying is not influenced by size differences. Therefore, miniature mated <b>queens</b> may be as successful in laying eggs as normal-sized <b>queens.</b> Finally we discuss some ultimate hypotheses for why miniature <b>queens</b> are produced...|$|R
