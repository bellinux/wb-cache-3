An effective, cheap, and safe control method is necessary {{as an alternative to}} subtitute the use of fungicides in postharvest disease control. This research aimed to identify yeast antagonist from avocados that are effective in controlling anthracnose disease on avocado fruit. Research was started with isolation of C. gloeosporioides and yeast from avocado fruit, followed by in vivo bioassay, antibiosis assay, and chitinolitic activity assay. In vivo bioassay was done by dipping avocado fruit on yeast cell suspension. As many as 23 yeasts isolates was obtained from avocado fruits. Eight yeast isolates (A 28, A 32, A 33, A 34, A 35, A 36, A 37, A 38) showed very effective for inhibiting anthracnose disease in avocado fruit at concentration of 10 6 mL - 1 and 10 7 mL - 1.

40|$|The {{original}} publication can {{be found}} at www. springerlink. comThallium is an extremely toxic metal which, due to its similarities to K, is readily taken up by plants grown in Tl-contaminated soils. Thallium is also a precious metal nearly as economically valuable as gold. Thallium is efficiently hyperaccumulated in Iberis intermedia as aqueous Tl(I) with highest concentrations within the vascular network of leaves. In this study we examine the utility of synchrotron X-ray differential absorption-edge computed microtomography (CMT) in determining the distribution and compartmentalization of thallium (Tl) in Iberis intermedia. We found Tl to be distributed in solution throughout the vascular system of <b>I.</b> <b>intermedia.</b> Current laboratory experiments are examining the characteristics and potential recovery of Tl by <b>I.</b> <b>intermedia</b> with the objectives to remediate its toxic risks and to facilitate its reclamation for reuse. However, the recovery and reuse of Tl from <b>I.</b> <b>intermedia</b> by way of phytomining requires knowledge on the speciation, distribution and compartmentalization of thallium.

40|$|General EcologyThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} microhabitat differences between two species of sundews, Drosera rotundifolia and Drosera <b>intermedia.</b> <b>I</b> tested several hypotheses: D. rotundifolia density increases with increasing height above a fixed low point, while D. intermedia density decreases with height; D. rotundifolia grows primarily on red Sphagnum moss, while D. intermedia grows primarily on green Sphagnum; the densities of both Drosera species increase with decreasing pH; the density of neither Drosera species is affected by water conductivity or dissolved oxygen content. At Mud Lake Bog in Cheboygan County, Michigan, I recorded the species of Drosera plants, as well as the height of the plants above a fixed low point and the color of Sphagnum moss on which they were growing. I also measured the pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen content of the water in which the plants were growing. Densities of both Drosera species decreased with increasing height, though the trend was stronger for D. intermedia. D. rotundifolia grew significantly more on red Sphagnum than did D. intermedia, while D. intermedia grew significantly more on green Sphagnum than did D. rotundifolia. D. rotundifolia density varied significantly with neither pH, conductivity, nor dissolved oxygen. D. intermedia density increased significantly with decreasing pH and increasing conductivity, but not with dissolved oxygen. My results were consistent with past research, and conclusively illustrated the differences in microhabitat preferences between the two Drosera species...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an ethnomusicological {{and historical}} exploration of intermedia art as an experimental artistic practice in Japan between 1958 and 1970. My research shows how intermedia art {{itself was a}} contested musical, aesthetic, political, technological and economic assemblage that negotiated complex plays of power particular to the social and historical terrain of postwar Japan. In {{the first half of}} the dissertation I examine relations [...] both productive and ambivalent [...] between politics and experimental aesthetics in the collectives at the Sogetsu Art Center, a hub for experimental and avant-garde activities in Tokyo. I then turn to EXPO' 70, the world's fair held in Osaka in 1970. Deemed a failure in terms of artistic innovation by many, EXPO' 70 has come to be seen as a moment that divided artists working in the realms of experimental and avant-garde practice. I look behind these "failures" to examine the disruptions and disagreements that bring to the surface the limits of collective cohesion. In the last part of the dissertation, I examine forms of intermedia that depart from the dominant intermedia aesthetics that appeared at EXPO' 70. Focusing on the acoustics of <b>intermedia,</b> <b>I</b> investigate examples of these "other" forms of intermedia that engage experiences of the liminal in the everyday in contrast to normalized senses of the "depoliticized everyday. " I argue that experimental practices in intermedia productively questioned these normalized senses of perception and perceptibility through specific, local, creative responses to a volatile period in postwar Japan. Over the course of the dissertation, I consider the significance of transnational networks for intermedia. As a deeply transnational practice, <b>I</b> argue that <b>intermedia</b> engaged with aesthetic and political negotiations with the "West" and the US (both real and imagined) that by far exceed simple transactions of "borrowing" or "imitation. " Research methods for this project combine ethnographic fieldwork, interviews, musical analysis, and archival research conducted in Japan and the United States. Critical theory and analytic methods based in the fields of ethnomusicology, music theory, and music history, as well as art history, new media studies, history, anthropology, and sociology inform this study. Through the notion of the "collective" as a central analytic theme, I engage with a theoretical framework that is open to understanding the coexistence contradictions, ruptures, and the politics of ambivalence within collectives. The critical methodology of this dissertation departs from the existing majority of scholarship on avant-garde and experimental music that has overwhelmingly tended to focus on the framework of the innovations of composers or artists and their works. More broadly, by presenting a study of original and innovative experimental music and art practices in Japan in the 1960 s, I contest persisting echoes of Euro-American ethnocentrism that assumes the "belated" or "derivative" nature of avant-garde practices outside of Euro-American contexts in scholarship both within and outside of Japan...|$|R

A {{coloured}} drawing is given of this hybrid.), from finding that a seedling-tree, raised from a sweet almond fertilised by the pollen of a peach, yielded fruit quite {{like that of}} a peach, suspected that the peach-tree is a modified almond; and in this he has been followed by various authors. (10/24. 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1856 page 532. A writer, it may be presumed Dr. Lindley, remarks on the perfect series which may be formed between the almond and the peach. Another high authority, Mr. Rivers, who has had such wide experience, strongly suspects ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1863 page 27) that peaches, if left to a state of nature, would in the course of time retrograde into thick-fleshed almonds.) A first-rate peach, almost globular in shape, formed of soft and sweet pulp, surrounding a hard, much furrowed, and slightly flattened stone, certainly differs greatly from an almond, with its soft, slightly furrowed, much flattened, and elongated stone, protected by a tough, greenish layer of bitter flesh. Mr. Bentham (10/25. 'Journal of Hort. Soc.' volume 9 page 168.) has particularly called attention to the stone of the almond being so much more flattened than that of the peach. But in the several varieties of the almond, the stone differs greatly in the degree to which it is compressed, in size, shape, strength, and in the depth of the furrows, as may be seen in figure 42 (Nos. 4 to 8) of such kinds as I have been able to collect. With peach-stones also (Nos. 1 to 3) the degree of compression and elongation is seen to vary; so that the stone of the Chinese Honey-peach (No. 3) is much more elongated and compressed than that of the (No. 8) Smyrna almond. Mr. Rivers, of Sawbridgeworth, to whom I am indebted for some of the specimens above figured, and who has had such great horticultural experience, has called my attention to several varieties which connect the almond and the peach. In France there is a variety called the Peach-Almond, which Mr. Rivers formerly cultivated, and which is correctly described in a French catalogue as being oval and swollen, with the aspect of a peach, including a hard stone surrounded by a fleshy covering, which is sometimes eatable. (10/26. Whether this is the same variety as one lately mentioned ('Gardener's Chronicle' 1865 page 1154) by M. Carriere under the name of persica <b>intermedia,</b> <b>I</b> know not; this variety is said to be intermediate in nearly all its characters between the almond and peach; it produces during successive years very different kinds of fruit.) A remarkable statement by M. Luizet has recently appeared in the 'Revue Horticole' (10/27. Quoted in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1866 page 800.), namely, that a Peach-almond, grafted on a peach, bore, during 1863 and 1864 almonds alone, but in 1865 bore six peaches and no almonds. M. Carriere, in commenting on this fact, cites the case of a double-flowered almond which, after producing during several years almonds, suddenly bore for two years in succession spherical fleshy peach-like fruits, but in 1865 reverted to its former state and produced large almonds.|$|R

This study determined the MIF levels in saliva and its possible association with periodontal conditions and infection patterns of periodontopathogens. Methods: 79 non-smoking Chinese subjects (33 males and 46 females, aged 35 - 80 years) were recruited from a health screening program at the Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong. Clinical parameters including plaque, bleeding on probing (BOP), probing depth and attachment loss were recorded. MIF and IL- 1 b levels in unstimulated saliva were assessed by ELISA. The presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. g.), Prevotella <b>intermedia</b> (P. <b>i.),</b> and Treponema denticola (T. d.) at supragingival plaque, collected from the tooth surfaces with detectable plaque, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. Results: Salivary MIF was detected in each subject with a median of 123. 25 ng/ml (10. 04 - 638. 22 ng/ml), and it was significantly correlated with IL- 1 b levels, with the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0. 839, p< 0. 001. Overall, salivary MIF level was correlated to sites% with BOP (r= 0. 210, p= 0. 05). In the subjects with combined infection of P. g., P. i., and T. d., a stronger correlation was found (r= 0. 465, p= 0. 004), while in those with one, two or no infection of P. g., P. i., and T. d., no significant correlation was found (r= 0. 102, p= 0. 555). Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that sites% with BOP was related with high MIF levels (odds ratio= 17. 63, 95 % C. I. : 1. 2 - 261. 6, P= 0. 037).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} {{and levels of}} six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-two Chinese were included. Four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [PPD ≥ 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (BOP) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (PPD ≥ 4 mm). Subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to quantify six pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. g.), Treponema denticola (T. d.), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. a.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n.), Prevotella <b>intermedia</b> (P. <b>i.),</b> and Staphylococcus aureus (S. a.). Counts were log 10 -transformed. RESULTS: The most commonly detected species were S. a. and F. n., while A. a. and. P. i. had the lowest detection frequency. The detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites {{for each of the}} six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. There were no statistically significant differences for any of the species or clinical sites (P > 0. 05, Cochran's Q test). No statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of F. nucleatum. This was more abundant in periodontitis sites (P = 0. 023, Friedman's 2 -way anova). Both periodontal and peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor S. aureus cells. The log 10 -transformed loads of S. aureus were approximately 3. 5 within each of the clinical sites (P = 0. 232). This was the highest of the six species analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of health status. The prevalence and levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis.

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the relationships among interleukin (IL) - 8 and granulocyte elastase levels in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis. Methods: GCF and subgingival plaque samples were collected from 16 patients with untreated adult periodontitis and 10 healthy control subjects. IL- 8 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Granulocyte elastase was analyzed with a neutrophilic granulocyte-specific, low molecular weight and chromogenic substrate, L-pyroglutamyl-L-prolyl-L-valine-p-nitroanilide, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (MR-EA) was calculated. Five DNA probes were used to detect the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans (A. a.), B. forsythus (B. f.), P. gingivalis (P. g.), P. <b>intermedia</b> (P. <b>i.),</b> and T. denticola (T. d.). Results: Lower IL- 8 concentrations and higher granulocyte elastase activities were found in patients than in healthy controls {{as well as in}} diseased conditions co-infected with B. f., P. g., P. i., and T. d. as compared to healthy conditions without the target species (P < 0. 05). IL- 8 concentrations were positively correlated with MR-EA levels in the periodontitis conditions co-infected with B. f., P. g., P. i., and T. d. (P < 0. 05). A wide range of IL- 8 concentrations was found among 15 patients when the periodontitis condition was characterized by co-infection with B. f., P. g., P. i., and T. d. MR-EA levels in the high IL- 8 group of subjects were significantly higher than those in the low IL- 8 group of subjects (P < 0. 01). Conclusions: The present study shows that the local host-bacteria interactions in untreated periodontitis are diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory responses measured by IL- 8 -related granulocyte elastase activity in GCF. This might reflect different phases of the inflammatory response due to shifts in host-bacteria interactions and therefore be indicative of a range of periodontal disease activity levels. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Material and methods: GCF and subgingival plaque were collected from 16 subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis at baseline and 4 weeks after SRP. IL- 8 levels were determined by ELISA. Granulocyte elastase activity was analyzed with a specific substrate, pGluProVal-pNA, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (MR-EA) was calculated. 5 DNA-probes were used to detect the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans (A. a.), B. forsythus (B. f.), P. gingivalis (P. g.), P. <b>intermedia</b> (P. <b>i.),</b> and T. denticola (T. d.), with a sensitivity = 103 cells/paper point. Results: IL- 8 and MR-EA levels in GCF decreased significantly after SRP (p < 0. 001) with a corresponding reduction of total count of the species. Of the sites with probing depth (PD) ≥ 5. 0 mm and co-infection by B. f., P. g., P. i. & T. d. at baseline, the sites without persistent co-infection of these species after SRP exhibited a significant reduction of IL- 8 levels (p < 0. 02), MR-EA levels (p < 0. 02) and PD (p < 0. 01). No such change was found in the sites where such a co-infection persisted. Moreover, reduction of IL- 8 levels in those pocket sites was accompanied by a concomitant reduction of MR-EA (p < 0. 02) and PD (p < 0. 01), while no significant change in MR-EA levels and PD was noted in those pocket sites that exhibited an increase of IL- 8 levels after SRP. At baseline, the former group of sites showed significantly higher IL- 8 levels than the latter group of sites (p < 0. 02). Conclusions: IL- 8 -related granulocyte elastase activity was related to the change in infection patterns of the target periodontopathogens following scaling and root planing. Varying initial IL- 8 levels in GCF and a corresponding shifting change of granulocyte elastase activity in GCF may characterize the different short-term treatment responses. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2002. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Periodontitis {{consists}} of a mixture of diseases, most of which respond favorably to traditional mechanical therapy. It is now recognized that advanced periodontitis does not always respond to conventional management with scaling, periodontal surgery, and oral hygiene measures. However, various types of antibiotics given systemically or locally improve the success rate of periodontal therapy. In short-term studies, {{it has been shown}} that metronidazole, when systemically administered after debridement, resulted in treatment benefits including less need for surgical intervention. Methods: In this double-blind study, we evaluated periodontal treatment involving initial non-surgical treatment, systemic administration of metronidazole for 1 week, and then follow-ups for scaling and root planing every 6 months, for 5 years. The study population consisted of 64 subjects (37 smokers and 27 non-smokers), mean age 36. 3 (± 3. 0 SD) years, with severe periodontal disease. After initial scaling and root planing, patients were randomly assigned to the intervention or placebo groups: 400 mg metronidazole or a placebo administered at 8 -hour intervals for 1 week. The participants underwent an extensive clinical periodontal examination. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was analyzed for spirochetes and granulocytes. Samples were cultured for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (A. a.), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. g.), and Prevotella <b>intermedia</b> (P. <b>i.).</b> Results: The number of patients infected with A. a., P. g., P. i., and spirochetes decreased during the study. Most patients who harbored spirochetes at the end of the study had these microorganisms at the beginning. Smokers responded less favorably to periodontal therapy than non-smokers. Non-smoking patients who required only non-surgical therapy in the intervention group showed statistically significant improvement in the clinical parameters after 5 years. Patients with complete healing, defined as the absence of inflamed sites ≥ 5 mm, after 5 years were found only in the intervention group. The patients considered healthy after 5 years were the same patients found to be healthy after 6 months. Conclusions: Decisive factors in the sustained long-term improvement of patients who respond satisfactorily to treatment are probably initial scaling and root planing; a brief course of metronidazole; and regular follow-up examinations at 6 -month intervals for oral hygiene and scaling and root planing. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the association between the levels of granulocyte elastase and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) in GCF, and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis (AP). GCF and subgingival plaque were sampled by paper strips and paper points respectively, from various periodontal sites in 16 AP subjects. Granulocyte elastase activity in GCF was analyzed with a low molecular weight substrate specific for granulocyte elastase, pGluProVal-pNA, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (MR-EA, mAbs/min/site) was calculated. PGE 2 levels in GCF were determined by radio-immunoassay. 5 species-specific DNA probes were used to detect the presence of A. actinomycetemcomitans (A. a., ATCC 43718), B. forsythus (B. f., ATCC 43037), P. gingivalis (P. g., ATCC 33277), P. <b>intermedia</b> (P. <b>i.,</b> ATCC 33563), and T. denticola (T. d., ATCC 35405), with a sensitivity of 103 cells/paper point. No A. a. was detectable from all sites sampled. The predominant combination of species detected was B. f., P. g., P. i. & T. d. and it was significantly higher at periodontitis sites (68 %) than at healthy (7 %) or gingivitis sites (29 %) (p< 0. 05). Overall, MR-EA values were strongly correlated with PGE 2 levels (r= 0. 655, p< 0. 001), especially at these periodontitis sites co-infected by B. f., P. g., P. i. & T. d. (r= 0. 722, p< 0. 001). The periodontitis sites co-infected by the 4 species were observable from 15 subjects. These sites were sub-grouped into 8 subjects with a high MR-EA and 7 subjects with a low MR-EA. The PGE 2 levels in the high MR-EA group {{were significantly higher than}} in the low MR-EA group (p< 0. 05). No significant differences in clinical or bacterial data were found between the two groups. While within the high MR-EA group, similar results were found between the paired periodontitis sites in each subject with highest and lowest MR-EA values. This study shows that the local host response to bacterial challenge in untreated periodontal pockets is diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory response measured by granulocyte elastase and PGE 2 levels in GCF. A more thorough evaluation of the risk for active periodontal disease may involve the combined approaches to the test of the dynamic bacteria-host relations. © Munksgaard, 1999. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} is the detection of periodontal pathogens by Genechips. The experiments were done with the ParoCheck® Kit 20. It is the first commercial, semi-quantitative DNA-Chip {{for the detection of}} periodontitis associated bacteria. The following bacteria can be detected by the ParoCheck® Kit 20 : Actinobacillus actinomycetem comitans A. a., Actinomyces odontolyticus A. o., Bacteroides forsythus B. f. (synonym: Tannerella forsythensis, T. f.), Campylobacter concisus C. c, Campylobacter gracilis C. g., Campylobacter rectus C. r., Capnocytophaga gingivalis Cap. g., Eikenella corrodens E. c., Eubacterium nodatum E. n., Fusobacterium nucleatum F. n., Peptostreptococcus micros P. m., Porphyromonas gingivalis P. g., Prevotella <b>intermedia</b> P. <b>i.,</b> Prevotella nigrescens P. n., Streptococcus constellatus S. c., Streptococcus gordonii S. g., Streptococcus mitis S. m., Treponema denticola T. d., Veillonella parvula V. p [...] Ten samples from ten different patients with a chronic periodontitis were taken. Each patient was examined for a detailed anamnesis and a periodontal status. After taking the samples the DNA was extracted, amplified by PCR and finally hybridised on the Chips. Each sample was analysed with the older ParoChip® (ParoChip 1) and also with the more modern version of the Chip (ParoChip 2). Both Chips have a different configuration. ParoChip 1 is a glass microscope slide which can hold only one single sample. For each bacteria there are three measuring points on the Chip. In contrast, the ParoChip 2 is a plexiglass microscope slide which can hold 12 samples and has five measuring points for each bacteria. Both Chips used fluorophor marked primer for the PCR (cy 5 marked) and fluorophor marked probes for internal control systems (cy 3 marked). The Chips were scanned with the wavelength 532 nm (cy 3 marked) and 635 nm (cy 5 marked) by the Axon Scanner 4100 A and analysed by the GenePix 4. x software. The results of both Chips matched in 75 % of the tests. The discrepancy between the Chips is likely due to the different surface chemistry and therefore the different SNR- (Signal-to-Noise-Ratio) thresholds. In single cases a different probesequence (with better specificity) may also be an explanation. In comparison with other methods of bacteria detection the GeneChip had clear advantages: The detection of 20 bacteria in one test, quick results and also the robust and semi-quantitative character. Additional microbiological and clinical studies are required, particularly for specificity, sensitivity and practicality of the method, however initial testing suggest that the ParoChip® Genechips could find a place in routine diagnostics...|$|R

Materials and Methods: 51 cardiac and non cardiac subjects within {{the age group of}} 40 - 80 years,who met the eligibility criteria, were selected and categorized as the experimental and control group respectively. Total number of teeth was recorded, and oral hygiene was evaluated using Plaque Index and Oral Hygiene Index (OHI). Periodontal pocket depth and clinical attachment level were also assessed as a part of periodontal examination. Subgingival plaque samples were collected with the help of with Gracey′s curette in both the groups. In experimental group, biopsy was obtained from the atherosclerotic plaque during Coronary artery bypass grafting CABG procedure. Both, subgingival and the coronary atherosclerotic plaque samples were subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis for identification of the periodontal bacteria. Statistical Analysis: Mean, standard deviation and test of significance of quantitative variables such as periodontal parameters were compared between experimental group and control group. Kappa measures of agreement was done to analyze the relationship between the presence/absence of microorganisms in the subgingival and atherosclerotic plaque samples in the experimental group. Results: The mean Plaque Index, Gingival Index, Russel′s Periodontal Index, OHI, clinical attachment level, Pocket Depth Index was statistically significant in both the groups. Association of T. f, E. c, C. r, P. g, P. g (fi mA), T. d, P. i, P. n was significantly associated. A. a was absent in the control group, whereas only one patient in the experimental group was positive for the bacteria. Kappa analysis showed the significant association of periodontal bacteria T. f, C. r, P. g, P. g (fi mA), P. i and P. n in subgingival plaque and atherosclerotic plaque of the same patients of the experimental group. Conclusion: It is concluded that CAD subjects had higher prevalence of periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilms as compared to the non cardiac subjects.

40|$|Bacteria, in {{the form}} of biofilm, has been shown to play a {{critical}} role in the etiology and pathogenesis of periodontal and peri-implant infectious diseases. Studies have shown that distinctively different dental plaque is commonly found in healthy versus inflamed gingivae and mucosa. It should be noted, however, that in most of these studies, the healthy and diseased plaque samples were collected from different individuals. To address this important issue, in the two studies described within this thesis, I recruited subjects who were periodontally involved and/or had inflamed peri-implant tissues, and also had equivalent healthy control sites. In the first study, I analysed the subgingival microbiota of a cohort of tea labourers from Sri Lanka, who had never performed any oral hygiene practices. Within each of the 32 subjects, one ‘shallow’ (healthy) site and one ‘deep’ (diseased) site were chosen for subgingival plaque sampling. A 16 S ribosomal RNA (16 S rRNA) gene sequencing method was applied to investigate the diversity of the subgingival microbiome, and to compare the microbial composition between healthy and diseased sites. A taxonomically diverse subgingival microbiota was identified, with 318 operational taxonomic units (OTUs; 98 % identity cut-off) from 1, 887 cloned full-length 16 S rRNA gene sequences. The subgingival microbiota was dominated by the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. A significant difference in the overall composition of microbial communities between shallow and deep sites was found ((-Libshuff, p< 0. 001) while pairwise comparisons within each subject revealed no significant differences. The absence of oral hygiene resulted in a highly diverse subgingival microbiota in this cohort. In the second study, 22 subjects who had both implants and teeth surrounded by healthy and inflamed tissues, were included for subgingival/submucosal microbiological sampling. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to detect and to quantify six species, including putative periodontal pathogens, i. e., Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. g.), Treponema denticola (T. d.), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (A. a.), Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. n.), Prevotella <b>intermedia</b> (P. <b>i.),</b> and Staphylococcus aureus (S. a.). Within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of health status. The detection frequencies for each of the six target species at diseased tooth or implant sites were either equal to, or higher than, the respective detection frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. Both periodontal and peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbour S. aureus. Even though the target organisms were found in all clinical conditions, there were differences in the involvement of some of the pathogens for the diseased conditions. The prevalence and levels of P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. A. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health. In conclusion, results from my two studies indicated that the differences between the composition of subgingival microbial communities present in single sites within two different individuals, were always greater than the differences in microbial community composition present in two subgingival sites of differing health status within the same individual. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

Im Gegensatz zu den umfangreichen Untersuchungen zu den Proteasen von P. gingivalis ist jedoch über die Proteasen von P. i. nur wenig bekannt. Ziel der Studie war der Nachweis von P. i. und drei seiner Cysteinproteasen in subgingivalen Plaqueproben. Methoden: Plaqueproben von insgesamt 154 Personen (41 aggressive Parodontitis (AP), 98 chronische Parodontitis (CP) und 15 parodontal gesund) wurden zunächst auf das quantitative Vorkommen von P. i. untersucht. Weiterhin erfolgte mittels PCR-Verfahren der Nachweis der drei bekannten Proteasen Interpain A, B und C. Abschließend wurde in einzelnen Proben von Sulkusflüssigkeit der Nachweis des Proteins von Interpain A mittels Western blot versucht. Ergebnisse: In 14 (34 %) der Proben von AP und in 37 (38 %) der Proben von CP konnte P. i. nachgewiesen, dabei wurde in 5 AP- und in 24 CP-Proben eine Keimzahl von > 106 detektiert. Keine der von parodontal gesunden Personen stammenden Proben enthielt P. i. Interpain A wurde bei insgesamt 41 (80 %) der insgesamt 51 P. i. -positiven Proben gefunden, Interpain B wurde in 47 Fällen (92 %) und Interpain C 48 -mal (94 %) nachgewiesen. Bei Interpain A und B wurden keine Unterschiede zwischen AP und CP festgestellt. Interpain C hingegen wurde in allen 37 P. i. -positiven CP-Proben nachgewiesen, jedoch ließ es sich nur in 11 der 14 AP-Proben detektieren (Chi-Quadrat-Test: p= 0, 017). Mittels Western blot konnte Interpain A im gingivalen Sulkus nachgewiesen werden. Diskussion / Schlussfolgerungen: Die Proteasen von P. i. besitzen Bedeutung in der Pathogenese der Parodontitis. Weiteren Studien wird es vorbehalten sein, die Kenntnisse über deren Funktion zu vertiefen. The {{purpose of}} the study was to determine the prevalence of Prevotella intermedia including her known panel of proteases genes in subgingival plaque samples. Methods: Plaque was sampled from 41 patients with aggressive periodontitis (AP), 98 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) as well as from 15 periodontally healthy subjects. DNA was extracted and the load of P. intermedia was determined by real-time PCR. Further the presence of three interpain genes (inpA, inpB, and inpC of P. intermedia) was checked. Primers were designed and after PCR, samples were subjected to agarose gels. At last we tried to detect inpA as a native protein in gingival fluid by using Western blot methods. Results: Fourteen (34 %) and 37 (38 %) of samples were found positive for P. intermedia in specimens collected from AP and CP, respectively. In periodontally healthy subjects P. intermedia was never detectable. Most of P. intermedia positive samples have been tested positive for interpain genes. InpA was present in 80 %, inpB in 92 % and inpC in 94 % of all the samples. In comparison there is no difference between the presence of inpA and inpB in chronic and aggressive samples. Only inpC could be detected in 37 P. intermedia positive CP-samples. The presence of inpA in gingival fluid could be shown by using Western blot methods. Conclusion: Proteases genes of P. intermedia are present in most of the strains found in periodontitis samples with a tendency to higher prevalence in CP, which underlies the possible importance in pathogenesis in periodontal disease...|$|R
40|$|Phytoextraction {{of heavy}} metals is a {{relatively}} new technology that has potential applications for the remediation of many contaminated sites around the world. The technology has significant applications in the minerals industry for the treatment of low-grade ores and metalliferous mine waste. This study concerns the investigation of the potential to remove heavy metals, in particular nickel, cobalt and gold, from artificial and lateritic substrates. Four experiments comprise this study of the phytoextraction of nickel, cobalt and gold using both accumulator and non-accumulator species. Nickel and cobalt bioavailability was determined by ammonium acetate extraction for both artificial and laterite substrates. It was found that ammonium acetate extractability was predictive for nickel accumulation from a nickel-only artificial substrate. Cobalt bioavailability did not predict the accumulation response of either Alyssum bertolonii or Berkheya coddii grown of artificial substrates. The potential for phytoextraction of nickel and cobalt was investigated using the known nickel hyperaccumulators A. bertolonii and B. coddii, grown on artificially prepared substrates. The substrates were nickel-only (4 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg), cobalt-only (4 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg) and nickel-cobalt mixed (1 : 1 ratio, 4 mg/kg to 500 mg/kg) amendments of sulphates to commercial potting mix. Hyperaccumulation from nickel-only and cobalt-only substrates resulted in typical logarithmic metal uptake by both species. The cobalt-only substrates were phytotoxic to B. coddii above a concentration of 15 - 20 mg/kg. Phytotoxicity significantly reduced biomass production in B. coddii without effecting the bioaccumulation coefficient. No corresponding cobalt phytotoxicity was observed in A. bertolonii over the experimental range, although biomass production appears to favour substrate concentrations below 30 mg/kg. The bioavailability and hyperaccumulation of cobalt from the mixed nickel-cobalt substrates dramatically reduced the nickel accumulation potential of both species at substrate concentrations below 300 mg/kg. At higher substrate metal concentrations both species return to nickel dominant hyperaccumulation. Induced gold accumulation in B. coddii and Iberis intermedia was investigated using, sequential ammonium thiocyanate and ammonium thiosulphate chelation to, a 5 mg/kg gold artificial substrate. An attempt to determine gold bioavailability by ammonium thiocyanate and ammonium thiosulphate extraction was made on the substrate. It was found that neither chelator extraction could be correlated with plant accumulation induced by the same concentration of the reagent. Ammonium thiocyanate induction resulted in plant gold accumulation at or below the substrate concentration. Ammonium thiosulphate induced gold accumulation in <b>I.</b> <b>Intermedia</b> reached 48. 8 mg/kg when treatment with a 1 % solution. B. coddii accumulated 9. 3 mg/kg gold for the same treatment. Five consignments of metalliferous lateritic materials from Western Australia were investigated. Three substrates originated from Project Murrin Murrin nickel and cobalt mine operated by Anaconda Nickel Ltd. and two substrates originated from Boddington Gold Mine operated by Worsley Alumina Ltd. Nickel and cobalt accumulation by A. bertolonii and B. coddii was found to be significantly lower than observed using artificial substrates. Nickel and cobalt bioavailability, determined by ammonium acetate extraction, failed to predict the accumulation responses from laterite substrates. This is attributed to elemental interference by, and possibly ammonium acetate chelation of, other mobile heavy metals in these substrates. A hypothesis deserved of further research. Hyperaccumulation of nickel was observed for both species on the Anaconda Nickel Ltd. SAP substrate only. Appreciable cobalt accumulation (≈ 90 mg/kg) was observed on the SAP substrate for both species and on the Boddington Gold Mine B 5 substrate for B. coddii. Phytomining scenarios were determined for both species grown on the SAP substrate. A. bertolonii could produce 13 kg of nickel and 0. 8 kg of cobalt per hectare with a value of US$ 163. B. coddii could produce 23. 8 kg of nickel and 2. 1 kg of cobalt per hectare at a value of US$ 319. These levels of production could be improved by fertilisation and/or substrate acidification. A preliminary investigation into induced gold accumulation from laterite substrates by <b>I.</b> <b>Intermedia,</b> A. longiflora, Brassica juncea and Limum usitatissimum was made using the acid biased chelator ammonium thiocyanate. It was found that an acidified amendment of ammonium thiocyanate greatly improved the phytoaccumulation of gold from the lateritic substrates. An amendment of 2 M HC 1 produced appreciable gold mobility and phytoaccumulation and indicates that gold solubility is the primary control on plant uptake. Analysis of various plant tissues indicated that Acacia longiflora stored significant gold in its roots compared to foliar components. All plant-substrate combinations indicated a trend towards increasing acidification and gold phytoaccumulation. No plant-substrate-treatment combination produced an economically viable phytomining scenario...|$|R
40|$|This work compiles {{the results}} of the {{analysis}} of hydrographical data collected in January 2008 over the western sector of the South Scotia Ridge (SSR). The cruise was carried out on board R/V Hespérides in the framework of the Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interaction (SASSI) study, one of the core projects endorsed by the International Polar Year. SASSI focused on shelf-slope processes taking place all along the Antarctic continental slope, paying particular attention to the Antarctic Slope Front (ASF) and its associated westward Antarctic Slope Current (ASC). The Spanish contribution to SASSI (framed by the E-SASSI project) focused on the SSR region between the South Shetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands, bounded to the north by the Scotia Sea and to the south by the Weddell Sea. The main objectives of E-SASSI were (1) to quantify the outflow of Weddell Sea waters into the Scotia Sea and to determine how these waters contribute to the modification of the Southern Boundary (SB) of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC); (2) to determine the role of the Antarctic Slope Front in these processes; and (3) to track the path of the Antarctic Slope Current before diluting into the Scotia Sea. This thesis aims to answer these questions. The sector of the SSR located between the South Shetland Islands and the South Orkney Islands is a region of especial interest. First because the gaps indenting the ridge constitute the first gate for the outflow of relatively shallow, recently ventilated waters from the northwestern Weddell Sea into the Scotia Sea. Second, because of the complexity of the bathymetry: a deep trough (the Hesperides Trough) separates the northern and southern flanks of the ridge and the location and depth of the different gaps indenting the ridge constrain the pathway of the Antarctic Slope Current. A key feature of the E-SASSI cruise with respect to previous studies conducted in the region is the unprecedented high spatial resolution of the hydrographic survey, particularly over the continental slopes. Also the coverage of all the gaps of the northern flank of the ridge was a novelty of E-SASSI. Both features have allowed a better quantification of the water mass transports in the region. The E-SASSI physical data consist mainly of Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD) and ship-mounted Acoustic Doppler Currentmeter Profiler (ADCP) measurements. The presence of narrow jets, the rough topography, the strong tidal currents observed in theregion, and the fact that velocity measurements were available only for the upper 500 meters of the water column, they all handicapped the determination of the barotropic component of the flow. Inverse modeling based on the conservation of volume, heat, and salt over an enclosed region was used to refine the barotropic component of the velocity pattern initially estimated from the adjustment of the baroclinic component of velocity profiles to the ADCP measurements. The regional circulation, including the pathway of the Antarctic Slope Current, was inferred from the joint analysis of CTD profiles and the velocity field inferred from the inverse model. Results from a cross-slope section located in the Weddell Sea side show the well-defined structure of the Antarctic Slope Front before reaching the SSR. At the firsts gaps indenting the southern flank of the SSR the ASC has been observed to break into two branches: an inshore branch following the upper levels of the slope (700 m) and an offshore branch extending over the 1600 m isobath. At the northern flank the sampling covered all the gaps of the ridge and several cross-slope sections into the Scotia Sea. The inshore branch of the ASC was detected crossing a relatively shallow gap that prevents the outflow of the offshore, deeper branch and acts as a barrier for Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). In spite of the higher velocities of the outflow, this shallow gap is less important in terms of Warm Deep Water (WDW) transport than the deeper Hesperides Passage hosting the outflow of the deeper branch of the ASC. This passage accounts for most of the outflow of Weddell Sea waters into the Scotia Sea and is the only gate of WSDW through the western sector of the SSR. The transports inferred from the inverse model give a net outflow of 7 ± 5 Sv, 2 Sv corresponding to WSDW and most of the other 5 Sv being WDW. In addition to the determination of the circulation pattern we have also analyzed inflow/outflow θS diagrams. They show an overall homogenization of the outflowing waters with respect to the more variable incoming Weddell Sea waters. In the last part of this thesis we show that isopycnal mixing between inshore and offshore water masses taking place within the Hesperides Trough is the main process for the modification of subsurface and intermediate layers. We also describe the role of the ASF {{in the formation of the}} most modified WDW observed before reaching the SSR and study the contribution of this water to the modification of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, in the southwestern sector of the Scotia Sea. Aquest treball reuneix els resultats de l’anàlisi de dades hidrogràfiques preses el gener de 2008 durant una campanya oceanogràfica a la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud (Antàrtida). La campanya es va dur a terme a bord del R/V Hespérides en el marc del projecte SASSI (Synoptic Antarctic Shelf-Slope Interaction study), un dels projectes clau de l’Any Polar International. Aquest projecte va tenir com a objectiu l’estudi de processos entre la plataforma i el talús continental antàrtics, amb una especial atenció al Front de Talús Antártic i al seu corrent associat que flueix en sentit oest, el Corrent de Talús Antàrtic. La contribució espanyola a SASSI (el projecte E-SASSI) es va centrar en el sector oest de la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud, entre les illes Shetland del Sud i Orcades del Sud, flanquejat al nord pel Mar d’Escòcia i al sud pel Mar de Weddell. Els objectius principals d’E-SASSI eren: (1) quantificar l’exportació d’aigües del Mar de Weddell cap al Mar d’Escòcia i determinar com aquestes aigües contribueixen a la modificació de la Frontera Sud del Corrent Circumpolar Antàrtic; (2) determinar el paper que juga el Front de Talús en tots aquests processos; i (3) traçar el camí que recorr el Corrent de Talús abans de diluir-se en el Mar d’Escòcia. Aquesta tesi tracta de respondre totes aquestes qüestions. El sector oest de la dorsal és d’especial interés. Primer perquè els passos que s’obren al llarg de la dorsal constitueixen la primera porta de sortida cap al Mar d’Escòcia d’aigües relativament poc fondes i recentment ventilades que flueixen al llarg del marge nordoest del Mar de Weddell. Segon, degut a la complexitat de la batimetria: la localització i fondària d’aquests passos, a més de l’existència d’una fossa submarina que separa aquesta banda de la dorsal en un flanc nord i un flanc sud (la Fossa d’Hespèrides), són tots factors que afecten al pas del Corrent de Talús per sobre de la dorsal. Els punts claus de la campanya E-SASSI respecte d’estudis precedents duïts a terme en aquesta regió són, d’una banda, l’elevada resolució espacial del mostreig hidrogràfic, sobretot al talús continental, i d’altra, la cobertura del mostreig, que abastà tots els passos del flanc nord de la dorsal. Ambdós aspectes han estat una aportació fonamental per part d’E-SASSI, per quan han permès una millor quantificació dels transports d’aigües en aquesta regió. El conjunt de dades físiques d’E-SASSI són majoritàriament dades de conductivitat, temperatura i pressió (Conductivity-Temperature-Depth, CTD) i de velocitat (Acoustic Doppler Currentmeter Profiler, ADCP). La presència de corrents prims, lo abrupt de la batimetria, els forts corrents de marea observats a la regió, i el fet de disposar de mesures directes de la velocitat només en els primers 500 metres de la columna d’aigua, tot plegat fa que la determinació del component baròtrop del fluxe sigui complicada. La modelització inversa és una tècnica que es basa en la conservació de volum, calor i sal a una regió de perímetre tancat. Aquest tècnica s’ha emprat per refinar el component baròtrop del patró inicial de velocitat obtingut a partir de l’ajust del component baroclí a dades d’ADCP. La circulació regional, i en particular el traçat del Corrent de Talús, s’ha obtingut a partir de l’anàlisi conjunt de les dades de CTD i del camp de velocitats donat pel model. Quan als resultats, una secció hidrogràfica d’E-SASSI mostra el Front de Talús perfectament estructurat just abans d’arribar al flanc sud de la dorsal. És al primer pas d’aquest flanc on el Corrent de Talús se separa en dues branques: una interior que flueix a la part alta del talús (700 m) i una de més externa que segueix la isobata de 1600 m. Al flanc nord el mostreig va cobrir tots els passos i diverses seccions que travessen el talús cap a dintre del Mar d’Escòcia. La branca interna del Corrent de Talús es va detectar creuant un pas relativament poc profund, que per altra banda no només evita la sortida de la branca més externa sinó també la de Weddell Sea Deep Water (WSDW). Tot i les intenses velocitats del fluxe de sortida, aquest pas no és tan important com el Pas d’Hespèrides pel que fa a exportació de Warm Deep Water (WDW). Aquest pas no només permet la sortida de la branca externa del Corrent de Talús, sinó que és l’única porta de sortida de WSDW a la banda oest de la Dorsal d’Escòcia del Sud. Els transports obtinguts pel model invers han donat un fluxe net de sortida de 7 ± 5 Sv, dels quals 2 Sv són WSDW i gran part dels 5 Sv restants corresponen a WDW. A més de la determinació de la circulació regional hem comparat les característiques d’entrada i sortida de les aigües a sobre de diagrames θS. L’anàlisi ha mostrat una homogeneïtzació de les aigües del Mar de Weddell quan travessen la dorsal. Hem mostrat que això és degut a processos de mescla isopicna a la Fossa d’Hespèrides pel que fa a la modificació de les capes subsuperficial <b>i</b> <b>intermèdia.</b> També hem descrit al darrer punt de la tesi el paper que juga el Front de Talús en la formació de la forma més modificada de WDW observada abans d’entrar a la dorsal i la seva contribució en la modificació de la Frontera Sud del ACC al sudoest del Mar d’Escòcia...|$|R
