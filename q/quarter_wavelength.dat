25|$|Electrostatics are {{inherently}} dipole radiators {{and due to}} the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers.

25|$|More {{sophisticated}} techniques {{will show}} proportional differences in optical density. Phase contrast {{is a widely}} used technique that shows differences in refractive index as difference in contrast. It {{was developed by the}} Dutch physicist Frits Zernike in the 1930s (for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1953). The nucleus in a cell for example will show up darkly against the surrounding cytoplasm. Contrast is excellent; however it is not for use with thick objects. Frequently, a halo is formed even around small objects, which obscures detail. The system consists of a circular annulus in the condenser, which produces a cone of light. This cone is superimposed on a similar sized ring within the phase-objective. Every objective has a different size ring, so for every objective another condenser setting has to be chosen. The ring in the objective has special optical properties: it, first of all, reduces the direct light in intensity, but more importantly, it creates an artificial phase difference of about a <b>quarter</b> <b>wavelength.</b> As the physical properties of this direct light have changed, interference with the diffracted light occurs, resulting in the phase contrast image. One disadvantage of phase-contrast microscopy is halo formation (halo-light ring).|$|E

50|$|An antenna transmits and {{receives}} radio waves {{with a particular}} polarization which can be reoriented by tilting the axis of the antenna in many (but not all) cases. The physical size of an antenna is often a practical issue, particularly at lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). Highly directional antennas need to be significantly larger than the wavelength. Resonant antennas usually use a linear conductor (or element), or pair of such elements, {{each of which is}} about a <b>quarter</b> of the <b>wavelength</b> in length (an odd multiple of <b>quarter</b> <b>wavelengths</b> will also be resonant). Antennas that are required to be small compared to the wavelength sacrifice efficiency and cannot be very directional. Fortunately at higher frequencies (UHF, microwaves) trading off performance to obtain a smaller physical size is usually not required.|$|R

The antenna {{that is to be}} used is a so called ESPAR antenna or Electronically Steerable Passive Array Radiator using monopoles over a circular ground plane.

The measurements showed less variation between the different configurations of the antenna than the simulations indicated. The largest difference was the elevation angle of the antenna. This was found to be about 0 degrees for all configurations which is an improvement of about 25 degrees from the simulated results. The best results was found to be with an antenna that has the same configurations as the simulated one described above but with a parasitic monopole height of 37 mm. The measurements showed the following specifications: -	Gain of about 9. 5 dB -	HPBW of 80 degrees -	FTBR of about 12 dB Because of certain elements {{in the construction of the}} antenna the measurements of the matching were inconclusive, and were not weighed heavily in this thesis. </p...|$|R

2500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{applications}} of the dipole antenna is the rabbit ears or bunny ears television antenna, found atop broadcast television receivers. [...] It is used to receive the VHF terrestrial television bands, consisting in the US of 52 to 88nbsp&MHz (band I) and 174 to 216nbsp&MHz (band III), with wavelengths of 5.5 to 1.4 m. [...] Since this frequency range is much wider than a single fixed dipole antenna can cover, it is made with several degrees of adjustment. [...] It is constructed of two telescoping rods that can be extended out to about 1 m length (approximately one <b>quarter</b> <b>wavelength</b> at 52nbsp&MHz). [...] Instead of being fixed in opposing directions, these elements can be adjusted at an angle in a [...] "V" [...] shape. [...] The reason for the V shape is that when receiving channels {{at the top of the}} band, the antenna elements will typically resonate at their 3rd harmonic. [...] In this mode the direction of maximum gain is no longer perpendicular to the rods, but the radiation pattern will have lobes at an angle to the rods, making it advantageous to be able to adjust them to various angles.|$|E
2500|$|Most home hi-fi {{loudspeakers}} use two wiring {{points to}} connect {{to the source of}} the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or receiver). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have binding posts, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper electrical polarity (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −; [...] speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be [...] "out of phase" [...] or more properly [...] "out of polarity". Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a <b>quarter</b> <b>wavelength</b> or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.|$|E

2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a <b>quarter</b> <b>wavelength</b> compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. [...] This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E

25|$|The next pair of {{illustrations}} {{is that of}} left-handed, counter-clockwise {{circularly polarized}} light when viewed by the receiver. Because it is left-handed, the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component is now lagging the vertical component by one <b>quarter</b> of a <b>wavelength</b> rather than leading it.|$|R
25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a <b>quarter</b> of <b>wavelength</b> twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its horizontal component {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one <b>quarter</b> of a <b>wavelength.</b> Whether that horizontal component is retarded by one <b>quarter</b> of a <b>wavelength</b> in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|R

The sound signal displayed on the oscilloscope is observed using a small microphone immediately in front of the plunger. A maximum response of the microphone indicates that there is a pressure antinode (or a velocity node) at the closed end and a pressure node (or velocity antinode) at the open end, so the proper arrangement of standing wave loops just fits into the closed tube. The sound that is heard on the video is picked up by an external microphone. The microphone inside the tube is hooked only to the oscilloscope. The frequency is increased in the second segment of the demonstration, so that the distance between the pressure antinodes can be compared with those for the lower frequency.

5000|$|At the {{operational}} {{frequency of the}} choke flange, {{the depth of the}} ditch is approximately one <b>quarter</b> of a <b>wavelength.</b> This is somewhat longer {{than a quarter of the}} free-space wavelength, since the electric field also varies in going around the ditch, having two changes of polarity, or one complete wave in the circumference.

This high impedance is in series with the metal-to-metal connection between the flanges, and minimizes the current across it.
