5|$|Another <b>question</b> <b>in</b> {{the case}} was whether the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had {{jurisdiction}} to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|As {{regards the}} first <b>question,</b> <b>in</b> Borissik v. Urban Redevelopment Authority (2009), the Singapore High Court adopted four {{conditions}} {{set out in}} De Smith's Judicial Review (6th ed., 2007) {{to determine whether a}} legitimate expectation has been created. The public body's representation must be clear, unambiguous and devoid of any relevant qualification; induced by the conduct of the decision-maker; made by a person with actual or ostensible authority; and applicable to the applicant, who belongs to the class of persons to whom the representation is reasonably expected to apply.|$|E
5|$|Chief Justice Melville Fuller {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on May 21, 1900. This opinion held that there were no federal issues in <b>question</b> <b>in</b> the case, and that the court lacked jurisdiction.

5|$|Coral Ridge Properties {{established}} strict landscaping {{and sign}} laws for the city—a <b>question</b> <b>in</b> {{the original version}} of Trivial Pursuit noted that the city hosted the first McDonald's without the distinctive Golden Arches sign. Restrictions on commercial signs, exterior paint colors, roofing materials, recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are {{significantly higher than the}} county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.|$|E

5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board. They may, within two months from the date of the detention order, make written representations to the Minister. The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board.

The burden of proving that a person is a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E
5|$|Section 1254(1) {{represents}} {{the far more}} common route: certiorari, the source of nearly all the Supreme Court's current docket. Section 1254(2) represents a less common route: certification. Pursuant to § 1254(2), the Supreme Court heard 72 certified question cases between 1927 and 1936; 20 between 1937 and 1946; and only four between 1947 and 2010. In modern jurisprudence, § 1254(2) certification has become very rare. For example, when the en banc Fifth Circuit attempted to certify a <b>question</b> <b>in</b> 2009 (also a rare occurrence), the Supreme Court summarily declined to consider the case. Certified questions are also governed by Supreme Court Rule 19.|$|E

To what extent do the reading <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> “Headlight” refer to comprehension level? (3). To what extent do the reading <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> “Headlight” refer to application level? (4). To what extent do the reading <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> “Headlight” refer to analysis level? (5). To what extent do the reading <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> “Headlight” refer to synthesis level? (6). To what extent do the reading <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> “Headlight” refer to evaluation level? To get the answers of the research problem, the writer follows this procedure: (1). She interpreted the <b>questions</b> <b>in</b> order to find the level of the questions based on Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive domain. (2). She made a table that shows the number of question and percentage of each level of cognitive domain in every passage. (3). She used the formula to find the proportion of each level of cognitive domain in every passage. (4). She numbered all questions from 18 passages which belong to each level of cognitive domain (5). She used the formula to find out the proportion of each level of cognitive domain from the 18 passages. (6).

5|$|All the {{candidates}} in a GRC must either {{be members of}} the same political party or independent candidates standing as a group, and at least one of {{the candidates}} must be a person belonging to the Malay, Indian or some other minority community.

Similarly, a person will belong to the Indian community or some other minority community if he or she considers himself or herself a member and the community accepts him or her as such.
