40|$|Nitrogen stable {{isotopes}} {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} the trophic position of consumers in food webs. However, the nitrogen stable isotope ratios (d 15 N) of primary producers at the base of food webs are highly variable and must be accounted for in these estimates. To assess spatial variation in the d 15 N of primary producers, we measured the d 15 N of phytoplankton-feeding bivalve molluscs (<b>queen</b> <b>scallops</b> Aequipecten opercularis) at sites in the north-east Atlantic (Irish Sea, English Channel, North Sea). <b>Queen</b> <b>scallops</b> are good monitors of spatial patterns in the d 15 N of phytoplankton because their slow rate of tissue turnover integrates variability in the d 15 N of their diet. A significant proportion of spatial variation in d 15 N was statistically explained by widely recorded environmental variables such as salinity, depth and temperature. Accordingly, we developed a linear model to predict and map large-scale spatial patterns in scallop d 15 N from the environmental variables. We used the model, in conjunction with new data on the spatial variation in d 15 N of two predatory fishes, to show that 51 % and 77 % of spatial variance in dab Limanda limanda and whiting Merlangius merlangus d 15 N, and hence apparent trophic level, could be attributed to differences in d 15 N {{at the base of the}} food chain. Since temperature and salinity are correlated with base d 15 N, and since gradients in these physical variables are particularly pronounced in coastal areas and close to estuaries, spatial comparisons of trophic position are easily biased if fine-scale information on base d 15 N is not available. Conversely, in offshore regions, where temperature and salinity show little variation over large areas, variations in base d 15 N and the associated bias will be less...|$|R

Trawling and handling of the (by-) catch often results in physical injury, the extent of which was previously unknown. Damage sustained by invertebrate discards was assessed following commercial trawling (of 62 - 270 min duration) and sorting on deck. Brittlestars Ophiura ophiura were most vulnerable with 100 % incurring damage, followed by squat lobsters Munida rugosa (57 %) and starfish Astropecten irregularis (56 %). Harder-shelled species such as hermit crabs Pagurus bernhardus and <b>queen</b> <b>scallops</b> Aequipecten opercularis sustained fewer injuries (14 and 2 %, respectively). Shell chipping, loss and damage of limbs were the most frequent types of injury incurred. The severity and frequency of damage was mainly correlated with species-specific morphological and behavioural characteristics.

The ecology and natural history of scallops is introduced followed by a description of the state of current knowledge of scallop swimming, muscle physiology and energetics. The effects of temperature and the mechanisms used by ectotherms to compensate for such changes over acute, seasonal and evolutionary timescales are discussed.

40|$|Escape {{behaviour}} {{was investigated}} in <b>Queen</b> <b>scallops</b> (Aequipecten opercularis) acclimated to 5, 10 or 15 degrees C and tested at their acclimation temperature. Scallops are active molluscs, able to escape from predators by jet-propelled swimming using a striated muscle working in opposition to an elastic hinge ligament. The first cycle of the escape response was recorded using high-speed video (250 Hz) and whole-animal velocity and acceleration determined. Muscle shortening velocity, force and power output were calculated using measurements of valve movement and jet area, and a simple biomechanical model. The average shortening speed of the adductor muscle had a Q(10) of 2. 04, significantly reducing {{the duration of the}} jetting phase of the cycle with increased temperature. Muscle lengthening velocity and the overall duration of the clap cycle were changed little over the range 5 - 15 degrees C, as these parameters were controlled by the relatively temperature-insensitive, hinge ligament. Improvements in the average power output of the adductor muscle over the first clap cycle (222 vs. 139 W kg(- 1) wet mass at 15 and 5 degrees C respectively) were not translated into proportional increases in overall swimming velocity, which was only 32 % higher at 15 degrees C (0. 37 m s(- 1)) than 5 degrees C (0. 28 m s(- 1)) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} newly established, fully protected marine reserve on benthic habitats and two commercially valuable species of scallop in Lamlash Bay, Isle of Arran, United Kingdom. Annual dive surveys from 2010 to 2013 showed the abundance of juvenile scallops to be significantly greater within the marine reserve than outside. Generalised linear models revealed this trend to be significantly related to the greater presence of macroalgae and hydroids growing within the boundaries of the reserve. These results suggest that structurally complex habitats growing within the reserve have substantially increased spat settlement and/or survival. The density of adult king scallops declined threefold with increasing distance from the boundaries of the reserve, indicating possible evidence of spillover or reduced fishing effort directly outside and around the marine reserve. However, {{there was no difference in}} the mean density of adult scallops between the reserve and outside. Finally, the mean age, size, and reproductive and exploitable biomass of king scallops were all significantly greater within the reserve. In contrast to king scallops, the population dynamics of <b>queen</b> <b>scallops</b> (Aequipecten opercularis) fluctuated randomly over the survey period and showed little difference between the reserve and outside. Overall, this study is consistent with the hypothesis that marine reserves can encourage the recovery of seafloor habitats, which, in turn, can benefit populations of commercially exploited species, emphasising the importance of marine reserves in the ecosystem-based management of fisheries...|$|R
40|$|Marine inshore communities, {{including}} biogenic habitats {{have undergone}} dramatic changes {{as a result}} of exploitation, pollution, land-use changes and introduced species. The Firth of Forth on the east coast of Scotland was once home to the most important oyster (Ostrea edulis Linnaeus, 1758) beds in Scotland. 19 th and early 20 th century fisheries scientists documented the degradation and loss of these beds, yet transformation of the wider benthic community has been little studied. We undertook archival searches, ecological surveys and shell community analysis using radioisotope dated sediment cores to investigate the history of decline of Forth oyster beds over the last 200 years and the changes to its wider biological communities. Quadrat analysis of the present day benthos reveal that soft-sediment communities dominate the Firth of Forth, with little remaining evidence of past oyster beds in places where abundant shell remains were picked up by a survey undertaken in 1895. <b>Queen</b> <b>scallops</b> (Aequipecten opercularis Linnaeus, 1758) and horse mussels (Modiolus modiolus Linnaeus, 1758) were once common within the Forth but have also markedly decreased compared to the earlier survey. Ouranalyses of shell remains suggest that overall mollusc biomass and species richness declined throughout the 19 th century and early 20 th century, suggesting broader-scale community change as human impacts increased and as habitats degraded. Inshore communities in the Firth of Forth today are less productive and less diverse compared to past states, with evidence suggesting that most of the damage was done by early bottom trawling and dredging activities. Given the pervasive nature of intensive trawling over the past 150 years, the kind of degradation we document for the Firth of Forth is likely to be commonplace within UK inshore communities...|$|R

50|$|S. spinulosa usually lives singly in a tube {{attached}} to the substrate over its entire length. In much of its range it does not forms reefs {{in the same way}} as the closely related honeycomb worm, Sabellaria alveolata. When the worms are crowded together the tubes may stand up vertically and form crusts or mounds several metres across. Unaggregated individuals may reach densities of 300 per square metre (10sq ft), and densities of 4000 individuals per square metre have been recorded in loose aggregations. However, under a narrow set of environmental circumstances, reefs are formed. These include: sand or gravel sea floor, the edges of sandbanks, the edges of channels and drop-offs, high turbidity, high sediment load, moderate currents and moderate suspended organic particulate load. Where reefs exist, they provide a biodiverse habitat for a large number of invertebrates and juvenile fish. They are often dominated by the presence of crustaceans, especially the porcelain crab (Pisidia longicornis) and the pink shrimp (Pandalus montagui), which feed on the worms and on other invertebrates which shelter in the reefs. Another frequent resident is the <b>queen</b> <b>scallop</b> (Aequipecten opercularis).|$|E
40|$|During the 1970 s and 1980 s, {{the late}} Dr Norman Holme {{undertook}} extensive towed sledge surveys in the English Channel {{and some in}} the Irish Sea. Only {{a minority of the}} resulting images were analysed and reported before his death in 1989 but logbooks, video and film material has been archived in the National Marine Biological Library (NMBL) in Plymouth. A study was therefore commissioned by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee and {{as a part of the}} Mapping European Seabed Habitats (MESH) project to identify the value of the material archived and the procedure and cost to undertake further work (Phase 1 of the study reported here: Oakley & Hiscock, 2005). Some image analysis was undertaken as a part of Phase 1. Phase 2 (this report) was to further analyse selected images. Having determined in Phase 1 that only the 35 mm photographic transparencies provided sufficient clarity to identify species and biotopes, the tows selected for analysis were ones where 35 mm images had been taken. The tows selected for analysis of images were mainly in the vicinity of Plymouth and especially along the area between Rame Head and the region of the Eddystone. The 35 mm films were viewed under a binocular microscope and the taxa that could be recognised recorded in note form. Twenty-five images were selected for inclusion in the report. Almost all of the images were of level sediment seabed. Where rocks were included, it was usually unplanned and the sled was hauled before being caught or damaged. The main biotopes or biotope complexes identified were: SS. SMU. CSaMu. Circalittoral sandy mud. Extensively present between the shore and the Eddystone Reef complex and at depths of about 48 to 52 m. At one site offshore of Plymouth Sound, the turret shell Turritella communis was abundant. In some areas, this biotope had dense anemones, Mesacmaea mitchelli and (more rarely) Cerianthus lloydii. <b>Queen</b> <b>scallops,</b> Aequipecten opercularis and king scallops, Pecten maximus, were sometimes present in small numbers. Hard substratum species such as hydroids, dead mens fingers Alcyonium digitatum and the cup coral Caryophyllia smithii occurred in a few places, probably attached to shells or stones beneath the surface. South of the spoil ground off Hilsea Point at 57 m depth, the sediment was muddier but is still assigned to this biotope complex. It is notable that three small sea pens, most likely Virgularia mirabilis, were seen here. SS. SMx. CMx. Circalittoral mixed sediment. Further offshore but at about the same depth as SS. SMU. CSaMu occurred, coarse gravel with some silt was present. The sediment was characterised must conspicuously by small <b>queen</b> <b>scallops,</b> Aequipecten opercularis. Peculiarly, there were ‘bundles’ of the branching bryozoan Cellaria sp. – a species normally found attached to rock. It could not be seen whether these bundles of Cellaria had been brought-together by terebellid worms but it is notable that Cellaria is recorded in historical surveys. As with many other sediments, there were occasional brittle stars, Ophiocomina nigra and Ophiura ophiura. Where sediments were muddy, the burrowing anemone Mesacmaea mitchelli was common. Where pebbles or cobbles occurred, there were attached species such as Alcyonium digitatum, Caryophyllia smithii and the fleshy bryozoan Alcyonidium diaphanum. Undescribed biotope. Although most likely a part of SS. SMx. CMx, the biotope visually dominated by a terebellid worm believed to be Thelepus cincinnatua, is worth special attention as it may be an undescribed biotope. The biotope occurred about 22 nautical miles south of the latitude of the Eddystone and in depths in excess of 70 m. SS. SCS. CCS. Blan. Branchiostoma lanceolatum in circalittoral coarse sand with shell gravel at about 48 m depth and less. This habitat was the ‘classic’ ‘Eddystone Shell Gravel’ which is sampled for Branchiostoma lanceolatum. However, no Branchiostoma lanceolatum could be seen. The gravel was almost entirely bare of epibiota. There were occasional rock outcrops or cobbles which had epibiota including encrusting calcareous algae, the sea fan Eunicella verrucosa, cup corals, Caryophyllia smithii, hydroids and a sea urchin Echinus esculentus. The variety of species visible on the surface is small and therefore identification to biotope not usually possible. Historical records from sampling surveys that used grabs and dredges at the end of the 19 th century and early 20 th century suggest similar species present then.

Taking this peculiarity into account, the paper makes a distinction between different strategies, which enable fishers to adapt to a changing environment (abundance variation but also economic and institutional shifts) during recent years. Fishers have to choose among different activities, which bring about various investments. Vice versa, their behaviour has feedback effects on the global institutional environment, and especially on the regulation system of input control.

40|$|Due to the {{possibility}} that bacteria could be involved in the clearance of paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) from bivalve molluscs, investigations into which, if any, bacteria were able to grow at the expense of PST focused on several common shellfish species. These species were blue mussels, oysters, razor fish, cockles, and <b>queen</b> and king <b>scallops.</b> Bacteria associated with these shellfish were isolated on marine agar 2216 and characterized by their carbon utilization profiles (BIOLOG). Selected isolates from groups demonstrating 90 % similarity were screened for their ability to metabolize a range of PST (gonyautoxins 1 and 4 [GTX 1 / 4], GTX 2 / 3, GTX 5, saxitoxin, and neosaxitoxin) using a novel screening method and confirming its results by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results suggest that molluscan bacteria have different capacities to utilize and transform PST analogues. For example, isolates M 12 and R 65 were able to reductively transform GTX 1 / 4 with concomitant production of GTX 2 / 3, while isolate Q 5 apparently degraded GTX 1 / 4 without the appearance of other GTXs. Other observed possible mechanisms of PST transformations include decarbamoylation by isolate M 12 and sulfation of GTXs by isolates Q 5, R 65, M 12, and C 3. These findings raise questions as to the possible role of bacteria resident in the shellfish food transport system. Some researchers have suggested that the microflora play a role in supplying nutritional requirements of the host. This study demonstrates that bacteria may also be involved in PST transformation and elimination in molluscan species...|$|R

Additionally, the damage sustained by the by-catch was assessed and related to a range of physical parameters recorded during the survey. A number of species captured in the spring-toothed dredges exhibited differences in abundance and damage sustained between years, and also between the start and end of the closed season for great scallop fishing (1 June– 31 October). The by-catch assemblage varied geographically, dependent upon the underlying community structure, as well as putative factors including gear efficiency and substratum type. Two clear assemblage types were identified by multivariate analysis, one to the south-west of the Isle of Man, the other covering fishing grounds to the north, east and south of the island. There is a hierarchy of species sensitivity to damage in great and <b>queen</b> <b>scallop</b> dredges, probably related to morphological and behavioural characteristics. This selective mortality of a fraction of the community may have long-term implications at the ecosystem level. The degree of damage sustained by many species is related to both the volume of stones retained in the dredge, and the total volume of the catch (dredge fullness). If these were reduced, the overall magnitude of incidental by-catch mortality would be lower...|$|E

The effects of increasing exploitation on scallop stocks are also considered by analysing available data sets on abundance, density, exploitation and mortality rates, population age structure and recruitment. With increasing exploitation, scallop abundance has decreased and the older age groups have been depleted. Most inshore fishing grounds show evidence of growth overfishing but the fishery is sustained by consistent recruitment. The problems of managing the fishery are discussed...|$|E
40|$|During 1998 {{and early}} 1999, {{shellfish}} samples from sites in Scotland {{were found to}} contain the amnesic shellfish poisoning toxin, domoic acid (DA). Two different techniques, liquid chromatography (LC) with UV diode-array detection and LC with mass spectrometric (MS) detection, were used to detect and confirm DA in shellfish extracts. The LC/UV method was validated for routine monitoring by recovery experiments on spiked mussel and scallop tissues with a certified mussel tissue used as reference material. Crude extracts of selected samples as well as extracts cleaned with strong anion exchange (SAX) were analyzed by both LC/UV and LC/MS. Good correlation (linear regression r 2 = 0. 996, slope = 0. 93) between the 2 methods was found for cleaned extracts. Analyses of crude extracts by LC/UV produced false-positive results in 2 crab samples, whereas LC/MS analyses gave accurate results. It was concluded that LC/UV is a valid approach for routine monitoring of DA in shellfish when cleanup is performed with a SAX cartridge to prevent false positives.

40|$|The king scallop {{fishery is}} the fastest growing fishery in the UK and {{currently}} the second most valuable. The UK {{is also home to}} the largest <b>queen</b> <b>scallop</b> fishery out of all of Europe. However, concerns have been raised about the effects of this recent growth of UK scallop fisheries among scientists and conservation bodies, as well as amongst the public following recent media campaigns (e. g. Hugh’s Fish Fight). This is because the majority of scallop landings (95 %) are made by vessels towing scallop dredges, a type of fishing gear known to cause substantial environmental impacts. In addition, several scallop stocks are showing signs of overexploitation and there is concern over future impacts of ocean warming and acidification. Although, there have been several recent improvements in the management of scallop fisheries in parts of the UK, information on many scallop stocks around the UK is still lacking. This report therefore proposes that better monitoring and stock assessments are needed for these scallop fisheries and stocks. With recent legislation soon to result {{in the development of a}} new network of marine protected areas (MPAs) around the UK, and improved management of fisheries in European Marine Sites, now is a crucial time to review the UK scallop dredge fishery and its impacts on the wider environment so that this new legislation can support a sustainable future for the UK scallop fishery.

Sampling took place, after the spawning period, {{in the main}} shellfish grounds of the Rias of Vigo and Arosa (NW Spain). Each sample was prepared from 20 individuals representing the available size range existing in the selected area. The soft tissues (total edible portion) were separated from the shells, triturated with an Ultraturrax homogeniser and freeze-dried. The analysis of trace metals includes a nitric acid digestion in a microwave. The quantification {{was carried out by}} atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman effect graphite furnace. Total mercury was determined by flow injection cold vapour atomic absorption spectrometry. The method used for the determination of 13 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) is based in a Soxhlet extraction with organic solvents mixture, followed by an extract cleaning up using column chromatography. Finally, the extract was analysed using gigh performance liquid chromatography with wavelength programmable fluorescence detector. Samples for analyses of PCBs were extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with organic solvents mixture. Clean-up and fractioned of the extract was performed with a chromatographic columns. The extract were analysed by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector using capillary columns and He as carrier gas. The lipid content was gravimetrically determined. The quality of the chemical analyses is demonstrated by the results obtained in different intercalibration exercises that take part on a regular basis, such as QUASIMEME. The internal laboratory QC includes analyses of duplicate samples and procedural blanks as well as control charts of CRMs. The experimental values for metals were far below the EU maximum levles for bivalve molluscs for human consumption, with the exception of Pb, for which some results exceeded EC Regulation Nº 1881 / 2006. The Pb values appear to be more related to the biology of this species than to the contaminant levels in the study areas, as the Pb values in other species of bivalve molluscs from these areas show concentrations far below the limits for consumption. The average As and Zn concentrations was higher in Arosa than in Vigo. Cd, Hg and Cu showed very similar values in both areas of study. For PAHs, the comparison value used in this study was the one established for extraction and consumption after the Erika and Prestige oil spills, 200 µg kg- 1 dry wt in Vigo, which is 3 - 4 times less than the limit, to 151 - 181 µg Kg- 1 dry wt in Arosa, which is very close to, but below the maximum allowed level. In general, the <b>queen</b> <b>scallop</b> showed higher PAH concentrations in Arosa than in Vigo, and the origin also appears to be different. The highest concentrations of PCBs were found in the Ría of Vigo, zone with greatest industrial and port activity, with a maximum value of 20 µg Kg- 1 wet wt, which is considerably lower than the level established by the FDA for edible seafood. In the Ria of Arousa the concentrations were 6 - 7 times lower, with values ranging level 2. 8 and 3. 2 µg kg- 1 wet wt. The concentrations of DDTs showed similar values in the two rias: 0. 52 - 0. 64 µg kg- 1 wet wt in the Ria of Vigo and 0. 45 - 0. 55 µg kg- 1 wet in the Ria of Arosa. The levels were also lower then the maximum limits established by the EU...|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{characteristics}} greatly {{influence the}} patterns of distribution and abundance in scallops, providing structure for the settlement of spat and influencing predation risk and rates of survival. Establishing scallop-habitat relationships is relevant to understanding the ecological processes that regulate scallop populations and to managing critical habitats. This information is particularly relevant for the D’Entrecasteaux Channel, south-eastern Tasmania (147. 335 W, 43. 220 S), a region that has supported significant but highly variable scallop production over many years, including protracted periods of stock collapse. Three species of scallops {{are present in the}} region; the commercial scallop Pecten fumatus, the <b>queen</b> <b>scallop</b> Equichlamys bifrons, and the doughboy scallop Mimachlamys asperrima. We used dive surveys and Generalized Additive Modelling {{to examine the relationship between}} the distribution and abundance patterns of each species and associated habitat characteristics. The aggregated distribution of each species could be predicted as a function of sediment type and species-specific habitat structural components. While P. fumatus was strongly associated with finer sediments and E. bifrons with coarse grain sediments, M. asperrima had a less selective association, possibly related to its ability to attach on a wide range of substrates. Other habitat characteristics explaining P. fumatus abundance were depth, Asterias amurensis abundance, shell and macroalgae cover. Equichlamys bifrons was strongly associated with macroalgae and seagrass cover, whereas M. asperrima abundance was greatly explained by sponge cover. The models define a set of relationships from which plausible hypotheses can be developed. We propose that these relationships are mediated by predation pressure as well as the specific behavioural characteristics of each species. The findings also highlight the specific habitat characteristics that are relevant for spatial management and habitat restoration plans...|$|E
40|$|Records of {{environment}} {{contained within the}} accretionarily deposited tissues of fossil organisms afford a means of detailed reconstruction of past climates and hence of rigorous testing of numerical climate models. We identify the environmental factors controlling oxygen and carbon stable-isotopic composition, and microgrowth-increment size, in the shell of modern examples of the <b>Queen</b> <b>Scallop,</b> Aequipecten opercularis. This understanding is then applied in interpretation of data from mid-Pliocene A. opercularis from eastern England. On the basis of oxygen-isotope evidence we conclude that winter minimum seafloor temperature was similar to present values (typically 6 – 7 °C) in the adjacent southern North Sea and that summer maximum seafloor temperature was a few degrees lower than present values (typically 16 – 17 °C). This contrasts with evidence from other proxies that winter and summer temperatures were higher than present. The pattern of seasonal variation in microgrowth-increment size suggests the existence of intense thermal stratification in summer. We therefore conclude that summer surface temperatures were much higher (maxima well over 20 °C) than those recorded isotopically on the seafloor and that the annual range of surface temperature (probably over 14 °C) was greater than now at the times in the mid-Pliocene when the investigated A. opercularis were alive. Taken {{in conjunction with other}} proxy evidence of warmer winters as well as summers, the data point to substantial fluctuation (up to 10 °C) in winter minimum temperatures during the mid-Pliocene in the north-east Atlantic region. This fluctuation may be attributable to variation in the strength of the Gulf Stream/North Atlantic Drift. Since the Pliocene has been widely used as a test-bed for numerical models of a greenhouse Earth, the results have implications for prediction of future climate in the north-east Atlantic region under the influence of anthropogenic global warming. ...|$|E

Plasmalogen (Pls) and diacyl + alkyl (Ptd) forms of serine, ethanolamine, and choline glycerophospholipids were isolated by HPLC and their FA compositions analyzed by GC-FID. Pls and Ptd forms of serine glycerophospholipids (PlsSer and PtdSer), {{and to a lesser}} extend the Pls form of ethanolamine glycerophospholipids (PlsEtn), were found to be specifically enriched with c 4, 7, 10,t 13 - 22 ∶ 4. This specificity was found to decrease in the tested organs in the following order: gills, mantle, gonad, and muscle. In gills, c 4, 7, 10,t 13 - 22 ∶ 4 was shown to be the main unsaturated FA of serine glycerophospholipids in both Pls and Ptd forms (23. 8 and 19. 4 mol%, respectively, for A. opercularis, and 21. 0 and 26. 2 mol% for P. maximus). These results represent the first comprehensive report on the FA composition of plasmalogen serine subclass isolated from pectinid bivalves. The specific association of the PlsSer with the c 4, 7, 10,t 13 - 22 ∶ 4 for the two pectinid species can be paralleled to the specific association of the PlsSer with the non-methylene interrupted (NMI) FA and 20 ∶ 1 (n− 11) observed in mussels, clams, and oysters (Kraffe, E., Soudant, P., and Marty, Y. (2004) Fatty Acids of Serine, Ethanolamine and Choline Plasmalogens in Some Marine Bivalves, Lipids 39, 59 - 66.) This, led us to hypothesize a similar functional significance for c 4, 7, 10,t 13 - 22 ∶ 4, NMI FA, and 20 ∶ 1 (n− 11) associated with PlsSer subclass of bivalves...|$|E
40|$|Carbon stable {{isotopes}} {{can be used}} {{to trace}} the sources of energy supporting food chains and to estimate the contribution of different sources to a consumer's diet. However, the d 13 C signature of a consumer is not sufficient to infer source without an appropriate isotopic baseline, because {{there is no way to}} determine if differences in consumer d 13 C reflect source changes or baseline variation. Describing isotopic baselines is a considerable challenge when applying stable isotope techniques at large spatial scales and/or to interconnected food chains in open marine environments. One approach is to use filter-feeding consumers to integrate the high frequency and small-scale variation in the isotopic signature of phytoplankton and provide a surrogate baseline, but it can be difficult to sample a single consumer species at large spatial scales owing to rarity and/or discontinuous distribution. Here, we use the isotopic signature of a widely distributed filter-feeder (the <b>queen</b> <b>scallop</b> Aequipecten opercularis) in the north-eastern Atlantic to develop a model linking base d 13 C to environmental variables. Remarkably, a single variable model based on bottom temperature has good predictive power and predicts scallop d 13 C with mean error of only 0. 6 ‰ (3 %). When the model was used to predict an isotopic baseline in parts of the overall study region where scallop were not consistently sampled, the model accounted for 76 % and 79 % of the large-scale spatial variability (101 - 104 km) of the d 13 C of two fish species (dab Limanda limanda and whiting Merlangus merlangius) and 44 % of the d 13 C variability in a mixed fish community. The results show that source studies would be significantly biased if a single baseline were applied to food webs at larger scales. Further, when baseline d 13 C cannot be directly measured, a calculated baseline value can eliminate a large proportion of the unexplained variation in d 13 C at higher trophic levels...|$|E
