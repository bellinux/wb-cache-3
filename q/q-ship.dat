5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1916 he was {{transferred}} as first lieutenant to a <b>Q-ship</b> under Gordon Campbell. A <b>Q-ship</b> was a merchant ship with hidden weaponry, commanded secretly by the navy and manned by a Royal Navy crew. When attacked by a submarine, the <b>Q-ship</b> would feign damage until the enemy {{was close enough to}} engage and then reveal its weapons to counter-attack. Campbell, a major proponent of <b>Q-ship</b> strategy, was impressed with Stuart's stubborn refusal to accept the two years of rejection and brought him in to replace an officer whose nerves had cracked under the strain of <b>Q-ship</b> operations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to receiving the Victoria Cross, Stuart {{was promoted to}} lieutenant commander and given his own command, HMS Tamarisk. Tamarisk was a small sloop built in 1916 that was capable of being disguised as a merchant vessel and used as a <b>Q-ship,</b> designated Q11.|$|E
5|$|Six {{days into}} her first war patrol, on 22 March 1916, U-68 was sunk by , a British <b>Q-ship,</b> with all hands. U-68 sank no ships in her brief career. A post-war German study found fault with U-68s captain for not {{following}} established procedures for avoiding decoy ships.|$|E

50|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War, Chatterton joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (R.N.V.R.), ultimately commanding a Motor Launch flotilla at Queenstown, now Cobh, in Ireland. He describes these years in <b>Q-Ships</b> and their Story (1922), The Auxiliary Patrol (1924) and Danger Zone: The Story of the Queenstown Command (1934). He left the service in 1919 with the rank of Lieutenant Commander.|$|R
5|$|After {{repeated}} pleas to authorities, Sanders {{traveled to}} London and on 19 April 1916 was finally appointed an acting sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. After {{a period of}} time at the HMS Excellent training facility on Whale Island, he was granted a position on Helgoland, a <b>Q-ship</b> operating against German submarines in the Western Approaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} {{of the war was}} quiet for Stuart, achieving no further successes against submarines. Upon the armistice the full details of his Victoria Cross action were revealed and, in 1919, he was mentioned in despatches in recognition of the service he had performed during the <b>Q-ship</b> operations. As further recognition of his overall efforts against the German submarine campaign, the French government presented him with the Croix de Guerre.|$|E
5|$|Sanders, a bachelor, died without {{knowledge}} of the award of a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on 12 June 1917. The emergence of correspondence with his first <b>Q-ship</b> commander, A.D Blair, {{makes it clear that}} he at least knew of his VC prior to his death, even if he had not received it. In June 1918, Sanders' father received his son's VC and DSO from the Governor-General of New Zealand. Sander's VC, the only one awarded to a New Zealander serving in the navy, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E
5|$|Q-ships were {{merchant}} ships crewed by Navy {{personnel and}} bearing hidden weaponry. When attacked by U-boats, {{a portion of}} the ship's crew (referred to as a panic party) would appear to evacuate the vessel, sometimes setting smoke fires to simulate damage. This would encourage its attacker to approach and when the U-boat was close enough, the <b>Q-ship's</b> guns would become operational and open fire, hopefully destroying the submarine.|$|R
500|$|U-68 {{departed}} the Ems on 16 March 1916 {{to begin}} her first war patrol. Headed to her assigned operating area off Britain's west coast, Güntzel and U-68 came across , a British Q-ship—in appearance unarmed—under {{the command of}} Gordon Campbell. At approximately 07:00, U-68 fired a torpedo at Farnborough and narrowly missed the ship's bow. Farnborough continued the deception and continued on at her same speed and course. At 07:20, U-68 surfaced about [...] astern of Farnborough, moved to the ship's port quarter, and fired a shot across the <b>Q-ship's</b> bow.|$|R
500|$|As UB-4 went down, her hulk fouled the Inverlyons nets—which {{had been}} {{deployed}} {{to keep up}} the appearance of a real fishing boat—essentially anchoring Inverlyon in place. The <b>Q-ship's</b> crew, not having a wireless set on board, sent word of the encounter with another smack, and followed up by releasing messenger pigeons the following morning, requesting instructions on what to do with UB-4. The thought of salvaging the snagged U-boat was rejected, so the nets were cut, freeing UB-4 to sink to the bottom. UB-4s wreck lies at position [...] Jehan was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for the sinking of UB-4, and the crewmen of Inverlyon split the submarine bounty paid by the Admiralty.|$|R
5|$|Agreeing to this proposal, Crisp became first a Seaman and by {{the summer}} of 1916 a Skipper in the Royal Naval Reserve, {{arranging}} for his son to join the crew of his boat, the HM Armed Smack I'll Try, armed with a 3–pounder gun. On 1 February 1917 in the North Sea, I'll Try had its first confrontation with the enemy when two submarines surfaced close to the smack and her companion the larger Boy Alfred. Despite near misses from enemy torpedoes, both smacks scored hits on their larger opponents and reported them as probable sinkings, although post–war German records show that no submarines were lost on that date. Both skippers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and a present of £200 for this action, and Crisp was offered a promotion and transfer to an ocean–going <b>Q–ship.</b> He was forced to turn down this offer due to his wife's sudden and terminal illness. She died in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after {{assuming}} command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS Cassin after she was torpedoed by U-61 in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the Cassin had lost her entire stern including the rudder and {{was in danger of}} sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the Tamarisk not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the <b>Q-ship</b> and together they enabled the Cassin to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the Cassin's rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; it was a rare presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of a gallant and daring act being {{performed}} by a squadron, ship's company or a detached body of men (such as marines) in which all men are deemed equally brave and deserving of the Victoria Cross then a ballot is drawn. The officers select one officer, the NCOs select one individual and the private soldiers or seamen select two individuals. In all 46 awards have been awarded by ballot with 29 of the awards during the Indian Mutiny. Four further awards were granted to Q Battery, Royal Horse Artillery at Korn Spruit on 31 March 1900 during the Second Boer War. The final ballot awards for the army were the six awards to the Lancashire Fusiliers at W Beach during the landing at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915 although three of the awards were not gazetted until 1917. The final seven ballot awards were the only naval ballot awards with three awards to two <b>Q-Ships</b> in 1917 and four awards for the Zeebrugge Raid in 1918. The provision for awards by ballot is still included in the Victoria Cross warrant but there have been no further such awards since 1918.|$|R
5000|$|Farnborough {{came into}} contact with SM U-68 off Britain's west coast on 22 March 1916. At {{approximately}} 07:00, U-68 fired a torpedo at Farnborough that narrowly missed the ship's bow. Farnborough continued the deception of being a merchant ship and continued at her same speed and course. At 07:20, U-68 surfaced about 1000 yd astern of Farnborough, moved to the ship's port quarter, and fired a shot across the <b>Q-ship's</b> bow. Farnborough stopped, blew off steam, and launched a boat to simulate a surrender. As U-68 closed to 800 yd, Farnborough raised the British White ensign, uncovered her guns and opened fire with three of her five 12-pounder guns. The British gunners scored several hits on the U-boat out of 21 rapidly fired rounds. As U-68 began to sink, Campbell steered Farnborough over U-68s location and dropped a depth charge that blew the bow of the submarine out of the water. This was the first use of the depth charge in action. As U-68 began going down by the stern, Farnboroughs gunners scored another five hits on the U-boat's conning tower. U-68 sank at position [...] off Dingle in southern Ireland, with the loss of her entire crew of 38 men.|$|R
25|$|In April 1916 the Mary B. was requisitioned {{for service}} as a <b>Q-ship.</b> She was armed with a 12-pounder and two 6-pounder guns {{as well as two}} machine guns and small arms.|$|E
25|$|The Mary B Mitchell was a British {{schooner}} {{which served}} as a <b>Q-ship</b> during the First World War. She was in service from April 1916 {{until the end of}} hostilities, operating in the Southwest Approaches from her base in Falmouth.|$|E
25|$|In April 1916 {{she was at}} Falmouth, {{where she}} was requisitioned for service as a <b>Q-ship.</b> She was armed and outfitted, {{under the command of}} Lt. M Armstrong RNR, to carry a 12-pounder and two 6-pounder guns as well as two machine guns and small arms.|$|E
25|$|The Mary B Mitchell {{had a good}} {{reputation}} as a <b>Q-ship</b> following the First World War, being credited with the destruction of two U-boats. This reputation has persisted to this day, although post-war analysis showed neither of the U-boats she engaged had been sunk, and that her achievement had been overestimated.|$|E
25|$|Mary B Mitchell {{was built}} by Paul Rogers in 1892 at Carrickfergus, as a three-masted topsail schooner. She was owned by Lord Penrhyn and served for a period as a yacht, before being put {{to work as a}} coaster. In 1916 she was requisitioned by the Admiralty to be used a <b>Q-ship.</b>|$|E
25|$|Result is a three-masted cargo {{schooner}} {{built in}} Carrickfergus in 1893. She was a working ship until 1967, and served {{for a short}} time in the Royal Navy as a <b>Q-ship</b> during World War I. She currently rests on land at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, and in 1996 was added to the National Register of Historic Vessels.|$|E
25|$|In January 1917 Result was requisitioned by the Royal Navy {{to act as}} a <b>Q-ship</b> {{with the}} pennant number Q23. She was armed with two 12-pounder guns forward and aft of the mainmast, a 6-pounder gun forward, and two fixed 14-inch torpedo tubes aft. The crew of 23 were {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Philip Mack RN, and the second-in-command was Lt. George Muhlhauser RNR.|$|E
25|$|Result had {{no further}} success in {{attracting}} submarines, {{and it was}} not until several months later that the Navy learned that she had been photographed and identified as a decoy by the Germans. In July 1917 the crew of Result were transferred to another <b>Q-ship,</b> and as the Navy could find no other use for her she was returned to her owners in August 1917.|$|E
25|$|In 1934 the Gold Star {{was a bit}} of {{a veteran}} <b>Q-Ship</b> dealing with {{communications}} intelligence as she moved from port to port and while in port. As a station ship she was assigned to monitor 1) Internal Japanese Fleet frequencies 2) Frequencies measurements and DF or direction finder azimuths. She had three intercept operators and one chief radioman supervised by an officer. This all started in 1933 during the reconstruction of the Japanese fleet by Tokyo. The Gold Star along with ground stations in Guam, Olongapo and Beijing provided significant intelligence before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.|$|E

500|$|U-68 {{was laid}} down on 31 December 1913 (yard number 205) by Germaniawerft at Kiel and {{launched}} on 1 June 1915. She was commissioned on 17 August 1915 {{under the command}} of Kapitänleutnant Ludwig Güntzel. Six days into her first war patrol, U-68 encountered the British <b>Q-ship</b> [...] (<b>Q-ship</b> number five) off Dingle and was sunk with all hands. U-68 sank no ships during her brief service career.|$|E
500|$|Seiner Majestät UB-4 was a German Type UB I {{submarine}} (U-boat) in the German Imperial Navy (...) during World War I. She was sunk by a British <b>Q-ship</b> {{disguised as}} a fishing smack in August 1915.|$|E
500|$|His Majesty's or HM Armed Smack Inverlyon was {{a fishing}} smack that was {{converted}} to a <b>Q-ship</b> during the First World War. Q-ships served as decoys to lure German submarines near enough so that concealed weapons could {{be brought to bear}} and sink the submarines. On 15 August 1915, Inverlyon succeeded in luring German submarine [...] within range and sinking her with nine shots from her gun. The Royal Navy [...] in command of the vessel, Ernest Martin Jehan, received the Distinguished Service Cross and members of Inverlyons crew shared the bounty offered for German submarines. After Inverlyons <b>Q-ship</b> career ended, she returned to fishing, but was sunk by [...] on 1 February 1917.|$|E
500|$|His conduct on Helgoland {{resulted}} in a promotion to lieutenant for Sanders, {{and he was also}} recommended for command of his own ship. [...] In February 1917, he was appointed captain of HMS Prize, a three-masted topsail schooner that was sailing under the German flag when it was seized in 1914 and converted to a <b>Q-ship</b> in early 1917. [...] At midnight on 30 April 1917 about 180 miles south of Ireland, in the Atlantic, Prize was attacked by a U-boat, [...] commanded by Edgar von Spiegel von und zu Peckelsheim. The <b>Q-ship</b> was genuinely badly damaged by shellfire from the U-boat's deck guns. [...] Sanders, remaining under cover, moved about the vessel reassuring his men.|$|E
500|$|One method {{devised to}} deal with U-boat attacks was the decoy or <b>Q-ship,</b> {{designed}} to lure submarines that were targeting merchant shipping close enough so that concealed guns or other weapons could sink them. Inverlyon was selected to become a <b>Q-ship,</b> was outfitted with either a 3-pounder (47mm) or a 6-pounder (57mm) gun, and entered {{the service of the}} Royal Navy on 2 August 1915. Inverlyons fishing crew and skipper were all temporarily inducted into the Trawler section of the Royal Naval Reserve. Regular Royal Navy [...] Ernest Martin Jehan and three other gunners from —a former torpedo boat operating as a minesweeper out of Lowestoft—were assigned to Inverlyon, with Jehan in command.|$|E
500|$|Not {{until after}} the war was it learned [...] had sunk Irish Oak. This action, and U-607s report, were not well received. Her Captain, Oberleutnant zur See Wolf Jeschonnek, claimed Irish Oak was a <b>Q-ship</b> with false Irish markings, sailing without lights.|$|E
500|$|UB-4 {{conducted}} the first sortie of the Flanders Flotilla in April, {{during which she}} sank the Belgian Relief ship , the first ship credited to the flotilla. She sank three more ships from mid-April to mid-August. On 15 August, UB-4 surfaced near the British <b>Q-ship</b> [...] and was sunk by gunfire from the sailing vessel. None of UB-4s 14 crewmen survived the attack.|$|E
500|$|For {{his role}} in the sinking of the UC-33, Worsley was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Shackleton sent him a {{telegraph}} congratulating him on his success. [...] Worsley conducted patrols with the PC.61 for several more months. In September 1918, he was given command of HMS Pangloss, a <b>Q-ship</b> operating in the Mediterranean and which was formerly commanded by Commander Gordon Campbell. With the war nearly over, Worsley did not anticipate much excitement in his new posting.|$|E
