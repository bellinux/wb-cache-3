This places a premium on local government organisations having high <b>quality</b> policy <b>advice</b> and decision-making processes in place. High <b>quality</b> policy <b>advice,</b> which supports good regulatory design and implementation and sound investment decisions, is critical to improving performance.

40|$|Using a large data {{sample of}} 69, 539 new {{municipal}} issues covering {{the period from}} 1984 to 2002, we examine whether the <b>quality</b> of <b>advice</b> provided by a financial advisor affects new issue interest costs. We find that more reputable financial advisors are associated with statistically significant decreases in new issue yields. We argue that in the municipal debt market, price certification signals have minimal value to investors and therefore attribute these reputational effects primarily {{to the quality of}} the financial advice provided. We interpret our evidence as supportive of the <b>quality</b> of <b>advice</b> affecting yields rather than yields being affected by a signal about issuer quality. Another measure of the <b>quality</b> of <b>advice</b> is continuing relationships between the financial advisor and the issuer. We find that continuing relationships are also associated with reduced interest costs.

40|$|The {{financial}} planning profession in Malaysia is {{in a curious}} regulatory posture. While the financial services industry {{is one of the}} most highly regulated sectors in the country, the {{financial planning}} profession itself lacks a stand-alone regulatory system. Currently, financial planners are not regulated and the financial planning industry itself is straddling between two regulators – the Securities Commission and Bank Negara. This study found that the lack of a social security system in Malaysia to protect the public from social and economic distress has driven home the urgent need and necessity for prudent financial planning and for individuals to arrange their financial affairs to meet their life goals and objectives. Contributions and savings via the Employees Provident Fund and the Socso are simply not enough to insure a comfortable living after one’s retirement or support to dependents arising from the income earner’s premature death or disability. As Malaysians live longer, they need additional resources to finance the extra years of life after retirement. The financial planning industry in Malaysia is said to be about 20 years behind that of the United States where it started. This study found that if the right regulatory framework is nurtured and the profession itself work on developing what are the core competencies that the financial planner should focus on in order to offer <b>quality</b> <b>advice</b> to the client, and uphold the high ethical standards expected, then this emerging profession in Malaysia can leapfrog the usual stumbling advances and catch up with the other developed countries. The successful financial planner is a qualified professional who has the necessary training, experience and competencies, and is fully committed to deliver <b>quality</b> <b>advice</b> and services to his or her client. Financial planning is a multi-discipline profession and one that can only be practised by qualified professionals as it affects the financial state of affairs of the client...|$|E

Although most relationships are more complicated than predicted based on FCP theory and research, several patterns occur across models and populations.

In addition, perceived family support and <b>advice</b> <b>quality</b> mediate several relationships between FCP and academic self-efficacy, college stress, and loneliness. Differences between the two cultures, theoretical implications for FCP, and practical implications for academic counselors are discussed along with avenues for future research. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} evaluation of a coach that helps students collaborate during synchronous group problem solving. Unlike previous work generally emphasizing dialogue analysis, this work evaluates {{a new approach to}} supporting collaboration that identifies learning opportunities based on differences between problem solutions and on tracking levels of participation. The contribution made by these and other knowledge sources in the generation of collaboration advice was evaluated by comparing, for each event in the collaborative sessions, expert rankings of advice with the software coach's rankings, and by identifying the advice that would be lost if each respective knowledge source were removed. Results show that good <b>quality</b> <b>advice</b> can be obtained through these knowledge sources, although other knowledge sources may fill in gaps relative to the expert's performance. This work demonstrates how intelligent agents can produce reasonable collaboration advice using a few basic knowledge sources, and illustrates several methods of evaluating the knowledge and reasoning of complex knowledge-based systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|This article {{studies the}} use of {{different}} distribution channels {{as an instrument of}} price discrimination in credence goods markets. In credence goods markets, where consumers do not know which quality of the good or service they need, price discrimination proceeds along the dimension of quality of advice offered. High <b>quality</b> <b>advice</b> and appropriate treatment is provided to the most profitable market segment only. Less profitable consumers are induced to demand a treatment without a serious diagnosis. If consumers differ in the probabilities of needing different treatments some consumers are potentially overtreated. By contrast, under heterogeneity in the valuations of a successful intervention some consumers are potentially undertreated. Our results help to explain the casual observation that in the early phase of the IT industry only low quality equipment was distributed via warehouse sellers while today it is quite common to see high quality equipment at discounters.
