40|$|The {{clearance}} {{mechanisms of}} quinapril and <b>quinaprilat</b> were probed using an isolated perfused rat kidney model. Sixty-four experiments were performed with {{drug in the}} absence and presence of classic inhibitors of the organic acid (i. e., probenecid and p-aminohippurate) and organic base (i. e., tetraethylammonium and quinine) transport systems of the proximal tubule. Initial perfusate concentrations of quinapril and <b>quinaprilat</b> were approximately 2. 36 μM (or 1000 ng/ml), and transport inhibitors were coperfused at 100 – 10, 000 times the drugs' initial μM concentrations. Quinapril and <b>quinaprilat</b> concentrations were determined in perfusate, urine, and perfusate ultrafiltrate using a reversed-phase HPLC procedure with radiochemical detection, coupled to liquid scintillation spectrometry. Perfusate protein binding was determined using an ultrafiltration method at 37 °C. Overall, the clearance ratios of quinapril (total renal clearance divided by fu·GFR) and <b>quinaprilat</b> (urinary clearance divided by fu·GFR) were significantly reduced, and in a dose-dependent manner, by the coperfusion of organic acids but not organic bases. The data demonstrate that the organic anionic secretory system is the primary mechanism by which quinapril and <b>quinaprilat</b> are transported into and across renal proximal cells...|$|E
40|$|ACE inhibitors block B(2) {{receptor}} desensitization, thereby potentiating bradykinin beyond blocking its hydrolysis. Angiotensin (Ang) -(1 - 7) also {{acts as an}} ACE inhibitor and, in addition, may stimulate bradykinin release via angiotensin II type 2 receptors. In {{this study}} we compared the bradykinin-potentiating effects of Ang-(1 - 7), <b>quinaprilat,</b> and captopril. Porcine coronary arteries, obtained from 32 pigs, were mounted in organ baths, preconstricted with prostaglandin F(2 alpha), and exposed to <b>quinaprilat,</b> captopril, Ang-(1 - 7), and/or bradykinin. Bradykinin induced complete relaxation (pEC(50) = 8. 11 +/- 0. 07, mean+/-SEM), whereas <b>quinaprilat,</b> captopril, and Ang-(1 - 7) alone were without effect. <b>Quinaprilat</b> shifted the bradykinin curve to the left in a biphasic manner: a 5 -fold shift at concentrations that specifically block the C-domain (0. 1 to 1 nmol/L) and a 10 -fold shift at concentrations that block both domains. Captopril and Ang-(1 - 7) monophasically shifted the bradykinin curve to the left, {{by a factor of}} 10 and 5, respectively. A 5 -fold shift was also observed when Ang-(1 - 7) was combined with 0. 1 nmol/L <b>quinaprilat.</b> Repeated exposure of porcine coronary arteries to 0. 1 micromol/L bradykinin induced B(2) receptor desensitization. The addition of 10 micromol/L <b>quinaprilat</b> or Ang-(1 - 7) to the bath, at a time when bradykinin alone was no longer able to induce relaxation, fully restored the relaxant effects of bradykinin. Angiotensin II type 1 or 2 receptor blockade did not affect any of the observed effects of Ang-(1 - 7). In conclusion, Ang-(1 - 7), like <b>quinaprilat</b> and captopril, potentiates bradykinin by acting as an ACE inhibitor. Bradykinin potentiation is maximal when both the ACE C- and N-terminal domains are inhibited. The inhibitory effects of Ang-(1 - 7) are limited to the ACE C-domain, raising the possibility that Ang-(1 - 7) synergistically increases the blood pressure-lowering effects of N-domain-specific ACE inhibitors...|$|E

Methods: The experiments were performed with an isolated, erythrocyte-perfused, rabbit working-heart model. The hearts excised from 29 adult New Zealand White rabbits (2950 ± 200 g) {{were randomly assigned to}} four groups. Two groups received <b>quinaprilat</b> (1 μg/mL), initiated either with cardioplegia (n = 7) or during reperfusion (n = 7). The third group received l-arginine (2 mmol/L) initiated with cardioplegia (n = 7). Eight hearts served as a control group. Forty minutes of preischemic perfusion were followed by 60 minutes of hypothermic arrest and 40 minutes of reperfusion. Results: All treatments substantially improved postischemic recovery of external heart work (62 % ± 6 %, 69 % ± 3 %, and 64 % ± 5 % in <b>quinaprilat</b> during cardioplegia, <b>quinaprilat</b> during reperfusion, and l-arginine groups, respectively, vs 35 % ± 5 % in control group, P <. 001) with similarly increased external stroke work and cardiac output. When administered during ischemia, <b>quinaprilat</b> significantly improved recovery of coronary flow (70 % ± 8 %, P =. 028 vs <b>quinaprilat</b> during reperfusion [49 % ± 5 %] and P =. 023 vs control [48 % ± 6 %]). l-Arginine (55 % ± 7 %) showed no significant effect. Postischemic myocardial oxygen consumption remained low in treatment groups (4. 6 ± 1. 2 mL · min− 1 · 100 g− 1, 6. 0 ± 2. 2 mL · min− 1 · 100 g− 1, and 4. 7 ± 1. 6 mL · min− 1 · 100 g− 1 in <b>quinaprilat</b> during cardioplegia, <b>quinaprilat</b> during reperfusion, and l-arginine groups, respectively, vs 4. 2 ± 0. 8 mL · min− 1 · 100 g− 1 in control group), even though cardiac work was markedly increased. High-energy phosphates, which were consistently elevated in all treatment groups, showed a significant increase in adenosine triphosphate with <b>quinaprilat</b> during ischemia (2. 24 ± 0. 14 μmol/g vs 1. 81 ± 0. 12 μmol/g in control group, P =. 040). Ultrastructural grading of mitochondrial damage revealed best preservation with <b>quinaprilat</b> during ischemia (100 % [no damage], P =. 001 vs control).

Control studies were performed with drug-free perfusate (n= 8) and perfusate containing quinapril (n= 9) <b>quinaprilat</b> (n= 7) at initial drug concentrations of 1000 ng/ml (including corresponding tracer levels of tritiated drug). Physiologic parameters were within the normal range of values for this technique and were stable {{for the duration of}} each experiment. Quinapril and <b>quinaprilat</b> concentrations were determined in perfusate, urine, and perfusate ultrafiltrate using a specific and sensitive reversed-phase HPLC procedure with radiochemical detection, coupled to liquid scintillation spectrometry.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the effects of acute angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition on myocardial blood flow (MBF) in control and ischemic regions. BACKGROUND: Although animal studies indicate an improvement of MBF to ischemic regions after ACE inhibition, this effect has not been conclusively demonstrated in patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS: Myocardial blood flow was analyzed in ischemic and nonischemic regions of 10 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease using repetitive [15 O] water positron emission tomography at rest and during maximal dobutamine stress before and after ACE inhibition with <b>quinaprilat</b> 10 mg IV. To exclude the possibility that repetitive ischemia may cause an increase in MBF, eight patients underwent the same protocol without <b>quinaprilat</b> (placebo patients). RESULTS: Rate pressure product in control and <b>quinaprilat</b> patients was comparable. In placebo patients, repetitive dobutamine stress did not change MBF to ischemic regions (1. 41 ± 0. 17 during the first stress vs. 1. 39 ± 0. 19 ml/min/g during the second stress, p = 0. 93). In contrast, MBF in ischemic regions increased significantly after acute ACE inhibition with <b>quinaprilat</b> during repetitive dobutamine stress (1. 10 ± 0. 13 vs. 1. 69 ± 0. 17 ml/min/g, p < 0. 015). Dobutamine coronary reserve in ischemic regions remained unchanged in placebo patients (1. 07 ± 0. 11 vs. 1. 10 ± 0. 16, p = 0. 92), but increased significantly after <b>quinaprilat</b> (0. 97 ± 0. 10 vs. 1. 44 ± 0. 14, p < 0. 002).

40|$|International audienceQuinapril and <b>quinaprilat</b> are two angiotensin-converting {{enzyme inhibitors}} (ACEIs) {{characterized}} by a peak broadening and splitting when they were analyzed by ultra-performance liq. chromatog. (UPLC). This phenomenon {{is due to the}} existence of the two isomers cis and trans around the amide band. In order to confirm the existence of the two conformers and allow identification of the predominant form, NMR studies of quinapril, involving 1 H, 13 C, 1 H- 1 HCOSY, Impact-HMBC, JMOD, HSQC, and ROESY have been conducted in this work. The analyses allowed us to identify the predominant form of quinapril; the conformer trans is the predominant form (75 %). In addn., this study highlights the important benefits of UPLC to sep. quinapril and <b>quinaprilat</b> isomers due to its high resolving power. The effect of various operating conditions on the retention peak, namely, splitting and band broadening of <b>quinaprilat</b> and quinapril, has been qual. examd. in this study. Several practical exptl. conditions have been tested, allowing both the elution of the two ACEIs as single peaks, while keeping at the same time an acceptable sepn. The effect of various factors on the conformational s-cis-s-trans equil. of quinapril and <b>quinaprilat,</b> namely, the compn. of the mobile phase, column temp., flow rate, pH, and type and amt. of org. modifier was investigated by UPLC-DAD (diode array detector) with a BEH C 18 column (100 mm, 2. 1 mm internal diam. × 1. 7 μm particle diam.).

40|$|NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors {{partially}} block bradykinin (BK) -mediated vasorelaxation. Here {{we investigated}} {{whether this is}} due to incomplete NOS inhibition and/or NO release from storage sites. We also studied the mechanism behind ACE inhibitor-mediated BK potentiation. Porcine coronary arteries (PCAs) were mounted in organ baths, preconstricted, and exposed to BK or the ACE-resistant BK analogue Hyp 3 -Tyr(Me) 8 -BK (HT-BK) with or without the NOS inhibitor L-NAME (100 [*]μM), the NO scavenger hydroxocobalamin (200 [*]μM), the Ca 2 +-dependent K+-channel blockers charybdotoxin+apamin (both 100 [*]nM), or the ACE inhibitor <b>quinaprilat</b> (10 [*]μM).

Complete blockade was obtained with hydroxocobalamin or L-NAME+ charybdotoxin+apamin. Repeated exposure to 100 [*]nM BK or HT-BK, to deplete NO storage sites, produced progressively smaller vasorelaxant responses. With L-NAME, the decrease in response occurred much more rapidly. L-Arginine (10 [*]mM) reversed the effect of L-NAME.

Thirty patients with poor left ventricular function (EF< 30 %) following CABG surgery with use of cardiopulmonaly bypass were examined. Fourty patients were control group. All patients had complete invasive hemodynamic monitoring. The ACE-inhibitor <b>quinaprilat</b> 0. 5 mg/h was administered intravenously via infusion pump. The following parameters were analyzed: arterial blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, pulmonary vascular resistance, heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac index, left ventricular stroke work index and the level of mixed venous oxygen saturation. Results. The results of our study were as follows: Cardiac output, cardiac index and left ventricular stroke work index were significantly increased in comparison to the control group.

The response to angiotensin I could be significantly inhibited (P< 0. 05) by incubation with the AT 1 receptor antagonist losartan (1 [*]μM). Prior incubation of segments of SV with either captopril (1 [*]μM) (n= 6), <b>quinaprilat</b> (1 [*]μM) (n= 7), or the chymase inhibitor soya bean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) (10 [*]μM) (n= 7) singularly failed to have any inhibitory effect on the response to angiotensin I. However when vessel segments (n= 7) were co-incubated with <b>quinaprilat</b> (1 [*]μM) and SBTI (10 [*]μM), the SV exhibited a rightward shift in curve profile to angiotensin I and a markedly reduced maximum response 12. 5 ± 2. 4 [*]mN, when compared to control (30. 4 ± 7. 6 [*]mN), <b>quinaprilat</b> (24. 5 ± 9. 4 [*]mN), and SBTI (31. 6 ± 10. 7 [*]mN) on their own.

40|$|The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) has two natural {{substrates}} and two catalytic domains: one cleaving angiotensin I and one inactivating bradykinin. The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate the comparative binding affinity of ACE inhibitors for the two binding sites of human endothelial ACE. In vitro binding assays were performed to test the ability of bradykinin, angiotensin I, or various ACE inhibitors (enalaprilat, perindoprilat, <b>quinaprilat,</b> ramiprilat, and trandolaprilat) to displace a saturating concentration of [(125) I] 351 A, a radiolabeled lisinopril analogue, from ACE binding sites. The calculated IC(50) values for the ACE inhibitors were in the nanomolar range, while those for the natural substrates were in the micromolar range.

The ACE inhibitors generally had higher affinity for the bradykinin than the angiotensin I binding sites, supporting the idea that these agents are primarily inhibitors of bradykinin degradation, and secondarily inhibitors of angiotensin II production. Perindoprilat had the highest selectivity for bradykinin versus angiotensin I binding sites, and enalaprilat has the lowest.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism-related {{differences}} in ACE concentration do {{not result in}} {{differences in}} angiotensin levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate whether this relates to differences in {{the contribution of the}} ACE C-domain and N-domain, we quantified, using the C-domain-selective inhibitors <b>quinaprilat</b> and RXPA 380, and the N-domain-selective inhibitor RXP 407, the contribution of both domains to the metabolism of angiotensin I, bradykinin, the C-domain-selective substrate Mca-BK(1 - 8), and the N-domain-selective substrate Mca-Ala in serum of IIs, DDs, and 'hyperACE' subjects (i. e., subjects with increased ACE due to enhanced shedding). During incubation with angiotensin I, the highest angiotensin II levels were observed in sera with the highest ACE activity. This confirms that ACE is rate-limiting with regard to angiotensin II generation. C-domain-selective concentrations of <b>quinaprilat</b> fully blocked angiotensin I-II conversion in DDs, whereas additional N-domain blockade was required to fully block conversion in IIs. Both domains contributed to bradykinin hydrolysis in all subjects, and the inhibition profile of RXP 407 when using Mca-Ala was identical in IIs and DDs. In contrast, the RXPA 380 concentrations required to block C-domain activity when using Mca-BK (1 - 8) were three-fold higher in IIs than DDs. CONCLUSION: The contributions of the C-domain and N-domain differ between DDs and IIs, and RXPA 380 is the first inhibitor capable of distinguishing D-allele ACE from I-allele ACE. The lack of angiotensin II accumulation in DDs in vivo is not because of the often quoted concept that ACE is a nonrate-limiting enzyme. It may relate to the fact that in IIs both the N-domain and C- domain generate angiotensin II, whereas in DDs only the C-domain converts angiotensin I...|$|E

Dosage-dependent effects of quinapril on systolic blood pressure and the glomerular filtration rate were observed. In contrast, control of Palb in isolated glomeruli exposed to oncotic gradients, proteinuria, and glomerular and tubular hypertrophy was obtained with subhypotensive dosages (DQ 3 and DQ 4 groups) of the ACE inhibitor. In the in vitro study, <b>quinaprilat</b> reduced Palb significantly in concentration ranges from 106 to 1014 mol/l compared with results in control glomeruli. The effect on Palb may have occurred by mechanisms different from kidney ACE inhibitor. These study results indicated that ACE inhibitor treatment prevents the early onset of the Palb defect in experimental diabetes. This effect seemed to occur independently of systemic or glomerular hemodynamic changes and, at least partially, from kidney ACE inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Background. The {{putative}} circulating factor {{responsible for}} the glomerular permeability alterations induced in vitro by serum from patients affected by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) remains unidentified. Wehave observed that a serine proteinase isolated from patient serum increases albumin permeability in isolated glomeruli. The objective {{of the present study}} was to determine the effect of various proteinase inhibitors on glomerular albumin permeability (Palb) in isolated glomeruli incubated with FSGS serum. Methods. The study population consisted of 12 FSGS patients (eight males; mean age: 21 ± 10 years) previously shown to have elevated serum albumin permeability activity. Palb was determined by measuring the change in glomerular volume induced by applying oncotic gradients to isolated healthy rat glomeruli treated with patient serum in comparison to control serum. Solutions of seven different proteinase inhibitors (0. 5 mg/ml) were added to the incubation media with the sera (1 : 1 vol/vol) : serine proteinase inhibitors (PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, gabexate mesylate), the cysteine proteinase inhibitor E- 64, the metalloproteinase inhibitor EDTA and the aspartate proteinase inhibitor pepstatin. Sera from the same patients were also tested with the addition to the incubation media of <b>quinaprilat,</b> an inhibitor of the metalloproteinase angiotensin-converting enzyme. Results. Mean Palb of the sera was 0. 86 ± 0. 11, with the addition of PMSF 0. 41 ± 0. 09, leupeptin 0. 30 ± 0. 17, aprotinin 0. 09 ± 0. 14, gabexate mesylate 0. 27 ± 0. 25, E- 64 0. 81 ± 0. 09, EDTA 0. 68 ± 0. 10 or pepstatin 0. 76 ± 0. 11. The mean Palb of the sera combined with <b>quinaprilat</b> was reduced to 0. 34 ± 0. 35. Thus, only the serine proteinase inhibitors consistently blocked the increased Palb induced by the FSGS sera. Conclusions. In the cascade of events that lead to the initiation of glomerular fibrosis in FSGS, the putative glomerular permeability factor associated with FSGS may require a serine proteinase to effect its activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{angiotensin}} I (AI) metabolite, A(1 - 7), elicited a concentration-dependent dilator response (ED 50 > or = 2 microM) in porcine {{coronary artery}} rings which was markedly attenuated by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine, and abolished after {{removal of the}} endothelium. This effect of the heptapeptide was not mimicked by AII, AIII or A(3 - 8) at comparable concentrations. The A(1 - 7) -induced relaxation was not affected by AT 1 or AT 2 receptor blockade or cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, but was attenuated by the B 2 receptor antagonist, Hoe 140, and augmented by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, <b>quinaprilat.</b> These {{findings suggest that the}} relaxation to A(1 - 7) was mediated by the release of NO from the coronary endothelium through activation of an, as yet unidentified, AT receptor, the occupation of which also seems to stimulate the release of vasoactive kinins. Since A(1 - 7) accumulates during ACE inhibition, this mechanism may contribute to the coronary dilator effect of ACE inhibitors in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Clinical studies {{indicate}} that the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor quinapril is an effective antihypertensive agent when administered once daily. At {{the end of a}} 4 -week, double-blind crossover trial comparing quinapril and placebo, patients were admitted for a hemodynamic profile study 12 hours after taking the previous dose. A final 20 mg dose of quinapril had no additional effect on blood pressure. This is interesting inasmuch as the plasma half-life of the active metabolite <b>quinaprilat</b> is approximately 2 hours and the effective accumulation half-life is approximately 3 hours. The blood pressure reduction in patients with mild hypertension receiving long-term quinapril therapy may be more closely related to prolonged angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or to an effect on tissue angiotensin II concentration than to the plasma half-life. This may be the case particularly for cardiac output and renal circulation, because quinapril lowers total vascular resistance without increasing cardiac output or disturbing autoregulation of renal blood flow. Reduced ventricular wall stress, improved diastolic function, and lower renal perfusion pressure may spare cardiac function and glomeruli from hypertensive vascular damage...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of plasma and tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) against propofol-induced endothelial dysfunction and to elucidate the involved mechanisms in vitro. Materials and methods: We examined the effects of propofol (50 μM), <b>quinaprilat</b> and enalaprilat (10 − 5 M) on fibrinolysis (t-PA, PAI- 1, TAFI antigen levels), oxidative stress parameters (H 2 O 2 and MDA antigen levels and SOD and NADPH oxidase mRNA levels) and nitric oxide bioavailability (NO 2 /NO 3 concentration and NOS expression at the level of mRNA) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Results: We found that both ACE-Is promoted similar endothelial fibrinolytic properties and decreased oxidative stress in vitro. Propofol alone increased the release of antifibrinolytic and pro-oxidative factors from the endothelium and increased mRNA iNOS expression. We also found that the incubation of HUVECs in the presence of propofol following ACE-Is pre-incubation caused weakness of the antifibrinolytic and pro-oxidative potential of propofol and this effect was similar after both ACE-Is. Conclusions: This observation suggests that the studied ACE-Is exerted protective effects against endothelial cell dysfunction caused by propofol, independently of hemodynamics...|$|E
40|$|Binding {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Ins) have high chemical affinity for binding sites of human somatic ACE (hsACE). The enzyme has 2 natural substrates and catalytic domains: one cleaving angiotensin-I (Ang-I) and the other inactivating bradykinin 1 - 9 (Bk). AIM: To test binding selectivity of various ACE-Ins - namely Enalaprilat (E), Perindoprilat (P), <b>Quinaprilat</b> (Q), Ramiprilat (R), Trandolaprilat (T) – for specific Ang-I and Bk binding sites of hsACE. Single displacement binding assays showed the following IC 50 for ACE-Ins and hsACE natural substrates: Q: 0. 35 nM, T: 0. 57 nM, R: 0. 76 nM, P: 1. 05 nM, E: 1. 94 nM, Ang-I: 2. 65 microM and Bk: 1. 31 microM. The order of binding affinity of ACE-Ins to hsACE is: Q>T>R>P>E; (2) All ACE-Ins have a higher affinity for Bk respect to Ang-I binding sites, the order of binding affinity being E>Q>T>R>P for Ang-I and Q>E>T>R>P for Bk binding sites, respectively; (3) P is the ACE-In with the highest selectivity for Bk versus Ang-I binding sites, (the order of Bk/Ang-I selectivity being P>R>Q>T>E). These results {{support the hypothesis that}} affinity differences of ACE-Ins towards sites for Bk degradation exist and may constitute the biochemical grounds in explaining differences obtained in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease...|$|E
40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that inhibition of tissue {{angiotensin converting enzyme}} (ACE) {{is important for the}} pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of ACE inhibitors. Radioligand inhibitor binding methods using 125 I- 351 A and either tissue homogenates or in vitro autoradiography have allowed in vitro and ex vivo quantitation of tissue ACE inhibition by a variety of ACE inhibitors. The rank order of potency against plasma as well as lung, kidney, and cardiac homogenates was <b>quinaprilat</b> = benazeprilat greater than perindoprilat greater than lisinopril greater than enalaprilat greater than fosinoprilat. The highest concentration of ACE in the heart was found in the cardiac valves followed by the right and left atria, then the right and left ventricles. Ex vivo studies showed that after oral administration of quinapril, ACE was inhibited dose-dependently in the lung, kidney, aorta and heart for more than 24 h. Tissue bioavailability of the inhibitor is also an important determinant of tissue ACE inhibition. Perindopril crossed the blood-brain barrier and inhibited brain ACE at high doses, but after equivalent doses of quinapril no brain ACE inhibition could be demonstrated. These results suggest that {{it may be possible to}} design ACE inhibitors to have specific effects on ACE in different tissues...|$|E
40|$|Studies in {{isolated}} cells overexpressing ACE and bradykinin type 2 (B 2) receptors suggest that ACE inhibitors potentiate bradykinin by inhibiting B 2 receptor desensitization, via a mechanism involving protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatases. Here we investigated, in intact porcine coronary arteries, endothelial ACE/B 2 receptor ‘crosstalk' {{as well as}} bradykinin potentiation through neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibition. NEP inhibition with phosphoramidon {{did not affect the}} bradykinin concentration-response curve (CRC), nor did combined NEP/ACE inhibition with omapatrilat exert a further leftward shift on top of the ≈ 10 fold leftward shift of the bradykinin CRC observed with ACE inhibition alone. In arteries that, following repeated exposure to 0. 1 μM bradykinin, no longer responded to bradykinin (‘desensitized' arteries), the ACE inhibitors <b>quinaprilat</b> and angiotensin-(1 - 7) both induced complete relaxation, without affecting the organ bath fluid levels of bradykinin. This phenomenon was unaffected by inhibition of PKC or phosphatases (with calphostin C and okadaic acid, respectively). When using bradykinin analogues that were either completely or largely ACE-resistant ([Phe 8 Ψ(CH 2 -NH) Arg 9]-bradykinin and [ΔPhe 5]-bradykinin, respectively), the ACE inhibitor-induced shift of the bradykinin CRC was absent, and its ability to reverse desensitization was absent or significantly reduced, respectively. Caveolar disruption with filipin did not affect the quinaprilat-induced effects. Filipin did however reduce the bradykinin-induced relaxation by ≈ 25 – 30 %, thereby confirming that B 2 receptor-endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) interaction occurs in caveolae. In conclusion, in porcine arteries, in contrast to transfected cells, bradykinin potentiation by ACE inhibitors is a metabolic process, that can only be explained on the basis of ACE-B 2 receptor co-localization on the endothelial cell membrane. NEP does not appear to affect the bradykinin levels in close proximity to B 2 receptors, and the ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin potentiation precedes B 2 receptor coupling to eNOS in caveolae...|$|E
40|$|Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors exert their {{cardiovascular}} effects {{not only}} by preventing the formation of angiotensin II (AII), but also by promoting the accumulation of bradykinin in or at the vessel wall. In addition, certain ACE inhibitors {{have been shown to}} augment the vasodilator response to bradykinin, presumably by an interaction {{at the level of the}} B 2 receptor. We have investigated whether this is a specific effect of the ACE inhibitor class of compounds in isolated endothelium-denuded segments of the rabbit jugular vein where bradykinin elicits a constrictor response which is exclusively mediated by activation of the B 2 receptor. Moexiprilat and ramiprilat (⩽ 3 [*]nM) enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin three to four fold. Captopril and enalaprilat were less active by approximately one and <b>quinaprilat</b> by two orders of magnitude. Moexiprilat and ramiprilat, on the other hand, had no effect on the constrictor response to AII or the dilator response to acetylcholine. The bradykinin-potentiating effect of the ACE inhibitors was not mimicked by inhibitors of amino-, carboxy-, metallo- or serine peptidases or the synthetic ACE substrate, hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine, at a concentration which almost abolished the residual ACE activity in the vessel wall. In contrast, angiotensin-(1 – 7) (10 [*]μM), an angiotensin I metabolite, significantly enhanced the constrictor response to bradykinin. Ramiprilat did not alter the binding of [3 H]-bradykinin to a membrane fraction prepared from endothelium-denuded rabbit jugular veins or to cultured fibroblasts, and there was no ACE inhibitor-sensitive, bradykinin-induced cleavage of the B 2 receptor in cultured endothelial cells. These findings demonstrate that ACE inhibitors selectively potentiate the B 2 receptor-mediated vascular effects of bradykinin. Their relative efficacy appears to be independent of their ACE-inhibiting properties and might be related to differences in molecule structure. Moreover, the potentiation of the biological activity of bradykinin by this class of compounds does not seem to be mediated by a shift in affinity of the B 2 receptor or a prevention of its desensitization, but may involve an increase in the intrinsic activity of unoccupied B 2 receptor molecules...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Inbred LEW/N and F 344 /N rats respectively, are {{susceptible}} and relatively resistant {{to a broad}} range of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. We recently identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 10 that protects the F 344 /N rat from carrageenan-induced exudation in a dominant fashion. Angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) is one of the candidate genes located in this QTL region that {{plays an important role in}} inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted from both LEW/N and F 344 /N rat strains and used to produce full length cDNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both strands of the PCR products were entirely sequenced to determine nucleotide differences between strains. ACE activity was measured using the synthetic substrate 3 H-hippuryl-glycylglycine. ACE protein levels were determined by Western blot using a specific ACE antibody. ACE kinetic and inhibition studies were performed using specific substrates (Hip-His-Leu and Acetyl-Seryl-Aspartyl-Acetyl-Lysyl-Proline) and inhibitors (lisinopril, captopril and <b>quinaprilat)</b> for each C- and N-terminal active site. Finally, the dose-effects of lisinopril treatment on carrageenen-induced exudate volume and ACE activity was studied. RESULTS: In this study, we report for the first time a missense mutation in the coding region of ACE cDNA at 5 ' 1021 from C to T, resulting in a Leu- 341 to Phe substitution, close to the N-domain active site in the F 344 /N rats. Full characterization of soluble and tissue ACE in both LEW/N and F 344 /N rat strains showed that soluble ACE levels in serum and exudate were 1. 5 fold higher in the F 344 /N rats than those in LEW/N rats. In addition, the soluble ACE level was inversely correlated with the exudate volume. However, the specific ACE activity and its catalytic properties were identical in both strains. Furthermore, the chronic inhibition of serum and exudate ACE levels by lisinopril treatment did not affect the exudate volume in F 344 /N rats, indicating that several factors besides ACE were involved in the control of carrageenan-induced exudation. CONCLUSIONS: This report describes a complete molecular, biochemical, enzymatic and pharmacologic study of a missense mutation in the ACE cDNA in F 344 /N rats, that taken together, excludes ACE as a candidate gene involved with resistance to carrageenan-induced exudation in F 344 /N rats...|$|E
