5000|$|Metal {{quenching}} is {{a transient}} heat transfer process {{in terms of}} the Time Temperature Transformation (TTT). It is possible to manipulate the cooling process to adjust the phase of a suitable material. For example, appropriate quenching of steel can convert a desirable proportion of its content of austenite to martensite, creating a very tough product. To achieve this, it is necessary to quench at the [...] "nose" [...] (or eutectic) of the TTT diagram. Since materials differ in their Biot numbers, the time it takes for the material to quench, or the Fourier number, varies in practice. In steel, the <b>quenching</b> <b>temperature</b> range is generally from 600 °C to 200 °C. To control the quenching time and to select suitable quenching media, it is necessary to determine the Fourier number from the desired quenching time, the relative temperature drop, and the relevant Biot number. Usually, the correct figures are read from a standard nomogram. By calculating the heat transfer coefficient from this Biot number, one can find a liquid medium suitable for the application.|$|E

Thus, the temperature and pressure of the vapor plumes change along isentropic paths, whose entropies are determined by laser ablation.
