5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} Gospel of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was the fulfillment of messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E
5|$|In the Life of Tacitus, {{the emperor}} is {{acclaimed}} by the Senate, {{meeting in the}} Curia Pompiliana, which never existed.

Private letters commending Tacitus are <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom are assumed to be fictitious. Most of the 'Maecii' and 'Gallicani' in the History are believed to be inventions of the author.|$|E

5|$|When the General Assembly {{convened in}} June 1564, an {{argument}} broke out between Knox and Maitland over {{the authority of}} the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> Martin Luther and John Calvin about obedience to earthly rulers. Knox retorted that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.|$|E
5|$|A repeat {{performance}} of BWV243a may have accompanied the first performance of BWV10 on 2July 1724. The libretto of the cantata performed in Leipzig at {{the feast of}} the Visitation of 1725 survives. Maria Aurora von Königsmarck is the possible author of this Magnificat paraphrase. Around a decade before the libretto was reprinted in Leipzig it had already been set by Reinhard Keiser and Johann Mattheson. It is not known whether Bach set the libretto, neither which setting of the libretto was used for the 1725 Visitation feast in Leipzig. A year later Bach performed Der Herr wird ein Neues im Lande, JLB13, a Visitation cantata by his second cousin Johann Ludwig Bach. Picander's libretto for the Visitation cantata of 1728 may have been set as part of Bach's fourth cantata cycle: the libretto, surviving without music, starts with a dictum <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> Luther's German translation of Luke1:46–47.|$|E
5|$|Dana's {{work was}} {{followed}} up by geologist C. E. Dutton's 1884 expedition, who refined and expanded Dana's ideas. Most notably, Dutton {{established that the}} island of Hawaii actually harbored five volcanoes, whereas Dana counted three. This is because Dana had originally regarded Kīlauea as a flank vent of Mauna Loa, and Kohala as part of Mauna Kea. Dutton also refined others of Dana's observations, and is credited with the naming of 'a'ā and pāhoehoe-type lavas, although Dana had noted a distinction. Stimulated by Dutton's expedition, Dana returned in 1887, and published many accounts of his expedition in the American Journal of Science. In 1890 he published the most detailed manuscript of its day, and remained the definitive guide to Hawaiian volcanism for decades. 1909 saw the publication of two large volumes which extensively <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> earlier works now out of circulation.|$|E

5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern with the {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of the sort already <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he would almost certainly have <b>quoted</b> <b>from</b> it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
