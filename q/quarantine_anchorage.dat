50|$|PGM-3 {{remained}} at Buckner Bay until 25 September, when it departed for Hagushi, Okinawa, arriving there the same day. The following day PGM-3 took on fuel {{and water in}} preparation for a trip to Shanghai, China. On 28 September at 1256 hours the PGM-3 departed Hagushi in company of LCI Group 65 bound for Shanghai, China, in accordance with orders from Commander LCI Flotilla Fifteen. Two days later PGM-3 anchored in 22 fathoms of water {{at the entrance to the}} Yangtze River. An hour and a half later the ship proceeded to a <b>quarantine</b> <b>anchorage</b> in the river. The next day the ship moved to an anchorage midstream on the Yangtze off Blockhouse Island and was also moored at times to SS Claus Spreckles and USS Robinson. On 3 October, PGM-3 made its way to Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Pootung Wharf, Huangpu River, Shanghai, where it moored port side to PGM-5. The PGM-3 remained in Shanghai until 5 November, moving between various moorings, going into dry dock on 25 October, and leaving dry dock on 2 November.
