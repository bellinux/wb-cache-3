The quality factor (Q) of the photonic modes in the re-grown PCMs strongly depends on the relative orientation between photonic lattice and crystallographic directions. The optical modes of the re-grown PCMs preserve the linear polarization and, for the most favorable orientation, a 36 % of the Q measured in PCMs fabricated by the conventional procedure is observed, exhibiting values up to ∼ 6000.

A feasible relay device design is proposed that can work in conjunction with various sources, be highly tunable over a reasonably large bandwidth and operate with negligible switching delays. This is achieved {{with the help of the}} Transition Metal Dichalcogenide MoSe 2 WSe 2 heterojunction and a modulating chirped strain/acoustic wave is applied to control the operating frequency and other operational characteristics of the device. The chirping of strain wave is meant to control the exciton transport across the device. The switching delay is proposed to reduce by exploiting the exciton dynamics so that the carrier non-equilibrium is never disturbed and therefore no delay occurs while switching on or off. MoSe 2 WSe 2 heterojunction is chosen because of their binding energy nearly two orders greater than GaAs quantum wells because of which they demonstrate high exciton response which is electrically tunable even at room temperature.
