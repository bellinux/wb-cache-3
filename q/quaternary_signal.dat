The need for spectral efficiency has motivated consideration of of non-binary signalling with Ungerboeck [2, 3] codes or the Pragmatic standard recently proposed by Viterbi [4], in place of <b>quaternary</b> <b>signalling</b> with rate 1 / 2 coding.

Simulation {{results are}} {{presented}} for the error rate performance of the recursive digital MAP detector for known M-ary signals in multiplicative and additive Gaussian noise. The structure of the digital simulation of the innovative receiver, operating in a multipath environment, is generally described. Specific results are given for a <b>quaternary</b> <b>signal,</b> of the type used in air-ground data links, with 2500 symbol per second transmission rate. Plots of detection error rate versus additive {{signal to noise ratio}} are given, with multipath interference strength as a parameter. For comparison, the error rates of conventional coherent and noncoherent digital MAP detectors are simultaneously simulated and graphed. It is shown that with non-zero multiplicative noise, the error rates of the conventional detectors saturate at an irreducible level as additive signal to noise ratio increases. The error rate for the innovative detector continues to decrease rapidly with increasing additive signal to noise ratio. In the absence of multiplicative interference, the conventional coherent detector and the innovative detector are shown to exhibit identical performance...|$|E
40|$|Quantum {{receiver}} is {{an important}} tool for overcoming the standard quantum limit (SQL) of discrimination errors in optical communication. We theoretically study the quantum receivers for discriminating ternary and quaternary phase shift keyed coherent states in terms of average error rate and mutual information. Our receiver consists of on/off-type photon detectors and displacement operations w/o electrical feedforward operations. We show that for the ternary signals, the receiver shows a reasonable gain from the SQL even without feedforward. This scheme is realizable with the currently available technology. For the <b>quaternary</b> <b>signals</b> feedforward operation is crucial to overcome the SQL with imperfect devices. We also analytically examine the asymptotic limit {{of the performance of}} the proposed receiver with respect to the number of feedforward steps...|$|R

However, there is limited understanding of both the patterns and timing of population fluctuations in foundation trees and how they vary among geographical regions. We have reconstructed the demographic history of five genetically distinct populations of the Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus ssp. globulus) at the species and regional levels, using three nuclear loci sequenced from 104 individuals. Analysis using a Bayesian skyline plot indicated that the species experienced two periods of expansion, commencing in the Pliocene. Regional analyses showed that island populations expanded earlier, but {{that the rate of}} expansion was relatively slow when compared to that of the mainland group. This highlights the need for local demographic history {{to be taken into account}} when inferring local adaptation for candidate genes.

40|$|Abstract—A system {{involving}} the multisymbol noncoherent reception of coded continuous-phase frequency-shift keying is developed, optimized, and analyzed. Unlike coherent systems, the modulation {{index of the}} waveform {{does not need to}} be rational with a small denominator, and the oscillator only needs to be stable for the duration of a small block of symbols. The achievable performance over AWGN and Rayleigh blockfading channels is determined by computing the average mutual information, which is the capacity of a channel using the given modulation format and receiver architecture under the constraint of uniformly distributed input symbols. The code rate and modulation index are jointly optimized with respect to average mutual information under a bandwidth constraint. For binary and <b>quaternary</b> <b>signaling,</b> the information-theoretic results are corroborated by bit-error-rate curves generated using a standardized turbo code in conjunction with iterative demodulation and decoding. It is shown that, while more robust than a system with coherent reception, the proposed system offers superior energy efficiency compared with conventional singlesymbol noncoherent reception.

40|$|Early {{events in}} the {{biosynthesis}} of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR) have been studied, using a cell-free protein synthesizing system supplemented with canine pancreas microsomal membranes. Using subunit-specific antisera, it has been demonstrated that each AChR subunit is translated from a separate mRNA, and is integrated into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane by a process that results in a transmembrane orientation for each polypeptide. The in vitro synthesized subunits are glycosylated, but are apparently not assembled into a functional <b>quaternary</b> complex. Purified <b>signal</b> recognition protein (SRP), previously shown to be obligatory for the translocation of nascent secretory proteins across the microsomal membrane, was shown to be required as well for the integration of AChR subunits into the lipid bilayer.

For the uncoded signal detection case the obtained numerical and simulation results illustrate the BER performance degradation {{due to the}} imperfect reference signal recovery, receiver unbalancing and fading. It is demonstrated that imperfect cophasing causes an irreducible BER performance. Furthermore, we design large girth quasi-cyclic LDPC code with high code rate, suitable for use in communications over generalized fading channels. The pro-posed LDPC code does not exhibit the error floor phenomena, {{in the region of}} interest, even in the presence of imperfect cophasing and receiver unbalances, and outperforms standard convolutional code of lower code rate in the observed impairments. The effects of num-ber of iterations in decoding algorithm and codeword length on BER performance are also investigated. A part of this paper was presented at IEEE WCNC 2009...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The thesis describes various detection processes which are suitable {{for use in a}} synchronous serial data-transmission system operating at a transmission rate of up to 20, 000 bits per second over a slowly time-varying channel, The methods of operation of different detection processes are first described, with reference to binary and <b>quaternary</b> baseband <b>signals,</b> which includes the case when V,S,B,signals are transmitted over ·telephone circuits or H,F,radio links. The results of computer simulation tests are presented, comparing the tolerances of the detection processes to additive white Gaussian noise with the tolerances of conventional linear and non-linear equalisers. Several different time invariant channels are used in the tests. It is shown that two relatively simple detection processes can achieve a considerable improvement in tolerance to noise over both linear and non-linear equalisers of optimum design, Several of the most promising detection processes and a few new detection processes are then modified to use 4 -point, 16 -point and 32 -point Q,A,M,signals. The methods of operation of the different detection processes are then described for the signal format being considered. The results of computer simulation tests are presented comparing their tolerances to additive white Gaussian noise with those · of the linear and non-linear equalisers of optimum design. It is shown that these detection processes operate most efficiently, in terms of tolerance to noise and in the number of sequential operations, if the transmitted signal contains the smallest number of possible signal levels. Finally, several simple methods of estimating the sampled impulse response of the channel are presented. One of these channel estimation techniques gives a very low error in the estimated response, while giving a good rate of adaptation to a time-varying channel...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a carrier recovery loop for the coherent demodulation of a digital satellite modem for mobile systems. The loop is data aided, employing decision feedback. The modem transmits a band-limited differentially encoded <b>quaternary</b> phase-shift-keyed (DEQPSK) <b>signal</b> over a satellite link. Several different earth stations {{are assumed to}} have simultaneous access to a given transponder, in an arrangement of frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). Thus the DEQPSK signals that occupy the immediately adjacent frequency bands can introduce adjacent-channel interference (ACI) into the transmitted DEQPSK signal. The high-power amplifier (HPA) at the earth station transmitter introduces AM-AM and AM-PM conversion effects into the DEQPSK signal, but the satellite transponder is linear. A baseband predistorter operates on the baseband signals at the input to the modulator and assumes a prior knowledge of the HPA characteristics. A carrier-recovery loop is used at the receiver to generate the in-phase and quadrature reference carriers employed by the coherent demodulator. The performance {{of the system is}} studied by computer simulation, over a range of different conditions and with different arrangements of the modem, and the results are used to determine the preferred modem design. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) transduce many {{important}} physiological signals and are targets {{for a large}} fraction of therapeutic drugs. Members of the largest family of GPCRs (family A) are thought to self-associate as dimers and higher-order oligomers, although the significance of such <b>quaternary</b> struc-tures for <b>signaling</b> or receptor trafficking is known {{for only a few}} examples. One outstanding question is the physical stability of family A oligomers in cell membranes. Stable oligomers would be expected to move through cellular compartments and membrane domains as intact groups of protomers. Here, we test this pre-diction by recruiting subsets of affinity-tagged family A protomers into artificial microdomains on the surface of living cells and asking if untagged protomers move into these domains (are corecruited) at the same time. We find that tagged b 2 adrenergic and m-opioid protomers are unable to corecruit untagged pro-tomers into microdomains. In contrast, tagged metabotropic glu-tamate receptor protomers do corecruit untagged protomers into such microdomains, which is consistent with the known covalent mechanism whereby these family C receptors dimerize. These observations suggest that interactions between these family A protomers are too weak to directly influence subcellular location, and that mechanisms that move these receptors between subcellular compartments and domains must operate on indi-vidual protomers...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of modern integration technologies is normally {{driven by the}} needs of digital CMOS circuit design. Rapid progress in silicon VLSI technologies {{has made it possible}} to implement multi-function and high performance electronic circuits on a single die. Coupled with this, the need for interfacing digital blocks to the external world resulted in the integration of analog blocks such as A/D and D/A converters, ﬁlters and oscillators with the digital logic on the same die. Thus, mixed signal system-on-chip (SOC) solutions are becoming a common practice in the present day integrated circuit (IC) technologies. In digital domain, aggressive technology scaling redeﬁnes, in many ways, the role of interconnects vis-`a-vis the logic in determining the overall performance. Apart from signal integrity, power dissipation and reliability issues, delays over long interconnects far exceeding the logic delay becomes a bottleneck in high speed operation. Moreover, with an increasing density of chips, the number of interchip connections is greatly increased as more and more functions are put on the same chip; thus, the size and performance of the chip are mostly dominated by wiring rather than devices. One of the most promising approaches to solve the above interconnection problems is the use of multiple-valued logic (MVL) inside the chip [Han 93, Smi 88]. The number of interconnections can be directly reduced with multiple valued signal representation. The reduced complexity of interconnections makes the chip area and delay much smaller leading to reduced cross talk noise and improved reliability. Thus, the inclusion of multiple-valued logic in a otherwise mixed design, consisting of analog and binary logic, can make the transition from analog to digital world much more smoother {{and at the same time}} improve the overall system performance. As the sizes of integrated devices decrease, maximum voltage ratings also rapidly decrease. Although decreased supply voltages do not restrict the design of digital circuits, it is harder to design high performance analog and multiple valued integrated circuits using new processes. As an alternative to voltage-mode signal processing, current-mode circuit techniques, which use current as a signal carrier, are drawing strong attention today due to their potential application in the design of high-speed mixed-signal processing circuits in low-voltage standard VLSI CMOS technologies. Industrial interest in this ﬁeld has been propelled by the proposal of innovative ideas for ﬁlters, data converters and IC prototypes in the high frequency range [Tou 90, Kol 00]. Further, in MVL design using conventional CMOS processing, diﬀerent current levels can be easily used to represent diﬀerent logic values. Thus the case for an integrated approach to the design of analog, multi-valued and binary logic circuits using current-mode techniques seems to be worth considering. The work presented in this thesis is an effort to reaffirm the utility of current-mode circuit techniques to some of the existing as well as to some new areas of circuit design. We present new algorithms for the synthesis of a class of analog and multiple-valued logic circuits assuming an underlying CMOS current-mode building blocks. Next we present <b>quaternary</b> current-mode <b>signaling</b> scheme employing a simple encoder and decoder architecture for improving the signal delay characteristics of long interconnects in digital logic blocks. As an interface between analog and digital domain, we present an architecture of current-mode ﬂash A/D converter. Finally, low power being a dominant design constraint in today IC technology, we present a scheme for static power minimization in a class of Current-mode circuits...|$|R
