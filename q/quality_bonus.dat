Compared to the PPACA <b>quality</b> <b>bonus</b> program, CMSs demonstration increases the number of plans eligible for a bonus, enlarges the size of payments for some plans, and accelerates payment phase-in. CMS stated that the demonstrations research goal is to test whether scaling bonus payments to quality scores MA plans receive increases the speed and degree of annual quality improvements for plans compared with what would have occurred under PPACA. GAO reported that CMSs Office of the Actuary estimated that the demonstration would cost $ 8. 35 billion over 10 yearsan amount greater than the combined budgetary impact of all Medicare demonstrations conducted since 1995. In addition, GAO also found several shortcomings of the demonstration design that preclude a credible evaluation of its effectiveness in achieving CMSs stated research goal.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Our March 2012 review found that the CMS Office of the Actuarys (OACT) estimated cost of the demonstration exceeds $ 8 billion over 10 years. About $ 5. 34 billion of this estimate is attributed to <b>quality</b> <b>bonus</b> payments more generous than those prescribed in PPACA, specifically to (1) higher bonuses for 4 -star and 5 -star plans, (2) new bonuses for 3 -star and 3. 5 -star plans, (3) applying bonuses to plans entire benchmarks during the phase-in of PPACAs new payment methodology, and (4) allowing plans benchmarks to exceed their pre-PPACA levels. Most of the remaining projected demonstration spending stems from higher MA enrollment because the bonuses enable MA plans to offer beneficiaries more benefits or lower premiums. Taken together, the expanded bonuses and higher enrollment mainly benefit average-performing plansthose receiving 3 and 3. 5 -star ratings. Also, while a reduction in MA payments was projected to occur {{as a result of}} PPACAs payment reforms, OACT estimated that the demonstration would offset more than one-third of these payment reductions projected for 2012 through 2014. ...|$|E

40|$|Background The Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) {{requires}} fundamental {{reform of}} health care financing. We propose a Risk-Based Comprehensive Payment system with risk-adjusted base and bonus payments. Bundled base payments cover the expected cost of primary care services but do not encourage <b>quality.</b> <b>Bonus</b> payments incentivize desired outcomes by rewarding better-than-expected performance in clinical quality, efficiency, and patient-centeredness. Base and bonus payments require credible risk adjustment to discourage practices from cherry-picking easy patients and dumping difficult ones. Methods We estimated models to predict thirteen cost and utilization measures in 17. 4 million commercially insured people using diagnoses, age, and sex from Thomson-Reuters MarketScan® 2007 claims data. Using the same data, we imputed assignment of 456, 781 people to 436 medium-sized primary care practitioner (PCP) panels (500 – 5000 patients). For each measure, a PCP’s performance is judged by summing the difference between observed (O) and expected (E) outcomes across panel members. For each outcome we calculated: mean; coefficient of variation, or CV = SD/mean; and both individual and grouped R 2 as measures of predictive accuracy Results Using risk models to calculate expected outcomes explained 29 - 49 % of the observed patient-level and 85 - 98 % of practice-level variation in performance, with differential variability.

40|$|IntroductionIn 2012, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) {{introduced}} the <b>Quality</b> <b>Bonus</b> Payment Demonstration, a pay-for-performance (P 4 P) program, into Medicare Advantage plans. Previous studies documented racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of care among participants in these plans. The {{objective of this}} study was to determine whether P 4 P incentives have affected these disparities in Medicare Advantage plans. MethodsWe studied 411 Medicare Advantage health plans that participated in the Medicare Health Outcome Survey in 2010 and 2013. Preventive health care was defined as self-reported receipt of health care provider communication or treatment to reduce risk of falling, improve bladder control, and monitor physical activity among individuals reporting these problems. Logistic regression stratified by health care plan was used to examine racial/ethnic disparities in receipt of preventive health care before and after the introduction of the P 4 P program in 2012. ResultsWe found similar racial/ethnic differences in receipt of preventive health care before and after the introduction of P 4 P. Blacks and Asians were less likely than whites to receive advice to improve bladder control and more likely to receive advice to reduce risk of falling and improve physical activity. Hispanics were more likely to report receiving advice about all 3 health issues than whites. After the introduction of P 4 P, the gap decreased between Hispanics and whites for improving bladder control and monitoring physical activity and increased between blacks and whites for monitoring physical activity. ConclusionRacial/ethnic differences in receipt of preventive health care are not always in the expected direction. CMS should consider developing a separate measure of equity in preventive health care services to encourage health plans to reduce gaps among racial/ethnic groups in receiving preventive care services. 27609303 PMC 502784...|$|E

For feed intakes the six Holstein herds consumed an average of 52. 417 lbs per milking cow, while the four Jersey herds consumed an average of 45. 094 lbs of feed per milking cow for the year 2012. For feed efficiency, the Holstein dairies had 1. 353 lbs of milk produced per pound of dry matter (DM) consumed. For the Jersey breed, the dairies reported an average feed efficiency of 1. 635. Feed costs for the dairies were also observed. Feed costs per day per milking cow on the six Holstein dairies resulted in $ 7. 66 compared to $ 7. 45 for the four Jersey dairies. Another feed cost that was determined was the cost per hundred weight of milk. The Holstein dairies had a $ 10. 85 average on feed cost per hundred weight, while the Jersey dairies had a $ 10. 12 average on feed cost per hundred weight.

40|$|Practical {{mechanisms}} for procurement involve bidding, negotiation, transfer payments and subsidies, {{and the possibility}} of verification of unobservable product and service quality. We model two proposed multi-stage procurement mechanisms. One focuses on the auction price that is established, and the other emphasizes price negotiation. Both also emphasize quality and offer incentives for the unobservable level of a supplier’s effort, while addressing the buyer’s satisfaction. Our results show that, with the appropriate incentive, which we will refer to as a qualityeffort bonus, the supplier will exert more effort to supply higher quality goods or services after winning the procurement auction. We also find that a mechanism incorporating price and quality negotiation improves the supply chain’s surplus and generates the possibility of Pareto optimal improvement in comparison to a mechanism that emphasizes the auction price only. From the buyer’s perspective though, either mechanism can dominate the other, depending on the circumstances of procurement. Thus, post-auction negotiation may not always be optimal for the buyer, although it always produces first-best goods or service quality outcomes. The buyer’s choice between mechanisms will be influenced by different values of the <b>quality</b> effort <b>bonus.</b> For managers in practice, our analysis shows {{that it is possible to}} simplify the optimization procedure by using a new approach for selecting the appropriate mechanism and determining what value of the incentive for the supplier makes sense...|$|R

Scandinavian pulp mills normally communicate requirements for chip geometry to the producers through <b>quality</b> regulations and <b>bonus</b> penalty systems. To optimize their deliveries sawmills try to produce chips of optimal size and screen out undesired fractions, and as a standard procedure they re-chip oversized chips into acceptable sizes.

The geometry of chips from a single sawmill is almost as uniform as that of chips made by a pulp mill and the geometry is relatively consistent over time.

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) provides excellent soft tissue contrast for oncology applications. We propose to combine a MRI scanner with a helical tomotherapy (HT) system to enable daily target imaging for improved conformal radiation dose delivery to a patient. HT uses an intensity-modulated fan-beam that revolves around a patient, while the patient slowly advances through {{the plane of}} rotation, yielding a helical beam trajectory. Since {{the use of a}} linear accelerator to produce radiation may be incompatible with the pulsed radiofrequency and the high and pulsed magnetic fields required for MRI, it is proposed that a radioactive Cobalt- 60 (60 Co) source be used instead to provide the radiation. An open low field (0. 25 T) MRI system is proposed where the tomotherapy ring gantry is located between two sets of Helmholtz coils that can generate a sufficiently homogenous main magnetic field. It is shown that the two major challenges with the design, namely acceptable radiation dose rate (and therefore treatment duration) and moving parts in strong magnetic field, can be addressed. The high dose rate desired for helical tomotherapy delivery can be achieved using two radiation sources of 220 TBq (6000 Ci) each on a ring gantry with a source to axis-of-rotation distance of 75 cm. In addition to this, a dual row multi-leaf collimator (MLC) system with 15 mm leaf width at isocentre and relatively large fan beam widths between 15 and 30 mm per row shall be employed. In this configuration, the unit would be well-suited for most pelvic radiotherapy applications where the soft tissue contrast of MRI will be particularly beneficial. Non-magnetic MRI compatible materials must be used for the rotating gantry. Tungsten, which is non-magnetic, can be used for primary collimation of the fan-beam {{as well as for the}} MLC, which allows intensity modulated radiation delivery. We propose to employ a low magnetic Cobalt compound, sycoporite (CoS) for the Cobalt source material itself. Rotational delivery is less susceptible to problems related to the use of a low energy megavoltage photon source while the helical delivery reduces the negative impact of the relatively large penumbra inherent in the use of Cobalt sources for radiotherapy. On the other hand, the use of a 60 Co source ensures constant dose rate with gantry rotation and makes dose calculation in a magnetic field as easy as the range of secondary electrons is limited. The MR-integrated Cobalt tomotherapy unit, dubbed &#x 2032;MiCoTo,&#x 2032; uses two independent physical principles for image acquisition and treatment delivery.
