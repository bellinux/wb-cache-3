50|$|The primary {{selective}} adaptation {{that arises}} from bitter taste is to detect poisonous compounds, as most poisonous compounds in nature are bitter. However, this trait is not exclusively positive, as bitter compounds exist in nature {{that are not}} poisonous. Exclusive rejection of these compounds would in fact be a negative trait, as {{it would make it}} more difficult to find food. Toxic and bitter compounds do, however, exist in different diets at different frequencies. Sensitivities to bitter compounds should follow the requirements of different diets logically, as species that can afford to reject plants due to their low plant diet (carnivores) have a higher sensitivity to bitter compounds than those that exclusively ingest plants. Exposure to the bitter marker <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> supported this fact, as the sensitivities to bitter compounds were highest in carnivores, followed by omnivores, then grazers and browsers. This identifies toxic plants as the primary selective force for bitter taste.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of cinchona into therapeutics {{was due to}} the discovery of its efficacy in malaria. In 1921, John used <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> an alkaloid of cinchona in the treatment of amoebic liver abscess. Later when synthetic derivatives of quinine were introduced, chloroquine phosphate, a 4-aminoquinoline was found to be less toxic than the parent drug. The drug was first quoted in the treatment of this condition in very early reports by Conan (1948)15, Murgatroyd and Kent (1948). It is absorbed rapidly and completely from the gastrointestinal tract. It is found to be very effective in invasive amoebiasis although the drug is a weaker amoebicide when compared to emetine. It is only feebly amoebicidal in the intestinal lumen.The high concentration in the liver parenchyma and the lung allows the drug to act upon E. Histolytica in cases of amoebic liver abscess and pleuropulmonary amoebiasis.It is usually well tolerated, but in some individuals it may cause mild headache, itching, nausea, vomiting or blurred vision. Rarely incoordination, convulsions, peripheral neuritis and bleaching of hair can occur. Diminution of T waves has been noticed on routine electrocardiographic recordings. Retinopathy does not occur with the usual dosage for amoebic liver abscess. Psychic disturbances though rare may interfere with the safe operation of machines and vehicles. The drug may be toxic to children in large doses18 and causes deafness in the foetus. Each 0.5 G. tablet contains chloroquine diphosphate equivalent to 0.3 G. of the base. For the treatment of amoebic liver abscess, it is administered in doses of 0.6 G. base per day in 2 to 3 divided doses orally for 2 days followed by 0.15 G. base twice daily for 2 to 3 weeks. However, Plorde recommends that it be given as 0.6 G. base initially, 0.3 G. base six hours later and then 0.3 G. base twice daily for fourteen to twenty eight days.19 Chloroquine is also available in an injectable form. Since it is quite toxic by this route, it should not be used for more than 24-48 hours after which oral therapy should be continued. Rarely, when patients of amoebic liver abscess are vomiting, injection chloroquine {{can be used in a}} dose of 0.3-0.6 G. base in 24 hours not exceeding 0.9 G.). Chloroquine given alone is a safer drug than emetine in amoebic liver abscess, but unfortunately the relapse rate is almost 25%. Rarely repetition of the course may induce a dramatic response.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Bitter taste receptors (T 2 R) are {{expressed}} throughout {{the digestive tract}} and {{it is suggested that}} might be involved in several gastrointestinal functions. Nevertheless, their role is still unknown. Data on animals have suggested that bitter taste agonists are involved in the control of food intake, but no data are available in humans. AIMS & METHODS: Our aim is to assess whether bitter agonists influence satiation and food intake in healthy subjects. Thirteen healthy subjects (5 males, age 27 ± 8 years, BMI 24 ± 6) were recruited. A capsule containing either placebo, or 18 mg of <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> was administered in a double blind fashion to each subject. After 45 min, all subjects underwent an ad libitum test meal using a standardized meal composed by white bread, cheese and meat cream (89 kcal each portion, with the following composition 50 % carbohydrate, 31 % fat, 19 % protein). The subjects were allowed to eat until they reach the maximum satiation (scored on a visual analogue scale). The amount of kilocalories, the test duration, the level of satiation and all gastrointestinal sensations were scored before {{and at the end of}} the test. Data (mean ± SD) were compared by using paired t test. RESULTS: Subjects did not experience any bitter sensation and no adverse effects or gastrointestinal sensations were found after administration of <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or placebo. The amount of calories ingested was significantly lower when subjects received <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> than placebo (541 ± 180 vs. 610 ± 246 kcal; p = 0. 03), similarly the number of ingested sandwiches was reduced (6 ± 1 vs. 7 ± 1; p = 0. 03). Conversely, as compared to placebo, <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> did not affect the time to reach the maximum satiety (15 ± 4 vs. 16 ± 6 min; p> 0. 05), nor the intensity of satiation (80 ± 10 vs. 80 ± 10 mm; p> 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Administration of a bitter compound is able to significantly reduce caloric intake in an ad libitum test meal. As <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> does affect kcal intake without affecting the time to reach the maximum satiation, we hypothesize that <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> likely decreases the kcal intake by affecting the rate of meal portions consumption. Evaluation of gut hormones kinetics and studies with other bitter taste receptor agonists are needed to establish the role of gastrointestinal taste receptor in the control of food intak...|$|E

40|$|When one taste (masker) {{is strong}} enough, it can {{completely}} mask another taste (target) of different quality. How strong the masker {{must be to}} do this depends on how strong the target is. As the target concentration is increased, the masking concentration must be increased, too, but in ever-increasing proportion. To quantify the conditions for such complete masking, the target's detection threshold was measured {{as a function of}} the masker's concentration, from zero to strong. This was done for 12 binary combinations of sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid and <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> The 12 functions generated show that some tastants mask each other much more efficiently than others. Masking gives new insight into the role of aging in taste: older (66 - 90 years) subjects' thresholds, regardless of masking concentration, always measured a constant factor higher than younger (18 - 29 years) subjects ' thresholds (about two to seven times higher, depending on target tastant). Thus, with increasing level of the masker, the thresholds of young and elderly go up in parallel. Thresholds of tastants in water alone are false predictors of elderly persons ' ability to perceive ingredients like salt and sugar condiments in foods, where, because of masking, their thresholds can be several times higher than in water. Age manifested itself relatively mildly in sucrose and citric acid, moderately in sodium chloride, and strongly in <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride...</b>|$|E
40|$|Variation {{exists in}} the {{sensitivity}} of individual rodents and humans to different bitter tastants. An absence of uniform correlation in responsiveness to different bitter substances across individuals within a species suggests heterogeneity in the mechanisms underlying stimulus processing within this taste modality. Here, we examined taste responsiveness of individual rats to three bitter compounds (<b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> denatonium benzoate, and cycloheximide) in short-term lick tests to determine the magnitude of covariation among responses to these stimuli and infer commonalities in their receptor and neural mechanisms. Ratswere testedwith a given pair of bitter stimuli during three sessions comprising randomized trial blocks of six concentrations of each stimulus + deionized water. Psychophysical functions were generated for individual rats for respective stimulus pairs, and concentrations of each stimulus that produced equivalent lick suppression relative to water were correlated across animals. Behavioral taste responsiveness to <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> strongly covaried with responsiveness to denatonium benzoate (r = + 0. 82). Lick responsiveness to quinine was less robustly correlated with that to cycloheximide (r = + 0. 44), and denatonium and cycloheximide responses failed to correlate. These results imply substantial overlap in the bitter taste coding mechanisms for quinine and denatonium but some degree of independence in the mechanisms responsible for gustatory processing of cycloheximide. More generally, these data reinforce the notion that bitter taste processing is not a homogeneous event...|$|E

40|$|Rejection {{of bitter}} {{substances}} {{is common in}} many species and may function to protect an animal from ingestion of bitter-tasting toxins. Since many plants are bitter, it has been proposed that high tolerance for bitterness would be adaptive for herbivores. Earlier studies conducted on herbivorous guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) {{have been used to}} support this proposal. We tested guinea pigs with bitter plant secondary metabolites (salicin, caffeine, <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride)</b> and bitter protein hydrolysates (two types of hydrolyzed casein, hydrolyzed soy) in a series of two-choice preference tests. For comparison, we tested two nonherbivorous mouse species (Mus musculus and Peromyscus leucopus). Guinea pigs did show weaker avoidance of <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> than did the mice, confirming predictions generated from earlier work. However, guinea pigs had similar responses to caffeine as did Peromyscus. Both of these species showed weaker avoidance responses than Mus to 10 mM caffeine. For salicin, guinea pigs were the only species to avoid it at 10 mM and their preference scores at this concentration were significantly lower than for the two mice species. Guinea pigs avoided all of the protein hydrolysates more strongly than the other species. Responses to the protein hydrolysates did not reflect the patterns observed with the simple bitter compounds, suggesting that other properties of these complex stimuli may be responsible for guinea pig avoidance of them. Our results suggest caution in accepting, without further empirical support, the premise that guinea pigs (and herbivores in general) have a generalized reduced bitter sensitivity...|$|E

40|$|Capsaicin {{is viewed}} as a purely chemesthetic {{stimulus}} that selectively stimulates the somatosensory system. Here we show that when applied to small areas of the tongue, capsaicin can produce a bitter taste as well as sensory irritation. In experiment 1, individuals were screened for the ability to perceive bitterness from capsaicin on the circumvallate papillae. Fifteen of 25 subjects who reported at least weak bitterness rated the intensity of taste, irritation and coolness produced by 100 – 320 µM capsaicin and 100 – 320 mM menthol applied via cotton swabs to the tip (fungiform region), the posterior edge (foliate region), and the dorsal posterior surface (circumvallate region) of the tongue. Sucrose, citric acid, sodium chloride and <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> were applied to the same areas to assess tastes responsiveness. On average, capsaicin and menthol produced ‘moderate ’ bitterness (and no other significant taste qualities) in the circumvallate region, and weaker bitterness on the side and tip of the tongue. Sensory irritation from capsaicin was rated significantly higher at the tongue tip, whereas menthol coolness was rated higher in the circumvallate region. In experiment 2 we applied sucrose and <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> together with capsaicin to investigate the effects other taste stimuli might have on capsaicin’s reported bitterness. As expected, adding quinine produced stronger bitterness in the circumvallate and fungiform regions, and adding sucrose significantly reduced the bitterness of capsaicin in the circumvallate region. Overall, the results suggest that capsaicin and menthol are capable of stimulating a subset of taste neurons that respond to bitter substances, perhaps via receptor-gated ion channels like thos...|$|E

40|$|Novel {{chemical}} entities (NCEs) may {{be investigated}} for emetic liability {{in a range}} of unpleasant experiments involving retching, vomiting or conditioned taste aversion/food avoidance in sentient animals. We have used a range of compounds with known emetic /aversive properties to examine the possibility of using the social amoeba, Dictyostelium discoideum, for research into identifying and understanding emetic liability, and hence reduce adverse animal experimentation in this area. Twenty eight emetic or taste aversive compounds were employed to investigate the acute (10 min) effect of compounds on Dictyostelium cell behaviour (shape, speed and direction of movement) in a shallow chemotaxic gradient (Dunn chamber). Compound concentrations were chosen based on those previously reported to be emetic or aversive in in vivo studies and results were recorded and quantified by automated image analysis. Dictyostelium cell motility was rapidly and strongly inhibited by four structurally distinct tastants (three bitter tasting compounds - denatonium benzoate, <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> phenylthiourea, and the pungent constituent of chilli peppers - capsaicin). In addition, stomach irritants (copper chloride and copper sulphate), and a phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor also rapidly blocked movement. A concentration-dependant relationship was established for five of these compounds, showing potency of inhibition as capsaicin (IC 50  =  11. 9 ± 4. 0 µM) > <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (IC 50  =  44. 3 ± 6. 8 µM) > denatonium benzoate (IC 50  =  129 ± 4 µM) > phenylthiourea (IC 50  =  366 ± 5 µM) > copper sulphate (IC 50  =  1433 ± 3 µM). In contrast, 21 compounds within the cytotoxic and receptor agonist/antagonist classes did not affect cell behaviour. Further analysis of bitter and pungent compounds showed that the effect on cell behaviour was reversible and not cytotoxic, suggesting an uncharacterised molecular mechanism of action for these compounds. These results therefore demonstrate that Dictyostelium has potential as a non-sentient model in the analysis of the molecular effects of tastants, although it has limited utility in identification of emetic agents in general...|$|E

40|$|The NHANES 2011 – 2014 {{protocol}} {{includes a}} {{taste and smell}} questionnaire (CSQ) in the home interview followed by brief olfactory and taste assessment in mobile exam centers. The CSQ asks self-reported taste and smell ability, and selected symptoms, comorbidities, and treatment for chemosensory disorders. In the taste assessment, participants rate intensities of 1 M NaCl and 1 mM <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> applied to the tongue tip and these plus 0. 32 M NaCl sampled with the whole mouth. Smell function is assessed with two 4 -item, scratch-and-sniff tests (Pocket TestsTM (PT), Sensonics, Inc.) to classify normosmia and olfactory dysfunction from microsmia to anosmia. We examined the NHANES protocol test-retest reliability and compared the PT to an Olfactometer identification task. Seventy-seven adults (mean age= 39, range: 18 - 87 years) were tested at baseline and 2. 5 weeks. Taste intraclass correlations (one-way random, single measures) ranged from 0. 47 - 0. 71 (moderate to substantial agreement) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{pattern of}} licking {{microstructure}} during various phases of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) was evaluated. In Experiment 1, rats ingested lithium chloride (LiCl) for 3 trials and were then offered sodium chloride (NaCl) or sucrose on 3 trials. A CTA to LiCl developed and generalized to NaCl {{but not to}} sucrose. CTA intake suppression was characterized by reductions in burst size, average ingestion rate, and intraburst lick rate, and increases in brief pauses and burst counts. Compared with previous studies, LiCl licking shifted from a pattern initially matching that for normally accepted NaCl to one matching licking for normally avoided <b>quinine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> {{by the end of}} the 1 st acquisition trial. In Experiment 2, a novel paradigm was developed to show that rats expressed CTA generalization within 9 min of their first LiCl access. These results suggest that licking microstructure analysis can be used to assay changes in hedonic evaluation caused by treatments that produce aversive states...|$|E
