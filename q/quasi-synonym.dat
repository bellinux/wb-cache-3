50|$|This {{raises a}} logical issue. Adding -e {{to one of}} these {{secondary}} stems produces an adjective that is structurally and semantically equivalent to the past participle of the same verb. Experte, for example, is related to experir to experience, which has the past participle experite. Yet, semantically, there is little difference between un experte carpentero an expert carpenter and un experite carpentero an experienced carpenter. Effectively, experte = experite. Furthermore, one can form a word like le experito the experienced one as a <b>quasi-synonym</b> of le experto the expert.|$|E

The definitions of CWP and FM both have a long history. Chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions are universally prevalent in both genders and all age groups and, al-though their pathophysiology varies, they are inter-related anatomically and by their association with pain and impaired physi-cal function. However, there is still no con-sensus as to whether FM should be consid-ered a discrete entity or {{just the tip of the}} iceberg of CWP (2). Topography can be used if the pain is lo...|$|E

One current approach to generating <b>quasi-synonyms</b> uses a general similarity measure to score the synonymy of two words based on their context vectors. In contrast, we compare two simple measures that take into account more directly the contextual evidence that supports a synonymy relation.

40|$|Abstract. An {{unsupervised}} {{method for}} {{word sense disambiguation}} is proposed. The {{sense of the word}} is chosen to be the most similar to the senses of other words that appear in the corpus in similar contexts. Training consists of building a weighted list of related words (quasi-synonyms) for each word; the weights are obtained by measuring similarity between the word’s contexts. We adapt the algorithm of McCarthy et al. 2004 for finding the best sense in each occurrence, instead of finding the predominant sense of each word in the entire corpus. Their maximization algorithm allows then each <b>quasi-synonym</b> to accumulate a score for each ambiguous word sense; the sense with the highest score is chosen. We obtain a top precision of 69. 86 % using the same corpus for training and disambiguating...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the ancient}} {{language}} of French-Canadians, the term [...] "vlimeux" [...] evokes the unpredictability, malicious, mischievous, mocking or “ratoureur” {{a person to}} reach his ends subtly, sometimes making use of indirect means to deceive. The Wikdictionnaire attributed <b>quasi-synonyms</b> such as: playful, “ratoureux”, comic, inconvenient or tanning. Seeking to know the etymology of the term, some researchers argue the thesis that the toponym [...] "vlimeux" [...] would be a derivative of [...] "poisonous".

40|$|The focal {{issue of}} the paper is {{synonymy}} occurring in phraseology discussed on the example of selected units from various European languages. The relation of synonymy between multiword expressions is of complex character, since there are three main types of phraseological synonyms, i. e. absolute synonyms, <b>quasi-synonyms</b> and pseudo-synonyms. The first type, absolute synonyms, is represented by units which bear similarity {{in a number of}} parametres, such as: stylistic markedness and evaluation, frequency. In order to qualify units as absolute synonyms, one is to conduct a multiaspectual analysis, comparing the parametres of two units. It is generally acknowledged that hardly any absolute synonyms exist. The ones which can be considered absolute synonyms tend to form a chain of units, which show some lexical differences, occurring as a result of substitution of a component. <b>Quasi-synonyms,</b> units differing in some aspects, yet conveying the same meaning, are by far more common in language. As to the differences, they concern the semantics, imagery, stylistics, evaluation, syntactic properties, collocability and frequency of the units. The typology presented also comprises pseudo-synonyms, i. e. units showing external similarity (the structure and components) which cause language users to associate their meanings, which actually do not overlap. As a consequence, the units tend to be used wrongly in the process of communication. The results of the studies on the synonymy of phraseological units have some practical applications, for instance, they can be implemented in lexicography and language teaching.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{typology}} of terminological synonyms in English and Serbian, focusing on the corpus of terms relating to five ball games – basketball, football, handball, volleyball and water polo. According to this research, {{there are two types}} of synonyms in English (real synonyms and <b>quasi-synonyms),</b> and four types in Serbian (terminological doublets, anglicisms as hyposynonyms, and false friends,). However, if extended to the level of the general lexicon, this typology falls short of defining stylistically marked terms. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to add additional category of terminologically marked synonyms. Thus general conclusion of this paper is that, even though unwelcome in terminology, synonymous terms are a reality which should be controlled by the process of standardization...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} associated with automatic thesaurus construction is with determining the semantic relationship between word pairs. <b>Quasi-synonyms</b> provide a type of equivalence relationship: words are similar only for purposes of information retrieval. Determining such relationships in a thesaurus is hard to achieve automatically. The term vector space model and an inverse term frequency similarity function can provide a way to automatically determine the similarity between words in thesaurus. A thesaurus constructed using this method can also improve precision and recall in information retrieval, when the thesaurus is constructed in conjunction with fuzzy rough set algorithms and used with tight upper approximation query expansion. This dissertation presents a method that combines fuzzy rough sets and a word weighting and inverse term frequency similarity function as a technique for automatic thesaurus construction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} a {{multilingual}} relational lexical database of proper name, Prolexbase, a free resource available on the CNRTL website. The Prolex model is based on two main concepts: firstly, a language independent pivot and, secondly, the prolexeme (the projection of the pivot onto particular language), that {{is a set of}} lemmas (names and derivatives). These two concepts model the variations of proper name: firstly, independent of language and, secondly, language dependent by morphology or knowledge. Variation processing is very important for NLP: the same proper name can be written in different instances, maybe in different parts of speech, and it can also be replaced by another one, a lexical anaphora (that reveals semantic link). The pivot represents different referent's points of view, i. e. language independent variations of name. Pivots are linked by three semantic relations (quasi-synonymy, partitive relation and associative relation).

40|$|Healthcare {{consumers}} {{often have}} difficulty expressing and understanding medical concepts. The {{goal of this}} study is to identify and characterize medical expressions or “terms ” (linguistic forms and associated concepts) used by consumers and health mediators. In particular, these terms were characterized according to the degree to which they mapped to professional medical vocabularies. Lay participants identified approximately 100, 000 term tokens from online discussion forum postings and print media articles. Of the over 81, 000 extracted term tokens reviewed, more than 75 % were mapped as synonyms or <b>quasi-synonyms</b> to the Unified Medical Language System ® (UMLS ®) Metathesaurus ®. While 80 % conceptual overlap was found between closely mapped lay (consumer and mediator) and technical (professional) medical terms, about half of these overlapping concepts contained lay forms different from technical forms. This study raises questions about the nature of consumer health vocabularies that we believe have theoretical and practical implications for bridging the medical vocabulary gap between consumers and professionals...|$|R

40|$|The present article {{deals with}} a {{situation}} that lies between the needs of an advanced learner’s dictionary and those of a specialised dictionary in attempting to build a pattern dictionary for verbs which are being used in scientific research papers. Current dictionaries do not necessary assist in the particular production environment of the scientific article. This can be tackled by building a bottom-up phraseological dictionary which will help both with decoding and encoding. The building method uses collocational networks in order to compile a dictionary which will demonstrate usage of individual verbs, grouping them into a natural classification system that will grow from the corpus data. This organic dictionary ultimately makes wide use of mind mapping technology to allow the user to navigate within the dictionary. It contains both individual entries containing phraseological information and super entries linking <b>quasi-synonyms</b> and writing assistance. The dictionary provides the environment which can link phraseological patterns to the corpus data so as to limit the information retrieval process whilst providing real examples of language in use in specialised contexts...|$|R
40|$|Presented {{publication}} is {{an attempt}} to review current knowledge of the metatext, i. e. language units that have no reference to the world, but to linguistic expressions, elements of communicated knowledge and/or to a speaker. This verification was carried out at the example of ways to shape a speech act by particles. In the study I adopted the understanding of this class from Jadwiga Wajszczuk, in whose concept particles are parataktems – units that do not fall in the dependency syntax, but create relationships of coocurency, units not required by any element of a sentence and not requiring any specific grammatical or semantic features from their coocurents. Particles comment on a rhematic part of a sentence, the part that is designated prozodically (primarily by sentence stress). The study consists of three chapters. In a fundamental Chapter 1 a detailed analysis of semantic and syntactic features of “wyróżniające” particles (zwłaszcza, szczególnie,w szczególności, głównie, przede wszystkim) is presented. The analysis of the group is based on its confrontation with synonyms given in lexicography. Chapter 2 is devoted to discussing the notation of <b>quasi-synonyms</b> of particles in dictionaries. The examination of synonyms in differently shaped sentences forced a confrontation with the problem of contextual requirements of particles. To this problem Chapter 3 is devoted. edition: 1 stnrpages: 226 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The term "{{situational}} judgement" {{has been}} used often {{in the field of}} ball games in our country. However, the study on situational judgement in ball games has been hardly deve 1 oped. This is partly caused by unclearness of the object of study, as situational judgement and situational judgement ability, at the conceptual level. Then it was attempted in this paper to consider and clarify three basic concepts, i. e., situational judgement in ball games, situational judgement ability in ball dames, and game situation, from such an uncultivated field. From another point of view, this paper can be regarded as an attempt to present some theoretical frameworks for the study on situational judgement in ball games. (1) Situational judgement in ball games was considered synonymous with decisionmaking in the game, and defined as "to make a decision what to play in the game". Next, the process of situational judgement in ball games was considered from the information processing approach, and a conceptual linear model of the process, which contains selective attention to outer game situation, recognition of game situation, anticipation of game situation, and decision on play, was presented. Finally, situational judgement in ball games was classified into ones of four levels according to the hierarchy of the decisions in the game. (2) Situational judgement ability in ball games was defined as "the ability to make situational judgement, i. e., to make a decision what to play, in the specific ball game". And it was discussed that situational judgement ability was an indispensable element of skill in each ball game. Next, four abilities at each sub-process of the above-mentioned process model were identified as the constituents of situational judgement ability in ball games. Finally, a few <b>quasi-synonyms,</b> as tactical ability and game sense, were discussed. (3) Game situation was defined as "the unity of all stimuli having influence on a player in the game". And their stimulus elements were shown concretely under the objective ones (outer game situation) and the subjective ones {{in order to understand the}} concept more clearly. Next, game situation was classified with reference to situational judgement from two different view points, the one is that it is static game situation in which tha game is started after stoppage or dynamic game situation in which the game is evo 1 ving; the other is that it is the game situation in which the plays to choose from can be standardized theoretically or the game situation in which such plays cannot be standardized theoretically. Combinding these two taxonomy, game situation was classified under four categories. About the frameworks presented in this paper, more theoretical consideration should be expected, and in parallel their validity and practical usefulness should be verified by the corroborative studies in future...|$|R
40|$|In this essay, {{the domains}} of {{translation}} studies and technical textiles are brought together. A section of the French book Textiles techniques et fonctionnels, matériaux du XXIe siècle is translated into Swedish. The different translation procedures are presented, as well as particular difficulties which might occur during the translation process. The study also treats the field of terminology and various relations between terms. All textile terms are extracted from the translated text and a bilingual glossary is created. The essays secondary purpose is to simulate {{a publication of the}} book in Sweden and to examine if any adjustments are made to the translated text specifically because of this. During the translation, a large number of borrowed words were found. Both the French and the Swedish text contain several Anglicisms. The Swedish text contains a number of fashion related words which originates from France and the French text contains similar words which are borrowed from Italy. Both France and Italy are important countries within the fashion industry. Several words of German origin were also found in the Swedish text. The names of the synthetic fibers are often derived from the chemical composition of the material and the names are highly standardized in different languages. Translation procedures such as adaptation, transposition, modulation, equivalence and explication are used to adjust the Swedish text, for the purpose of obtaining an idiomatic language. Some reoccurring elements were detected, such as the prefix anti- in French and the suffix  -kläder in Swedish. A few « false friends » and ellipses where also found. When studying the terms, a number of hyponyms and a few antonyms were found, as well as a group of words with temporal relations. Both the Swedish and the French text contains some <b>quasi-synonyms</b> and a few terminology variations. Several cases of eponyms were found, most of them are trademarks of different materials which has developed into generic names (i. e. nylon, lycra, gore-tex). The translated text is a scientific text of denotational character and the translation did not pose any major difficulty. Though it is of great importance that the translator is aware of the different ranges of meaning implied in both the source and the target languages. Three adjustments were made due to the fictitious publication in Sweden; one generalization of geographical character, one explication of a French textile brand and one cultural adjustment. The most recent Swedish-French textile dictionary we found is the Swedish standard TNC 76, which was latest updated in 1981. By consequence, it does not contain recent textile words such as for example microfiber. A palpable difficulty when translating textile texts is to determine whether a material is a trademark or a generic name. If the material has started a development towards becoming an eponym, {{it can be difficult to}} determine if the brand name is referred to, or the material in a more general meaning. Several questions arouse regarding this issue. How do the companies who own trademarks act to protect their brands and is this transformation even possible to prevent? What are the consequences of a genericized trademark? This would be a very interesting subject to investigate further...|$|R
