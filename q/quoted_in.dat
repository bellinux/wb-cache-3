5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E

In chapter 36, High states that valkyries serve drinks and {{see to the}} tables in Valhalla, and Grímnismál stanzas 40 to 41 are then <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> {{reference}} to this.

5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (<b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E

A phrase of Gothic is <b>quoted</b> <b>in</b> an elegiac couplet from the Latin Anthology, and more substantially parts of the Gospels were translated into Gothic and preserved by the 6th-century Codex Argenteus.
