In a dialectical fashion, {{explicit}} quotations (frequently from French sources) clarify his position towards generic paradigms. This article attempts to group these <b>quotations</b> on the <b>basis</b> of their literary genres in order to stress the complexities of an inclusive and versatile text. The intertextual network, ranging from feuilleton literature to academic preciosity, in the last instance reveals itself as an ironic antidote to Romantic identification. This trend is confirmed by the remarkable {{increase in the number of}} quotations from the first edition (1876) to the second publication in volume form in 1883...|$|R
5000|$|... "What {{a man can}} be, he must be." [...] This <b>quotation</b> {{forms the}} <b>basis</b> of the {{perceived}} need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to what a person's full potential is and the realization of that potential. Maslow describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, {{to become the most}} that one can be. Individuals may perceive or focus on this need very specifically. For example, one individual may have the strong desire to become an ideal parent. In another, the desire may be expressed athletically. For others, it may be expressed in paintings, pictures, or inventions. As previously mentioned, Maslow believed that to understand this level of need, the person must not only achieve the previous needs, but master them.|$|R
40|$|In {{his book}} "Leadership Next" Gibbs (2005 : 18) {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} secular and spiritual leadership as symbiotic, namely, two different organisms living in close relationship. To this end he makes the statement : The relationship between the secular and spiritual is a symbiotic one rather than a clash of opposites. In the secular realm many significant changes in thinking have occurred. For example, the management-by-objective philosophy that proved so demanding, manipulative and destructive for so many {{in the business world}} has now been largely superseded. In the course of reading a large number of recently published books on leadership in the for-profit and non-profit worlds, I have been struck by their emphasis on humility, a servant attitude, spirituality and consistently upheld values as essential ingredients for leadership visions to be actualized. This welcome development is in line with leadership values made explicit in the New Testament. (Gibbs 2005 : 18) Considering this <b>quotation</b> as the <b>basis</b> for this discussion the research question is: Does statistical analysis completed by Sparks (cf Sparks 2007 : 123 - 159), of South African leaders who have led in both church and business, support or disagree with Gibbs? Considering the hypothesis that secular and spiritual leadership are symbiotic, the author will consider the various components of the quotation and describe a basic understanding found in literature with regard to these components. Thereafter, he will consider the relevant data from the research referred to. A brief overview of the life of Christ will be considered and subsequently a fresh {{understanding of the nature of}} the relationship between secular and spiritual leadership will emerge. It becomes clear that whilst there is general agreement with Gibbs, there are also specific areas of difference, particularly in the area of focus...|$|R
