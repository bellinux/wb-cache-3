40|$|We {{discuss the}} renormalisation {{of the ground}} state energy of massive fields obeying {{boundary}} conditions, i. e., of the Casimir effect, and emphasise {{the role of the}} mass for its understanding. This is an extended abstract of a talk given at the topical group meeting on Casimir Forces at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics on March 15 - 29, 1998. Renormalisation is a key {{to the understanding of the}} structure of quantum field theory. The kind of ultraviolet divergencies occurring divide the perturbative field theoretical models into renormalizable and non or super renormalizable ones. The ultraviolet divergencies occurring during the calculation of ground state energy in different backgrounds (including boundary conditions, i. e., the Casimir effect) carry information on the classical system which one is forced to associate in order to remove resp. interprete the divergencies. In the present note which is an extended abstract of a talk 1 we discuss the renormalisation using different examples. These are the Casimir effect for massive scalar [1] and spinor [2] fields and the radiative corrections [3] to the electromagnetic Casimir effect with boundary conditions on a sphere. In addition we consider the ground state energy of a scalar field in a spherically symmetric smooth background field [4]. For all questions and references not given in this note we refer to the cited papers. The necessity to associate some classical system with any ground state energy arises from its very nature. The ground state energy is the amount of energy left in a <b>quantised</b> <b>system</b> when all excitations are gone. To any excitated level it adds the same amount of energy (or other observables like charge) and, hence, cannot be observed in any measurements involving a mere change of the quantum 1 given at the topical group meeting on Casimir Forces at the Harvard-Smithsonian Cente...|$|E
40|$|Systems {{involving}} quantisation {{arise in}} many areas of engineering, especially when digital implementations are involved. In this thesis we consider different aspects of quantisation in feedback control systems. We study two topics of interest: (a) quantisers that quadratically stabilise a given system and are efficient in the use of their quantisation levels and (b) the derivation of ultimate bounds for perturbed systems, especially when the perturbations arise from the use of quantisers. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we address problem (a) above. We consider quadratic stabilisation of discrete-time multiple-input systems by means of quantised static feedback and we measure the efficiency of a quantiser via the concept of quantisation density. Intuitively, the lower the density of a quantiser is, the more separated its quantisation levels are. We thus deal with the problem of optimising density over all quantisers that quadratically stabilise a given system with respect to a given control Lyapunov function. Most of the available results on this problem treat single-input systems, and the ones that deal with the multiple-input case consider only two-input systems. In this thesis, we derive several new results for multiple-input systems and also provide an alternative approach to deal with the single-input case. Our new results for multiple-input systems include the derivation of the structure of optimal quantisers and the explicit design of multivariable quantisers with finite density that are able to quadratically stabilise systems having an arbitrary number of inputs. For single-input systems, we provide an alternative approach to the analysis and design of optimal quantisers by establishing a link between the separation of the quantisation levels of a quantiser and the size of its quantisation regions. In the second part of the thesis we address problem (b) above. In the presence of perturbations, asymptotic stabilisation may not be possible. However, there may exist a bounded region that contains the equilibrium point and has the property that the system trajectories converge to this bounded region. When this bounded region exists, we say that the system trajectories are ultimately bounded, and that this bounded region is an ultimate bound for the system. The size of the ultimate bound quantifies the performance of the system in steady state. Hence, it is important to derive ultimate bounds that are as tight as possible. This part of the thesis addresses the problem of ultimate bound computation in settings involving several scalar quantisers, each having different features. We consider each quantised variable in the system to be a perturbed copy of the corresponding unquantised variable. This turns the original <b>quantised</b> <b>system</b> into a perturbed system, where the perturbation has a natural componentwise bound. Moreover, according to the type of quantiser employed, the perturbation bound may depend on the system state. Typical methods to estimate ultimate bounds are based on the use of Lyapunov functions and usually require a bound on the norm of the perturbation. Applying these methods in the setting considered here may disregard important information on the structure of the perturbation bound. We therefore derive ultimate bounds on the system states that explicitly take account of the componentwise structure of the perturbation bound. The ultimate bounds derived also have a componentwise form, and can be systematically computed without having to, e. g. select a suitable Lyapunov function for the system. The results of this part of the thesis, though motivated by quantised systems, apply to more general perturbations, not necessarily arising from quantisation. PhD Doctorat...|$|E

40|$|Water {{distribution}} {{systems are}} large and complex structures. Hence, their construction, management and improvements are time consuming and expensive. But nearly all the optimisation methods, whether aimed at design or operation, suffer from the need for simulation models necessary to evaluate the performance of solutions to the problem. These simulation models, however, are increasing in size and complexity, and especially for operational control purposes, {{where there is a}} need to regularly update the control strategy to account for the fluctuations in demands, the combination of a hydraulic simulation model and optimisation is likely to be computationally excessive for all but the simplest of networks. The work presented in this thesis has been motivated by the need for reduced, whilst at the same time appropriately accurate, models to replicate the complex and nonlinear nature of water distribution systems in order to optimise their operation. This thesis attempts to establish the ground rules to form an underpinning basis for the formulation and subsequent evaluation of such models. Part I of this thesis introduces some of the modelling, simulation and optimisation problems currently faced by water industry. A case study is given to emphasise one particular subject, namely reduction of water distribution system models. A systematic research resulted in development of a new methodology which encapsulate not only the system mass balance but also the system energy distribution within the model reduction process. The methodology incorporates the energy audits concepts into the model reduction algorithm allowing the preservation of the original model energy distribution by imposing new pressure constraints in the reduced model. The appropriateness of the new methodology is illustrated on the theoretical and industrial case studies. Outcomes from these studies demonstrate that the new extension to the model reduction technique can simplify the inherent complexity of water networks while preserving the completeness of original information. An underlying premise which forms a common thread running through the thesis, linking Parts I and II, is in recognition of the need for the more efficient paradigm to model and simulate water networks; effectively accounting for the discontinuous behaviour exhibited by water network components. Motivated largely by the potential of contemplating a new paradigm to water distribution system modelling and simulation, a further major research area, which forms the basis of Part II, leads to a study of the discrete event specification formalism and <b>quantised</b> state <b>systems</b> to formulate a framework within which water distribution systems can be modelled and simulated. In contrast to the classic time-slicing simulators, depending on the numerical integration algorithms, the quantisation of system states would allow accounting for the discontinuities exhibited by control elements in a more efficient manner, and thereby, offer a significant increase in speed of the simulation of water network models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a number of case studies and compared with results obtained from the Epanet 2 simulator and OpenModelica. Although the current state-of-art of the simulation tools utilising the <b>quantised</b> state <b>systems</b> do not allow to fully exploit their potential, the results from comparison demonstrate that, if the second or third order quantised-based integrations are used, the <b>quantised</b> state <b>systems</b> approach can outperform the conventional water network simulation methods in terms of simulation accuracy and run-time...|$|R

We study a minisuperspace model together with a homogeneous scalar field, for which we can solve the Hamiltonian constraint exactly and arrive at an explicit ex-pression for the physical (non-vanishing) Hamiltonian. The scale factor and associated momentum cease to be dynamical variables, leaving the scalar field as the only physical degree of freedom. We investigate the resulting classical theory, showing how the dynamics of the scale factor can be recov-ered via an appropriate interpretation of the Hamiltonian as a volume. We then <b>quantise</b> the <b>system</b> in the Schrödinger picture. In the quantum theory we recover the dynamics of the scale factor by interpreting the spectrum and expectation value of the Hamiltonian as being associated with volume rather than energy. If trajectories in the sense of de Broglie-Bohm are introduced in the quantum theory, these are found to match those of the classical theory. We suggest that these trajectories may provide the basis for a perturbation theory in which both background and perturbations are quantised. ...|$|R
