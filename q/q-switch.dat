50|$|Initially {{the laser}} medium is pumped while the <b>Q-switch</b> {{is set to}} prevent {{feedback}} of light into the gain medium (producing an optical resonator with low Q). This produces a population inversion, but laser operation cannot yet occur {{since there is no}} feedback from the resonator. Since the rate of stimulated emission is dependent on the amount of light entering the medium, the amount of energy stored in the gain medium increases as the medium is pumped. Due to losses from spontaneous emission and other processes, after a certain time the stored energy will reach some maximum level; the medium is said to be gain saturated. At this point, the <b>Q-switch</b> device is quickly changed from low to high Q, allowing feedback and the process of optical amplification by stimulated emission to begin. Because of the large amount of energy already stored in the gain medium, the intensity of light in the laser resonator builds up very quickly; this also causes the energy stored in the medium to be depleted almost as quickly. The net result is a short pulse of light output from the laser, known as a giant pulse, which may have a very high peak intensity.|$|E
50|$|Chromium (IV)-doped YAG (Cr:YAG) {{provides}} a large {{absorption cross section}} in the 0.9-1.2 micrometer spectral region, which makes it an attractive choice as a passive <b>Q-switch</b> for Nd-doped lasers. The resulting devices are solid-state, compact and low-cost. Cr:YAG has high damage threshold, good thermal conductivity, good chemical stability, resists ultraviolet radiation, and is easily machinable. It is replacing more traditional Q-switching materials like lithium fluoride and organic dyes. The dopant levels used range between 0.5 and 3 percent (molar). Cr:YAG {{can be used for}} passive Q-switching of lasers that operate at wavelengths between 1000 and 1200 nm, such as those based on Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, Nd:YVO4, and Yb:YAG.|$|E

The field of PIV, particle image velocimetry, encompasses several subsets which would use digital delay generators {{as the main}} component of its timing where multiple lasers may be triggered. Multiple channels may trigger multiple lasers. One is also able to multiplex the timing of several channels onto one channel in order to trigger or even gate the same device multiple times. A single channel may trigger a laser or gate a camera with its multiple, multiplexed pulses. Another useful setup is to have one channel drive flash lamps a preset number of times, followed by a single <b>Q-switch,</b> followed by a delay and gate for the data acquisition or imaging system.|$|E

5000|$|WIth cavity dumping, {{the cavity}} end mirrors are 100% reflective, {{so that no}} output beam is {{produced}} when the Q is high. Instead, the <b>Q-switch</b> is used to [...] "dump" [...] the beam out of the cavity after a time delay. The cavity Q goes from low to high to start the laser buildup, and then goes from high to low to [...] "dump" [...] the beam from the cavity all at once. This produces a shorter output pulse than regular Q-switching. Electro-optic modulators are normally used for this, since they can easily be made {{to function as a}} near-perfect beam [...] "switch" [...] to couple the beam out of the cavity. The modulator that dumps the beam may be the same modulator that Q-switches the cavity, or a second (possibly identical) modulator. A dumped cavity is more complicated to align than simple Q-switching, and may need a control loop to choose the best time at which to dump the beam from the cavity.|$|E
5000|$|A cavity dumper is an {{output coupler}} that {{performs}} {{the function of}} a <b>Q-switch.</b> It allows the energy to build up in the optical cavity and then releases it at a specifically timed interval. This allows the beam to build up to high levels and then be released {{in a very short}} time; often within the time it takes a light wave to complete one round-trip through the cavity, hence the name. After building in intensity the cavity suddenly [...] "dumps" [...] its energy. Cavity dumpers usually use a high-reflective mirror on each end of the cavity, allowing the beam to receive full gain from the medium. At a specific interval, the beam is redirected, using a device such as a Pockels cell, an acousto-optic modulator, or a fast-rotating prism or mirror. This redirected beam bypasses the end mirror, allowing a very powerful pulse to be emitted. Cavity dumpers can be used for continuous-wave operation, but their most common use is with mode-locked lasers, to extract a very short pulse at its peak intensity.|$|E
50|$|In this case, the <b>Q-switch</b> is a saturable absorber, a {{material}} whose transmission increases when {{the intensity of}} light exceeds some threshold. The material may be an ion-doped crystal like Cr:YAG, which is used for Q-switching of Nd:YAG lasers, a bleachable dye, or a passive semiconductor device. Initially, {{the loss of the}} absorber is high, but still low enough to permit some lasing once a large amount of energy is stored in the gain medium. As the laser power increases, it saturates the absorber, i.e., rapidly reduces the resonator loss, so that the power can increase even faster. Ideally, this brings the absorber into a state with low losses to allow efficient extraction of the stored energy by the laser pulse. After the pulse, the absorber recovers to its high-loss state before the gain recovers, so that the next pulse is delayed until the energy in the gain medium is fully replenished. The pulse repetition rate can only indirectly be controlled, e.g. by varying the laser's pump power and the amount of saturable absorber in the cavity. Direct control of the repetition rate can be achieved by using a pulsed pump source as well as passive Q-switching.|$|E

To determine a relatively preferable fiber length for stable cw <b>Q-switched</b> operation, three active fiber simples with {{the length of}} 1. 1, 5. 3, and 7. 0 m were employed respectively in our experiments. With 1. 1 m gain fiber, we generated <b>Q-switched</b> pulses with a pulse width of 245 ns and an average power of up to 2. 2 W at a repetition rate of 620 kHz.

5000|$|Here, the <b>Q-switch</b> is an {{externally}} {{controlled variable}} attenuator. This {{may be a}} mechanical device such as a shutter, chopper wheel, or spinning mirror/prism placed inside the cavity, or (more commonly) it may be some form of modulator such as an acousto-optic device, a magneto-optic effect device or an electro-optic device — a Pockels cell or Kerr cell. The reduction of losses (increase of Q) is triggered by an external event, typically an electrical signal. The pulse repetition rate can therefore be externally controlled.Modulators generally allow a faster transition from low to high Q, and provide better control. An additional advantage of modulators is that the rejected light may be coupled out of the cavity {{and can be used}} for something else. Alternatively, when the modulator is in its low-Q state, an externally generated beam can be coupled into the cavity through the modulator. This can be used to [...] "seed" [...] the cavity with a beam that has desired characteristics (such as transverse mode or wavelength). When the Q is raised, lasing builds up from the initial seed, producing a Q-switched pulse that has characteristics inherited from the seed.|$|E
5000|$|Laser [...] — 600-1000 nm lasers {{are most}} common for non-scientific applications. They are inexpensive, {{but since they}} can be focused and easily absorbed by the eye, the maximum power {{is limited by the}} need to make them eye-safe. Eye-safety is often a {{requirement}} for most applications. A common alternative, 1550 nm lasers, are eye-safe at much higher power levels since this wavelength is not focused by the eye, but the detector technology is less advanced and so these wavelengths are generally used at longer ranges with lower accuracies. They are also used for military applications as 1550 nm is not visible in night vision goggles, unlike the shorter 1000 nm infrared laser. Airborne topographic mapping lidars generally use 1064 nm diode pumped YAG lasers, while bathymetric (underwater depth research) systems generally use 532 nm frequency doubled diode pumped YAG lasers because 532 nm penetrates water with much less attenuation than does 1064 nm. Laser settings include the laser repetition rate (which controls the data collection speed). Pulse length is generally an attribute of the laser cavity length, the number of passes required through the gain material (YAG, YLF, etc.), and <b>Q-switch</b> (pulsing) speed. Better target resolution is achieved with shorter pulses, provided the lidar receiver detectors and electronics have sufficient bandwidth.|$|E
