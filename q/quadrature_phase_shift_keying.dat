40|$|Abstract – One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in cognitive radio (CR) networks {{is the need to}} sample signals as efficiently as possible without incurring the loss of vital information. Compressive Sensing (CS) is a new sampling paradigm which provides a theoretical framework for sub-sampling signals which are characterized as being sparse in the frequency domain. The random demodulator (RD) is a CS-based architecture which has been employed to acquire frequency sparse, bandlimited signals which typify the signals which often occur in many CR-related applications. This paper investigates the impact of precolouring upon CS performance by combining the RD with an autoregressive (AR) filter model to enhance compressive spectral estimation. Quantitative results with <b>quadrature</b> <b>phased</b> <b>shift</b> <b>keying</b> (QPSK) modulated multiband signals, corroborate that adopting a precolouring strategy both reduces the spectral leakage in the power spectrum, and concomitantly improves the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance of the compressive spectrum estimator...|$|R
