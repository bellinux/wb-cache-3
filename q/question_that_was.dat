5|$|According to the author, {{he began}} {{writing the book}} {{in the same way}} he began most of his books: by {{exploring}} a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> unresolved for him. In this case, the question became the book's title. In What's So Amazing About Grace?, Yancey answers this question by writing that God gives grace to people unconditionally, without their need to earn it. His book includes Bible stories, anecdotes from Yancey's life and accounts of historical events. Similar to his other works, What's So Amazing About Grace? has a self-deprecating tone. It describes Yancey's upbringing in a judgmental church, a theme Yancey previously explored in The Jesus I Never Knew and later returned to in Reaching for the Invisible God and Soul Survivor.|$|E
5|$|For his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{turned to}} a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of Einstein's equations: model universes consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions {{play a key role}} when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully covariant theory – its laws are the same, independent of which coordinates are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions invariantly, that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.|$|E
25|$|Already in Autumn 1948, {{criticism}} {{came out}} in a joint statement by AB Atomenergi and Atom Commission. The FOA reports predicted a military monopoly over Swedish uranium resources to the detriment of civilian research, and that much larger resources were being assigned to plutonium production. The feasibility of the plutonium project was under <b>question.</b> <b>That</b> <b>was</b> the first sign of antagonism of interests between military and civilian nuclear proponents. The plans had been predicated on the idea that each nuclear device required 50kg rather than 6kg of plutonium. None of those involved in the project realized that this was, in fact, an overestimation. Although the program was scaled to produce 5-10 weapons per year, given the estimated production of 1kg of Pu-239 per day, it was actually scaled to produce sixty.|$|E

500|$|Much of {{the modern}} {{perception}} of Queen Tamar was shaped {{under the influence of}} 19th-century Romanticism and growing nationalism among Georgian intellectuals of that time. In the Russian and Western literatures of the 19th century, the image of Queen Tamar reflected the European conceptions of the Orient – of which Georgia was perceived as a part – and the position and characteristics of women in it. The Tyrolean writer Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer described Tamar as a [...] "Caucasian Semiramis". Fascinated by the [...] "exotic" [...] Caucasus, the Russian poet Mikhail Lermontov wrote the romantic poem Tamara ( [...] ; 1841) in which he utilized the old Georgian legend about a siren-like mountainous princess whom the poet gave the name of Queen Tamar. Although Lermontov's depiction of the Georgian queen as a destructive seductress had no apparent historical background, it has been influential enough to raise the issue of Tamar's sexuality, a <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> given some prominence by the 19th-century European authors. Knut Hamsun's 1903 play Dronning Tamara ("Queen Tamara") was less successful; the theatre critics saw in it [...] "a modern woman dressed in a medieval costume" [...] and read the play as [...] "a commentary on the new woman of the 1890s." [...] Russian conductor Mily Balakirev composed a symphony named [...] "Tamara".|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{then turned}} to the <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> at issue in the case: whether the disparate-impact {{regulation}} that Sandoval invoked created an implied private right of action. The Court rejected the argument, put forward both by Sandoval and by Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion, that because Cannon involved disparate impact, Cannon held that Title IX and, by extension Title VI, create a private right of action to enjoin policies that create a disparate impact. Both Sandoval and Justice Stevens relied on a footnote in Cannon, which stated that the effect of the policies that the Cannon plaintiff challenged was [...] "to exclude women from consideration." [...] The Court responded that Cannon was decided {{on the assumption that the}} University of Chicago had engaged in intentional discrimination, and hence the holding of case applied only to intentional discrimination. The Court asserted that [...] "this Court is bound by holdings, not language." [...] Therefore, from the majority's point of view, the holding of Cannon did not include the footnote.|$|E

2500|$|Unlike most game shows, {{there is}} no minimum age {{necessary}} to participate in [...] "Family Feud." [...] Each round begins with a [...] "face-off" [...] question {{that serves as a}} toss-up between two opposing contestants. The host asks a survey <b>question</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> previously posed to a group of 100 people (e.g., [...] "Name the hour that you get up on Sunday mornings."). A certain number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey's responses. Only answers that receive two or more responses can appear on the board. The first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer; if it is the most popular, his/her family immediately wins the face-off. Otherwise, the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher-ranked answer wins. Ties are broken in favor of the contestant who buzzes-in first. If neither contestant's answer is on the board, the other eight contestants have a chance to respond, one at a time from alternating sides, until an answer is revealed. The family that wins the face-off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents (except on the Combs version, when the family who won the face-off automatically gained control of the question).|$|E
