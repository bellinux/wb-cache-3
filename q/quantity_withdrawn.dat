Similarly the concentration of verapamil remaining in the central compartment was undetectable {{at the end of}} the handling and this for all three concentrations studied. The <b>quantities</b> <b>withdrawn</b> by the hemodiafiltration compartment MARS corresponded to 8, 18 and 12 % of the injected quantity, EC varied between 10 and 20 % remaining stable. The <b>quantities</b> <b>withdrawn</b> by the coal compartment activated MARS was 92, 82 and 89 % of the injected amount, the EC induced by MARS cartridge was stable in the order of 70 % throughout the manipulation.|$|R
40|$|Rock {{drilling}} {{is essential}} in the mining industry. Complexities involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties but also {{the nature of the}} drilling action impact the drilling performance and operational costs. Brittleness is a fundamental rock property relevant to rock drilling and excavation works. However, rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated. In this study, a new brittleness index developed upon fracture energy <b>quantities</b> <b>withdrawn</b> from the complete stressstrain characteristics in uniaxial compression of rock is presented. A vast independent data on the drilling performance reported elsewhere in the literature was evaluated against the new brittleness index. The results show that the proposed brittleness index successfully describes the performance of different drilling methods including PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) rotary drilling, roller-cone rotary drilling and percussive drilling.

40|$|Pumpkin Creek, a {{tributary}} of the North Platte River, historically flowed from eastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle through Banner County, and joined the North Platte River in Morrill County near Bridgeport. Over 20 years ago, Pumpkin Creek was closed to the issuance of new surface water rights by the Nebraska Department of Water Resources (now the Department of Natural Resources or DNR), due to streamflow reductions. In March 2001 the North Platte Natural Resources District (NRD) established the Pumpkin Creek Groundwater Management Subarea and closed the subarea to new well drilling. Existing wells must be metered in 2003 and <b>quantities</b> <b>withdrawn</b> reported in 2004. The Pumpkin Creek Subarea was established pursuant to a 1996 Nebraska statute authorizing NRDs to restrict groundwater uses to address conflicts between surface and groundwater users. The Pumpkin Creek Subarea was established to deal with declines in both ground water levels and streamflows...|$|R

50|$|Yield {{indicates}} {{the ability of}} a barrel set to concentrate cooked must at given operating conditions being dependent on the rate of water loss by evaporation. Low yields are due both to relatively low withdrawn and high water evaporation rates. The latter is the major factor lowering the TBV yield. The bigger is the evaporation rate, the higher is the flux of material through the barrel set and the lower is the residence time. As a consequence, when the yield is low, the vinegar age might be relatively low {{as a function of the}} amount of cooked must used to refill.Applying the spreadsheet of the theoretical model to a barrel set as in figure, the residence time obtained as a function of <b>withdrawn</b> <b>quantity</b> and evaporation rate is plotted in the concerning graph.|$|R
40|$|Designing {{policies}} for water systems management requires {{the capability to}} assess the economic impacts of water availability and to effectively couple water withdrawals by human activities with natural hydrologic dynamics. At the core of any scientific approach to these issues there is the estimation of water withdrawals by industrial sectors {{in the form of}} water coefficients, which are measurements of the <b>quantity</b> of water <b>withdrawn</b> per dollar of GDP or output. In this work we focus on the contiguous United States and on the estimation of water coefficients for regional scale analyses. We first compare an established methodology for the estimation of national water coefficients with a parametric one we propose. Second, we introduce a method to estimate water coefficients at the level of ecological regions and we discuss how they reduce possible biases in regional analyses of water systems. We conclude discussing advantages and limits of regional water coefficients...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{behaviour}} of Dutch banks. We test the adjustment of banks' balance sheets {{in times of}} monetary policy changes during the period 1957 - 1991. As a reaction to a policy change, banks basically have two alternatives to adjust their net money creation: (1) sell securities in public capital markers, and/or issue long-term liabilities, and (2) change domestic loan supply. If banks opt for the latter a lending channel may be relevant, even in a small open economy with a fixed exchange rate and {{a high degree of}} international capital mobility. We test for the effectiveness of both indirect and direct instruments of monetary policy. It turns out that in case of changes in the official interest rate, the volume of bank loans is not affected and that banks display a kind of buffer-stock behaviour by diminishing their publicly traded assets. In situations with quantity restrictions on the growth of net money creation, however, the volume of loans is affected significantly when the <b>quantity</b> restriction is <b>withdrawn</b> thereby fulfilling a necessary condition for the bank lending channel to be effective...|$|R
40|$|The list of {{barbituric acid}} {{derivatives}} is increasing with extra-ordinary rapidity and their range of employment clinically is growing wider and more varied. The danger of acute poisoning by these compounds when administered as anesthetics or pre-scribed as hypnotics is well-known. The laity, unaware of danger {{of these drugs}} even {{in the hands of}} experts, but quick to sense their hypnotic qualities, is adding to the incidence of acci-dental deaths by promiscuous self-medication with various mem-bers of the series that can be bought without a prescription at the drug counter. Instances of their employment with suicidal intent are also multiplying. These considerations have deter-mined our course in search of an effective antidote which may be employed in case of poisoning from the barbiturates. In 1925, Caussade and Tardieu (1) advised blood-letting in the treatment of barbital poisoning. In 1929, Gower and Tatum (2) advocated the principle of moderate continuous diuresis in the treatment of acute barbital poisoning. In their comments on the therapeutics of blood-letting, suggested by Caussade and Tardieu, Gower and Tatum advised that the <b>quantity</b> of blood <b>withdrawn</b> should be immediately replaced by an equivalent amount of physiological salt solution and followed at intervals by amounts of saline equal to the flow of urine. They found that the actual withdrawal of blood was inconsequential as a remedial measur...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{deals with}} a 2 -year study carried out at the water work of Ferrara (Po Valley, Italy), aiming to enhance the <b>quantity</b> of water <b>withdrawn</b> for drinking purposes by means of river bank filtration (RBK) from the Po River. The current drinking water plant (27 106 m 3 /year) is fed with the surface water of Po River (for the 80 %) and with the groundwater withdrawn by alluvional wells (for the remaining 20 %). Treatments consist of grit removal, lagooning, coagulation-flocculation-sedimentation, ozonation, sand filtration (only for surface water), activated carbon, disinfection by chlorine (for the mixture of treated surface water and groundwater). Withdrawn surface water requires all these treatments as Ferrara water work is placed at the end (50 km far from the discharge into the Adriatic Sea) of the long course of the river (652 km), downstream the discharges of developed urban and industrial areas of the Northern Italy as well as wide rural ones of the Po Valley. Recent investigations on the surface water of Po River and in some of its affluents have documented the occurrence of {{a great number of}} persistent organic compounds, including hydrocarbons, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, as well as heavy metals, questioning if adopted water treatments are adequate to guarantee a good and safety quality of the drinking water produced from surface water. The debate has increased after the oil spill in an affluent of Po River occurred in February 2010 that required a continuous (expensive) monitoring {{of the quality of the}} surface water of the Po river in many points along its course for many weeks after the accident to evaluate the possibility to withdraw it for drinking purposes. Finally, the frequent drought events happened in the last 10 years in the Po Valley have induced a severe control of the water amount withdrawn for the different needs and in some circumstances, the direct withdrawal from surface water was difficult due to the lowering of the Po level...|$|R
