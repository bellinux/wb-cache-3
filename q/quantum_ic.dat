40|$|A famous beam-split {{coincidence}} {{test of the}} photon {{model was}} performed with -rays instead of visible light. A similar test was performed to split -rays. In both tests, co- incidence rates greatly exceed chance, leading to an unquantum effect. In contradiction to quantum theory and the photon model, these new results are strong evidence of the long abandoned accumulation hypothesis, {{also known as the}} loading theory. Attention is drawn to assumptions applied to past key experiments that led to <b>quantum</b> mechan- <b>ics.</b> The history of the loading theory is outlined, and a few key experiment equations are derived, now free of wave-particle duality. Quantum theory usually works because there is a subtle difference between quantized and thresholded absorption...|$|R

40|$|This {{volume is}} a {{consequence}} of a series of seminars presented by the authors at the Infrared Spectroscopy Institute, Canisius College, Buffalo, New York, over the last nine years. Many participants on an intermediate level lacked a sufficient background in mathematics and <b>quantum</b> mechan­ <b>ics,</b> and it became evident that a non mathematical or nearly nonmathe­ matical approach would be necessary. The lectures were designed to fill this need and proved very successful. As a result of the interest that was developed in this approach, it was decided to write this book. The text is intended for scientists and students with only limited theore­ tical background in spectroscopy, but who are sincerely interested in the interpretation of molecular spectra. The book develops the detailed selection rules for fundamentals, combinations, and overtones for molecules in several point groups. Detailed procedures used in carrying out the normal coordinate treatment for several molecules are also presented. Numerous examples from the literature illustrate the use of group theory in the in­ terpretation of molecular spectra and in the determination of molecular structure...|$|R
40|$|Scaling {{limits of}} the Hamiltonian H {{of a system of}} N charged {{particles}} coupled to a quantized radiation field are considered. Ultraviolet cutoffs, &l, [...] ,,N, are imposed on the radiation field and the Coulomb gauge is taken. It is so called the Pauli-Fierz model in nonrelativistic <b>quantum</b> electrodynam- <b>ics.</b> We mainly consider two cases: (i) all the ultraviolet cutoffs are identi- cal, 1 [...] . &N, (ii) supports of ultraviolet cutoffs have no intersection, supp,i fsupp,j [...] 0, i j. The Hamiltonian acts on L 2 (dN) r, where r is a symmetric Fock space and has the form H [...] Hell+B+lHquad. Here Hel denotes a particle Hamiltonian, Hquaa a quadratic field operator, and B an in- teraction term. The scaling is introduced as H(n) [...] Hell+nIB+n 21 Hquad, where n is a scaling parameter and l _< 2 a parameter of the scaling. Perform- ing a mass renormalization we consider the scaling limit of H(n) as n - oo in the strong resolvent sense. Then effective Hamiltonians Hef in L 2 (1 d) in- fected with reaction of effect of the radiation field is derived. In particular (1) effective Hamiltonians with an effective potential for l = 2, and (2) effective Hamiltonians with an observed mass for l [...] 1, are obtained...|$|R
40|$|Nonadiabatic {{interactions}} in the NeIC 1 van der Waals complex have been explored {{in the lowest}} energy triad of IC 1 ion-pair states (approximately 39 000 cm- 1). Dispersed fluorescence measurements reveal emission characteristic of multiple ion-pair electronic states, with the relative contributions from the E(O+), beta(1), and D 2 ̆ 7 (2) states changing with the initial IC 1 vibrational excitation (v(IC 1)). Emission directly from NeIC 1 (v(IC 1) = O) complexes indicates that the initially prepared NeIC 1 levels have mixed electronic character and that the IC 1 electronic parentage changes with the initial van der Waals vibrational level selected. NeIC 1 complexes prepared with 1 - 4 <b>quanta</b> of <b>IC</b> 1 stretch undergo rapid vibrational predissociation with a strong propensity for DELTA-V(IC 1) = - 1 relaxation. The electronic state(s) populated in the IC 1 fragments differ from the mixed electronic character of the initially prepared level, demonstrating that vibrational predissociation is accompanied by nonadiabatic electronic state changing processes. The observed final state selectivity {{may be attributed to}} the relative strength of the nonadiabatic couplings between the initial NeIC 1 bound state and the final IC 1 states or a momentum gap rationale based on the overlap between the NeIC 1 bound state wave function and the highly oscillatory continuum wave function of the separating fragments...|$|R
40|$|Quantum {{algorithms}} are {{sequences of}} abstract operations, per­ formed on non-existent computers. They are in obvious need of categorical semantics. We present some steps in this direction, following earlier contribu­ tions of Abramsky, Goecke and Selinger. In particular, we analyze function abstraction in quantum computation, which {{turns out to}} characterize its clas­ sical interfaces. Intuitively, classical data can be recognized as just those data that can be manipulated using variables, i. e. copied, deleted, and abstracted over. A categorical framework of polynomial extensions provides a convenient language for specifying quantum algorithms, with a clearly distinguished clas­ sical fragment, familiar from functional programming. As a running example, we reconstruct Simon's algorithm, which is a sim­ ple predecessor of Shor's quantum algorithms for factoring and discrete loga­ rithms. The abstract specification in the framework of polynomial categories displays some of the fundamental program transformations involved in devel­ oping quantum algorithms, and points to the computational resources, whether quantum or classical, which are necessary for the various parts of the execution. The relevant resources are characterized as categorical structures. They are normally supported by the standard Hilbert space model of <b>quantum</b> mechan­ <b>ics,</b> but in some cases they can also be found in other, nonstandard models. We conclude the paper by sketching an implementation of Simon's algorithm using just abelian groups and relations. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new small {{parameter}} {{associated with the}} density matrix deformation (density pro-matrix) studied in previous works of the author is introduced into the Generalized <b>Quantum</b> Mechan- <b>ics</b> (GQM), i. e. quantum mechanics involving description of the Early Universe. It is noted that this parameter has its counterpart in the generalized statistical mechanics. Both parameters offer a number of merits: they are dimensionless, varying over the inter- val from 0 to 1 / 4 and assuming in this interval a discreet series of values. Besides, their definitions contain all the fundamental con- stants. These parameters are very small for the conventional scales and temperatures, e. g. {{the value of the}} first parameter is on the order of ≈ 10 − 66 + 2 n, where 10 −n is the measuring scale and the Planck scale ∼ 10 − 33 cm is assumed. The second one is also too small for the conventional temperatures, that is those much below the Plancks. It is demonstrated that relative to the first of these parameters the Universe may be considered as a nonuniform lattice in the four-dimensional hypercube with dimensionless finite-length (1 / 4) edges. And the time variable is also described by one of the above-mentioned dimensions due to the second parameter and gen- eralized uncertainty relations in thermodynamics. In this context the lattice is understood as a deformation rather than approxima- tion...|$|R
40|$|Molecular hydrogen, H 2, {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} constituents of the universe, acting as the molecular feedstock for much of the chemistry occurring within the interstellar medium. Although gas phase models of the chemistry of interstellar clouds have been successful in explaining the abundances of some gas phase molecules, it has long been established that they cannot account for the large abundance of molecular hydrogen. The general consen- sus of the astronomical community is that carbonaceous interstellar dust grains assume a catalytic role in the formation of H 2 molecules within interstellar clouds. First-principles calculations using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) have been performed in order to scrutinise the hydrogen-graphite interaction, with emphasis placed on how surface relaxation and grain defects modulate the H atom sticking and subsequent associative des- orption processes. It has been found that the adsorption of one hydrogen atom occurs only if a carbon atom of the graphite flake puckers from the surface by ∼ 0. 35 A. This process has an associated activation barrier of ∼ 2400 K, which is essentially insurmountable under interstellar conditions. This chemisorption barrier is notably reduced upon the introduction of surface defects and allowing for a more dynamic graphite surface. <b>Quantum</b> dynam- <b>ics</b> calculations have also been performed {{within the framework of the}} Multi Configuration Time Dependent Hartree (MCTDH) algorithm, in conjunction with a novel potential energy surface accounting for surface restructuring. The dynamics study is limited to the collinear scenario, with all degrees of freedom handled by a wavepacket description. By incorporat- ing surface motion into our dynamical model, our results suggest that a significant fraction of the total reaction energy is imparted to the surface, highlighting the importance of the adopted substrate model.

The unifying theme was his application of powerful and scrupulously controlled experimental methods to issues that really matter. Though Bob sometimes {{had to hide}} his amusement at theorists he found poorly grounded in phenomenology, he {{did not hesitate to}} speculate where the experimental ground is thin; the condition was that there had to be the possibility of a measurement that could teach us something new. He wrote: I have long believed that an experimentalist should not be unduly inhibited by theoretical untidiness. If he insists on having every last theoretical T crossed before he starts his research the chances are that he will never do a significant experiment. And the more significant and fundamental the experiment the more theoretical uncertainty may be tolerated. By contrast, the more important and difficult the experiment the more that experimental care is warranted. There is no point in attempting a half-hearted experiment with an inadequate apparatus. 1 Bob held some 50 patents, from clothes dryers to lasers. He recognized that two mirrors make a more effective laser than the traditional closed cavity of microwave technology.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMuch {{of the progress}} in solid-state microelectronics {{has come from the}} continued reduction in size of the transistors that make up integrated circuits (ICs), having dropped by a factor of 10 in the last decade to where minimum device geometries have reached approximately 350 nanometers in mass production. Continued improvements in ICs will require a device technology that can be scaled down to the sub- 100 nanometer size regime. There, the quantum mechanical nature of the electron becomes strongly evident, and new design tools are required for a nano-electronic semiconductor technology. The combined scaling and speed advantages of these new devices could portend orders of magnitude increases in the functional performance of future-generation <b>ICs.</b> <b>Quantum</b> device performance is extremely sensitive to small variations in design parameters. Accurate theoretical modeling is therefore required to guide the technology development. Conventional device design tools are based on classical physics, and do not incorporate quantum effects. New design tools are required to explicitly account for the quantum effects that control charge transport at the nanometer scale. To further understand and develop nanoscale device technology, this thesis will model the potential energy function in a quantum dot, a nanostructure in which electrons are quantum-mechanically confined in all three dimensions and which represents the inevitable result of continued downscaling of semiconductor devices[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
