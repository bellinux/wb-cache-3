Using available annual sets of quota data up to 2011, the paper shows that the top 10 countries remained broadly stable in 2009 - 2011, with one notable development: China is now the largest economy since 2009 followed by the United States, Japan and Germany. <b>Quota</b> <b>shares</b> mirror this development, notably the downward trend of the <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> of advanced economies.

The paper also explores the impact of removing openness and/or variability from the dataset used {{for the purpose of}} the PCAp.

After the quota management system was established, the government purchased back ten percent of the <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> and gave it to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission for the benefit of Māori. In 1992, the government allocated a cash settlement to Māori which they used to buy a half share of Sealord, the countries largest fishing company. In addition, the government has given Māori twenty percent of the commercial <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> of new species introduces to the quota management system, and the equivalent of twenty percent of all marine farming space created around New Zealand coasts and harbours.

50|$|Industry-wide Retention: The {{industry}} as a whole must cover a certain amount of the losses before federal assistance is available. This amount rises from $15 billion in 2005 to $25 billion in 2006 and rises again in 2007 to $27.5 billion. The difference between this amount and the aggregate amount that insurers must pay (deductibles and co-payments) can be recouped from commercial policyholders through a surcharge not to exceed 3 percent of premium for insurance coverages that fall under the TRIEA program. This reinsurance {{takes the form of a}} 90 percent <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> in excess of variable deductibles based upon a percentage of earned premium income.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the above}} {{examples}} concern reinsurance contracts that cover more than one policy (treaty). Reinsurance can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as facultative reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> or excess of loss basis. Facultative reinsurance contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. Facultative reinsurance is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas treaty reinsurance is typically purchased by a senior executive at the insurance company.|$|E

40|$|The current {{allocation}} {{of decision making}} in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), determined largely by the distribution of members' quotas, has failed {{to keep up with}} the changing world economy. The situation undermines the Fund's relevance and legitimacy in promoting global growth and economic and financial stability. A new simplified and transparent formula to guide the distribution of Fund quotas is key to IMF reform. The authors offer four recommendations to advance IMF quota reform: (1) The IMF executive board should complete its work on the new IMF quota formula by the 2007 annual meeting [...] rather than spring 2008 [...] to ensure that the other necessary elements of a reform package can be completed by spring 2008 and ratified by the IMF governors at their annual meeting in fall 2008. (2) The new quota formula should follow the recommendations of the quota formula review group (QFRG), deleting an "openness" measure from the formula. The openness variable has no economic or financial justification, and the traditional measures are biased. (3) The traditional industrial countries should agree to a target of limiting their <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> to 60 percent of their GDP shares to facilitate the further redistribution of <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> toward the nonindustrial countries. (4) A reasonable benchmark would be an increase in the size of the Fund (total quotas) by at least 50 percent to implement the redistribution of <b>quota</b> and voting <b>shares</b> under the new quota formula. ...|$|R

Workers claimed the daily quota sack size gradually increased before finally reaching double its initial size, making it near impossible to fill in a standard twelve-hour shift. Larger, and therefore heavier, sacks also made the trek up from the bottom of the mine more dangerous. The count also began changing the partido system. The partido bags the workers split with management and then were allowed to take home had always contained higher-quality ore than the quota bags, and the count now decided half of the workers’ share would now be exchanged with half of the <b>quota</b> <b>share.</b> By the end of the year, not only had the workers’ standard wages been cut, but their job was also made more dangerous by the increased quota bag size and their partido shares—-a form of “bonus” yet necessary to their livelihood-—reduced to a much lower quality ore (Ladd 47-48).|$|E

40|$|Since their inception, Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands (BSAI) crab {{fisheries}} {{have attracted}} participants willing to undertake great financial and personal risks {{to participate in}} these high valued fisheries. Although entry to the fisheries is limited, excess capital and overcapacity, together with stock declines, {{have resulted in a}} race for fish. The shortest season is in the Bristol Bay red king crab fishery, which has been prosecuted for less than one week in recent years. Efforts of managers to protect declining stocks by reducing allowable catch have increased the economic stress on participants and communities that depend on these fisheries and increased pressure on participants to take greater risks. For several years, the North Pacific Fishery Management Council worked with participants to address these problems in the crab fisheries through series of working groups and management measures. In 2001, Congress stepped in, directing the Council to assess various rationalization programs for the fisheries, including individual fishing <b>quotas</b> (IFQs), processor <b>shares,</b> cooperatives, and <b>quotas</b> held by communities. The outcome of the Council process is a new and unique management program selected by a unanimous vote of the North Pacific Council. The program reflects the Council's desire to accommodate the interests of several groups dependent on these fisheries-vessel owners, processors, captains and crew, and communities. Under the program, harvest <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> (QS) will be issued to vessel owners and captains. Processors will be issued processing <b>quota</b> <b>shares.</b> Under these allocations, 90 percent of harvest <b>quota</b> <b>shares</b> are designated for delivery to holders of processing <b>quota</b> <b>shares.</b> Community interests are protected by a requirement that a certain portion of the catch be landed and processed in designated regions. An arbitration program is included to resolve price disputes, which could arise because of the constraints on markets created by the dual share allocations. The result of the Council's action {{is one of the most}} complex fishery management programs to date. The attempt to satisfy many interests creates significant hurdles that must be overcome for the program to succeed economically and environmentally. This paper describes key dimensions of the proposed crab fishery management program and identifies the most substantial hurdles that the program must overcome for the Council to judge it a successful management program for the fisheries. First, managers will be challenged by program implementation. Implementation will require initial allocations of harvesting shares to vessel owners and captains and processing shares to processors. Most shares will be regionally designated based on the participant's landings history. Second, managers will face the challenge of protecting stocks as the incentives to high grade increase in the share-based fishery. Third, the markets for the harvest shares, captains shares, and processing shares must develop in a manner that facilitates coordination of harvesting and processing activity required by the share system and the regional landing and processing requirements. Lastly, market opportunities for harvest landings will be constrained by the requirement that deliveries be made to a processing share holder in a designated region. For the program to be considered a success, price formation in the market for landings must be perceived as fair. Each of these issues is described in a manner that provides the reader with a perspective of the institutional challenges faced by a program that attempts to address the concerns of several different interests. In addition, characteristics of the fisheries that contribute to the potential to overcome these obstacles are discussed. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|Fisheries {{economics}} {{concentrates on}} {{solving the problem}} of economic overexploitation in fisheries. The field took its first steps, as a specialized study area within economics, in the early 1950 s. The approach since then, for solving the problem of overexploitation, has mostly been one of neo-classical economics, with emphasis on the production side of the problem. A potential solution to the overexploitation problem is the privatization of fisheries {{in order to maximize}} long-term economic benefits. ^ Recent studies have shown that prices and certain product characteristics are an important factor for determining the optimal management of fisheries. This study tries to establish a methodological approach to incorporate information on prices, characteristics and environmental quality into fisheries management. ^ The study uses exports of cod fillets by Iceland to the United States as a case study for exploring import demand for specific products, and how import demand might feed back into the management process. The study uses co-integration methods to identify the most appropriate commodities in constructing a model of import demand for cod. Elasticities are then estimated using an Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) for disaggregated product groups. ^ Finally, the study concludes by establishing a link between financial theory and fisheries economics in order to incorporate market information directly into fisheries management. This study suggests that using Minimum Information Management systems, and establishing a public market in trading of permanent <b>quota</b> <b>shares,</b> along with trading in financial options on <b>quota</b> <b>shares,</b> could provide the fisheries manager with important information on tradeoffs between risk and return from a particular fishery. ...|$|R

In this thesis we introduce two criteria for finding optimal ratio of proportional reinsurance.

40|$|Alaska fishing {{charter service}} owners are seeking an {{increased}} share of halibut fish resources {{be reserved for}} the recreational guided angler sector. An organization representing the owners who fish in the International Pacific Halibut Commission Regulatory Area 2 C (southeast Alaska) and Area 3 A (southcentral Alaska) titled the Catch Accountability through Compensated Halibut (CATCH) Project are designing a plan whereby quota shares owned by commercial fishing sector are purchased and the quota pounds they represent are annually deposited in a guided angler harvest common pool. If necessary to assist in augmenting available harvestable fish from stock abundance to attain the same management regulations for both guided and unguided anglers in both regulatory areas, then the inter-sector transfers through purchases would be used. While this could {{be perceived as a}} fishery resource allocation dispute, the organization is not attempting to influence management bodies in reallocating the resource based on optimizing social welfare and economic development values. Instead the organization is looking for mechanisms that would allow it to purchase quota shares using voluntary market approaches consistent with privatized user rights and privileges. The <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> inter-sector transfer procedures will necessarily be complex for several reasons. The amount to purchase needs to be estimated within the bounds of possible future resource abundances and what new effort might be attracted into the guided angler sector. Guided angler trip demand forecasts must be developed to account for less restrictive regulations, possibly higher angler costs, and other guided angler motivations for trip making such as nationwide general economic conditions. The possible cost increases are because one <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> purchase fund raising option is to use proceeds from imposing a guided angler fishing license endorsement fee. Diverting quota pounds from the seafood market for the <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> amounts to be purchased during years of lower exploitable stock abundance (range of 500 thousand to one million net weight pounds in Area 2 C) will not in itself appreciably influence harvest price. Another reason the plan is complex is that the existing program's <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> sales rules are highly regulated in order to satisfy an objective to retain the pre-privatized fishery structure. <b>Quota</b> <b>share</b> sales in recent years are very small and amounts needed for the inter-sector transfer would greatly exceed amounts annually coming to market. The inter-sector ask price would have to be high enough to incentivize new holders to the market. It is suggested that program rules on restraining certain transfers may need to be relaxed for sufficient purchases to occur. The acquisition is for an asset that is primarily needed by the guided angler sector during periods of relative low fish resource abundances. If stock recovery is sufficient, then the asset could be leased or even divested back to the commercial fishing sector. A report was developed by economists to assist in the CATCH Project design. The report explains there will be significant challenges in conducting purchases for the benefit of a heterogeneous set of fishing charter service firms. There will be plan design problems associated with determining own industry needs; estimating angler response to fees and the changed quality of the angling experience; and, assessing commercial fishing industry <b>quota</b> <b>share</b> supply functions. There is probably sufficient flexibility for federal authorization of such a program, although establishing one is without precedent. The approval of a design is neither imminent nor assured given the required state legislative and administrative processes, the many federal and international treaty implementing unknowns, judicial review avenues, etc. However, the innovative process is deserving of consideration due to higher marginal economic benefits to local communities and the nation from reserving additional recreationally harvested fish, and concerns for a viable charter industry from customer demand response for the unequal fishery access...|$|E
