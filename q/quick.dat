40|$|Abstract This work is {{a survey}} on a special minsum-maxmin bicriteria problem, known as the <b>quickest</b> path problem, that can model the {{transmission}} of data between two nodes of a network. Moreover, the authors review the problems of ranking the K <b>quickest</b> paths, and the K <b>quickest</b> loopless paths, and compare {{them in terms of}} the worst-case complexity order. The classification presented led to the proposal of a new variant of a known K <b>quickest</b> loopless paths algorithm. Finally, applications of <b>quickest</b> path algorithms are mentioned, as well as some comparative empirical results. [URL]...|$|R

Today, Amman is known as a modern, liberal and westernized Arab city, with major mega projects such as the Abdali Urban Regeneration Project and the Jordan Gate Towers.

40|$|In {{a dynamic}} network, the <b>quickest</b> path problem {{asks for a}} path {{minimizing}} {{the time needed to}} send a given amount of flow from source to sink along this path. In practical settings, for example in evacuation or transportation planning, the reliability of network arcs depends on the specific scenario of interest. In this circumstance, the question of finding a <b>quickest</b> path among all those having at least a desired path reliability arises. In this article, this reliable <b>quickest</b> path problem is solved by transforming it to the restricted <b>quickest</b> path problem. In the latter, each arc is associated a nonnegative cost value and the goal is to find a <b>quickest</b> path among those not exceeding a predefined budget with respect to the overall (additive) cost value. For both, the restricted and reliable <b>quickest</b> path problem, pseudopolynomial exact algorithms and fully polynomial-time approximation schemes are proposed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{increasing}} role of <b>quickest</b> paths for on-demand routing in computer networks, {{it is important to}} compute them faster, perhaps, by trading-off the quality for computational speed. We consider the computation of a <b>quickest</b> path from a source node to a destination node for a given message size in a network with n nodes and m links each of which is specified by bandwidth and delay. Every known <b>quickest</b> path algorithm computes m shortest paths either directly or indirectly, and this step contributes to most of its computational complexity which is generally of the form O(m 2 +mnlogn). We present a probabilistic <b>quickest</b> path algorithm that computes an approximate <b>quickest</b> path with time complexity O(pm+pnlogn) by randomly selecting p⩽m bandwidths at which the shortest paths are computed. We show that the delay of the computed path is close to optimal with a high probability that approaches 1 exponentially fast with respect to p/m. Simulation results indicate that this algorithm computes the optimal <b>quickest</b> paths with p/m 40. We also present an algorithm to compute the path-table consisting of these approximate <b>quickest</b> paths with the same time complexity of O(pm+pnlogn) ...|$|R
