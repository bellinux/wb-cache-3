40|$|Successful {{knowledge}} transfer {{is an important}} process which requires continuous improvement in today's knowledgeintensive economy. However, improving {{knowledge transfer}} processes represents a challenge {{for most of the}} small and medium size consulting firms. In recent years, the terminology 'knowledge management' initiative has been introduced. The concept of knowledge management (KM) is seen as the solution through the inculcation of knowledge sharing via various tools and techniques in managing the knowledge within parties in construction. Through intranet as one of the KM tools, the organisations are able to create, acquire and transfer knowledge. The aim of this research paper was to investigate how quantity surveying (QS) consulting firms is exploiting intranet technology in facilitating knowledge management in order to deliver <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> efficiently. A qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews was adopted as the method used to establish current knowledge management practices and the tools used for sharing knowledge and learning. The study finds that the use of intranet has not been used to its fullest potential due to the barriers and challenges in using intranet as KM tools. Thus has created some problems with regard to deliver <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> efficiently. A discussion is also included on the future research direction {{for the development of a}} conceptual framework to support the integration of quantity's surveyor services with relevant knowledge management initiative. © 2012 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|A competency-based {{review of}} {{professional}} quantity surveying {{is important for}} service excellence and has continuing relevance in the built environment of the 21 st century. A survey of quantity surveyors in professional practice in South Africa has provided {{a new perspective on}} the relative importance of competencies required for current and future <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> <b>services,</b> and revealed notable gaps between the important competencies and current proficiency levels among practitioners. The survey was based on a structured questionnaire reflecting 23 defined competencies, which were derived from the literature and from in-depth interviews with selected practitioners. The results indicated that technically orientated competencies were rated of highest importance for current services, while management orientated competencies were rated of higher importance for future services. The profession was rated as deploying below average proficiency levels in marketing, advanced financial management, leadership and general management, and project management, although these received high current and future importance ratings. The findings suggest that initial and continuing education and training of professional quantity surveyors should emphasize the development of management-orientated competencies.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree of Master of Technology in Construction Management Department of Construction Management and Quantity Surveying in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2014 Many South African quantity surveying practitioners are not committed to developing knowledge and skills, a factor that may hinder the development and viability of the firm. Owing to this problem, the research focuses on the strategic role of management {{with an emphasis on}} the support mechanisms for learning and the development of knowledge. The research population focuses on professional quantity surveying firms in the Western Cape region of South Africa. The aim of the research is to understand and identify key components of management‟s strategic influence on: (a) the organisation‟s culture, (b) the development of knowledge and (c) the development of related services and skills within professional quantity surveying firms. The research methodology consists of both qualitative and quantitative methods. Management members provided qualitative data by participating in interviews and staff members provided quantitative data by completing questionnaires. The data for the research comprised a criterion sample of eleven small- and medium-sized diversified firms. The core elements of the research are the organisational culture, learning, and the development of knowledge and service diversification. The research expands information on management‟s role in the organisation‟s culture and development of knowledge in professional quantity surveying firms. The research found that there are many supportive learning elements within the organisational cultures of most quantity surveying firms. Most management members discuss employee development and performance issues, and the lessons learnt from projects. Management occasionally mentors employees and regularly allows employees to undertake challenging work activities. Management members do not, however, include employees {{in the development of the}} firm‟s related services. Management primarily established related services because there was a need for these services. The development and transfer of related service knowledge and skills are restricted to management members to a large degree. Management‟s influence on the development of knowledge and skills of employees is somewhat limited and inconsistent. Organisational culture factors such as job satisfaction and the professional development of staff members have to be given appropriate attention by management, especially from a consistency and formal standpoint. Elements that require reviewing include the time allocated for internal learning activities and learning initiatives, other than on-the-job training. Service diversification factors, such as management members restriction of staff members to core <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> <b>services,</b> also have to be reconsidered. Elements of some related services may improve the quality of core <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> <b>services.</b> KEYWORDS: QUANTITY SURVEYING; PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FIRM; CULTURE; LEARNING; KNOWLEDGE; SERVICE DIVERSIFICATIO...|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of consultants {{in meeting the}} needs of clients in the built environment of a developing economy is influenced by their recognition and application of context-relevant competencies. This paper presents a model of the important competencies required of those providing current <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> <b>services</b> and discusses the critical inputs expected of key role-players. A review of related literature followed by in-depth interviews of selected practitioners yielded twenty-three defined competencies that were presented in a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was completed by 150 practitioners from a proportional stratified random sample of professional quantity surveyors in South Africa. The techniques of re-scaling, factor analysis, content analysis and ranking were applied to the survey feedback. Results showed a high degree of consistency among all respondents, regardless of demographic differences, in the ranking {{of the importance of the}} competencies. A four-factor solution was obtained from factor analysis of the rated competencies and suggested that the body of knowledge, skills and values that underpin quantity surveying could be represented in a simplified model. The four competency dimensions, in order of importance are labelled Relationships, Built environment objectives, Technical skills, and Property economics. To sustain the model, academic institutions, individual quantity surveying firms and the Association of South African Quantity Surveyors have defined roles to play.

40|$|Purpose - <b>Quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> {{firms are}} {{characterized}} by their professional identity and knowledge-driven nature; knowledge is crucial to their success in the competitive and dynamic business environment. As knowledge management {{is still in its}} infancy in the construction industry and structured knowledge management processes have not yet been adequately deployed in the surveying discipline, this research seeks to focus on the implicit knowledge management processes being undertaken in professional <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> firms in Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach - A framework of knowledge processes was developed from a detailed literature review in an attempt to enhance the knowledge flow in Hong Kong professional <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> firms. The applicability and validity of the framework were verified by quantitative research methods. Based on the proposed process model, a questionnaire survey was then conducted to study the opinions of professional quantity surveyors on the details of these processes; the questionnaire was returned with a response rate of 42. 6 percent out of 260. Findings - From the findings of the questionnaire survey, the research confirms the six knowledge management processes in <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> firms, namely acquisition, creation, storage, distribution, use, and maintaining. There is a general lack of specifically assigned staff for knowledge acquisition from external sources, knowledge acquisition having an overall mean value marginally below the passing point, and a relatively low reliance on external knowledge by these firms. Research limitations/implications - The paper unravels some of the mysteries and difficulties of transferring knowledge both within and across projects. The findings can equally be applied in other project-based industries. Practical implications - A clear policy/strategy governing the ways in which knowledge should be handled is far from prevalent in Hong Kong <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> firms. The appointment of managers for knowledge aspects was only carried out by one third of the responding quantity surveyors. Despite the absence of such an appointment and policy, nearly half of the responding quantity surveyors can seek the necessary knowledge when they need it. Originality/value - Although the study applies uniquely to <b>quantity</b> <b>surveying</b> professional <b>services</b> firms and may not yield an evaluation that is comparable with previous studies, it is hoped that the same survey instrument can be applied to other types of project-based professional services organizations in order to find out whether there are differences among different professions in terms of how they manage their organizational knowledge. In addition, these future studies can offer a benchmarking effect to firms providing customized professional services to clients. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R
