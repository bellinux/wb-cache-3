5|$|Ireland's Odonata fauna is <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> {{from that}} of Britain, with many fewer {{breeding}} species, but one additional species not found in Britain, Irish Damselfly Coenagrion lunulatum – see List of Odonata species of Ireland for more information.|$|E
5|$|Laucke's {{classical}}/flamenco musical {{style is}} {{a blend of}} his classical studies with Bream, Segovia, Valdès-Blain, and his friendship with deLucía. Although classical and flamenco guitar are two <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> musical styles, Québec's French-language newspaper Le Soleil chronicled Laucke's feelings and reasoning about performing both.|$|E

5|$|The {{concentrations}} {{of the other}} ions in cytosol are <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from those in extracellular fluid and the cytosol also contains much higher amounts of charged macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids than {{the outside of the}} cell structure.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking over}} the {{administration}} of the country in 1945, the Communist Party changed the administrative model to that of the Soviet Union (regions and raions) in 1950, but changed it back in 1968. Nevertheless, the county borders set then were <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from those present during the interbellum, as only 39 counties were formed from the 56 remaining after the war.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of dualism is that the mental and the physical seem to have <b>quite</b> <b>different,</b> and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E

5|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Schubert's last sonatas {{have long}} been historically neglected, dismissed as inferior in style to Beethoven's piano sonatas. However, the negative view has changed during the late twentieth century, and today these works are usually praised for their conveying of an idiosyncratic, personal Schubertian style, indeed <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from Beethoven's, but holding its own virtues. In this mature style, the Classical perception of harmony and tonality, and the treatment of musical structure, are radically altered, generating a new, distinct type of sonata form.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{left his}} brother-in-law's home {{a year later}} and went {{to live and work}} on a sheep farm. The family he lived with were devout Seventh Day Adventists. During this time, he became {{convinced}} that their view of the Bible and its teachings were <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> than what he had been raised to understand, but he accepted their religion entirely.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B.attenuata in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Cyrtostylis, a large and rather heterogenous series of twelve species. He conceded its large emarginate cotyledons (having a notch in their apex) were <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from other members, {{and that it had}} similarities in flower architecture to another anomalous member B.elegans. He felt B.attenuata to have affinities to B.lindleyana and B.media.|$|E

5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from those of atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E
5|$|Once {{they have}} {{collected}} nectar and pollen, female workers {{return to the}} nest and deposit the harvest into brood cells, or into wax cells for storage. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees only store a few days' worth of food, so are much more vulnerable to food shortages. Male bumblebees collect only nectar and do so to feed themselves. They may visit <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> flowers from the workers because of their different nutritional needs.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius {{does not}} try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull {{strongly}} with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour is <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs.|$|E

5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> and her writing is not like Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson {{was the only other}} lesbian author they could recall.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|The Georgia Tech {{campus is}} located in Midtown, an area north of {{downtown}} Atlanta. Although a number of skyscrapers—most visibly the headquarters of AT, The Coca-Cola Company, and Bank of America—are visible from all points on campus, the campus itself has few buildings over four stories and {{has a great deal}} of greenery. This gives it a distinctly suburban atmosphere <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> from other Atlanta campuses such as that of Georgia State University.|$|E

5|$|The geology of Shetland is <b>quite</b> <b>different.</b> It is {{extremely}} complex, with numerous faults and fold axes. These islands are the northern outpost of the Caledonian orogeny {{and there are}} outcrops of Lewisian, Dalriadan and Moine metamorphic rocks with similar histories to their equivalents on the Scottish mainland. There are also small Old Red Sandstone deposits and granite intrusions. The most distinctive feature is the ultrabasic ophiolite, peridotite and gabbro on Unst and Fetlar, which are remnants of the Iapetus Ocean floor. Much of Shetland's economy depends on the oil-bearing sediments in the surrounding seas.|$|E
5|$|The {{rippling}} preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} the Alpine chough are <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> {{from the more}} typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling churr alarm call, {{and a variety of}} quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E
5|$|The sheep {{industry}} in Spain was {{an instance of}} migratory flock management, with large homogenous flocks ranging over the entire country. The management model used in England was <b>quite</b> <b>different</b> but had a similar importance to economy of the country. Up until the early 20th century, owling (the smuggling of sheep or wool out of the country) was a punishable offense, {{and to this day}} the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords sits on a cushion known as the Woolsack.|$|E
