40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increase}} in the use of structural stainless steel, mainly owing to its aesthetic and architectural qualities alongside durability. Among stainless steels, ferritic grades are characterized by low nickel content resulting in a more cost-stable and economic material compared with austenitic stainless steels, allowing a balanced approach between economic and environmental aspects. As an introduction, this paper presents the recent research outcomes especially concerning the currently ongoing RFCS project “Structural Applications of Ferritic Stainless Steels”. Then, attention is paid to the advantages and challenges {{associated with the use of}} this material in recent construction projects in view of sustainability. Life cycle analysis is explained. The background of the new European standard EN 15804 is described, including Module D, which takes now into account the end-of-life phase. Life cycle inventories of stainless steel products (cold-rolled coils and <b>quarto</b> <b>plate)</b> are presented. Depending on the fraction of material recovered at the end of the lifespan, several potential impacts such as the Primary Energy Demand and Global Warming Potential are compared for four grades: 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and 1. 4401 (AISI 316) austenitic grades, 1. 4016 (AISI 430) ferritic grade and 1. 4462 (AISI 2205) duplex grade. The influence of the end-of-life credits and loads is underlined. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen an {{increase}} in the use of stainless steel in buildings, mainly owing to its corrosion properties and therefore long service life. Among stainless steels, ferritic and lean duplex grades are characterized by low nickel content resulting in a more cost-stable and economic material compared to austenitic stainless steels. These grades have comparable (or even higher) strength than carbon steel and good corrosion resistance at lower cost. That is why, lately, they have been more often used in structural components. In this paper, attention is firstly paid to the advantages {{associated with the use of}} stainless steel in recent construction projects in view of sustainability. Secondly, life cycle analysis and the background of the new European standard EN 15804 are introduced, including Module D, which allows credits to be taken now for the eventual reuse or recycling of material in the future, at the end-of-life stage. Life cycle inventories of stainless steel products (cold-rolled coils and <b>quarto</b> <b>plate)</b> are presented. Depending on the fraction of material recovered at the end of the lifespan, two potential impacts (Primary Energy Demand and Global Warming Potential) are presented for four grades: 1. 4301 (AISI 304) and 1. 4401 (AISI 316) austenitic grades, 1. 4016 (AISI 430) ferritic grade and 1. 4462 (AISI 2205) duplex grade.

40|$|Sweden is an industrialized country {{endowed with}} such natural {{resources}} as extensive forests, rich iron ore deposits, and abundant hydroelectric power. Its economy slackened {{during the first}} half of 2001 with an overall growth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 1. 4 %. Swedish industry, which included metal products manufacturing, contributed 27. 9 % of GDP. The per capita income for the country was $ 26, 200. The inflation rate was low and steady at 2. 6 % (U. S. Department of State, 2002 § 1). The Government budget improved to a surplus of 8 % of GDP in 2001. Besides iron ore, other significant mineral resources were base metals (copper, lead, and zinc) and industrial minerals (dolomite, feldspar, granite, kaolin, limestone, and quartz). Poplar Resources Ltd. of Canada investigated the Bottenbacken polymetallic-palladium property. Geophysical surveys were completed, and drilling was expected to begin in August. Dragon Mining NL of Australia completed a bankable feasibility study of its 60 % owned Svartliden gold deposit, which is 70 kilometers from Lycksele in the Skelleftea district. Lappland Goldminers AB was investigating gold mineralization at the Faboliden and the Stortjarnshobben prospects in the vicinity of Lycksele (Mining Journal, 2001 c). Outokumpu Steel Oyj and Avesta Sheffield AB merged to form AvestaPolarit Oyj Abp. The company planned to close its Degerfors melting shop and billet-rolling operation by 2003. The plant’s production capacity for blooms and billets was 200, 000 metric tons per year (t/yr). About 330 out of Degerfors’ 700 employees would be laid off in the closure. Degerfors would continue rolling and finishing of stainless <b>quarto</b> <b>plate</b> (Metal Bulletin, 2001 j). In the third quarter of 2001, output at the Degerfors meltshop was reduced. Production at the Steckel mill at Avesta also was trimmed because of operating problems. Billiton Development Far East BV and Billiton Arctic Resources BV entered into an alliance with Lake Resources NL of Australia to explore for iron-oxide-hosted copper/gold and hybrid zinc/lead/silver base-metal deposits in granted tenements in the Norbotten district of northern Sweden. The majority of the planned $ 500, 000 would be used to explore the Klingersel and Tjamotis tenements. On completion of initial scout drillin...|$|E

500|$|The {{work was}} {{illustrated}} with tables and plates (at {{the end of}} Volume IV) covering {{only some of the}} species mentioned. A much larger set of illustrations, said by Cuvier to be [...] "as accurate as they were elegant" [...] was published by the entomologist Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville in his Iconographie du Règne Animal de G. Cuvier, the nine volumes appearing between 1829 and 1844. The 448 <b>quarto</b> <b>plates</b> by Christophe Annedouche, Canu, Eugène Giraud, Lagesse, Lebrun, Vittore Pedretti, Plée and Smith illustrated some 6200 animals.|$|R
50|$|Von Winthem visited Meigen in 1826. Meigen {{also made}} a trip in that year to Crefeld and Düsseldorf. The {{following}} year, 1827, a Handbuch für Schmetterlingsliebhaber (Handbook for Butterfly Collectors) appeared under his name, and he also started a much larger work on Lepidoptera. This latter appeared in fascicles, each of 10 <b>quarto</b> <b>plates</b> lithographed by Meigen himself. It went as far asthe Euphalaenae, where lack of funds brought it to a close. He coloured the plates in a few copies. The figures, except a very few borrowed from other works, were drawn by Meigen from specimens, many {{from the collection of}} an old friend Seeger.|$|R

50|$|In 1800, Milbert {{embarked}} on Nicolas Baudin's voyage to Australia. During the voyage, Milbert {{and several other}} artists became ill, and the artists and the captain came into conflict. This caused several artists, including Milbert, to leave the voyage at Mauritius, leaving Charles-Alexandre Lesueur to produce the voyage's scientific drawings. Milbert returned to France, where in 1812 he published a series of views of Mauritius, the Cape Colony and Tenerife, titled , comprising two octavo volumes of text, and one <b>quarto</b> volume of <b>plates.</b>|$|R
60|$|These hints {{enabled me}} to {{comprehend}} more fully {{the arrangement of the}} table. The two ends were occupied by two partners of the house. And the host seemed to have adopted Addison's ideas as to the literary precedence of his guests. A popular poet had the post of honor, opposite to whom was a hot-pressed traveller in <b>quarto,</b> with <b>plates.</b> A grave-looking antiquarian, who had produced several solid works, which were much quoted and little read, was treated with great respect, and seated next to a neat, dressy gentleman in black, who had written a thin, genteel, hot-pressed octavo on political economy that was getting into fashion. Several three-volume duodecimo men of fair currency were placed about the centre of the table; while the lower end was taken up with small poets, translators, and authors, who had not as yet risen into much notice.|$|R
60|$|Owing to the {{competition}} which existed between the publishers, the printers, and the engravers {{of the city of}} Hubbabub, and the great exertions of the intelligent individual, the Narrative of Captain Popanilla's Voyage was brought out in less than a week, and was immediately in everybody's hand. The work contained a detailed account of everything which took place daring the whole of the three days, and formed a <b>quarto</b> volume. The <b>plates</b> were numerous and highly interesting, There was a line engraving of Alligator Mountain and a mezzotint of Seaweed Island; a view of the canoe N.E.; a view of the canoe N.W.; a view of the canoe S.E.; a view of the canoe S.W. There were highly-finished coloured drawings of the dried fish and the breadfruit, and an exquisitely tinted representation of the latter in a mouldy state. But the chef-d'oeuvre was the portrait of the Author himself. He was represented trampling on the body of a boa constrictor of the first quality, in the skin of which he was dressed; at his back were his bow and arrows; his right hand rested on an uprooted pine-tree; he stood in a desert between two volcanoes; at his feet was a lake of magnitude; the distance lowered with an approaching tornado; but a lucky flash of lightning revealed the range of the Andes and both oceans. Altogether he looked the most dandified of savages, and the most savage of dandies. It was a sublime lithograph, and produced scarcely less important effects upon Popanilla's fortune than that lucky 'lock of hair;' for no sooner was the portrait published than Popanilla received a ticket for the receptions of a lady of quality. On showing it to Skindeep, he was told that the honour was immense, and therefore he must go by all means. Skindeep regretted that he could not accompany him, but he was engaged to a lecture on shoemaking; and a lecture was a thing he made it a point never to miss, because, as he very properly observed, 'By lectures you may become extremely well informed without any of the inconveniences of study. No fixity of attention, no continuity of meditation, no habits of reflection, no aptitude of combination, are the least requisite; all which things only give you a nervous headache; and yet you gain all the results of all these processes. True it is that that which is so easily acquired is not always so easily remembered; but what of that? Suppose you forget any subject, why then you go to another lecture.' 'Very true!' said Popanilla.|$|R
