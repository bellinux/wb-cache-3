It has been increasingly reported that the multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) is promising for handling multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). MOEA/D employs scalarizing functions to convert an MOP {{into a number of}} single-objective subproblems. Among them, penalty boundary intersection (PBI) {{is one of the most}} popular decomposition approaches and has been widely adopted for dealing with MOPs. However, the original PBI uses a constant penalty value for all subproblems and has difficulties in achieving a good distribution and coverage of the Pareto front for some problems. In this paper, we investigate the influence of the penalty factor on PBI, and suggest two new <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes,</b> i. e., adaptive <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme</b> (APS) and subproblem-based <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme</b> (SPS), to enhance the spread of Pareto optimal solutions. The new <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes</b> are examined on several complex MOPs, showing that PBI with the use of them is able to provide a better approximation of the Pareto front than the original one. The SPS is further integrated into a recently-developed MOEA/D variant to help balance the population diversity and convergence. Experimental results show that it can significantly enhance the algorithm’s performance...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{theoretical}} {{developments in the}} field of antitrust law enforcement, much still {{needs to be done in}} order to prevent collusion and price-fixing in the major indiustries. Although penalties were recently increased considerably and new instruments of cartel deterrence such as leniency programs, were introduced, still complete deterrence of antitrust law violations has not been achieved. This thesis contributes to the solution of the problem of optimal competition law enforcement. We approach this problem from the angle of possible refinements of current <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes</b> for violations of competition law. In particular, we determine the optimal combination of instruments such as the amount of the fine and the rate of law enforcement, and the optimal structure and design of leniency programs. In the thesis, the main features of current penalty systems are modeled employing the tools of game theory, dynamic games, and dynamic optimization. We stress the importance of the dynamic analysis of competition law enforcement, since it captures better both the current antitrust rules and the crime process in general. Application of the above-mentioned tools allows us to compare current US and EU <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes</b> for violations of antitrust law and to develop policy implications on how existing <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes</b> can be modified in order to increase their deterrence power. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{twenty years}} ago, the United States Supreme Court held that both {{mandatory}} capital sentencing schemes and total discretionary capital sentencing schemes violate the Eighth Amendment. According to Jeffrey Kirchmeier, the 2 ̆ 2 guided discretion 2 ̆ 2 capital sentencing scheme of sentencing factors that has developed, however, has the constitutional problems of both mandatory death penalties and unlimited discretion death penalties. Justices Scalia, Blackmun, and Thomas {{have noted that}} the mandate of unlimited mitigating circumstances has resulted in an arbitrary system. Kirchmeier argues that today 2 ̆ 7 s sentencing scheme is arbitrary also because of undefined aggravating factors, unlimited nonstatutory aggravating factors, and victim impact evidence. According to Kirchmeier, the death <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme</b> also has moved toward a mandatory scheme as legislatures expand death penalty statutes and the Court sanctions other expansions of {{the application of the}} penalty. Thus, argues Kirchmeier, the paradox of the present system is that it is both arbitrary and mandatory. Focusing on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions regarding aggravating and mitigating factors, this Article discusses the arbitrary and mandatory aspects of the current system and then examines five options for addressing those constitutional problems: keeping the present system, narrowing the application of the death penalty, returning to unguided discretion statutes, returning to mandatory death <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes,</b> or, as Justices Blackmun and Powell have suggested, abandoning the death penalty. This Article concludes that a mandatory death <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme</b> {{is the only way to}} potentially apply the death penalty in an evenhanded manner. The mandatory aspects of the current scheme and the historical experience with mandatory death <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes,</b> however, illustrate that no human system for selecting defendants for the ultimate punishment can be both fair and nonarbitrary...|$|R

40|$|The {{reform of}} the {{electricity}} distribution industry {{has resulted in the}} national regulator authorities moving from Rate of Return (ROR) to Incentive Based Regulation (IBR) quality regulation mechanism. This has influenced the reporting, planning, design, operating and maintenance (O&M) philosophy surrounding distribution networks and service delivery to the end customer. The introduction of IBR regulation has created a need to understand how the IBR scheme implemented will influence the capital and operating investment decisions. The aim of the work leading up to this thesis has been to develop reliability hurdle rates that include the effect of the IBR scheme implemented by the national regulator authority of South Africa. This will enable the network planner to compare the investment decision with the reward / <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme.</b> The thesis addresses the challenges facing distribution network planning to achieve the appropriate (optimal) balance of investment cost vs. reliability levels. Value Based Reliability Planning (VBRP) methodology is an approach to evaluate capital investment decisions by quantifying, in economic terms, the benefits of improving reliability (System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) per capital cost required) by comparing different reliability improvement alternatives. This is achieved by relating the investment decision to the reward / <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme</b> introduced by National Electricity Regulator for South Africa (NERSA). To reach this goal this thesis derived a reliability hurdle rate by utilising benefit-to-cost analysis principles by considering the shape of the reward / <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme.</b> Furthermore, this necessitates the determination of the optimal balance between investment decisions to obtain improvement in the continuity of supply indices. One of the fundamental objectives is therefore to relate the IBR and VBRP in an efficient and effective way, that is the aim of the national regulator authority. A new method to determine a regional and national reliability hurdle rate is proposed by the thesis. This is a first step in obtaining an optimal expansion alternative and allows the planner to compare the preferred alternative selected against a hurdle rate. Since the method considers the reward / <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme,</b> the thesis first reviews the principles that influence the quality regulation mechanisms and the benefit-to-cost analysis techniques. The second step demonstrates the derivation of the reliability hurdle rate utilising the reward / <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme</b> adopted within South Africa. Parameters considered include the number of customers and the interruption indices in each region. The application studies demonstrate the derivation of the regional reliability hurdle rate from the six regions within South Africa. This allows the derivation of regional reliability hurdle rate from the different regional reward / <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes.</b> Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to understand the influence of different parameters, which will influence the regional reliability hurdle rate. The results from the case studies show that, when NERSA creates the reward / <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme,</b> it is crucial that the approved method is applied to determine the shape of the scheme implemented, which will allow the derivation of the reliability hurdle rate. The new method is suitable for implementation where the IBR quality regulation mechanism has been adopted by the national electricity authorities. Furthermore, the reliability hurdle rate derived can be used to compare the investment decision against the improvement required in the continuity of supply indices. This ensures the trade-off between the expansion investment and improvement in the reliability level...|$|R

A comparison is made between the performance of people working under one PM and those working under three PM. Additionally, the performance of participants working under a bonus scheme is compared with a penalty-framed incentive scheme. The results indicate that it is better to use multiple PM, because it inspires higher effort intensity and better effort allocation. Furthermore, it is better to frame incentives as a <b>penalty</b> <b>scheme,</b> instead of as a bonus scheme, because loss aversion has a higher performance impact than perceived fairness. However, the difference between bonus and <b>penalty</b> <b>schemes</b> is not larger with multiple versus a single PM, because loss aversion under multiple PM is higher for bonuses than for penalties.

The Balancing Rule model defines the optimal set of decisions as those which minimize the maximum non-exceedance probability of the levels of the decisions within a specified forecast horizon. In contrast, the <b>Penalty</b> <b>Scheme</b> model defines the optimal decisions as the set of operations which minimize the assessed penalties, for non-ideal operations, within the forecast horizon.

In each case, the operations over a period of about 550 days were simulated and compared. ^ The results of the numerical experiment also revealed a counter-intuitive conclusion about the performance of penalty-based models dispelling formerly held notions about their performance as more (perfect) forecasts are used. ^ A review of a classical Inventory Theory problem called the Newsboy or Christmas Tree problem was exploited to provide some analytical motivation for the proposed Balancing Rule model. ...|$|R
