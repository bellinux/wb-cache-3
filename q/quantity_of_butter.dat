But, to my great satisfaction, I foresee better times; the ancient manner beginneth to be now practised {{in many parts of}} Connaught, {{as well as in the}} county of Cork; where the squires turn tenants to themselves, divide so many cattle to their slaves, who are to provide such a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> hides, or tallow, still keeping up their number of cattle; and carry the goods to Cork, or other port towns, and then sell them to the merchants.

The Doctor was very fond of eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant, instead of contriving to gratify him at little expense, gave her cook as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen in her offices.

It was {{very clear that the}} young gentleman who had only showed that he had {{forgotten}} his conic sections could not be supposed to have passed. The austerity of the last few years had deterred more young men from coming forward than the extra £10 had induced to do so. One unfortunate, on the failure of all his hopes, had thrown himself into the Thames from the neighbouring boat-stairs; and though he had been hooked out uninjured by the man who always attends there with two wooden legs, the effect on his parents' minds had been distressing. Shortly after this occurrence the chief clerk had been invited to attend the Board, and the Chairman of the Commissioners, who, on the occasion, was of course prompted by the Secretary, recommended Mr. Hardlines to be a leetle more lenient. In doing so the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> which he poured over Mr. Hardlines' head and shoulders with the view of alleviating the misery which such a communication would be sure to inflict, was very great. But, nevertheless, Mr. Hardlines came out from the Board a crestfallen and unhappy man. 'The service,' he said, 'would go to the dogs, and might do for anything he cared, and he did not mind how soon. If the Board chose to make the Weights and Measures a hospital for idiots, it might do so. He had done what little lay in his power to make the office respectable; and now, because mammas complained when their cubs of sons were not allowed to come in there and rob the public and destroy the office books, he was to be thwarted and reprimanded! He had been,' he said, 'eight-and-twenty years in office, and was still in his prime--but he should,' he thought, 'take advantage of the advice of his medical friends, and retire.

6000|$|It {{commenced}} {{by eating}} one dozen large blue-mass pills, box and all; then it fell {{down a flight}} of stairs, and arose with a blue and purple knot on its forehead, after which it proceeded in quest of further refreshment and amusement. It found a glass trinket ornamented with brass-work --smashed up and ate the glass, and then swallowed the brass. Then it drank about twenty drops of laudanum, {{and more than a dozen}} tablespoonfuls of strong spirits of camphor. The reason why it took no more laudanum was because there was no more to take. After this it lay down on its back, and shoved five or six inches of a silver-headed whalebone cane down its throat; got it fast there, and it was all its mother could do to pull the cane out again, without pulling out some of the child with it. Then, being hungry for glass again, it broke up several wine glasses, and fell to eating and swallowing the fragments, not minding a cut or two. Then it ate a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter,</b> pepper, salt, and California matches, actually taking a spoonful of butter, a spoonful of salt, a spoonful of pepper, and three or four lucifer matches at each mouthful. (I will remark here that this thing of beauty likes painted German lucifers, and eats all she can get of them; but she prefers California matches, which I regard as a compliment to our home manufactures of more than ordinary value, coming, as it does, from one who is too young to flatter.) Then she washed her head with soap and water, and afterward ate what soap was left, and drank as much of the suds as she had room for; after which she sallied forth and took the cow familiarly by the tail, and got kicked heels over head. At odd times during the day, when this joy forever happened to have nothing particular on hand, she put in the time by climbing up on places, and falling down off them, uniformly damaging her self in the operation. As young as she is, she speaks many words tolerably distinctly; and being plainspoken in other respects, blunt and to the point, she opens conversation with all strangers, male or female, with the same formula, [...] "How do, Jim?" [...] Not being familiar with the ways of children, it is possible that I have been magnifying into matter of surprise things which may not strike any one who is familiar with infancy as being at all astonishing. However, I cannot believe that such is the case, and so I repeat that my report of this baby's performances is strictly true; and if any one doubts it, I can produce the child. I will further engage that she will devour anything that is given her (reserving to myself only the right to exclude anvils), and fall down from any place to which she may be elevated (merely stipulating that her preference for alighting on her head shall be respected, and, therefore, that the elevation chosen shall be high enough to enable her to accomplish this to her satisfaction). But I find I have wandered from my subject; so, without further argument, I will reiterate my conviction that not all babies are things of beauty and joys forever.|$|E

Yet butter also had numerous, widespread non-culinary uses such as the payment of taxes, rents, and fines; facilitation of hospitality; care of the sick and infirm; and strengthening of social bonds. On occasion, butter might also have less prestigious applications, including waterproofing, and making candles or even cement. The frequency with which famines and animal epidemics struck would have necessitated development of storage techniques to protect this important product. It is possible many stashes were never retrieved due to enemy occupation or simple forgetfulness.|$|E

Antrim’s first senior championship outing was an All-Ireland quarter-final with Galway at Corrigan Park in Belfast. There was mild surprise when Antrim emerged as the winners by 7-0 to 6-2. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final saw Kilkenny travel to Belfast to take on Antrim. What transpired in Corrigan Park turned out to be one of the most shocking results in the history of the All-Ireland championship. Walsh’s side took a half-time lead of 2-2 to 1-3 and hung on in the second-half. Antrim finally came through by 3-3 to 1-6. For the first time ever a team from the northern province would compete in the All-Ireland final. Cork, the champions of the previous two years, provided the opposition as up to 50,000 people traveled to Croke Park. The economic reality of the Emergency saw an unusual exchange take place prior to the game as Walsh presented a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> to Cork captain Mick Kennefick, who in turn handed over tea to his opposite number.

That year Armstrong collected his second Ulster title before lining out against Galway in the All-Ireland quarter-final. That game, played at Corrigan Park in Belfast, threw up a surprise result as Antrim defeated Galway by 7-0 to 6-2. This allowed Armstrong's side to advance to an All-Ireland semi-final meeting with Kilkenny and, once again, the game was played at Corrigan Park. It was another historic win for Antrim as 'the Cats' were defeated by 3-3 to 1-6. It was the biggest shock in the history of the All-Ireland championship. For the first time in history a team from Ulster qualified to play in the All-Ireland final. Cork, the champions of the previous two years, provided the opposition on this occasion. Before the game, the economic realities of the time surfaced. Jimmy Walsh, the Antrim captain presented a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> to the Cork captain, Seán Condon, who in turn presented his counterpart with a quantity of tea.

50|$|In 1938 the Institute, {{despite its}} {{relative}} poverty, built a biochemical division {{and another one}} dedicated to cellular pathology, whose direction was entrusted to the hands of Boivin (who went on to discover endotoxins that are contained in the germ's body and are freed after its death). During the same period, Andre Lwoff assumed {{the direction of a}} new microbial physiology branch built on rue Dutot.The general mobilization after France's declaration of war against Germany, in September 1939, emptied the Institute and significantly reduced its activities, as members of appropriate age and condition were recruited into the army, but the almost total absence of battles during the first months of the conflict helped maintain the sanitary situation on the front. After the occupation of France, the Germans never tried to gather information from the Institute’s research; their confidence in Germany’s advantage in this field decreased their curiosity, and their only interest was in the serums and vaccines that it could provide to their troops or the European auxiliaries they recruited. This relative freedom allowed the Institute to become, during the two years after the occupation, a great pharmacy for the Resistance thanks to the initiative of Vallery-Radot, Pasteur’s nephew. The Germans became suspicious of the Institute’s staff only after an outbreak of typhoid in a Wehrmacht division that was stationed near Paris before being sent to the Russian front. The cause of the epidemic was later found to be due to a member of the Institute stealing a culture of the germ responsible for the disease and, with the collaboration of an accomplice, infecting a large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>butter</b> used to feed German troops. The fact that the epidemic spread after the Germans sold some of the butter to civilians was proof that the illness's breakout was not caused by local water quality. Afterwards, the German authorities ordered that the Institute’s stores containing microbial cultures could be opened only by authorized members; similar security problems also induced them to demand complete lists of the staff's names and functions; missing names caused the Germans to send two very valuable biologists, Dr. Wolmann and his wife, as well as other three lab assistants, to a concentration camp. The Institute was not a location for German entrenchment even during the battles for Paris’s liberation because of the honor and respect it commanded, as well as out of fear that involving it in any type of conflict might “free the ghosts of long defeated diseases”.|$|E
