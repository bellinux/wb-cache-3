5|$|Faramir is also {{featured}} as a playable character in Lego Lord of the Rings, {{in which his}} role is <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to that played in the Peter Jackson films.|$|E
5|$|Shōgo Suzuki/Steve Blum as Vincent Valentine. Nomura wanted Cloud and Vincent to have noticeably {{different}} voices {{because the}} characters were otherwise <b>quite</b> <b>similar.</b> Since Vincent was {{older and more}} mature than Cloud, his role was given to Suzuki, who has a very low voice.|$|E
5|$|The rare Pacific Northwest morel Morchella hotsonii, {{known only}} from its type collection, is <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> in {{appearance}} to M.importuna. The former species is distinguished by its finely velvety surface.|$|E

50|$|The {{expressive}} head {{is made up}} {{of straight}} lines and distinctly warmblood in type. It is usually narrow, long and <b>quite</b> dry, <b>similar</b> to the Saddlebred.|$|R
30|$|We {{can use the}} 99 -method to {{calculate}} the uncertainty distribution of X_t^α by taking J as identical. The numerical method is also <b>quite</b> the <b>similar</b> when J(x) is a strictly decreasing function.|$|R
5|$|The {{veterinary}} uses of clindamycin are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to {{its human}} indications, and include treatment of osteomyelitis, skin infections, and toxoplasmosis, {{for which it}} is the preferred drug in dogs and cats. Toxoplasmosis rarely causes symptoms in cats, but can do so in very young or immunocompromised kittens and cats.|$|E
5|$|Phaeacius is {{a spider}} genus of the Salticidae family (jumping spiders). Phaeacius {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, which {{is thought to be}} primitive. Molecular phylogeny, a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Phaeacius {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (<b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Phaeacius′s closest relative is the genus Holcolaetis, and that the next closest are Portia and Spartaeus.|$|E
5|$|Portia {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which is}} thought to be primitive. Molecular phylogeny, a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Portia {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (<b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Portia′s closest relatives are the genera Spartaeus, Phaeacius, and Holcolaetis.|$|E
50|$|Monte Cook {{originally}} planned on perhaps renaming them so their name was not <b>quite</b> so <b>similar</b> to kytons, or chain devils, {{as well as}} other episodes of Monte Cook's Ptolus campaign to see how they were originally used.|$|R
50|$|Rail Alphabet is similar, but not identical, to a bold {{weight of}} Helvetica. It is not <b>quite</b> as <b>similar</b> to Akzidenz Grotesk or Arial. Akzidenz Grotesk had earlier also {{provided}} the same designers the broad {{inspiration for the}} Transport typeface used for all road signs in the United Kingdom.|$|R
30|$|The {{performance}} could positively {{be affected}} by the fact that recordings for the same context were done around the same geographical location, e.g., along the same street. Thus, the training and testing sets might contain recordings around the same area having <b>quite</b> a <b>similar</b> auditory scene, leading to over-optimistic performance.|$|R
5|$|Portia {{is in the}} {{subfamily}} Spartaeinae, {{which is}} thought to be primitive. Molecular phylogeny, a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Portia {{is a member of the}} clade Spartaeinae, that Spartaeinae is basal (<b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), that Portia′s closest relative is the genus Spartaeus, and that the next closest are Phaeacius and Holcolaetis.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of Bhikshatana {{is discussed in}} all Shaiva Agamic texts, including Amshumadbhedagama, Kamikagama, Supredagama, Karanagama and the iconographic work Shilparatna; the texts are mostly South Indian in origin. The iconography is <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of the}} Kankala-murti aspect who, like Bhikshatana, is associated with the legend of Shiva's atonement for severing Brahma's head. The chief difference is that Bhikshatana is nude and Kankala-murti is clothed.|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of Sakurai's Object are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> {{to that of}} V605 Aquilae. V605, discovered in 1919, is the only other known star observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and Sakurai's Object is modeled to increase in temperature {{in the next few}} decades to match the current state of V605.|$|E
5000|$|Miss Hodgkins {{has been}} on the faculty of five Southern California Universities. Her Chamber orchestras have toured {{extensively}} throughout the West Coast and in 1980 the Loma Linda University Chamber Orchestra toured Scandinavia on <b>quite</b> a <b>similar</b> tour as Boris Sirpo and his [...] "Little Chamber Orchestra" [...] played in 1955 and 1957.|$|R
50|$|In Iceland it is {{customary}} to eat {{buried and}} fermented skate along with potatoes on Þorláksmessa; in recent years, this custom {{is something that}} most people do not like the smell off, but eat because this is a celebrated tradition. The ammonia-infused odor of fermented skate is <b>quite</b> strong, <b>similar</b> to that of hákarl.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the use of}} morphological amoebas for the enhancement of 3 D medical images. Morphological amoebas are kernels adapting their shape {{in such a way}} that they do not cross the contours of the image. They can be used in morphological operations in <b>quite</b> a <b>similar</b> way as classical kernel and are well-fitted for noise-reduction in 3 D medical images...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{many of its}} fellow mimids, {{the black}} catbird is not known to imitate any other species. Its song {{consists}} of repeated phrases of notes ranging from harsh and scratchy to warbled and flute-like, often interspersed with metallic clicking buzzes. It often sings from exposed perches. It {{has a variety of}} calls, including some which are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to those of the gray catbird; these are variously described as a harsh rriah, a nasal chrrh and a grating tcheeu.|$|E
5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death). In more advanced disease, the changes observed are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to those seen in autoimmune hepatitis, such as infiltration by inflammatory cells, piecemeal necrosis and fibrosis (scar tissue). In advanced disease, finally, cirrhosis is the main finding. In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making up part of the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E
5000|$|Haüyne is {{isotropic}}. Truly isotropic minerals have no birefringence, but haüyne is weakly birefringent when {{it contains}} inclusions. [...] The refractive index is 1.50. Although this is <b>quite</b> low, <b>similar</b> {{to that of}} ordinary window glass, {{it is the largest}} value for minerals of the sodalite group. [...] It may show reddish orange to purplish pink fluorescence under longwave ultraviolet light.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} to make tuktuk is <b>quite</b> simple and <b>similar</b> to other chili-sauce ingredients. What makes this sauce {{is a little}} different from the rest is the use of andaliman (Sichuan pepper), commonly used in Batak cuisine.|$|R
60|$|Of course, {{there remain}} their {{witchcraft}} and the cruelties which result from their almost universal {{belief in the}} power and efficiency of magic. Well, since I lived in England I have been reading up this subject, and I find that <b>quite</b> recently <b>similar</b> cruelties were practised throughout Europe--that is {{in a part of}} the world which for over a thousand years has enjoyed the advantages of the knowledge and profession of the Christian faith.|$|R
5|$|The Marwari or Malani {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse from the Marwar (or Jodhpur) region of India. Known for its inward-turning ear tips, it comes in all equine colours, {{although}} pinto patterns {{tend to be the}} most popular with buyers and breeders. It is known for its hardiness, and is <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to the Kathiawari, another Indian breed from the Kathiawar region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Marwari are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses, possibly with some Mongolian influence.|$|E
5|$|The Siberian accentor has brown upperparts and wings, {{with bright}} {{chestnut}} streaking {{on its back}} and a greyish-brown rump and tail. The head has a dark brown crown and a long, wide pale yellow supercilium ("eyebrow"). All plumages are <b>quite</b> <b>similar.</b> The nest is an open cup in dense shrub or a tree into which the female lays four to six glossy deep blue-green eggs that hatch in about ten days. Adults and chicks feed mainly on insects, typically picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation. In winter, the accentors may also consume seeds or feed near human habitation.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{anagenesis}} {{was confirmed by}} John Wilson and Jack Scannella in 2016, who studied the ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs. They compared a small Einiosaurus specimen, MOR4568-8-87-1, with Achelousaurus specimen MOR591. Both proved to be <b>quite</b> <b>similar,</b> with the main differences being a longer face in MOR4568-8-87-1, and a sharper supraorbital horncore in MOR591. They concluded that Achelousaurus was likely the direct descendant of Einiosaurus. The more adult Einiosaurus individuals approached the Achelousaurus morphology. The {{differences between the two}} taxa would have been caused by heterochrony – differential changes in the speed the various traits developed during the lifetime of an individual.|$|E
50|$|Rotius's schutterstukken {{were painted}} <b>quite</b> soon after <b>similar</b> {{paintings}} in Amsterdam were completed by Bartholomeus van der Helst and Govert Flink. Comparative study shows he {{was influenced by}} these paintings, and perhaps was encouraged to achieve similar effects by his patrons.|$|R
30|$|Figure  4 {{indicates}} <b>quite</b> a <b>similar</b> {{landscape of}} comparing {{results in the}} two scenarios to Fig.  3. It is worth noting that, as the fixed cost grows, the average utility of all household decreases in the exit-right scenario but increases in the exit-cost scenario. This suggests the exit-cost device outperforms the exit-right {{in the case of}} a high economics of scale. However, this could be changed if we take transaction costs, which may increase while the economics of scale grow, into consideration.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to enlarge the number field {{underlying}} quantum mechanics from complex to quaternion. It is not impossible to construct quaternion quantum mechanics in <b>quite</b> a <b>similar</b> manner to the usual complex quantum mechanics, though some limitations are necessary for the position of factors. Further, as a special case, the charge properties of the spin·O particles are considered. This example may show some new way to generalize {{the concept of the}} charge of the elementary particles without adoption of the iso-space...|$|R
5|$|The straight, {{symmetrical}} stone columns {{found in}} the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period. The foot of each column is carved {{in the shape of}} a lotus flower. Archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof. This is widely accepted, and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this. However, another theory is that the Vatadage did not have a roof, and the stone columns were used to hang lamps, curtains or Buddhist symbols.|$|E
5|$|The upper incisors have orange enamel and are opisthodont, {{with the}} cutting edge of the tooth {{inclined}} backwards. The root of the lower incisors extends though the mandible (lower jaw) to a low capsular process {{at the back of the}} jawbone. The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear distinct cusps. The second molars, although decidedly smaller than the first, are similar in their crown morphology, but the much smaller third molars are reduced and more distinct from the first molars in morphology. The molars lack accessory crests and other features. Each of the upper molars is three-rooted, whereas the lowers have two roots. The molars are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to those of Macrotarsomys, and differ only in minor details.|$|E
5|$|Though they aren't very {{enthusiastic}} {{at the idea}} of acting in a film about the independence movement, Sue eventually manages to convince them. Laxman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni), a right-wing political party activist, joins the cast later, despite initially being unpopular due to his anti-Western ideology, due to which he is often at odds with the other four, and anti-Muslim beliefs and contempt for Aslam Khan. In the process of filming, the idealism of India's revolutionary heroes seeps into the protagonists. They gradually begin to realize that their own lives are <b>quite</b> <b>similar</b> to the characters they portray in Sue's film and that the state of affairs that once plagued the revolutionaries continues to torment their generation.|$|E
40|$|GX 339 - 4 {{has been}} {{observed}} by BeppoSAX twice in spring 1997 {{as part of a}} longer monitoring program. The source was close to the highest levels (50 mCrab) of the extended low state (as measured by the XTE ASM during the last 2 years). Its spectrum was <b>quite</b> hard, <b>similar</b> to the Exosat 1984 off state, but 40 times stronger. The source is detected up to more than 120 keV, enabling the possibility to study its high energy spectru...|$|R
40|$|The arbelos is {{the shape}} bounded by three {{mutually}} tangent semi-circles with collinear diameters. Recently, Sondow introduced the parabolic analog, the parbelos and proved several {{properties of the}} parbelos similar to properties of the arbelos. In this paper we give one step further and generalize the situation considering the figure bounded by (<b>quite)</b> arbitrary <b>similar</b> curves, the f-belos. We prove analog properties {{to those of the}} arbelos and parbelos and, moreover, we characterize the parbelos and the arbelos as the f-beloses satisfying certain conditions. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{companding}} used in ACSSB {{is a type}} {{of dynamic}} range reduction where in the difference in amplitude between the louder and softer sounds is reduced prior to transmission. A corresponding expander circuit in the receiver inverts this transformation in order to restore the dynamic range. If a conventional SSB receiver is used to receive ACSSB signals, some distortion may be noticed but generally the signals are <b>quite</b> intelligible. <b>Similar</b> techniques are used in audio noise reduction circuits such as those developed for Dolby.|$|R
