500|$|Despite {{its vast}} extent, the {{collective}} {{mass of the}} Kuiper belt is relatively low. The total mass is estimated to range between 1/25 and 1/10 {{the mass of the}} Earth. Conversely, models of the Solar System's formation predict a collective mass for the Kuiper belt of 30 Earth masses. This missing >99% of the mass can hardly be dismissed, because it is required for the accretion of any KBOs larger than [...] in diameter. If the Kuiper belt had always had its current low density, these large objects simply could not have formed by the collision and mergers of smaller planetesimals. Moreover, the eccentricity and inclination of current orbits makes the encounters quite [...] "violent" [...] resulting in destruction rather than accretion. It appears that either the current residents of the Kuiper belt have been created closer to the Sun, or some mechanism dispersed the original mass. Neptune's current influence is too weak to explain such a massive [...] "vacuuming", though the Nice model proposes {{that it could have been}} the cause of mass removal in the past. Although the <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> <b>open,</b> the conjectures vary from a passing star scenario to grinding of smaller objects, via collisions, into dust small enough to be affected by solar radiation. The extent of mass loss by collisional grinding is limited by the presence of loosely bound binaries in the cold disk, which are likely to be disrupted in collisions.|$|E

2500|$|The apostleship {{does not}} hinge upon Jesus' calling of the disciples while alive, but upon Christ's {{appearances}} to the disciples, among whom James and Peter were chosen first of all, a significance the early Church did not miss. [...] "Paul sees the diakonis (Acts 20:24) and the apostole to world mission (Rom.1:5/Gal1:1) as received {{directly from the}} Christ who has risen and appeared to him. Accordingly he knows himself to be an ambassador, a leitourgos, a doulos of the Lord (Rom15:16/Gal1:10, p.90). The Ascension itself is the last, specially significant appearance of [...] "the Risen One", and not a parallel miracle to the Resurrection. Even the empty tomb is subordinated to the Resurrection: that the tomb was empty {{was part of the}} Gospel, entailed by the appearance corporeal of the glorified body of the Risen One. The inverse of this would not have been necessarily true, and so the empty tomb is implied, but not emphasized: an empty tomb alone could have indicated many various things. Emil Brunner's note that Paul does not mention the empty tomb does not entail a conflict between Paul's Gospel and the original apostles (p.92). Again, Künneth defends the extreme middle : the Church becomes increasingly focused on an empty tomb (as the original witnesses die off), yes, but [...] "the decisive <b>question</b> <b>remains</b> <b>open,</b> how far an essential concern of the primitive Christian Church is expressed precisely in this tendency". Therefore, [...] "according to the church tradition about the resurrection event handed down by Paul in I Cor 15:1ff, a difference between the experience of Paul and of the original apostles seems impossible".|$|E
