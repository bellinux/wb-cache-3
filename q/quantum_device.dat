40|$|Quantum {{tunneling}} {{effect has}} been an important issue in both fundamental science and practical applications. Classical quantum tunneling devices are generally rigid in structures which may encounter technical difficulties during fabrication, functional tuning and shape adapting. Here through introducing the room-temperature liquid metals as two conductive electrodes and a soft even liquid insulating layer sandwiched between them, we proposed a conceptually innovative all-soft or liquid <b>quantum</b> <b>device</b> which would help realize a couple of unconventional quantum capabilities such as flexibility, deformability, transformability, and reconfigurability, etc. which may not be easily offered by a rigid <b>quantum</b> <b>device.</b> Representative structural configurations to make such transformable quantum devices via sandwiching various liquid metal-insulating layer-liquid metal (LM-IL-LM) components are suggested. The feasibility for making such an all-soft <b>quantum</b> <b>device</b> is interpreted through experimental evidences and theoretical evaluations. Potential future applications of the proposed devices in a group of emerging fields including intelligent quantum systems and quantum computing are prospected. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figure...|$|E
40|$|A Bell test {{separates}} {{quantum mechanics}} from a classical, local realist theory of physics. However, a Bell test cannot separate quantum physics from all classical theories. Classical devices supplemented with non-signaling correlations, e. g., the Popescu-Rohrlich "nonlocal box," can pass a Bell test with probability {{at least as}} high as any <b>quantum</b> <b>devices</b> can. After all, quantum entanglement {{does not allow for}} signaling faster than the speed of light, so in a sense is a weaker special case of non-signaling correlations. It could be that underneath quantum mechanics is a deeper non-signaling theory. We present a test to separate quantum theory from powerful non-signaling theories. The test extends the CHSH game to involve three space-like separated <b>devices.</b> <b>Quantum</b> <b>devices</b> sharing a three-qubit GHZ state can pass the test with probability 5. 1 % higher than classical devices sharing arbitrary non-signaling correlations between pairs.

40|$|Nonlinear optics {{based on}} bulk {{materials}} {{is the current}} technique of choice for quantum-state generation and information processing. Scaling of nonlinear optical <b>quantum</b> <b>devices</b> is of significant interest to enable <b>quantum</b> <b>devices</b> with high performance. However, {{it is challenging to}} scale the nonlinear optical devices down to the nanoscale dimension due to relatively small nonlinear optical response of traditional bulk materials. Here, correlated photon pairs are generated in the nanometer scale using a nonlinear optical device for the first time. The approach uses spontaneous four-wave mixing in a carbon nanotube film with extremely large Kerr-nonlinearity (≈ 100 000 times larger than that of the widely used silica), which is achieved through careful control of the tube diameter during the carbon nanotube growth. Photon pairs with a coincidence to accidental ratio of 18 at the telecom wavelength of 1. 5 μm are generated at room temperature in a ≈ 100 nm thick carbon nanotube film device, i. e., 1000 times thinner than the smallest existing devices.

40|$|AcceptedArticle in PressThe paper investigates two typical {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) problems, namely, coupling and matching in nanoscale circuits composed of nano-interconnects and <b>quantum</b> <b>devices</b> in entangled state.

Two examples are studied: in the first one, electromagnetically coupled NWs are connected to classical lumped devices; in the second one, electromagnetically uncoupled transmission lines are terminated on <b>quantum</b> <b>devices</b> in entangled states. In both circuits, the EMC features qualitatively and quantitatively differ from their classical analogs. In the second example, we demonstrate the existence of quantum coupling, due to the entanglement, which exists {{in spite of the}} absence of classical electromagnetic coupling.

30|$|While {{the idea}} of {{simulations}} is centuries old [1, 2], the suggestion that a <b>quantum</b> <b>device</b> would make for a better mimic of some models than a classical device is commonly attributed to Feynman in 1982 [51]. He noted that calculating properties of an arbitrary quantum model on a classical device is a seemingly very inefficient thing to do (taking a time that scales exponentially {{with the number of}} particles in the model being simulated), but a <b>quantum</b> <b>device</b> {{might be able to do}} this efficiently (taking a time that scales at most polynomially with particle number [52]).|$|E
30|$|The {{majority}} of the current effort on quantum simulation is, firstly, in matching models of interest to a suitable <b>quantum</b> <b>device</b> with which to perform a simulation [49, 50]. Secondly, experimentalists demonstrate {{a high level of}} control and flexibility with a simulator, performing some of the simple fail-able tests mentioned above [18, 22, 33]. This is very much {{along the lines of the}} five goals set out by Cirac and Zoller in 2012 [46], and great successes have led to claims that we are now able to perform simulations on a <b>quantum</b> <b>device</b> that we are unable to do on a classical device. In the future, the main direction of inquiry will continue to be along these lines.|$|E
30|$|Our chosen {{boundary}} between quantum and classical {{is one of}} many possibilities. Indeed, defining the quantumness of the simulation entirely in terms of the device is not common. Many others [49, 50] take the quantum in quantum simulator to relate to the model being simulated {{as well as to the}} simulating device. In common with definitions of quantum computation, our assignment of the quantum in quantum simulator based only on the device avoids the assumption that only simulating quantum models is hard enough to potentially benefit from a <b>quantum</b> <b>device.</b> This is not so: finding the ground state of even a classical Ising model is NP-hard and thus thought to be inefficient on both a classical and <b>quantum</b> <b>device</b> [75, 76].|$|E
