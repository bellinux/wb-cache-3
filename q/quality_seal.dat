Whilst the benefits of such devices are widely reported {{there is still a}} large variation in the <b>quality</b> of the <b>seal</b> produced, with factors such as vessel size known to effect <b>seal</b> <b>quality.</b> The study aimed to investigate parameters affecting device performance and improve the <b>seal</b> <b>quality.</b> The burst pressure test was used to assess the <b>seal</b> <b>quality</b> and tissue adhesion was measured using a peel test. Additionally histology techniques were used to quantify vessel morphology and found that with an increase in elastin content there was a reduction in <b>seal</b> <b>quality.</b> A number of device modifications were made, testing a selection of non-stick coatings and surface features of the shims. No coating reduced the level of tissue adhesion to the device, but results found that with a greater level of adhesion there was a reduction in <b>seal</b> <b>quality.</b> Considering the different surface features one design, a combination of longitudinal and transverse grooves, resulted in a seal failure rate of 0. 0...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Sealed {{radioactive}} {{sources of}} 22 Na for positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), {{free from the}} legal regulations, are commercially available from an American company. However, thick foils are used to seal 22 Na in these sources and large fractions of the positrons annihilate in the sealing materials. Further, it is pointed out that a long lifetime component over 1 ns appears in the positron lifetime spectrum acquired with the Kapton sealed source (POSK- 22, IPL Inc.). In this research, {{attempts were made to}} develop high <b>quality</b> <b>sealed</b> positron sources, potentially free from regulations, for ubiquitous application of PALS. The sources prepared in the present work are of high quality and applicable to our new PALS, which does not require sample cutting and is potentially applicable to truly nondestructive, onsite inspection of various materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of renewal of panel residential houses, which includes also replacement of original windows for new ones, on air change rate of a building. The replacement of original windows for new windows with better thermal-insulation properties and more <b>quality</b> <b>sealing</b> considerably contribute to reduction of energy need for heating of a building, {{but on the other}} hand, too low air change caused by tight windows worsen the quality of indoor environment of a building and therefore the required air change is needed to provide by more intensive ventilation.

The most positive attitudinal effect appeared for male actors who match well with an implicitly endorsed object (d =. 90). The most negative effect was found for female models not matching well with an explicitly endorsed object (d = −. 96). Furthermore, celebrity endorsements performed worse compared to endorsements of <b>quality</b> <b>seals,</b> awards, or endorser brands. No publication bias was detected.

40|$|Sprayed seals are the {{predominant}} pavement surfacing across the Australian road network, covering over 80 % of the all-weather roads. Typically, a simple sprayed seal may vary in life from 7 to 15 years. However, considerably different lifetimes may eventuate depending {{on a range}} of causes, including the choice of treatment, quality of materials and operational aspects of construction, amongst other influencing factors. From a sustainability and budgetary viewpoint, a difference in age of several years may {{have a significant impact on}} the consumption of scarce high <b>quality</b> <b>sealing</b> aggregate and bituminous binder and on the whole-of-life greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the seal.
