500|$|Catch Thirtythree is one 47-minute song {{divided into}} 13 sections. It is more mid-tempo guitar riff based, {{and a more}} {{straightforward}} and experimental full-length album than Chaosphere or Nothing. Nick Terry of Decibel Magazine describes the album as a four-movement symphony. Some songs still use Meshuggah's [...] "familiar template combining harsh vocals and nightmarish melodies over coarse, mechanically advancing, oddball tempos", while others explore ambient sounds and <b>quieter</b> <b>dynamics.</b> The first part of Catch Thirtythree centers around two simple riffs. In the song [...] "In Death - Is Death", the band uses a combination of noise and silence, which is {{in contrast with the}} atypical melodies on [...] "Dehumanization". On [...] "Mind's Mirrors", Meshuggah used electronics, programming and [...] "robotic voices". [...] "Shed" [...] incorporates tribal percussion and whispered vocals.|$|R
40|$|In {{standard}} sonata form, {{the onset}} of recapitulation exactly quotes {{the beginning of the}} exposition, preserving both “structural” parameters (melody, rhythm, harmony, key), as well as “secondary” ones (dynamics, instrumentation, register, tempo). In practice, however, composers may alter any aspect of the main theme upon its return. Most analysis of such recapitulatory alteration has focused on structural change, with other parameters receiving relatively little attention. This paper examines composers’ handling of two secondary parameters—dynamic markings and instrumental density—at the beginnings of recapitulations in the nineteenth-century symphonic repertoire. In order to analyse a large number of works, a system of classifications for recapitulatory alterations is necessary. The alterations fall into four broad types: “similar” recapitulations have few or no changes to dynamics and instrumentation, “intensified” recapitulations are louder or more fully orchestrated than the beginning of the exposition, “attenuated” recapitulations have <b>quieter</b> <b>dynamics</b> or sparser orchestration, and “contradictory” recapitulations have alterations to dynamics and instrumentation that work in opposite directions. After explaining this classification system in detail, with examples from specific symphonies, the paper then gives the results of an analytical survey of 483 sonata-form movements from 282 symphonies dating from the years 1800 to 1899. Similar and intensified recapitulations are most common, with preferences changing over time. Until about the 1840 s, similar recapitulations were most common, but from around the 1860 s on, intensified returns became the default choice. Attenuated and contradictory recapitulations, by contrast, are very rare throughout the century...|$|R

50|$|Kotik's {{music is}} {{composed}} in the minimal vein, with works often being of long duration and featuring slow tempi and <b>quiet</b> <b>dynamics.</b> Though his works feature innumerable gradual, slight changes, {{giving them a}} seemingly static quality, his harmonies, however, are more complex than those employed by many other American minimal composers, and his musical process is not as apparent to the listener as, for example, {{in the works of}} Steve Reich or Philip Glass. Further, Kotik does not draw as heavily on jazz or rock in his works as do many of his American colleagues (though, like Steve Reich, he is quite interested in Medieval music and often integrates Medieval compositional techniques into his works). These qualities set Kotik's music apart from American minimal trends, giving his music a decidedly European character more similar in outlook to, for example, that of Hungarian minimalists such as Zoltán Jeney, László Sáry, or László Vidovszky.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Stravinsky’s {{aesthetics of}} objectivism, {{as described in}} his own book and displayed in three different genres from his neoclassical period: Symphonies of Wind Instruments (1920), Perséphone (1933), and Orpheus (1947). My research has significance, in that I combine aesthetics and musical analysis in examining Stravinsky’s objectivism. Drawing on Stravinsky’s book, Poetics of Music in the Form of Six Lessons, I define his objectivism as the structural organization of musical materials, the denial of expression of subjective emotion, {{the importance of the}} composer’s invention, and the concept of limitation. Stravinsky’s objectivism appears in various ways in the different genres. The instrumental piece Symphonies of Wind Instruments presents the lack of linear continuity and development. The melodrama Perséphone represents his objectivism through his rearrangement of French text, and the ballet Orpheus shows his restrained expression in reduced orchestration, <b>quiet</b> <b>dynamics,</b> and cool tone colors...|$|E
