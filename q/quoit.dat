There is also a group of three stones, known as The Cove, in the garden of the local pub. Slightly further from the Great Circle is a single stone, known as Hautville's <b>Quoit.</b> Some of the stones are still vertical, but the majority are now recumbent and some are no longer present.|$|E

25|$|Penwith's scenery {{makes it}} a popular holiday destination. Local attractions {{including}} the Minack Theatre, South West Coast Path, Land's End and the Blue Flag beach at Sennen Cove ensure that tourism plays a major part in Penwith's economy. Additionally, St. Ives has in recent years become a popular New Year's Eve venue. Penwith also has the highest concentration of Neolithic sites in Europe, including monuments at The Merry Maidens, Lanyon <b>Quoit,</b> Chûn <b>Quoit</b> and an Iron Age village at Chysauster. Tourism accounts for 25% of Cornwall's GDP and 19% of households in Penwith derive their income from this activity.|$|E

25|$|Early Anglo-Saxon art, as it survives, is seen {{mostly in}} {{decorated}} jewellery, like brooches, buckles, beads and wrist-clasps, some of outstanding quality. Characteristic of the 5th century is the <b>quoit</b> brooch with motifs based on crouching animals, as {{seen on the}} silver <b>quoit</b> brooch from Sarre, Kent. While the origins of this style are disputed, it is either an offshoot of provincial Roman art, Frank, or Jute art. One style flourished from the late 5th century, and continued throughout the 6th, and is on many square-headed brooches, {{it is characterised by}} chip-carved patterns based on animals and masks. A different style, which gradually superseded it is dominated by serpentine beasts with interlacing bodies.|$|E
25|$|Perseus then {{returned}} his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a votive gift to Athena, who {{set it on}} Zeus' shield (which she carried), as the Gorgoneion (see also: Aegis). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In Pausanias he {{did not return to}} Argos, but went instead to Larissa, where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the <b>quoit</b> and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the <b>quoit</b> and was killed: Thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.|$|E
25|$|The class {{composition}} of the new regiment was Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the brooches, other finds from the settlement and cemeteries included 5th century domestic Anglo-Saxon pottery and late Roman military belt fittings in the <b>Quoit</b> Brooch Style. More than 5,000 items were donated to the British Museum by the landowners. Some of the original finds from the excavation are displayed in the British Museum, and others are in storage. Some replica finds are in the Thurrock Museum.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of {{an increasing number}} of important products of the <b>Quoit</b> Brooch ″school″ in northern France, however, shows that neither the style, nor the forms of jewellery are purely insular developments and that they cannot be linked with any particular ethnic group. An alternative theory has therefore been advanced that they are associated with broadly Germanic, mercenary or federate forces employed in the defence of both southern Britain and northern Gaul in the 5th century, who identified themselves and their status by the creation of innovative metalwork in late Roman tradition.|$|E
500|$|A (now recumbent) {{standing}} stone called Hautville's <b>Quoit</b> lies {{across the}} river to the north on an alignment with the centres of the Great Circle and the southern circle.

Described by Stukeley in 1723 as being [...] long, it is now about half that length, Leslie Grinsell suggesting that fragments have occasionally been broken off for mending the roads. Stukeley also referred to the presence of a second stone.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "Zennor Head" [...] {{originates}} {{from the}} name of a local saint, Senara. According to local legend, Senara was thrown off a headland in Brittany in a barrel after being falsely accused of adultery by her husband and washed up on the Cornish coast, founding Zennor and giving her name to the eponymous village (and subsequently Zennor Head, Zennor <b>Quoit</b> and Porthzennor Cove), before continuing to Ireland. The [...] "s" [...] changed to a [...] "z", an occurrence common in the West Country but rare elsewhere, and as such is the largest coastal feature in the United Kingdom to begin with the letter [...] "Z".|$|E
500|$|One of the curiosities of {{the place}} is Hautville's <b>Quoit,</b> which, to save time, should also be looked for on {{approaching}} the village. (Enter iron gate on L. {{a few hundred yards}} before reaching tollhouse, and search backwards along the hedge bordering road.) It is a large stone, which legend says was hurled by Sir J. Hautville (whose effigy is in Chew Magna Church) from the top of Maes Knoll. The famous [...] "druidical remains" [...] will be found near the church. About 50yards from the entrance to the churchyard take a lane to the L. leading to an orchard: the stones will be observed in the field beyond (admission free, but field closed on Sundays). The [...] "remains" [...] consist of three contiguous circles. The first is of considerable area, and is marked out by twelve large stones, only three of which remain upright; a smaller circle of eight stones lies just beyond; and a third circle of eight will be found farther away in an orchard on the R. The two larger circles have each a few scattered stones thrown off as a kind of avenue. Standing apart from the circles is a curious group of three stones huddled together in a garden abutting on the churchyard, from which they can be easily seen by looking over the W. boundary wall. These mystic rings probably had the same origin (whatever that may have been) as that of the more famous circle at Avebury in Wiltshire, with which they should be compared. The proximity of Maes Knoll is comparable with that of Silbury Hill. A ridiculous theory suggests that the monoliths were erected as a trophy after one of Arthur's victories. Arthur is connected to the site because a site in the nearby village of Camerley is reputed to be the location of Camelot in an oral tradition. The stones are of a reddish hue similar to that described in the Arthurian legend as connected to Camelot and to a sword that was seen in a stone near to Camelot. The country story is that a local wedding once took place on a Sunday, when the frivolous guests would insist on winding up with a dance. The penalty for a [...] "Sabbath" [...] thus [...] "profaned" [...] was the prompt transformation of the bridal party into stone. Hence the local appellation of [...] "The fiddlers and the maids".|$|E

50|$|<b>Quoits</b> (koits, kwoits, kwaits) is a {{traditional}} game which involves the throwing of metal, rope or rubber rings over a set distance, usually to land over or near a spike (sometimes called a hob, mott or pin). The sport of <b>quoits</b> encompasses several distinct variations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quoiting</b> (pronounced kiteing) was {{a popular}} sport amongst the male villagers. <b>Quoiting</b> greens were found in Renton, Alexandria, Hardgate and many Ayrshire villages. <b>Quoits</b> were heavy iron rings, rounded on one side, flat on the other and weighed 8-12 pounds but could be up to 23 pounds. They were hurled at a steel pin driven into a three-foot square clay bed, with the common length of the green being 18 yards. Renton were Scottish Champions in 1949 and 1986. There is a {{photograph}} of the victorious 1949 team in Renton Railway Station.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of the game during the 19th and early 20th centuries also gave rise to several variants, usually {{with the aim of}} allowing the game (or a version of it) to be played indoors or making it accessible to women and children. Games such as ringtoss or hoopla became popular as parlour games, whilst versions such as indoor <b>quoits</b> allowed pubs and taverns to maintain their <b>quoits</b> teams through the winter months. Deck <b>quoits</b> began life some time in the early 1930s as a pastime to occupy passengers on long cruises.|$|R

2500|$|The <b>quoit</b> brooch {{is a type}} of brooch found {{from the}} 5th century and later during the Anglo-Saxon {{settlement}} of Britain that has given its name to the <b>Quoit</b> Brooch Style to embrace all types of Anglo-Saxon metalwork in the decorative style typical of the finest brooches. [...] The brooches take their modern name from the rings thrown in the game of quoits, and have the form of a broad ring, or circle with an empty centre, usually in bronze or silver (sometimes inlaid with silver or gold respectively), and often highly decorated. The forms are in a very low relief, so contrasting with other early Anglo-Saxon styles, with detail added by shallow engraving or punching within the main shapes. Dots or dashes are often used to represent fur on the animal forms, as well as lines emphasizing parts of the body. [...] They are fixed with a single, straight hinged pin like those of other Anglo-Saxon ring or Celtic brooches and are further defined by the presence of a slot and pin-stops on the ring.|$|E
2500|$|The class {{composition}} of the new regiment was Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Jats.

The uniform was scarlet with buff facings. Sialkot in the Punjab {{was chosen as the}} permanent station for the Training Battalion.

2500|$|Whatever the case, a {{continuity}} of 'sub-Roman' Britons cannot be doubted, as evidenced, for example, {{by the sheer}} number of burials which already date to the late 5th and early 6th centuries - otherwise impossible to maintain by even the largest 'migration' estimates. In addition to the 'highland Tyrants' in the west, the case has been made by persistence of a 'native', post-Roman, polity of sorts south of the Thames during much of the fifth century- evidenced by the oppositional deposition of <b>Quoit</b> Brooch Style artefacts in inhumation burials south of the Thames versus 'Scandinavian' artefacts (such as 'square headed brooches') within predominantly cremation burial settings dominate north of the Thames (i.e. in [...] "Anglian" [...] areas). However, a take-over by continental migrants cannot be denied, as evidenced by an abrupt end of <b>Quoit</b> Broch style artefacts and inundation of exotic artefacts of a [...] "Jutish' character in the final decade or two of the fifth century. Thus Ken Dark's notion of a long chronology of a surviving, even dominant [...] "sub-Roman" [...] Britain finds little support. Moreover, Halsall argues that 'Britons' are scarcely if at all visible in the archaeological record of lowland England by the 6th century and beyond, not because of any bizarre notions of ethnic cleansing or 'apartheid', but simply because, by then, everyone was an 'Anglo-Saxon', whatever their geographic origin.|$|E
