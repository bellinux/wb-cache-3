40|$|The {{ratification}} of treaties governing human rights often {{raises the question}} of whether obligations imposed by the treaty are compatible with the existing domestic law of the ratifying state.

Another measure that may be adopted, particularly where the treaty provision at issue is cast in general terms, is for the ratifying state to include a Declaration or an Understanding (RUD) with its acceptance that sets forth an interpretation of the general terms consistent with domestic law on the subject. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether any such RUDs are called for in the ratification by the United States of the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 2 ̆ 7 in order to avoid a conflict between the treaty and domestic U.

In 1801 however, the strong opposition towards the existence of the Society from Charles IV of Spain led Pope Pius VII to <b>qualify</b> his <b>acceptance</b> of the Society by limiting it to the Russian Empire. He expressed this on 7 March 1801, in the Papal brief Catholicae fidei, through which Franciszek Kareu was made 'Superior General for Russia'.After 1801, contact with ex-Jesuits increased, thanks to the efforts of his Assistant Gabriel Gruber, his future successor as 'Superior General for Russia'. In this period, the Rector of Stonyhurst (England) asked if the School might be allowed to affiliate itself with the Society in Russia. Negotiations also began for a union with the ‘Paccanarist’ priests. The Patriarch of Constantinople also asked for the Jesuits to be of service in the area under his See. During Kareu's Generalship of the Society in Russia (in exile, as it were) the complete and universal restoration of the Society by the Catholic Church, did not seem a too distant reality.|$|R

40|$|Demonstrating that a waste form {{produced}} by a given immobilization process is chemically and physically durable as well as compliant with disposal facility acceptance criteria {{is critical to the}} success of a waste treatment program, and must be pursued in conjunction with the maturation of the waste processing technology. Testing of waste forms produced using differing scales of processing units and classes of feeds (simulants versus actual waste) is the crux of the waste form qualification process. Testing is typically focused on leachability of constituents of concern (COCs), as well as chemical and physical durability of the waste form. A principal challenge regarding testing immobilized low-activity waste (ILAW) forms is the absence of a standard test suite or set of mandatory parameters against which waste forms may be tested, compared, and <b>qualified</b> for <b>acceptance</b> in existing and proposed nuclear waste disposal sites at Hanford and across the Department of Energy (DOE) complex.

50|$|Tokenism is an {{extremely}} common practice in the workplace environment of today; it can essentially {{be defined as the}} act of going out of one’s way to include members of minority groups. According to Rosabeth Kanter’s 1977 publication Men and Women of the Corporation, the inability to achieve equality within the workplace can be largely attributed to the placement of “token status” on certain groups of individuals. Oftentimes tokens possess marginal status as members who are allowed entrance but do not get to experience full participation due to their status as an “outsider” who may be fully qualified for the position but does not possess the necessary characteristics, i.e. sex or race, that are usually expected of persons in said position. The term token {{can also be used to}} describe people who are hired due to their difference from other members of the company or other employees: oftentimes this is done as an attempt to prove that the group does not discriminate against said group of people. This variety of tokenism is thought to have originated in the Southern United States, where schools and businesses would admit token African Americans in order to meet the desegregation orders of the federal government. In many instances, the number of tokens accepted into a group or company is less than the number of people from the token group who are <b>qualified</b> for <b>acceptance.</b> However, in some cases, tokens are people who do not possess the necessary qualifications to hold a position but are admitted because of their token status.|$|R

40|$|This article {{attempts}} to evaluate theoretically {{the applicability of}} Foucault’s Panopticon to the practices of public surveillance utilising CCTV technology. The first part maps out three “strands ” in the reception of panopticism in surveillance studies, suggesting that it tends to {{fall into one of}} three broad kinds: its wholesale appropriation and application; its wholesale rejection as inadequate with respect to a supposedly “post-disciplinary ” society; and its <b>qualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> subject to some empirically-dependent limitations. I then attempt in a preliminary way to supplement these three positions. In particular, I question the logical adequacy of equating visual surveillance with effective subjectification and self-discipline by drawing upon a range of philosophical and sociological perspectives. Philosophically, it is suggested that the Foucauldian thesis may well “pathologise ” the relationship between subjectivity and visibility, and thereby overlook other dimensions of our experience of vision. Sociologically, it is suggested that the precise relation between surveillance and self-discipline requires us to attend, in ethnomethodological fashion, to the situated sense-making activities of subjects as the go about everyday practical activities in public settings...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} {{the response of}} national high courts to the ECJ’s integrationist agenda and tries to uncover the logic behind their <b>qualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of EU law supremacy and direct effect. Drawing on the legal and political science literature, I discuss and develop several possible explanations for the observed inter-court variation: the courts ’ type and organisation; their power to review legislative acts under domestic law; the rules governing access to the judicial forum; the monistic tradition {{of the legal system}} and the level of public support for European integration. I then assess the empirical validity of these hypotheses using a new dataset coding the doctrinal positions and institutional constraints of 34 domestic high courts. The direction of the correlation is found to be in line with that hypothesised for all predictor variables. Most of the correlations, however, prove to be small. Only one variable – the power to review statutory legislation under national law – appears to have a significant influence on the courts ’ doctrinal response to legal integration. While the empirical analysis does not quite capture the effect of all relevant factors, it lends some support to the argument that the varying institutional constraints and incentives under which high court judges operat...|$|E
40|$|Particularism {{refers to}} the idea that {{different}} moral standards apply to different people. This view is inherently discriminatory. The universal application of moral principles has been challenged in 'communitarian' critiques, which argue that moral rules have to be placed in a specific social context. People are tied to families, communities and localities; these kinds of relationships define the scope of their moral responsibilities. There are strong particularist traditions in Europe, including arguments for 'sphere sovereignty' and 'solidarity'. Some ideals in social policy, including the 'welfare society' and the concept of 'welfare pluralism', appeal to similar social constructs, and are likely to be particularist in their effects. Particularism can be <b>qualified</b> by the <b>acceptance</b> of some basic universal principles, but this still implies a presumption in favour of certain discriminatory structures. The arguments for particularism are framed in very similar terms to those which socialists use, referring to social networks, mutual aid and collective action. Ideas like empowerment, or participation in social networks, are generally applied within a particularist framework. For universalists, the main danger in advocating 'community' and 'solidarity' as values in their own right is that they are liable to be discriminatory in practice. Communitarianism is an attractive approach; it is also dangerous...|$|R

Its primary objective is to perform in-situ and remote sensing investigations that will characterize the chemistry of the materials at the local surface, subsurface, and atmosphere. The Phoenix spacecraft was launched on August 4, 2007 and will arrive at Mars in May 2008. The lander includes a suite of seven (7) science instruments. This mission is baselined for up to 90 sols (Martian days) of digging, sampling, and analysis. Operating at the Mars polar region creates a challenging environment for the Phoenix landed subsystems and instruments with Mars surface temperature extremes between - 120 deg C to 25 deg C and diurnal thermal cycling in excess of 145 deg C. Some engineering and science hardware inside the lander were qualification tested up to 80 deg C to account for self heating.

Anecdotal cases of directly observed severe infections were followed by enhanced acceptance of paramedical staff. Scientific literature was significantly more in favour of vaccination than Google and French newspaper websites. In the case of the newspaper websites, information correlated with their recognised political reputations, although they would presumably claim independence from political bias. The Trust Surveys showed that politicians were highly dis-trusted in contrast with doctors and pharmacists who were considered much more trustworthy. CONCLUSIONS: The low uptake of the vaccine could reflect failure to convey high quality medical information and advice relating to the benefits of being vaccinated. We believe that the media and internet contributed to this problem by raising concerns within the general population and that failure to involve GPs in the control programme may have been a mistake. GPs are highly regarded by the public and can provide face-to-face professional advice and information. The top-down strategy of vaccine programme management and information delivered by the Ministry of Health could have aggravated the problem, because the general population does not always trust politicians...|$|R

We had 156 participants aged 60 – 93 years (average 74. 7 years) in our survey. Of them, 49 were men and 107 were women. Treatment with loop diuretics (Furosemid and Bumetanide) and magnesium levels was correlated, as well as the influence of magnesium levels on life span. Serum magnesium levels were measured in patients receiving diuretics and in the control group. Also, magnesium levels were measured in patients who passed away in the course of their disease and were compared with the control group. Magnesium levels in the diuretic group (100 patients) were 0. 93 ± 0. 094 mmol/l, while the average levels in the control group of 56 patients were 0. 89 ± 0. 075 mmol/l. In 29 patients who passed away, average magnesium levels were 0. 92 ± 0. 078 mmol/l, while in the control group (127 patients), magnesium levels were 0. 93 ± 0. 083 mmol/l.

40|$|Conwy Lloyd Morgan (1852 – 1936) {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the father of modern comparative psychology. Yet, Morgan initially had significant doubts about whether a genuine science of comparative psychology was even possible, only later becoming more optimistic about our ability to make reliable inferences about the mental capacities of non-human animals. There has been a fair amount of disagreement amongst scholars of Morgan’s work about the nature, timing, and causes of this shift in Morgan’s thinking. We argue that Morgan underwent two quite different shifts of attitude towards the proper practice of comparative psychology. The first was a <b>qualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the Romanesian approach to comparative psychology that he had initially criticized. The second was a shift away from Romanes’ reliance on systematizing anecdotal evidence of animal intelligence towards an experimental approach, focused on studying the development of behaviour. We emphasize the role of Morgan’s evolving epistemological views in bringing about the first shift – in particular, his philosophy of science. We emphasize the role of an intriguing but overlooked figure in the history of comparative psychology in explaining the second shift, T. Mann Jones, whose correspondence with Morgan provided an important catalyst for Morgan’s experimental turn, particularly the special focus on development. We also shed light on the intended function of Morgan’s Canon, the methodological principle for which Morgan is now mostly known.

Norming data, provided by R. Woodcock, Ph. D., for grades three, five, eight, and eleven were used for the study. Three hypotheses were explored. The first hypothesis called for a comparison by gender. The second hypothesis called for a comparison of non-Hispanics and Hispanics. The third hypothesis called for comparisons between all combinations of grade levels using only the non-Hispanic subgroup. Using the results of confirmatory factor analysis from LISREL VIII (1993), the chi-square difference test, and three goodness-of-fit indexes provided evidence of similarity in factor patterns between target groups. Hypothesis 1 stated that there were no differences between male and female factor patterns. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis supported the acceptance of hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 stated that there were no differences between non-Hispanic and Hispanic students. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis supported a <b>qualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of hypothesis 2. The relationships between the latent variables are significantly different. Age, therefore, may have been a confounding variable in this study. Hypothesis 3 stated that there were no differences in patterns between grades. Only one of the six grade comparisons, 3 - 5, found model 1 to be the preferred model. All other comparisons found model 3 to be the preferred model. The residual or error terms were variable in matrix patterns, indicating that a factor other than age may be influencing the relationships. A fourth analysis was utilized and determined model 1 to be the preferred model. The results of the analysis indicate that differential patterns of processing, rather than age, may be the variable influencing the relationship of latent variables...|$|E
40|$|In the {{construction}} of roads or railways, the capping layer is the last layer of the earthworks phase. This layer can be made of non bound aggregates or by a treatment of a soil with lime and/or hydraulic binder, such as cement or hydraulic road binders. In the latter case, the in situ testing of the capping layer performances should encompass treated soil modulus measurements, but sampling such materials is not often satisfactory, {{because of the risk}} of material degradation by the sampling itself. Consequently, a non destructive method, aiming at measuring the modulus of the treated materials, could be very useful. For this reason, we propose to study the feasibility of the seismic surface or guided waves dispersion analysis in order to recover the depth and the S wave velocity of the subgrade. Previous works provided results and analysis of the dispersion curves concerning the pavement auscultation (Ryden et al, 2004). However, in these cases, the subgrade was an underlying layer in the global zone of interest that includes the upper pavement layers where the measurement surface is the thin asphalt layer. In the present study, we focus on the subgrade layer in the case of under construction roads, before the shallower pavement layers are built because it should help to <b>qualify</b> the project <b>acceptance</b> concerning this earthworks phase. In this context, the issue deals with a two layers medium case where the investigated subgrade, whom the top is the measurement surface, lays above a low velocity zone, i. e. the natural soil. As described by Ryden et al. (2004), the resulting dispersion curves {{in the case of a}} high velocity upper layer should be typical of Lamb waves dispersion curves and could bring out higher modes that could be difficult to pick. In this case, they advocated the entire dispersion diagram inversion to avoid any subjective picking in the data (Ryden et al, 2006). However, the treated soil can contain heterogeneities unfavourable to the assumption of homogeneous layers presupposed to the dispersion diagram calculation. Thus a first feasibility stage, i. e. a field experimental data acquisition, was conducted to define the ability of seismic data to provide a coherent dispersion diagram in the spectral content required. The dispersion curve have been extracted and inverted with an iterative weighted least squares local minimization method (Hermann, 2002). In order to consider the possibility of inverting the entire dispersion diagram, a second feasibility stage consisted in analysing all the events that possibly occur in the dispersion diagram. For that, the measurement experience was reproduced at reduced scale in laboratory as a perfectly controlled experimental modelling approach. These data and more precisely the dispersion diagram is compared in one hand to the theoretical curves associated to the leakage attenuations and in an other hand to the theoretical dispersion diagram numerically calculated with an original method taking into account the source effects...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{examining}} {{the history of}} the Teachers' League of South Africa, a specifically coloured teachers' association, during its conservative phase from 1913 to 1940, this thesis in addition attempts to investigate the nature and development of this organization {{in the context of the}} wider social dynamic of which it was both part and product. The League is thus not only studied as a professional association but also as a specific constituent of the broader social categories of the coloured elite, the coloured people and South African society. The origins of the T. L. S. A. was rooted in the subordination of peoples of colour in Cape settler society and the development through the 19 th century of a segregated education system at the Cape. More immediately, as a result of the social and political consequences of the mineral revolution intensifying racial discrimination against blacks, one of the responses of the coloured elite was the establishment of the League, through the mediation of the African Political Organisation, to protect coloured educational interests, regarded to be crucial to their advancement. The League was a typical embodiment of the assimilationist aspirations and accommodationist strategies that resulted from coloured elite marginality. This is evident in the growth and maturity of the League being largely in response to the progressive and systematic enforcement of segregation against coloureds over this period. More significantly, the League fully accepted white middle class values and codes of behaviour and its organizational life was dominated by the striving to conform to these norms. The League also displayed the essential powerlessness of the coloured elite as its representative in the tripartite contest with the Education Department and churches to influence the direction of coloured education. The interstitial position of the coloured elite in South African society was manifested by the League contradicting its basic principle of non-racism by the <b>qualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> of coloured inferiority and trying to use its closer assimilation to Western culture to claim a position of relative privilege for coloureds vis-a-vis Africans. It is apparent that at all levels of its existence the League was captive to its coloured identity and status...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT By {{critically}} {{assessing the}} discourse, intent and teleology of the United Nations Charter when {{the text of}} the instrument was being finalised in 1945, this thesis argues {{that the majority of the}} world's states gathered at the UN Conference on International Organisation in San Francisco were aware of the fact that the core provisions of the treaty were being dictated by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Nevertheless, these states accepted the Charter in its current form in return for the promise of a more democratic UN in the future. This <b>qualified</b> <b>acceptance</b> was manifested in Article 109 of the Charter and, more specifically, in that article's paragraph 3, which provided for a facilitated Charter review in ten years' time. Recognising that globalisation has outpaced fragmented state-centric global governance, and that world-wide threats in areas such as the violation of human rights, climate change, armed conflicts, and the use of conventional and nuclear weapons continue to exist, this thesis argues that elusive global governance and its instrument of international law are, in the absence of a global government, ill-equipped to deal effectively with these borderless problems. Bridging the governmental gap, however, the UN Security Council, with its monopoly on the use of force in order to maintain "peace and security" under Chapter VII of the Charter, has demonstrated erratic and unplanned competencies. In fact, in the past 25 years, the Council has deployed its auto-interpreted expanded powers in the diverse areas of court-making, law-making, defining criminality and sanctioning non-state actors as criminals. It has even involved itself in the settlement of tort claims, awarding damages to individuals and corporations. The Council has, in effect, emerged at the apex of the legal order and has shown its capacity to legislate globally. The founders, when drafting the Charter, were aware of the democratic and legitimacy deficiencies of the Council and, in order to redress them, and to apply the experiences learned during the UN's first years of operation, provided for a revisions process, including the holding of a Charter review conference, as enshrined in Article 109. Why the UN has never in its 70 -year history held such a review conference, and whether paragraph 3 of Article 109 -neglected by researchers and politicians-is still in force, are at the core of this thesis's analysis. It will be argued that, if such a review conference is convened now, it would most likely trigger the process of UN constitutionalisation, and thus help transform the UN, so it can ultimately fulfil the objectives set out in the Charter's preamble-including guaranteeing and the protecting the fundamental rights of "we the peoples"...|$|E
