40|$|We {{introduce}} quotient graphs for modeling neutrality {{in evolutionary}} search.

5000|$|In type theory, {{a kind of}} {{foundation}} of mathematics, a quotient type is an algebraic data type that represents a type whose equality relation has been redefined by a given equivalence relation such that {{the elements of the}} type are partitioned into a set of equivalence classes whose cardinality is {{less than or equal to}} that of the base type. Just as product types and sum types are analogous to the cartesian product and disjoint sum of abstract algebraic structures, quotient types reflect the concept of set-theoretic <b>quotients,</b> <b>sets</b> whose elements are surjectively partitioned into equivalence classes by a given equivalence relation on the set. Algebraic structures whose underlying <b>set</b> is a <b>quotient</b> are also termed quotients. Examples of such quotient structures include <b>quotient</b> <b>sets,</b> groups, rings, categories and, in topology, quotient spaces. For example, , the rational numbers, is the quotient ring - or [...] "field of fractions" [...] - of , the integers.|$|R

50|$|Setoids are studied {{especially}} in proof theory and in type-theoretic foundations of mathematics. Often in mathematics, when one defines an equivalence relation on a set, one immediately forms the <b>quotient</b> <b>set</b> (turning equivalence into equality). In contrast, setoids {{may be used}} when a difference between identity and equivalence must be maintained, often with an interpretation of intensional equality (the equality on the original set) and extensional equality (the equivalence relation, or the equality on the <b>quotient</b> <b>set).</b>|$|E

Fundamental equivalence relations link hyperstructure theory to the  theory of corresponding classical structures. They also introduce new hyperstructure classes. The present paper is a brief reference to the two different approaches to the notion of the fundamental relation in hyperstructures. The first one belongs to Koskas, who introduced the β ∗ - relation in hyperstructures and the second approach to Vougiouklis, who gave the name fundamental to the resulting <b>quotient</b> <b>sets.</b> The two approaches, the necessary definitions and the theorems for the introduction of the fundamental equivalence relation in hyperstructures, are presented...|$|R

Experimental results are presented for tar- get pose estimation (orthogonal groups) and signal subspace estimation (Grassmann manifolds).
