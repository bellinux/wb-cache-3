This article focuses on the process by which, after constitutional battles, the principle of ‘equal access of women and men’ to decision-making bodies was entrenched in the French constitution, and how the institutions created to monitor its implementation provided a support structure for the extension and diffusion of gender quotas from electoral politics to other domains.

40|$|Once {{a country}} {{allergic}} to {{any type of}} preferential treatment or <b>quota</b> <b>measure</b> for women, France has become a country that applies gender quotas to regulate women's presence and representation in politics, the business sector, public bodies, public administration, and even some civil society organizations. While research has concentrated on the adoption of electoral gender quotas in many countries and their international diffusion, few studies focus on explaining the successful diffusion of gender quotas from politics to other domains in the same country. This paper proposes to fill this gap by studying the particularly puzzling case {{of a country that}} at one point strongly opposed the adoption of gender quotas in politics, but, in less than a decade, transformed into one of the few countries applying gender quotas across several policy domains. This paper argues that the legal entrenchment of the parity principle, the institutionalization of parity in several successive women's policy agencies, and key players in these newly created agencies are mainly responsible for this unexpected development. The diffusion of gender quotas in France thus offers an illuminating example of under which conditions women's policy agencies can act autonomously to diffuse and impose a new tool for gender equalit...|$|E
40|$|The China—Rare Earths {{decision}} of the Appellate Body addressed two main issues: (i) whether China’s obligations not to impose export duties under its accession protocol are subject to exceptions under Article XX of GATT, and (ii) {{the scope of the}} exception for China’s export quota measures relating to conservation under Article XX(g) of GATT. In accord with its China—Raw Materials decision, the Appellate Body found that there is no textual basis for application of the Article XX exception to China’s export duty obligations. This interpretation exalted a narrow contextual approach over an approach to interpretation that would focus on broader context, object, and purpose. The Appellate Body also approved the Panel’s overall approach to determining the availability of the Article XX(g) exception. This approach focused on the design and structure of China’s <b>quota</b> <b>measure,</b> but left unresolved important issues, including the extent to which non-conservation purposes may prevent use of the exception and the role of empirical evidence of effects in these determinations. While the Appellate Body found that there is no “even-handedness” requirement in Article XX(g) itself, we argue that the chapeau’s requirement of non-discrimination is an appropriate additional criterion for determining whether a policy with a target of reducing extraction of a natural resource satisfies the requirements of Article XX...|$|E

To resolve issues of representation, legislative gender quotas were implemented across the region. Although twenty years have since passed, the impact of gender quotas is still under question. The current literature on gender <b>quotas</b> <b>measures</b> their impact on women’s political participation, descriptive representation, and symbolic representation. The current literature is inconclusive on what real impact gender quotas have on female citizens.

To do this, I analyze two manifestos delivered to the National Congress in 2006 by Brazilian intellectuals who laid their position publicly in relation to the quota policy. The analysis, guided by a conception of Bakhtinian language, shows that the concept of “affirmative action” appeared in dispute: first it is taken as a racist measure and it is percieved as unequal while on second place it is understood as a measure of racism deconstruction. By characterizing the debate in the Brazilian scenario, I sought to contribute to the construction of a regional overview on race and affirmative actions in the Latin American context...|$|R
40|$|Könskvotering eller kvinnoparti? I valet mellan dessa jämställdhetspolitiska lösningar i början av 1990 -talet gick könskvotering till riksdagen som ett skott. Utifrån en diskursanalytisk metod visar Maria Törnqvist att de varvade listorna blev en framgångshistoria därför att de lanserades som ett heteroromantiskt alternativ. This article {{explores the}} impact of a romantic {{discourse}} in Swedish gender politics and more so; a heteroromantic discourse on closeness and passion between men and women. This is done through a close reading of the Swedish debate on “varannan damernas”, a <b>quota</b> <b>measure</b> {{to increase the number of}} women in parliament. The article argues that part of what turned this into a gender political success-story is the heteroromantic framing together with an adoption of ideals of cooperation inside the existing parties. The change in status is marked by a shift in terminology from ‘quotas’ to ‘varannan damernas’ (‘every other women’). In its earlier usage the expression refers to a phrase from the dance halls in which women were allowed to ask men up for every other dance. The metaphor thereby brings the question of women’s political presence into the intimate sphere and turns the previously conflictual framing of enforced legislated gender quota into a dance that symbolically guarantees both parts free will. The discursive embedding of visions and strategies is decisive in order to make gender equality an intelligible target for political action and change. With the counter-case of a women’s party, the article claims that the acceptance of certain gender equality solutions is not only due to a strong women’s movement or a general public interest in gender related matters. It is foremost a question of how claims and strategies are made intelligible and how they are incorporated into normative ideals of Swedish politics (mutual agreements and block-politics) and gender equality (cooperation between men and women). Thereby the case demonstrates that visions of emancipation are structured within relations of power. Gender politics can be described as a striving for gender equality, but is also a struggle over the classifications and legitimacy of certain world views as well as over material resources...|$|E

40|$|PresentationITQ systems {{generate}} ITQ prices. For {{any given}} ITQ-managed species there are typically two prices. One {{is for the}} annual (or seasonal) quota, the other is for the longer lasting ITQ-share. In well-functioning ITQ markets, these prices reveal important information about the fishery. In the single species framework, prices of annual <b>quotas</b> <b>measure</b> the current profitability of fishing and prices for ITQ-shares reflect the expected future profitability of fishing under the ITQ system. Trading arbitrage leads to a determinate functional relationship between the prices of annual quantity quotas and that of TAC-shares. In the multi-species framework, if the ability to select the species composition of the harvest is less than perfect, the information content of the ITQ-prices is much less straight-forward. For instance the price of annual quotas for a given species may, under not uncommon circumstances, far exceed its landings price or, alternatively, be approximately zero. This paper explores these issues. It derives explicit expressions ITQ prices under various circumstances including the multi-species context with imperfect selectivity, discarding possibilities and ITQ-noncompliance. To illustrate the issues, empirical data on ITQ prices in Iceland are presented...|$|R

40|$|Interspecific {{competition}} for phosphorus was studied in continuous lake water cultures of phytoplankton communities from Lake Memphremagog, and its outcome shown to depend {{primarily on the}} size of the competitors. Comparison of the activity of the inducible enzyme alkaline phosphatase between the lake and cultures operated at various dilution rates (0. 06 - 0. 93 day('- 1)) established that in situ phosphorus limitation rarely depressed average community growth rates much below 0. 6 day('- 1). Growth rates under comparable, or even more severe (0. 2 - 0. 3 day('- 1)) limitation in culture decreased significantly with increasing cell size. Phosphorus uptake kinetics and cell <b>quotas</b> <b>measured</b> by track autoradiography on the competing species showed that biomass and quota-specific uptake rates varied inversely with cell size in highly significant allometric regressions, correctly predicting that competitive outcome should depend on size. Substituted in a variable internal stores model of phosphorus limited growth, the allometric functions for uptake, cell quota, and maximum growth rate correctly predicted observed growth rates except in competition much stronger than natural (D = 0. 06 - 0. 2 day('- 1)). Failure of the model to encompass cell senescence and death due to severe nutrient stress appeared to account for the discrepancy. Neither the absolute difference in growth rates due to cell size nor the direction of selection among the naturally co-occurring species varied systematically with the intensity of competition, indicating that spatio-temporal variation of limiting phosphorus supply in nature is unlikely to directly select the size or taxonomic composition of phytoplankton communities...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of benthic proliferations of the anatoxin-producing cyanobacterium Phormidium are increasing in cobble-bed rivers worldwide. Studies {{to date have}} shown high spatial and temporal variability in anatoxin concentrations among mats. In this study we determined anatoxin quotas (toxins per cell) in field samples and compared these results to the conventionally-used concentrations (assessed per dry weight of mat). Three mats were selected at sites in two rivers and were sampled every 2 – 3 h for 24 – 26 h. The samples were lyophilized and ground to a fine homogenous powder. Two aliquots of known weights were analyzed for anatoxin congeners using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, or digital droplet PCR with Phormidium-specific anaC primers to measure absolute quantities of gene copies. Anatoxin concentrations in the mats varied 59 - and 303 -fold in the two rivers over the study periods. A similar pattern was observed among gene copies (53 - and 2828 -fold). When converted to anatoxin quotas there was markedly less variability (42 - and 16 -fold), but significantly higher anatoxin quotas were observed in mats from the second river (p < 0. 001, Student’s t-test). There were no obvious temporal patterns with high and low anatoxin concentrations or <b>quotas</b> <b>measured</b> at each sampling time and across the study period. These results demonstrate that variability in anatoxin concentrations among mats is primarily due to the abundance of toxic genotypes. No consistent modulation in anatoxin production was observed during the study, although significant differences in anatoxin quotas among rivers suggest that site-specific physiochemical or biological factors may influence anatoxin production...|$|R
40|$|First {{recorded}} in the 1970 s, massive green macroalgal blooms have since become an annual recurrence in Brittany, France. Eutrophication (in particular to anthropogenic nitrogen input) {{has been identified as}} the main factor controlling Ulva ‘green tide’ events. In this study, we modelled Ulva proliferation using a two-dimensional model by coupling hydrodynamic and biological models (coined ‘MARS-Ulves’) for five sites along the Brittany coastline (La Fresnaye Bay, Saint-Brieuc Bay, Lannion Bay, Guissény Bay and Douarnenez Bay). Calibration of the biological model was mainly based on the seasonal variation of the maximum nitrogen uptake rate (VmaxN) and the half-saturation constant for nitrogen (KN) to reproduce the internal nutrient <b>quotas</b> <b>measured</b> in situ for each site. In each bay, model predictions were in agreement with observed algal coverage converted into biomass. A numerical tracking method was implemented to identify the contribution of the rivers that empty into the study bays, and scenarios of decreases in nitrate concentration in rivers were simulated. Results from numerical nitrogen tracking highlighted the main nitrogen sources of green tides and also showed that each river contributes locally to green tides. In addition, dynamic modelling showed that the nitrate concentrations in rivers must be limited to between 5 and 15 mg l- 1, depending on the bay, to reduce Ulva biomass by half on the coasts. The three-step methodology developed in this study (analysing total dissolved inorganic nitrogen flux from rivers, tracking nitrogen sources in Ulva and developing scenarios for reducing nitrogen) provides qualitative and quantitative guidelines for stakeholders to define specific nitrogen reduction targets for better environmental management of water quality...|$|R
40|$|Serious water scarcity, low water-use efficiency, and {{over-exploitation}} {{of underground}} water have hindered socio-economic development {{and led to}} environmental degradation in the Heihe River basin, northwestern China. Price leveraging is an important tool in water demand management, and it {{is considered to be}} effective in promoting water conservation and improving water use efficiency on the premise that water demand is elastic. In the present study, we examine whether price is an effective and applicable instrument for restraining the increasing demand for agricultural irrigation water in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin and how will it affect farmers' decisions on irrigation and crop structure. Specifically, the price elasticity of agricultural water demand was estimated based on the irrigation water demand function. The results show that the agricultural irrigation water price is statistically significant, but its elasticity is very low under current low water price. Price leverage cannot {{play a significant role in}} the context of the current pricing regime and farmers' response to price increase is intrinsically weak. To create incentives for conserving water and improving irrigation efficiency, price mechanism should be accompanied with clearly defined and legally enforceable water rights, restricted water <b>quota</b> <b>measures,</b> and reform of water authorities and water-user associations. Furthermore, increases of surface irrigation water price may lead to the over-withdrawal of groundwater, consequently, effective groundwater licensing and levying must take place to limit the total volume of groundwater withdrawal. In all, improving irrigation efficiency through better management and the adoption of water-saving technologies is the ultimate way to deal with the challenges facing irrigated agriculture in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin.

The thesis assembles this disparate research to provide a holistic account and analysis of the introduction, implementation and impact of gender quotas in politics in Pakistan and Bangladesh. This facilitates understanding of the overall processes associated with gender mainstreaming through quotas located in the social, cultural economical and political contexts of both countries. This research looks at women’s political empowerment through quotas at both national and local levels in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Comparison is made between Pakistan and Bangladesh to identify similarities and differences in their experiences with political gender quotas. The research assists in identifying key factors that explain how a policy works or does not; how it can be interpreted; and how it can be enacted and implemented in different ways by different actors.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{fisheries management}} scheme generates incentives to maximize a vessels {{share of the}} catch and encourages a ‘race to fish’. Individual vessel quota management schemes change the incentives to eliminate the ‘race to fish’ and {{have the potential to}} generate resource rent. An interesting question is whether it is the changed incentives due to individual quota or the capacity reduction due to transferability of individual quota that is most important in generating rent. In this study, the cost function approach is used to model the production technology for a fishery regulated with individual vessel <b>quotas.</b> We <b>measure</b> rent generated and potential rent in a fishery managed with individual vessel quotas at the vessel as well as the fleet level given the total quota and vessel type for the fishery. Country studies for Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the UK show that only at Iceland where the individual quotas are highly transferable is any rent generated.

At the same time, the U. S. action is likely to harm its automobile, metal products, and other related industries by raising the cost of intermediate input. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of U.

Fe <b>quotas</b> were <b>measured</b> using radioisotope uptake experiments (24 h incubation), bulk filtration and analysis by inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS), and single-cell synchrotron x-ray fluorescence (SXRF) analysis over a sixteen-day period (year days 263 to 278 of 2008) during a quasi-Lagrangian drifter experiment that tracked {{the evolution of}} the annual spring diatom bloom within a counter-clockwise open-ocean eddy. Overall, radioisotope uptake-determined Fe quotas (washed with oxalate reagent to remove extracellular Fe) were the lowest (0. 5 – 1. 0 mmol Fe:mol P; 4 – 8 μmol Fe:mol C), followed by single-cell Fe quotas (2. 3 – 7. 5 mmol Fe:mol P; 17 – 57 μmol Fe:mol C), and the highest and most variable quotas were from the bulk filtration ICPMS approach that used the oxalate reagent wash, corrected for lithogenic Fe using Al (0. 8 – 21 mmol Fe:mol P; 4 – 136 μmol Fe:mol C). During {{the evolution of the}} spring bloom within the eddy (year days 263 to 272), the surface mixed layer inventories of particulate biogenic elements (C, N, P, Si) and chlorophyll increased while Fe quotas estimated from all three approaches exhibited a general decline. After the onset of the bloom decline, the drogued buoys exited the eddy center (days 273 to 277). Fe quotas returned to pre-bloom values during this part of the study. Our standardized and coordinated sampling protocols reveal the general observed trend in Fe quotas: ICPMS > SXRF > radioisotope uptake. We discuss the inherent differences between the techniques and argue that each technique has its individual merits and uniquely contributes to the characterization of the oceanic particulate Fe pool...|$|R

One of the first short- and medium-term priorities in each country was to establish and consolidate standardization and conformity assessment structures. While the concept of “deeper integration beyond abolition of import tariffs and <b>quotas,</b> to further <b>measures</b> to remove market segmentation and promote integration ” (Venables 2000) is by and large not questioned, critical views on potential losses of national standards harming national identity – i. e., what constitutes “rum”, and how to address cheeses made from non-pasteurized sheep milk – are seen as well. The issue of “lost national standards ” is repeated: in 1987 the EU (then European Community) published its visionary plan on new, standardized Europe of 1992; a gain of 7 per cent of European income was estimated from harmonization (Emerson 1988, p. 6). Even then British were opposed to some parts of it, claiming “brilliant green mushy peas ” and “pink sausages ” are part of their national identity, and eventually succeeded in getting the necessary exemptions (Krugman and Obstfeld 2002). Although the harmonization issue {{has been on the}} tables in Brussels at least since the late 1980 s, it yet has to be concluded. Ove...|$|R

40|$|Global {{industrial}} production depends on stable access to raw inputs. Food price volatility {{has emerged as}} a major concern for Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (G 20), while we are hearing new calls for bringing global disciplines to resource cartels like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Supply chains that make up globalized production recently demonstrated their potential fragility when Chinese sovereign intervention threatened to bring Japan's high-tech manufacturing to its knees by cutting off its supplies. These wide-ranging issues are now being addressed under the umbrella of trade regulation. As a result, we are witnessing a shift from the old trade regulatory model of the past six decades - where trade negotiators focused on import barriers and reciprocal concessions and export restrictions were justified typically on grounds of national security and foreign policy - towards the realization of an increasing need to tighten global rules on export restrictions. Although commodity and resource prices are at least partly market- driven, sovereign intervention has finally emerged as a clear concern. The Obama Administration's first suit brought before the World Trade Organization (WTO) concerned Chinese export restrictions on nine commodities, including magnesium, coke, yellow phosphorus, and zinc, and]esulted in victory. Yet real General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) disciplines on export price <b>measures,</b> <b>quotas</b> and other conditions have been sparse. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

Naloga v prvem delu povzame zgodovinski razvoj ekonomske misli v zvezi z davčno diskriminacijo in razlogi zanjo, v drugem delu predstavi prepoved diskriminatornih davčnih norm ter poda analizo pomena prepovedi in postavi tezo, da je Prepoved diskriminatornih davčnih norm je civilizacijska pridobitev, ki prispeva tako k blaginji kakor k miru. Diskriminacija na omenjenem področju ima lahko namreč resne posledice tako na blaginjo v državi, kakor tudi na mednarodne odnose. Mogoče je celo dejati, da je vprašanje diskriminatornih davčnih norm, vprašanje vojne in miru. The {{subject of}} this {{undergraduate}} thesis is the ban on discriminatory tax norms, such as discriminatory customs, import <b>quotas</b> and similar <b>measures,</b> as well as discriminatory domestic taxes. In {{the first part of}} the thesis we summarized the historical development of the economic mentality in terms of discriminatory taxation and the underlying grounds for it. In the second part we present the prohibition of discriminatory taxation norms and offer an analysis of its importance. In addition, we offer a thesis that the ban on discriminatory taxation norms is a civilizational acquisition, which contributes to prosperity and peace. Discrimination in this field can have serious consequences on prosperity in the country as well as on international relations. It can even be said that the question of discriminatory taxation norms is a question of war and peace...|$|R
