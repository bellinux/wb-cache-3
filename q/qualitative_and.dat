It conducts <b>qualitative</b> <b>and</b> quantitative analysis {{in order to}} evaluate management decisions across {{the public and private}} sectors. According to The New York Times, it is considered the most prestigious management consultancy in the world. McKinsey publishes the McKinsey Quarterly since 1964, funds the McKinsey Global Institute research organization, publishes reports on management topics, and has authored many influential books on management.

Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E
