25|$|<b>Quasi-experimental</b> {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a relationship between intrusive thoughts and intentional control responses such that suppression increases the frequency of unwanted intrusive thoughts. These results suggest that suppression of intrusive thoughts may be important {{in the development and}} maintenance of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{qualitative}} {{data can be}} used to strengthen quantitative research designs in general and intervention research designs (i.e., experimental, <b>quasi-experimental)</b> in particular. For example, in educational psychology, researchers could conduct a qualitative pilot study to determine which group of students should be selected for quantitative study by observing or interviewing different groups of students.|$|E
25|$|Self-report survey {{methodology}} is {{the most}} used approach in OHP research. Cross-sectional designs are commonly used; case-control designs have been employed much less frequently. Longitudinal designs including prospective cohort studies and experience sampling studies can examine relationships over time. OHP-related research devoted to evaluating health-promoting workplace interventions has relied on <b>quasi-experimental</b> designs and, less commonly, experimental approaches.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quasi-experimental</b> design refers {{especially}} to situations precluding random assignment to different conditions. Researchers can use {{common sense to}} consider how much the nonrandom assignment threatens the study's validity. For example, in research on {{the best way to}} affect reading achievement in the first three grades of school, school administrators may not permit educational psychologists to randomly assign children to phonics and whole language classrooms, in which case the psychologists must work with preexisting classroom assignments. Psychologists will compare the achievement of children attending phonics and whole language classes.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, a <b>quasi-experimental</b> {{study was}} {{conducted}} that included homeschooled and traditional public students {{between the ages of}} 5 & 10 and it was discovered {{that the majority of the}} homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared to their counterparts (Chang, Gould, & Meuse, 2001). However, Martin-Chang also found that unschooling children ages 5–10 scored significantly below traditionally educated children, while academically oriented homeschooled children scored from one half grade level above to 4.5 grade levels above traditionally schooled children on standardized tests (n=37 home schooled children matched with children from the same socioeconomic and educational background).|$|E
25|$|The {{prognosis}} for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor, {{with some studies}} reporting that treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy as measured by recidivism rates, though {{it is noted that}} one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment, a 2011 retrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s, had several serious methodological problems and likely would not be approved of today. However, some relatively rigorous <b>quasi-experimental</b> studies using more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none were randomized controlled trials. Various other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study has of yet in a 2013 review examined if the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy could be changed by such treatments.|$|E
25|$|One of Persinger's lifelong endeavors {{has been}} to {{establish}} a mechanism underlying geophysical-behavioral correlates using experimental simulations. The Tectonic Strain Theory (TST) developed by Persinger and John S. Derr predicted that luminous phenomena and associated physical effects were produced by manifestations of tectonic strain that often precedes by weeks to months seismic events within the region. Persinger argues that the labeling of these manifestations such as unidentified flying objects (UFOs) {{has changed over the}} centuries and reflects the characteristics of the culture. The support for the theory was primarily correlational. The temporal contiguity of reports of unidentified luminous phenomena preceding local seismicity due to injections of fluids was considered a <b>quasi-experimental</b> support for the hypothesis. Alternative models, developed by Persinger and David Vares, were quantified for interaction between quantum values and specific magnitude earthquakes, global climate variations, interactions with population densities, discrete energies as mediators of disease, and processes by which human cognition could be covertly affected by Schumann Resonances and geomagnetic activity. The hypothesis was recently criticized by a prominent blogger. Persinger has estimated that the total biomass of the planet was equivalent to the accumulated solar energy (solar constant) on the Earth’s surface. The shared photon origin was considered one source for “entanglement” between living systems.|$|E
25|$|All {{researched}} psychological {{traits are}} influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees. These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother {{in his or her}} (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this simple transmission model are completely confounded. Experimental and <b>quasi-experimental</b> behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior. Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studies. One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic, where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder. Active research continues to understand the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction.|$|E
2500|$|A 2005 review found 83 {{randomized}} {{experiments in}} criminology published in 1982-2004, {{compared with only}} 35 published in 1957-1981. The authors classified the studies they found into five categories: [...] "policing", [...] "prevention", [...] "corrections", [...] "court", and [...] "community". [...] Focusing only on offending behavior programs, Hollin (2008) argued that RCTs {{may be difficult to}} implement (e.g., if an RCT required [...] "passing sentences that would randomly assign offenders to programmes") and therefore that experiments with <b>quasi-experimental</b> design are still necessary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rebound effect}} can {{increase}} the difficulty of projecting the reduction in greenhouse emissions from an improvement in energy efficiency. Estimation of the scale of direct effects on residential electricity, heating and motor fuel consumption has been common motivation for research of rebound effects. Evaluation and econometric methods are the two approaches generally employed in estimating {{the size of this}} effect. [...] Evaluation methods rely on <b>quasi-experimental</b> studies and measure the before and after changes to energy consumption from the implementation of energy efficient technology, while econometric methods utilize elasticity estimates to forecast the likely effects from changes in the effective price of energy services.|$|E
2500|$|Chinese {{mathematics}} made early contributions, {{including a}} place value system. [...] The geometrical theorem {{known to the}} ancient Chinese were acquainted was applicable in certain cases (namely the ratio of sides). It is that geometrical theorems which can be demonstrated in the <b>quasi-experimental</b> way of superposition were also known to them. In arithmetic their knowledge {{seems to have been}} confined to the art of calculation by means of the swan-pan, and the power of expressing the results in writing. Our knowledge of the early attainments of the Chinese, slight though it is, is more complete than in the case of most of their contemporaries. It is thus instructive, and serves to illustrate the fact, that it can be known a nation may possess considerable skill in the applied arts with but our knowledge of the later mathematics on which those arts are founded can be scarce. Knowledge of Chinese mathematics before 254 BC is somewhat fragmentary, and even after this date the manuscript traditions are obscure. Dates centuries before the classical period are generally considered conjectural by Chinese scholars unless accompanied by verified archaeological evidence.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{behavioral}} {{interventions and}} supports, {{school psychologists are}} often responsible for selecting and implementing academic interventions. In the 1990s, school psychology service delivery shifted towards a problem-solving focus, which is an approach aimed at developing interventions and ensuring outcomes. This was {{in contrast to the}} previous wait-to-fail model. This problem-solving approach is commonly referred to as the Response to Intervention (RTI) framework and is steadily becoming adopted by more and more schools. It is made up of a multi-tiered system of support that provides interventions and services to students with an increasing intensity based on severity of needs. [...] RTI necessitates that school psychologists be involved in the early identification of learning and behavioral difficulties and needs. School psychologists work collaboratively with teachers and other special education staff to determine what services and supports need to be implemented to best serve struggling students. RTI includes specific components to effectively ensure that all students are making adequate progress. Included is: 1) High quality instruction and behavioral support, 2) Well-researched, evidence-based interventions that are implemented with fidelity, 3) Continuous progress monitoring and data collection, 4) Continuous collaboration of an educational team, and 5) Parent involvement and participation. [...] These interventions can be conceptualized as a set of procedures and strategies designed to improve student performance with the intent of closing the gap between how a student is currently performing and the expectations of how they should be performing. [...] Short term and long term interventions used within a problem-solving model must be evidence-based. This means the intervention strategies must have been evaluated by experimental or <b>quasi-experimental</b> research that utilized rigorous data analysis and peer review procedures to determine the effectiveness. [...] Implementing evidence-based interventions for behavior and academic concerns requires significant training, skill development, and supervised practice. Linking assessment and intervention is critical for determining that the correct intervention has been chosen. [...] School psychologists have been specifically trained to ensure that interventions are implemented with integrity to maximize positive outcomes for children in a school setting.|$|E

50|$|Though quasi-experiments are {{sometimes}} shunned {{by those who}} consider themselves to be experimental purists (leading Donald T. Campbell to coin the term “queasy experiments” for them), they are exceptionally useful in areas where it is not feasible or desirable to conduct an experiment or randomized control trial. Such instances include evaluating the impact of public policy changes, educational interventions or large scale health interventions. The primary drawback of <b>quasi-experimental</b> designs is that they cannot eliminate the possibility of confounding bias, which can hinder one’s ability to draw causal inferences. This drawback {{is often used to}} discount <b>quasi-experimental</b> results. However, such bias can be controlled for using various statistical techniques such as multiple regression, if one can identify and measure the confounding variable(s). Such techniques can be used to model and partial out the effects of confounding variables techniques, thereby improving the accuracy of the results obtained from quasi-experiments. Moreover, the developing use of propensity score matching to match participants on variables important to the treatment selection process can also improve the accuracy of <b>quasi-experimental</b> results.In fact, data derived from <b>quasi-experimental</b> analyses has been shown to closely match experimental data in certain cases, even when different criteria were used. In sum, quasi-experiments are a valuable tool, especially for the applied researcher. On their own, <b>quasi-experimental</b> designs do not allow one to make definitive causal inferences; however, they provide necessary and valuable information that cannot be obtained by experimental methods alone. Researchers, especially those interested in investigating applied research questions, should move beyond the traditional experimental design and avail themselves of the possibilities inherent in <b>quasi-experimental</b> designs.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>quasi-experimental</b> {{designs are}} used when {{randomization}} is impractical and/or unethical, they are typically easier {{to set up}} than true experimental designs, which require random assignment of subjects. Additionally, utilizing <b>quasi-experimental</b> designs minimizes threats to ecological validity as natural environments do not suffer the same problems of artificiality as compared to a well-controlled laboratory setting. Since quasi-experiments are natural experiments, findings in one may be applied to other subjects and settings, allowing for some generalizations to be made about population. Also, this experimentation method is efficient in longitudinal research that involves longer time periods which can be followed up in different environments.|$|E
