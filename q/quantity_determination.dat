Because the possibilities of conditioning and distribution are limited, security of supply must take absolute priority. In this paper, measuring systems are described which are able to determine heat quantities accurately with the help of certain processing routines. These systems will assume ever-greater importance on account of today's energy prices. Besides the measuring systems, possibilities of measurement recording and processing are described. The following procedures are discussed: - Determination of characteristic gas quality data. - Measurement of gas volume taking gas quality into account (density-correction). - Comparison of measurement results with respect to forecasted an actual gas quality. - Determination of heat quantities by linking volume and calorific value on various time bases (monthly, daily, hourly). - Heat <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> dependent on gas throughput. - Continuous heat <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> through the use of energy computers. ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a framework to approach price and <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> in the roundwood market from a slightly new perspective. In {{the spirit of the}} trade union literature, a model of timber price determination is formulated according to which the forest owners' association determines timber prices and then forest firms unilaterally decide upon the timber to be used. The novelty here is to incorporate investment decisions of firms as a strategic factor into the model. The structure of the model is the following. The game is played in two stages. First, the forest owners' association and the firms in the forest industry decide on timber prices and capital stock, respectively. In the second stage, the firms determine timber demand conditional on the timber price-capital stock game, so that the equilibrium concept is the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. This game-theoretic model is applied to the annual data from the Finnish paper and pulp industry over the period 1960 - 1992. Estimation and testing results concerning the price and <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> of timber as well as capital stock determination are generally favorable for the hypotheses presented.

Efficiency is paramount, and to a great extent, this is determined by the integrated autocorrelation time (IAcT). This quantity varies depending on the observable that is being estimated. It is suggested that it is the maximum of the IAcT over all observables that is the relevant metric. Reviewed here is a method for estimating this quantity. For reversible propagators (which are those that satisfy detailed balance), the maximum IAcT is determined by the spectral gap in the forward transfer operator, but for irreversible propagators, the maximum IAcT can be far less than or greater than what might be inferred from the spectral gap. This is consistent with recent theoretical results (not to mention past practical experience) suggesting that irreversible propagators generally perform better if not much better than reversible ones. Typical irreversible propagators have a parameter controlling the mix of ballistic and diffusive movement.

The discharge is ignited by a short 10 ns voltage pulse with a peak voltage of 1. 3 kV followed by a 150 ns plateau of about 350 V. Pulsing is at 12 kHz which leaves {{a significant amount of}} residual charge between the individual pulses. Temporally resolved laser electric field measurement in the centre of the discharge employing a non-linear four-wave mixing scheme, ultra-high speed optical imaging by an ICCD camera at Balmer-alpha and Fulcher lines as well as the undispersed emission, and current and voltage measurements are performed. Special emphasis is put on a detailed analysis of the measured data by combining the results from the various diagnostics. This allows in addition to the directly measured <b>quantities</b> <b>determination</b> of the absolute evolution of the electron density, the development of space charge shielding, and the observation of the local electron dynamics. Pressure variations in a limited range indicate reasonable agreement with the Paschen law but raise also questions on the definition of the break down voltage under highly transient conditions. 2 Atmospheric pressure discharges under small spatial dimensions, so called microplasmas, have attracted large attention in recent years. On one hand large expectations on industrial applications exists while on the other hand the physics is often complex and difficult to investigate. In particular diagnostics is a challenge since most of the tools and techniques developed over decades for low-pressure, large scale discharges can not be applied here. Many types of microplasmas operate in pulsed mode and the transient phase of their ignition is even more difficult to access by adding to the already microscopic dimensions also fast temporal changes on ns or sub-ns timescales. Here an experimental investigation of the rapid ignition phase and the subsequent transition to quasi-DC operation in a molecular gas (hydrogen) is reported. The geometry is one-dimensional to allow a simple interpretation. The main parameters determined directly are the discharge voltage, the current density, the electric field in the centre of the discharge, and the spatially and temporally resolved emission. First successful application of these diagnostics to a similar setup was reported in [1 - 3]. Here we go beyond by more detailed studies and in particular a careful analysis and interpretation of the data. From the combination of the directly measured quantities with simple and robust models further insight in the ignition dynamics is provided.
