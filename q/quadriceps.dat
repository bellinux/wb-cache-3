5|$|During the May 21, 2001 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, he {{suffered}} a legitimate and career-threatening injury. In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left <b>quadriceps</b> muscle, causing it to come completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the <b>quadriceps.</b> The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E
5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} <b>quadriceps.</b> This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E
5|$|With {{his pace}} and high field goal percentage, Parker {{has been named}} to six NBA All-Star games, three All-NBA Second Teams, and an All-NBA Third Team. He was also the 2007 NBA Finals MVP. A severe injury to his left <b>quadriceps</b> tendon in Game 2 {{in the second round}} of the 2017 playoffs ended his season.|$|E
5|$|After the {{graduation}} of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At {{the conclusion of}} spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a <b>quadriceps</b> injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.|$|E
5|$|At Cyber Sunday during DX's {{feud with}} Rated-RKO, special guest referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal {{use of a}} weapon to give Rated-RKO the win. At Survivor Series, DX got their revenge when their team {{defeated}} Edge and Orton's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match. In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right <b>quadriceps</b> (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} that Triple H was injured with a ruptured <b>quadriceps</b> tendon {{and he did not}} compete on WWE television for over seven months. Shawn Michaels however, continued his feud with Rated-RKO by teaming up with Cena and defeating them for their World Tag Team Championship on the post-Royal Rumble episode of Raw. The feud ended shortly afterwards as Rated-RKO disbanded after their own rivalry began. A Triple Threat match, a standard match involving three wrestlers was made between Edge, Orton, and Michaels. Michaels won the match to become the number one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 23. Michaels then feuded with Cena, which would end at Backlash, when Cena defeated Edge, Orton and Michaels in a Fatal Four Way match, a standard wrestling match involving four wrestlers to retain his WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{played the}} Orange Bowl without {{starting}} linebacker Lyndell Gibson, who fractured his shoulder {{in the second}} quarter of the ACC Championship Game. Gibson was fourth on the team in tackles with 66. Replacing Gibson was redshirt freshman Tariq Edwards, who played only a few times before the Orange Bowl. The Hokies also returned a player from injury for the Orange Bowl. Linebacker Barquell Rivers, who had been predicted to be Tech's starting middle linebacker, suffered a torn <b>quadriceps</b> tendon in offseason workouts, causing him to miss every game. Heading into the Orange Bowl, coaches were optimistic that he had healed enough to be able to play.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} 2016–17 season, Parker lost {{longtime}} teammate Tim Duncan to retirement. The Spurs finished {{the season with}} a 61–21 record, as they registered back-to-back 60-win seasons {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Parker played 63 games and averaged 10.1 points per game, his lowest average since his rookie season. In the 2017 playoffs, the Spurs were once again matched with Grizzlies in the first round. San Antonio again defeated Memphis 4–2, with Parker averaging 16.3 points per game in the series. After scoring 18 points in Game 2 of the second round, a win against the Houston Rockets, Parker left the game with a rupture of his left <b>quadriceps</b> tendon that will preclude his return to the playoffs and may miss eight months. Game 3 of the series marked San Antonio's first postseason game without Parker since 2001, which ended an NBA record of 221 straight playoff appearances for Parker.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Amadi {{signed with}} the Calgary Stampeders and joined the team {{in the middle of}} {{training}} camp. Amadi was initially considered unlikely to play a large role, but he was forced into a starting role after two knee injuries to starting defensive halfbacks Brandon Smith and J. R. Ruffin. Amadi struggled in his first starts for the Stampeders, but he improved as the season continued. He started in 11 consecutive games before being moved to the practice squad, where he remained {{for the rest of the}} season. Before being moved off the active roster, Amadi recorded 28 tackles, three pass deflections, and a sack. He later re-{{signed with the}} Stampeders but was released after suffering a strained <b>quadriceps</b> in the preseason. Amadi played for the Tulsa Talons of the AFL in 2010, recording 24 solo tackles, six tackle assists, seven pass breakups and one fumble recovery.|$|E
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and <b>quadriceps</b> muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing forward thrust from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|Stacy Warner is {{a fictional}} {{recurring}} character portrayed by Sela Ward on the Fox Broadcasting Company's medical drama House. She {{was in a}} relationship with Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), when a clotted aneurysm in his right thigh led to an infarction during a game of golf, causing his <b>quadriceps</b> muscle to become necrotic. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced coma. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain {{for the rest of his}} life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with acute intermittent porphyria, and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints is achieved through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs is achieved through the movement of the <b>quadriceps</b> group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock is achieved by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E
5|$|Vick {{started out}} well, winning {{his first game}} against the Redskins and {{throwing}} had his first career 400 yard game in a close loss to the Chargers, with 4 passing TDs, 2 rushing TDs, and no interceptions in the two game stretch. After that, Vick suffered losses against Kansas City and Denver, where he threw for 1 touchdown and 3 INTs in that stretch (all 3 were thrown against Kansas City). In {{a game against the}} Giants, Vick was 6–14 for 105 yards, when he suffered a hamstring injury. Nick Foles played stellar in his place, going 8–2 as starter, while throwing 27 touchdowns to only 2 interceptions with a 119.0 passer rating. Vick saw his only playing time in a 15–7 loss to the Giants, where he was 6–9 for 30 yards and an interception, but he again suffered an injury, this time to his <b>quadriceps,</b> and was replaced by rookie Matt Barkley, who played even worse. Foles returned the following week, and Vick {{spent the rest of the}} season as the backup, making only one more appearance in a blowout win over the Chicago Bears.|$|E
5|$|With the {{transition}} to hard courts after Wimbledon, Raonic made {{the quarterfinals of the}} Canadian Open, losing to Monfils, before falling to Murray for the fifth time in 2016 in the Cincinnati Masters semifinal. Raonic was the fifth seed at the US Open, but lost in the second round to Ryan Harrison, partly due to debilitating cramps. In September, cramps were cited as the reason for Raonic to miss Canada's Davis Cup tie against Chile. Later that month, Raonic failed to defend his title at the St. Petersburg Open, falling in his opening match to Youzhny. Raonic withdrew from the China Open prior to his semifinal match due to an ankle injury sustained in the quarterfinal. With the result, Raonic qualified for the ATP World Tour Finals for the second time. Raonic suffered another injury, a <b>quadriceps</b> tear, during his quarterfinal match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga at the Paris Masters and withdrew before his scheduled semifinal against Murray.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} the Royal Rumble match. Before the match, Kurt Angle stole Nunzio's {{entrance}} number and replaced {{him in the}} match. The participants divided into their brands and fought against each other, working together to eliminate Muhammad Hassan, the thirteen entrant. Scotty 2 Hotty, the fifteenth entrant, was attacked by Hassan during his entrance and never entered the match. Angle, the twentieth entrant, dominated upon entering until Shawn Michaels eliminated him. Angle came back to eliminate Michaels and attacked him. The final four participants remaining were Batista, United States Champion John Cena, Edge, and Rey Mysterio. Edge fought with Mysterio, executing a spear to eliminate Mysterio. Cena and Batista then eliminated Edge as he was attacking them. Cena tried to perform an FU on Batista but Batista countered. Batista then attempted a Batista Bomb but was countered with a headscissors takedown by Cena, sending both over the top rope and touching the floor at the same time. The referees for the Raw brand believed Batista to be the winner while the SmackDown! referees believed Cena to be winner. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon came to the ring, in the process legitimately tearing both his <b>quadriceps</b> muscles, and ordered the match to be restarted with the final two participants. Batista eliminated Cena following a Spinebuster to win the match.|$|E
5|$|After an eight-game goal drought, Giovinco {{scored a}} hat-trick against D.C. United, on 23 July, in a 4–1 home win, also surpassing De Rosario's {{previous}} all-time record as Toronto FC's top scorer by two goals to 35 goals. With two goals from free kicks during the match, including his {{seventh in the}} MLS, he broke David Beckham's record for most goals from set-pieces in the league since 2010. He {{was named to the}} Team of the Week once again for his performances, and was also named MLS Player of the Week {{for the first time that}} season. On 27 August, Giovinco was brought off the field after the later diagnosis of strains in his <b>quadriceps</b> and adductor in the eventual 1–0 loss in the 401 Derby with Montreal at home; although he was initially expected to be sidelined for a month, the injury was more severe than expected, and he ended up missing seven weeks of play. He finally returned to action on 16 October, against Montreal once again, helping to set up Toronto's equaliser in a 2–2 away draw. On 26 October, Giovinco scored the opening goal of a 3–1 home win over Philadelphia, both his and Toronto FC's first MLS Playoff goal in the MLS Cup Playoffs, and was later involved in his team's next two goals; this was Toronto's first ever playoff win, which enabled the team to progress to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals for the first time. On 6 November in the second leg of the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, Giovinco scored a hat-trick in a 5–0 away win over New York City FC, 7–0 on aggregate, to progress to the Eastern Conference Finals in an all Canadian derby against Montreal Impact. In the first leg of the Eastern Conference Final on 22 November, Giovinco set up Jozy Altidore's goal in a 3–2 away loss to Montreal. Toronto later beat Montreal 5–2 in extra time in the return leg at home on 30 November, as Giovinco once again set up Altidore's goal, winning on an aggregated score of 7–5, making Toronto FC the first Canadian team to compete in an MLS Cup Final; although he was forced off in the 97th minute due to cramp in his calf, he was later declared fit to play against Seattle Sounders in the 2016 MLS Cup Final. On 5 December, he was named to the MLS Best XI for the second season in a row, despite being left off the finalists list for the MLS MVP.|$|E
25|$|The <b>quadriceps</b> tendon, while {{historically}} {{reserved for}} revision reconstructions, {{has enjoyed a}} renewed focus as a versatile and durable graft for primary reconstructions. Use of the <b>quadriceps</b> tendon usually does not result in {{the same degree of}} anterior knee pain postoperatively, and <b>quadriceps</b> tendon harvest produces a reliably thick, robust graft. The <b>quadriceps</b> tendon has approximately 20% greater collagen per cross-sectional area than the patellar tendon, and a greater diameter of usable soft tissue is available.|$|E
25|$|With Leonard out an {{extended}} period with a <b>quadriceps</b> injury, Anderson began 2017–18 as a starter.|$|E
25|$|A 2001 study, {{conducted}} by Aagaard et al., utilized MRI, ultrasonography and muscle biopsy techniques {{to examine the}} relationship between muscle architecture, contractile strength and pennation angle in the human <b>quadriceps</b> muscle after 14 weeks of resistance training. Upon completion of the training program, Aagaard et al. noticed a symmetrical increase in <b>quadriceps</b> CSA and volume, as each increased 10.2 and 10.3 percent respectively; however, these parameters increased disproportionately to <b>quadriceps</b> PCSA, which grew 16 percent. The rapid increase in PCSA was accompanied by a 35.5% increase in the fascicle pennation angle of the vastus lateris, one of the major <b>quadriceps</b> muscles, as well as a 16% increase in myofiber CSA. The increase in pennation angle in the vastus lateris resulted in an increase to the muscle’s PCSA, a measure proportional to the contractile force a pennate muscle is capable of producing. Work by Azizi et al. suggests this increase in pennation angle of the vastus lateris following resistance training generates an increase in the muscle’s AGR, a property which allows the whole muscle to contract with a higher velocity.|$|E
25|$|An {{accessory}} hamstring {{or part of}} the patellar ligament are {{the most}} common donor tissues used in autografts. The <b>quadriceps</b> tendon can also be used if the patellar ligament has been harvested for a previous surgery.|$|E
25|$|Parts of {{the body}} which play an {{important}} role in performing this asana are: both the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the feet, the <b>quadriceps,</b> the iliopsoas muscles, the piriformis, abdominal wall, and the diaphragm.|$|E
25|$|Barkley's {{second game}} came the {{following}} week in relief of Foles (concussion) and Vick (<b>quadriceps)</b> on October 27 versus the New York Giants. Barkley completed 17 of 26 passes for 158 yards, no touchdowns, 1 interception and 1 fumble inside their red zone.|$|E
25|$|On the July 8, 2002 {{episode of}} Raw, Waltman {{wrestled}} {{in his last}} WWE match, a ten-man tag. This match was also {{the end of the}} nWo angle, as Nash tore his <b>quadriceps,</b> and Vince McMahon disbanded the group a week later.|$|E
25|$|Injuries to <b>quadriceps</b> or hamstrings {{are caused}} by the {{constant}} impact loads to the legs during activities, such as kicking a ball. While doing this type of motion, 85% of that shock is absorbed to the hamstrings which can cause strain to those muscles.|$|E
25|$|This {{particular}} swimming technique encompasses all {{the muscles}} in the knee and will increase not only mobility but also {{the strength of the}} surrounding muscles, which include the <b>quadriceps,</b> hamstrings, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior (shin muscle), abductor hallucis, abductor digiti minimi, and flexor digitorum brevis (foot muscles).|$|E
25|$|Colonies vary in size {{depending}} upon species, but generally consist {{of fewer than}} 100 individuals. Dinoponera australis colonies have an average of 14 workers (range 3–37), Dinoponera gigantea average 41 workers (range 30–96) and Dinoponera <b>quadriceps</b> has the largest colonies {{with an average of}} 80 workers (range 26–238).|$|E
25|$|Piriformis {{syndrome}} is often left undiagnosed and mistaken with other pains due to similar symptoms with back pain, <b>quadriceps</b> pain, lower leg pain, and buttock pain. These symptoms include tenderness, tingling and numbness initiating in lower back and buttock area and then radiating {{down to the}} thigh and to the leg.|$|E
25|$|Bipedalism {{requires}} strong leg muscles, {{particularly in}} the thighs. Contrast in domesticated poultry the well muscled legs, against the small and bony wings. Likewise in humans, the <b>quadriceps</b> and hamstring muscles of the thigh are both so crucial to bipedal activities that each alone is {{much larger than the}} well-developed biceps of the arms.|$|E
25|$|Young {{injured his}} <b>quadriceps</b> {{during the first}} half of a matchup against Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 6. Young went to the {{dressing}} room clutching his leg, but returned after half-time and was shown warming up on the sidelines. However, he would not return to the game as a precautionary measure. The Titans would go on to lose the game 13–10.|$|E
25|$|The nest {{consists}} of large chambers and tunnels {{in the soil}} possibly with an earthen mound and can be 0.10–1.2 m deep. Nests are deeper in Dinoponera australis and Dinoponera <b>quadriceps</b> than in Dinoponera gigantea, Monnin et al. (2003) suggests that deeper nests are a possible adaptation to seasons and aridity. Dinoponera gigantea nests may have up to eight entrances and can be weakly polydomous, whereas 1–30 openings {{with an average of}} 11 were recorded for Dinoponera longipes. Nesting density and spatial distribution varies depending on habitat. Density ranges from 15–40 nests per ha−1 to 80 nests per ha−1. Morgan (1993) measured a spacing between nests for Dinoponera longipes with a median of 35 m (n=22, range 14–69.5 m). Dinoponera australis and Dinoponera gigantea usually nest at the base of trees. Observations of Dinoponera <b>quadriceps</b> nests show that in more arid Caatinga and Cerrado habitats, nests are predominantly constructed under trees, whereas in Atlantic forest 60% of nests were 3 m away from any tree.|$|E
25|$|For subduing large live prey and defense, workers {{possess a}} sting {{that has been}} known to cause severe pain lasting up to 48 hours. Lymphaedenopathy, edema, {{tachycardia}} and fresh blood appearing in human victim feces are common symptoms. In gamergates the venom sac is empty. Workers may have 60–75 unique proteinaceous components in the venom. The convoluted gland within the venom system of Dinoponera australis has been found to possess close similarities to those of vespine wasps. The contents of Dinoponera australis venom {{have been found to be}} similar to those of Pachycondyla spp. Due to the high diversity of compounds and systemic effects, venom of Dinoponera could be of use to the pharmaceutical industry. For instance, Sousa et al. (2012) demonstrated in mice that venom from Dinoponera <b>quadriceps</b> had antinociceptive properties. The authors note that the local population of northeast Brazil uses dry crushed Dinoponera <b>quadriceps</b> ants to treat earaches, and the stings of live ants are administered for back pain and rheumatism.|$|E
25|$|AMPK and {{thyroid hormone}} {{regulate}} some similar processes. Knowing these similarities, Winder and Hardie et al. designed an experiment {{to see if}} AMPK was influenced by thyroid hormone. They found {{that all of the}} subunits of AMPK were increased in skeletal muscle, especially in the soleus and red <b>quadriceps,</b> with thyroid hormone treatment. There was also an increase in phospho-ACC, a marker of AMPK activity.|$|E
25|$|Some also study patient {{satisfaction}} data associated with pain. Retaining the {{posterior cruciate ligament}} (PCL) {{has been shown to}} be beneficial for patients. Removal of the PCL has been shown to reduce the maximal force that the individual can place on that knee. Typically individuals who have the PCL removed will lean forward while climbing in order to maximize the force of the <b>quadriceps.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike the patellar ligament, the {{hamstring}} tendon's fixation to {{the bone}} can be affected by motion after surgery. Therefore, a brace {{is often used to}} immobilize the knee for one to two weeks. Evidence suggests that the hamstring tendon graft does as well, or nearly as well, as the patellar ligament graft in the long term. Common problems during recovery include strengthening of the <b>quadriceps,</b> T-band, and calf muscles.|$|E
25|$|D-Generation X and Rated-RKO {{continued}} feuding, and at Survivor Series, Team DX {{won with}} a clean sweep of Team Rated-RKO. The feud continued until New Year's Revolution, where the match between them for the World Tag Team Championship ended in a No Contest after Triple H delivered a Spinebuster on Orton and tore his <b>quadriceps</b> which was the main cause {{for the end of}} the DX return storyline.|$|E
25|$|A {{seemingly}} paradoxical role of AMPK {{occurs when}} we {{take a closer look}} at the energy-sensing enzyme in relation to exercise and long-term training. Similar to short-term acute training scale, long-term endurance training studies also reveal increases in oxidative metabolic enzymes, GLUT-4, mitochondrial size and quantity, and an increased dependency on the oxidation of fatty acids; however, Winder et al. reported in 2002 that despite observing these increased oxidative biochemical adaptations to long-term endurance training (similar to those mentioned above), the AMPK response (activation of AMPK with the onset of exercise) to acute bouts of exercise decreased in red <b>quadriceps</b> (RQ) with training (3 – see Fig.1). Conversely, the study did not observe the same results in white <b>quadriceps</b> (WQ) and soleus (SOL) muscles that they did in RQ. The trained rats used for that endurance study ran on treadmills 5 days/wk in two 1-h sessions, morning and afternoon. The rats were also running up to 31m/min (grade 15%). Finally, following training, the rats were sacrificed either at rest or following 10 min. of exercise.|$|E
