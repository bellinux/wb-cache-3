His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a few thousand dollars he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E

I have never found one among them, who could deny that that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.” That was an age when India’s past was still to be fully realised.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of LGBT theatre in Singapore, {{it was only in}} the second half of the 1980s that gay writers started to explore the {{hitherto}} taboo area of homosexuality in their works. The licensing authority, however, was not <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> so that in 1988, three plays with gay themes were banned from being performed. These were Eleanor Wong's Jackson on a Jaunt, Chay Yew's As If He Hears and Russell Heng's Lest The Demons Get To Me. The first two plays were subsequently staged in 1989/1990 after negotiations with the authority. The third was staged in 1992 after Singapore's culture policy was liberalised by its new Prime Minister, Goh Chok Tong.|$|E
25|$|While {{his colleagues}} saw {{football}} {{as a marketing}} and public relation investment and were <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> to siphon funds out of their main business to keep their teams afloat and replenish their player roster Spinelli saw Genoa as another business whose main aim was that of generating revenue for its owner (namely, himself) and so was {{more than happy to}} sell esteemed players for hefty revenues of which just a minimal fraction was then re-invested in the team, often for the acquisition of lesser-valued replacements or virtual unknowns. Thus he proved all-too-eager to sell Uruguayan striker Carlos Aguilera and to replace him with the markedly inferior Kazuyoshi Miura from the Japanese Yomiuri Verdy (a deal that especially pleased him since the Japanese sponsors were actually paying him to let Miura play in Italian Serie A).|$|E
500|$|Ritt {{asked that}} the {{housekeeper}} character (originally Halmea, a black woman) be renamed Alma and played by a white actress, because he thought a relationship between Hud and a black woman would not work. According to Ravetch and Frank, [...] "Neither American film nor American society was <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> for that back then". Although Halmea is raped by Hud in the novel, Ravetch and Frank added Lonnie's intervention to [...] "highlight" [...] his significance and keep Hud [...] "human" [...] and not [...] "totally and simplistically evil". To accentuate the scene's violence, Hud's roughness was complemented {{by the use of}} shadows, while a camera was attached on Newman's back to create a [...] "man's view angle" [...] while he chased Neal. Film critic Pauline Kael described Neal's performance as [...] "perhaps the first female equivalent of the white-negro".|$|E

In the audio commentary, Wilson noted that [...] "The Coup" [...] is [...] "not a fan favorite," [...] though it was submitted for an Emmy Award. For his work on this episode, Paul Lieberstein was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay – Episodic Comedy.|$|E
500|$|During the action, Tiger {{was hit by}} six German shells, {{the most}} {{significant}} {{of which was a}} [...] shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. Tigers repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, Tigers own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 [...] shells fired, scoring one hit each on Seydlitz and [...] Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a [...] "" [...] and adding [...] "The Tigers gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to {{have had a lot of}} practice.". In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through Tigers part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: [...] "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success." [...] The ship was given a refit in December 1915.|$|E

500|$|In 1932, Hensley and {{his family}} moved to Pineville, Kentucky, after a {{religious}} layman, who had seen Hensley handle snakes in Chattanooga, entreated him to come to the area. He returned to ministry and built the Pineville Church of God. Hensley established the church himself and characterized it as a [...] "free Pentecostal" [...] church. He continued to move frequently, a practice which Thomas Burton of East Tennessee State University attributes to [...] "wanderlust". In July 1935, Irene gave birth to a child in Pennington Gap, Virginia, and a month later, they were living in St. Charles, Virginia, while Hensley performed snake-handling services in the area. He successfully drew crowds to his preaching. In Norton, Virginia, 500 people attended an event, although that service was thrown into disarray after a boy in the audience killed one of the snakes. In 1936, Hensley built a house {{on the back of a}} trailer truck and drove to Florida to hold revival services. By March 1936, he had reached Tampa, Florida, where he drew over 100 people to a snake-handling service. He traveled to Bartow, Florida, where over 700 people attended one of his tent meetings. He subsequently ministered in Bloomingdale, Florida, before traveling north to Barrow County, Georgia, in late April. During a service in Barrow, a young agricultural worker was bitten by a snake and became ill. Hensley spoke to reporters and claimed that the man was bitten because he was [...] "not <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> for the demonstrations of the power". He predicted that the young man would miraculously recover, but the man died. This was the first death by snakebite to occur at one of Hensley's services. He conducted the man's funeral and left the area for fear of prosecution. His conduct was condemned by a local newspaper.|$|E
500|$|May did {{not play}} for Millwall {{at the start of}} the 2003–04 season, and was {{consequently}} loaned out once more, this time to Brentford on 25 August 2003. He joined the club on an initial three-month loan deal. He made his debut in Brentford's 2–1 home win against Oldham Athletic, playing the whole match. May scored his first goal for Brentford two weeks later, on 6 September 2003, in a 3–1 loss against Plymouth Argyle, scoring the goal that briefly tied the game at 1–1. He received the first red card of his career when he was sent-off for violent conduct in a Football League Trophy match against Barnet on 14 October 2003. Four days later, he scored Brentford's fourth goal in the 87th minute in a 4–2 victory against Luton Town, turning in Jay Tabb's cross. In Brentford's next league fixture, May scored his third goal of the season, [...] "bundling home Brentford's third" [...] in a 4–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion at Griffin Park. In November 2007, May's loan deal was extended until the end of the 2003–04 season. Millwall manager Dennis Wise stated [...] "He will do very well under Brentford manager Wally Downes and will learn a lot under him. I didn't feel he was <b>quite</b> <b>ready</b> for our first-team just yet". A month later, he scored the opening goal of the game in a 2–1 home defeat against Bristol City on 26 December 2003, scoring with a header from Stephen Hunt's corner. May scored two goals in the space of a week in January 2004, scoring the equaliser in games against Oldham and Tranmere Rovers respectively. He scored his seventh goal of the 2003–04 campaign in a 2–1 loss at Swindon Town — [...] "confidently firing home a left-footed shot from ten yards", although Brentford went on to lose their fourth consecutive match. It was May's last goal of the season, in all he scored seven goals in 43 appearances as Brentford finished the season in 17th place. He returned to his parent club in May 2004.|$|E
