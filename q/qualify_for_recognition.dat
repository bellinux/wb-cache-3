5|$|To <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> by the American Kennel Club, a {{national}} breed club {{must first be}} established and a written request needs {{to be sent to}} the AKC along with a breed standard. This enables qualification for the Foundation Stock Service. The next step is to qualify to compete in the Miscellaneous Class. This requires a minimum of one hundred active members in the national breed club, along with a minimum of three to four hundred dogs in the United States with a three generation pedigree (all dogs in those pedigrees must be of the same breed). In addition, they must be geographically spread across twenty states or more, and finally the clubs by-laws and constitution must be reviewed as well as breed observations made by AKC staff. There is a typical stay of between one and three years in the Miscellaneous Class before full recognition is granted. During this time, the breed club must be seen to be active and hold seminars, matches as well as local and national speciality shows. The Kennel Club (UK) does not have a miscellaneous class or foundation stock service, instead it requires British bred dog and three generation pedigrees of them, along with details from the country of origin including the breed standard. This allows listing on the Imported Breeds Register, with full recognition granted at the discretion of the Kennel Club Review Committee.|$|E
2500|$|The EC {{decided to}} request governments, {{industry}} and NGO's {{to set up}} voluntary schemes to certify biofuel sustainability {{for all types of}} biofuels, including those imported into the EU. [...] According to the EC, the overall majority of biofuels are produced in the EU, and for 2007, only 26% of biodiesel and 31% of bioethanol consumed in the EU was imported, mainly from Brazil and the United States. The Commission set standards that must be met for these schemes to gain EU recognition. One of the main criteria is that the certification scheme must be interdependently audited and fraud-resistant. Auditors must check the whole production chain, from the farmer and mill to the filling station (well-to-wheel life cycle). Auditors must check all the paper and inspect a sample of the farmers, mills and traders, and also whether the land where the feedstock for the ethanol is produced has been indeed farm land before and not a tropical forest or protected area. [...] The certificates are to guarantee that all the biofuels sold under the label are sustainable and produced under the criteria set by the Renewable Energy Directive. Several private certification systems originally designed for sustainability more generally have adapted their standards to <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> under the Renewable Energy Directive, including the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials and Bonsucro.|$|E

In November 2008, The Guardian carried an article by him entitled Self-rule for Cornwall, in which he said: Like Wales and Scotland, Cornwall considers itself a separate Celtic nation - so why shouldn't it have independence? ...Cornish Nationalists argue that Cornwall is a subjugated nation, in much the same way that Scotland and Wales once were. Not only is the historic Cornish flag - a white cross on a black background - excluded from the Union Jack; until not so long ago Cornish people needed planning permission to fly it.Comparisons with Scotland and Wales are valid. After all, Cornwall has all the basic cultural attributes of a nation: its own distinct Celtic language, history, festivals, cuisine, music, dance and sports.Many Cornish people perceive themselves to be other than English. Despite the government's resistance, under the Commission for Racial Equality and Council of Europe guidelines, they <b>qualify</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> as a national minority. ...Cornwall was once separate and self-governing. If the Cornish people want autonomy and it would improve their lives, why shouldn't they have self-rule once again? Malta, with only 400,000 people, is an independent state within the EU. Why not Cornwall? ...|$|E

In the part-fee, part-advertising-time scenario, the syndicator contracts to sell the advertising time on local stations to a third-party national advertiser. The issue is when the syndicator should recognize revenue for the advertising time. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the "barter " revenue would be recognized when the criteria of Statement 53 are met and noncancelable contracts are signed with both the station and the advertiser. [Note: See STATUS section. ] If a noncancelable contract does not exist, revenue would be recognized when the criteria of Statement 53 are met and the advertising is aired.

50|$|Irish was {{the main}} {{language}} spoken in Ulster from the earliest recorded times until the 17th century Plantation of Ulster by English and Scots speakers. Since the Plantation, Ulster Irish was steadily replaced by English and Scots. The Eastern dialect died out in the 20th century, but the Western lives on in the Gaeltacht region of County Donegal. In 1808, County Down natives William Neilson and Patrick Lynch (Pádraig Ó Loingsigh) published a detailed study on Ulster Irish called An Introduction to the Irish Language. Both Neilson and his father were Irish-speaking Presbyterian ministers. When {{the recommendations of the}} first Comisiún na Gaeltachta were drawn up in 1926, there were regions <b>qualifying</b> <b>for</b> Gaeltacht <b>recognition</b> in the Sperrins and the northern Glens of Antrim and Rathlin Island.
