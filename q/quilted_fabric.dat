Chanel used colors traditionally associated with masculinity in Europe, such as grey and navy blue, to denote feminine boldness of character. The clothes of the House of Chanel featured <b>quilted</b> <b>fabric</b> and leather trimmings; the quilted construction reinforces the fabric, the design and the finish, producing a garment that maintains its form and function while being worn. An example of such haute couture techniques is the woolen Chanel suit — a knee-length skirt and a cardigan-style jacket, trimmed and decorated with black embroidery and gold-coloured buttons. The complementary accessories were two-tone pump shoes and jewellry, usually a necklace of pearls, and a leather handbag.|$|E

50|$|Evidence of patchwork—piecing {{small pieces}} of fabric {{together}} to create a larger piece and quilting layers of textile fabrics together—has been found throughout history. The earliest examples have been located in Egyptian tombs and also in early age of China about 5000 years ago. Further finds have been dated from the early Middle Ages, where layers of <b>quilted</b> <b>fabric</b> were used in the construction of armor—this kept the soldiers warm and protected. Japanese armor was made in a similar fashion.|$|E

40|$|Conducted two {{meetings}} {{to review the}} project scope and develop concepts for self-sealing material compositions, Focus has been on developing concepts that would seal a penetration enough to allow the astronauts to re-enter the spacecraft within the window provided by the emergency air supply. Concepts discussed include: <b>quilted</b> <b>fabrics</b> containing a viscous flow material in the quilted cells which would seal the bladder breach when forced to flow by the internal suit pressure; a sealant impregnated felt liner which acts similar to above; and a "blousy" fibrous layer which would mechanically plug a rupture under pressure. Illustrations of the above concepts {{are included in the}} attached viewgraphs, which were used in a presentation. The most promising of these concepts will be made into prototypes for testing. ILC has developed a test fixture to test the scaling characteristics of various material layups by measuring real-time changes in pressure and make-up flow in a pressurized cylinder. Candidate viscous sealing compounds such as silicones and urethanes have been identified. These compounds will be coated on existing bladder cloth for initial tests. The most promising compounds will be integrated into the above material structures for final testing. Design and analysis of fabric weaves to improve cut and puncture resistance of the suit TMG layers is underway. Philadelphia Textile is developing a mathematical model to correlate yarn type and weave structure to cut and tear resistance. The computer mathematical modeling of the fabric failure mechanisms by Cornell University, as originally proposed, will be replaced with the above model and empirical testing methods, due to the loss of key Cornell personnel...|$|R
40|$|Mapping Nebraska is a drawn, {{stitched}} and digitally imaged cartography of {{the state}} (physical, social, cultural, sociological) where I live. The interrelated components of this on-going project are: A 15 foot wide hand-drawn “Locator Map” of Nebraska, with every city, town, park, railroad, river, lake and creek drawn to scale on 95 Tyvek sections which were then stitched together. Terrain Squares, <b>quilted</b> and embroidered <b>fabric</b> relief forms of the physical topography of selected locations, using software {{to be able to}} see the terrain at a much larger scale (1 inch = 596 feet) than the Locator Map. Surveys, or on-the-ground documentation (with a still camera and a dash-mounted Flip video camera) of each of the 95 sections. I’ve covered 5, 000 miles to date, traveling on state highways and gravel roads. Ground Cloths, mixed media textile constructions which respond to a particular location and which document what is unseen, invisible, remembered or imagined. In this public talk at the International Quilt Study Center and Museum (presented in conjunction with the exhibition SAQA Showcase: Studio Art Quilts Invitational) I give a visual overview of Mapping Nebraska. I approach stitching, like mapping, as a fundamental way of converting personal knowledge to transmittable knowledge and I share some of what I’ve learned as I stitch (draw and travel) across Nebraska.

40|$|MoMA and Child: The Century of the Child at the Museum of Modern Art by Ellen Handler Spitz The Century of the Child:: Growing by Design 1900 - 2000 at the Museum of Modern Art July 29 to November 5, 2012 11 West 53 rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues New York City, www. moma. org Arriving expectantly at {{the sixth}} floor atrium of MOMA, prodded by a mad crush of child-loving {{visitors}} {{of all ages and}} nationalities, you are met by the blow-up of an original gelatin silver print (Boy on Wall, Hammarkullen by Jens S. Jensen, 1973). From a massive face of concrete blocks a child dangles, eerily hanging by his right arm, more than a body’s height above the ground. Is it a boy or a girl? The figure wears a leather jacket, or possibly that’s a <b>quilted</b> <b>fabric,</b> hard to tell, and the frowzy blond Christopher Robin haircut might signal either gender. What about the smile? Not an exhibitionistic grin, as in “Hey, everybody! Look what I can do!” Just a glance, acknowledging your arrival: “Oh, it’s you,” as if being suspended by one hand high above the earth were the most natural way in the world to greet someone. No bravado, no fear of falling. The perplexities of this uncanny image epitomize the show. As you stare at it, you experience dysphoria, weightlessness, a fleeting sense of levitation, and you may even recoup your own childhood wish to float above the ground. For the boy (it is, we read, a boy, named Michael, aged nine) actually seems to be suspended in front of the wall, not securely attached to it. Is this an illusion, or not? What, this image makes you wonder, will this exhibit on The Century of the Child have to do with flesh and blood children, pace its title? Who or what is the child? What does it mean to design for the child? What are the ethics of such an enterprise? Presuming overall a rather bland and benign notion of childhood (think of Locke’s tabula rasa), the show withdraws for the most part from messy engagements with actual children. Children float suspended and detached from what is presented: like the figure in the Swedish photograph, the work on view in these MOMA galleries bypasses emotion (with some notable exceptions, including film footage related to the 1940 s work of Bauhaus-trained designer Friedl Dicker-Brandeis with children in the Terezín concentration camp near Prague, and Polish director Andrzej Wolski’s 2011 film, Toys, that features Warsaw children scrounging in the rubble after World War II). Much of the intense passion, however—the felt crises, anxieties, puzzlements, riotous humor, and delirious joys— that characterize living children both mentally and behaviorally has gone missing. The distance off the ground, so to speak, can be disconcerting. Indeed, what this ample, richly crowded, and perhaps unintentionally provocative seven-room exhibition reveals—in spite of itself— is a thoroughgoing exposé, decade after decade, of nearly unbroken top-down efforts to use, exploit, and control as well as engage children, sometimes by imitating them, occasionally by mocking them, all the while subsuming them under whatever artistic style, political agenda, or commercial opportunity happens to be ascendant. No major effort has been taken by the otherwise remarkably diligent curators to do more than show this. How have the successive waves of stylized objects on display—toys, furniture, books, clothing, as well as imagery, shifting educational practices, and spatial arrangements actually impacted the children exposed to them? A visitor seeks in vain for critique and evaluation—for any report on the later effects of all this adult-perpetrated design on youth. Few questions are aired. A typical text panel reads: “In such rooms, it was felt, children’s spontaneity and pleasure in learning would flourish. ” But why was that felt? And by whom? And was this feeling ever put to a test? Walking from room to room, you are struck by the way the putative child, objectified despite protestations to the contrary, has been incorporated into period style, the vector being culture > child, not the reverse: the Arts & Crafts Movement, Art Nouveau, Expressionism, Futurism, De Stijl, Pop Art, digital art. Despite claims that artists’ approaches were rooted in desires to understand children, you may come away feeling that, if the twentieth century is indeed The Century of the Child, surely that child is as much a projection of adult fantasy and social ideology as the pale coy innocents of the pre-Raphaelites or the bedizened seventeenth century infantas of Velázquez. A Gargantuan wooden table with a climbable oversized chair and step stool offer adults who try them out a bodily take on children’s experience. Mugging visitors pose on them for photo ops, while uniformed security personnel control access by ordering people brusquely to form a queue. For one split second, I clamber up on the chair and, when the tabletop reaches barely to my nose, my bygone helplessness and marginalization as a child rush back in a flood: I am Gulliver in Brobdingnag until an officious guard whisks me away: “You can’t spend any time here,” he admonishes sternly; now, I truly am a child. Visitors chuckle and guffaw at wall-mounted black and white 1927 footage of a three or four-year-old who steers his kiddie-motor wheel of fanciful circular design along an empty road. His father, in fedora, tie, and three-piece suit, chases him dutifully, unable to keep up as the child and his mini-vehicle careen along a wide unpopulated avenue in zigzag swaths, as if illustrating the line from Isaiah 11 (“the little child shall lead them”) or Wordsworth’s similar sentiment from the Rainbow poem of 1802. Throughout the exhibit, which is thronged morning and afternoon, spectators seem euphoric, entranced by images such as this. They appear bemused and nostalgic, while their children respond especially to movement for, as Fénelon wisely wrote, children are happiest when their bodies are in motion, when they can change position. Late in the show, you come upon a striking work that chimes with the Jensen photograph you met at the start: Paul Rand, in 1996, shortly before his death, composes a flat black child, upside down, arms akimbo, balancing precariously on a slanting tightrope made of words. The great designer fills in the body with saucy details from Breughel’s Children’s Games (1560) to create an indelible poster in support of a village devoted to orphaned and abandoned children. Aesthetically, top prize belongs to The Adventures of Prince Achmed, an exquisite dreamlike shadow film by Berlin artist Lotte Reiniger (1923 - 25) that plays silently in a gallery labeled “Avant Garde Play Time. ” Possibly the earliest surviving animated film, this gossamer confection was painstakingly made by hand, its style inspired by finger puppets, embroidery, and lace making. Reiniger, who invented her own techniques, created this masterpiece by scissor work, intricately cutting out characters of astonishingly delicate beauty, which, in an evanescent world, sway, prance, bow, and embrace while enacting stories of intrigue, romance, and suspense drawn from the Arabian Nights. Reiniger’s villain, a wicked enchanter known as the African Magician, appears maleficently in Aladdin and the Magic Lamp. To stand spellbound watching as these silhouetted tales unfurl their sinister plots and metamorphoses in ever-swirling motion until Prince Achmed is at last reunited with his slender fairy Peri Banou, is to recapture a childhood in which magic is real and flying demons are more true than anything attached to solid earth. This thought returns us to the elevated image with which we began — the photographed child in the air— and leads me to conclude that, if real children {{are to be found in}} this show, they must be summoned, like genii, from encounters with whatever designed objects move us most, for there is, after all, no such thing as the child but rather millions of uniquely responsive children, and adults, for whom childhood, despite varying degrees of distance, can still be occasionally invoked. Perhaps that is as close as we will ever come to the angel with the flaming sword who guards the way back, as Ernst Gombrich wrote famously once in his essay on the hobby horse...|$|E
