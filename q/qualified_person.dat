Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a <b>qualified</b> <b>person</b> to vote or to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote. Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.|$|E
5|$|The {{court is}} {{composed}} of seven elected justices, each of whom serves a six-year term after winning a nonpartisan election. Justices, like other Oregon state court judges, must be United States citizens, Oregon residents {{for at least three}} years, and lawyers admitted to practice in the state of Oregon. The newest justice receives the smallest office (nicknamed “the broom closet”) and is responsible for opening the door when a conference is interrupted. When a state court judge retires, resigns, or dies before completing a term, the Governor may appoint another <b>qualified</b> <b>person</b> to the position. To retain that position, the appointed person must run for election for a full six-year term at the next general election.|$|E

25|$|The High Court {{consists}} of the Chief Justice of Singapore and the Judges of the High Court. A person is qualified to be appointed a Judge {{if he or she}} has for an aggregate period of not less than ten years been a <b>qualified</b> <b>person</b> within the meaning of the Legal Profession Act or a member of the Singapore Legal Service, or both. The Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court are appointed by the President of Singapore if he, acting in his discretion, concurs with the advice of the Prime Minister. Where the appointment of Judges is concerned, the Prime Minister is required to consult the Chief Justice before tendering advice to the President. In addition, to facilitate the disposal of business in the Supreme Court, the President may, if he concurs with the Prime Minister's advice, appoint people qualified to be judges to be Judicial Commissioners of the Supreme Court. Judicial Commissioners exercise the same powers and perform the same functions as Judges of the High Court. However, unlike Judges who generally hold office until the age of 65 years, Judicial Commissioners do not have security of tenure.|$|E

500|$|As {{originally}} enacted, the Horse Protection Act was to {{be enforced}} by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), {{a branch of the}} USDA. However, a lack of staff and funding meant little success, leading to the 1976 amendment to the act. With this amendment, Congress created a Designated <b>Qualified</b> <b>Person</b> (DQP) program. This program allows non-USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and supervised by the USDA; after completing the training, they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events. The USDA is then able to double check the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows. One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates [...] "the potential for a [...] "fox guarding the chicken coop" [...] situation", as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of soring, the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of soring. When APHIS inspectors are present at horse shows, the number of citations for violations increases significantly. Competitors and trainers at shows, viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted, have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present, rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses. In June 2012, the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors. Previously, HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates, resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA.|$|E

500|$|With Atkinson thus occupied, an {{alternative}} arrangement {{to pick up}} Scott was necessary. Disregarding Meares, who was [...] "not available for work", the most <b>qualified</b> <b>person</b> available to meet Scott's party was the physicist Wright, an experienced traveller and navigator, but the chief scientist Simpson insisted Wright's scientific work be given priority. Atkinson therefore chose Cherry-Garrard, who could however not navigate, had never handled a dog before and who was moreover short-sighted. Lt Evans wrote later that he thought Scott would have approved the decision to keep Wright at the base camp, whereas Wright later stated [...] "It always worries me - I should have had that job". Cherry-Garrard would be accompanied by Dimitri. In his 1922 book The Worst Journey, Cherry-Garrard recalled the controversial verbal orders given by Atkinson. He was to travel to One Ton Depot as fast as possible, where he was to leave food for the returning polar party. If Scott had not arrived before him, Cherry-Garrard should decide [...] "what to do". Atkinson also emphasised {{that this was not}} a rescue party, and added that Scott had given instructions that the dogs were [...] "not to be risked in view of the sledging plans for next season". In the standard edition of his book, Cherry omitted any mention of Scott's request to be picked up at 82° or 82°30' on 1 March. But after Atkinson's and Lady Scott's deaths in 1929 and 1947 respectively, in a postscript to his privately published 1948 edition, Cherry acknowledged the existence of Scott's order and provided reasons why Atkinson, and later he himself, failed to comply: Cherry-Garrard in 1948 stated that Atkinson was too exhausted at the beginning of February to set off to meet Scott, and that the lack of dog food at One Ton Depot made a timely start impractical. Karen May of the Scott Polar Research Institute goes further by suggesting that the instruction about saving the dogs for the following season was Atkinson's own invention.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} art has been {{described}} by philosopher Richard Wollheim as [...] "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture". Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle. Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another. Benedetto Croce and R.G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists {{in the mind of the}} creator. The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, and was developed in the early twentieth century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. [...] More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation. George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a <b>qualified</b> <b>person</b> or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as [...] "the art world" [...] has conferred [...] "the status of candidate for appreciation". Larry Shiner has described fine art as [...] "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old." ...|$|E
