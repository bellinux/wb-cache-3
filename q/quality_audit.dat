The sample data are the public listed companies from period before the regulation (1999 - 2001) to period after the regulation (2004 - 2008). This research finds that in the pre-regulation period, generally there is no impact of audit firm tenure to <b>audit</b> <b>quality.</b> In the after regulation period, audit firm tenure has convex relationship with <b>audit</b> <b>quality</b> from neutrality and timeliness perspectives with minimum point at 10 and 8. 3 years (decrease for 10 years and 8. 3 years and then increase).

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the association of}} firms with high investment opportunities with high <b>quality</b> <b>audits</b> (proxied by Big 5 auditors) and whether that association results in a lower likelihood of earnings management. Firms with high investment opportunities may demand high <b>quality</b> <b>audits</b> for curbing earnings management. This is because they have more flexibility {{in the provision of}} discretionary accruals that arises from the attendant operating uncertainty which creates particular monitoring problems. Big 5 auditors will provide high <b>quality</b> <b>audits</b> that will constrain earnings management for firms with high investment opportunities because the risk of losing (and hence the likelihood of maintaining) auditor independence is higher. Results show the following. First, firms with high investment opportunities are more likely to hire Big 5 auditors than firms with low investment opportunities.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect that a regime of mandatory audit firm rotation would have on <b>audit</b> <b>quality.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Using two measures of <b>audit</b> <b>quality,</b> being the propensity to issue a going-concern report and the level of discretionary accruals, the paper examines the switching patterns of clients in their current voluntary switching capacity, and the levels of <b>audit</b> <b>quality.</b> Findings – The main finding is that <b>audit</b> <b>quality</b> increases with <b>audit</b> firm tenure, when proxied by the propensity to issue a going-concern opinion, and is unaffected when proxied by the level of discretionary expenses. Given the additional costs associated with switching auditors, it is concluded that there are minimal, if any, benefits of mandatory audit firm rotation. Research limitations/implications – A limitation of this study is that only actual <b>audit</b> <b>quality</b> is examined. While the results suggest that actual <b>audit</b> <b>quality</b> is associated with the length of audit tenure, the perception of <b>audit</b> <b>quality</b> is not addressed, which may increase with audit firm rotation.
