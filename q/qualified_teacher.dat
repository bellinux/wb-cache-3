40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Document:		THE IMPACT OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS 					ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND 					GRADUATION RATES 					Donald Jay Walker, Doctor of Education, 2014 Directed By:			Dr. Carol S. Parham, Department of Counseling, 					Higher Education and Special Education 	This study {{examined}} the relationship between the percentage of classes taught by highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (HQT) and students' academic achievement, as measured by students' passing rates on Maryland's High School Assessment (HSA), and graduation rates among secondary students for three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013) in the State of Maryland. All data relating to highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> and students' academic achievement and graduation rates was collected from the Maryland's Annual Report Cards, published by Maryland State Department of Education for all 24 school systems in the State of Maryland during three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). The individuals in this sample were 10 th, 11 th and 12 th grade students from Maryland School System who participated in the Spring Maryland High School Assessment (HSA) for academic school years 2011, 2012 and 2013. A linear regression method was used to answer the question of possible relationships between the dependent variables, academic achievement test scores and graduation rates, and the independent variable, percent of courses taught by highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers.</b> System level performance data were analyzed in a descriptive fashion in order to show the percent of students passing each of the Maryland High School Assessments (HSA) in Math, Biology and English, and the percent of students graduating from high school. In addition to the descriptive statistics, Hierarchical Linear Modeling analyses were conducted in order to determine if (1) students performed better on High School Assessments (HSA) in counties having more highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (noted as Between Counties) and (2) if students performed better in years when there were more highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (HQT) in a county, than in those years when there were fewer highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (noted as Within-Counties or Between Years). 	Results of the data indicated that between-county or counties with more highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (HQT) than counties with fewer highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> had a higher percentage of students who passed the Biology 10, 11 and 12, English 10, 11 and 12, and Math 10, 11, and 12 High School Assessments (HSA), over three consecutive academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). Within-counties, between-years or years when there were more highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (HQT) in a county compared to years when there were fewer (HQT) teachers, there was no significant relationships between the percentage of highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> and students passing rates on the Biology 11 and 12, the Math 10 and 12, and the English 10 and 11 High School Assessments (HSA). However, for Biology 10, Math 11 and English 12 there was a significant relationship between the percentage of HQT in a county in a year, and the percentage of students passing the test that year. Counties where there were more highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (HQT), a higher proportion of students graduated than in counties where there were fewer highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (HQT), over three academic school years (2011, 2012 and 2013). There was no relationship between the percentage of highly <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> (HQT) within a county in a particular school year and the percentage of students graduating in that year...|$|R

40|$|Darling-Hammond’s paper tackles {{four key}} {{issues related to}} the state’s {{teaching}} force and its distribution among various groups of students: 1) What does the state of California expect of its students and its teachers? In particular, what qualifications does the state require of teachers so that they can support student learning? 2) How does teacher quality matter for equal educational opportunity? 3) Do California students have equal access to <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> who can offer the instruction they need to master the state standards? 4) How might the discrepancies in students’ access to <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> best be remedied, given the policy context and knowledge about successful policy elsewhere? Drawing on a wealth of empirical studies, the paper reveals the critical relationship between <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> and student academic achievement. It also explains that new state standards, an increasingly diverse student population, together with the skills needed to participate in a knowledge-based society create an urgent demand for skilled and effective teachers. The paper also illuminates the notion that the shortage of <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> in schools predominantly serving children of color and poor students does not result from an overall lack of <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> in the state. Rather, Darling-Hammond attributes this problem to a failure of state oversight to ensure that <b>qualified</b> <b>teachers</b> remain in the system and that they are equitably distributed among schools and communities. Finally, Darling-Hammond’s comparison of California policies with those in other states lays the groundwork for new state policies that would support more equitable access to quality teachers...|$|R
