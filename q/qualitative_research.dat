25|$|In {{educational}} psychology, <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> is used {{to address}} questions concerned with developing {{an understanding of the}} meaning and collecting nonnumerical relevant data to gain insights into particular phenomenon. The central to good <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> is whether the research participants’ subjective meanings, actions and social contexts, as understood by them, are illuminated. Qualitative logic are for examining patterns across people. It is widely used in educational psychology. Educational psychologists only infrequently drew on qualitative literatures in the past 11 years to design their research studies. It does appear, however, that there has been {{an increase in the number}} of educational psychologists publishing studies using qualitative design frameworks in the past 5 years. On the other hand, it has its weakness as well. Qualitative formats for representing knowledge, such as text, afford insights into a learner’s understanding but are difficult to assemble into summary formats that concisely show a learner’s progress or allow comparisons among learners or across groups. The most fundamental and significant distinction between quantitative research method and <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> method is about the data, how the data collected and analyzed. Therefore, this article would be focus on the research methods and how the data collected and analyzed by researchers in <b>qualitative</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
25|$|In psychology, <b>qualitative</b> <b>{{research}}</b> {{has come}} to be defined as research whose findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>research</b> is often said to be naturalistic. That is, its goal is to understand behaviour in a natural setting. Two other goals attributed to <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> are understanding a phenomenon {{from the perspective of the}} research participant and understanding the meanings people give to their experience. It attempts to do this by using so-called naturalistic methods—interviewing, observation, ethnography, participant observation and focus groups. Each of these methods seeks to understand the perspective of the research participant within the context of their everyday life. This means that the researcher is concerned with asking broad questions that allow the respondent to answer in their own words. These methods allow the researcher to try to qualify their understanding during the research process through further probing questions. In addition, a method such as observation allows the researcher to observe people within natural settings—particularly those in public places. This has resulted in greater understanding of people's behaviours in, for example, lifts, public transport, and queues.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the methods for collecting data mentioned above, <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> includes {{a wide range of}} ways to analyse the data. One of the most popular of these is known as grounded theory. Others include conversation analysis, discourse analysis, thematic analysis, and even historical analysis.|$|E

25|$|Postmodern {{symbolic}} interactionists {{understand the}} notions of self and identity to be increasingly fragmented and illusory, and consider attempts at theorizing to be meta-narratives with no more authority than other conversations. The approach is presented in detail by The SAGE Handbook of <b>Qualitative</b> <b>Research.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Qualitative</b> <b>research</b> is {{sometimes}} {{said to have}} as its goal {{the understanding of the}} sample studied, rather than generalizing from the sample to the population. However, the results of <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> can be applied to other settings—as long as the reader of the research understands the limitations. For example, the research findings of a qualitative case study of primary school children in a particular school and their mobile phone usage will tell us more about the mobile phone usage of children in the general population, than of adults. However, the type of school (public or private), where it was located, and the socio-economic background of the students need to be taken into consideration when applying any findings to other settings (either schools or the general population of children).|$|E
25|$|Those {{psychological}} {{researchers who}} prefer <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> argue that statistically based research has limitations {{because it is}} less able {{to take into consideration}} the context of behaviour. Qualitative researchers have developed their own criteria for assessing reliability and validity. The work of Yvonna Lincoln and Egon Guba is an example of this.|$|E

25|$|While parapsychologists {{look for}} {{quantitative}} {{evidence of the}} paranormal in laboratories, {{a great number of}} people immerse themselves in <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> through participant-observer approaches to the paranormal. Participant-observer methodologies have overlaps with other essentially qualitative approaches as well, including phenomenological research that seeks largely to describe subjects as they are experienced, rather than to explain them.|$|E
25|$|At {{the most}} {{localized}} level of analysis, ethnographic, participant- or non-participant observation, content analysis and other <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> methods may be appropriate. More recently, highly sophisticated quantitative research methodologies {{are being developed}} and used in sociology at both local and global levels of analysis. Such methods include (but are not limited to) bifurcation diagrams, network analysis, non-linear modeling, and computational models including cellular automata programming, sociocybernetics and other methods of social simulation.|$|E
25|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} {{research methods}} include interviews, first-hand observation, and participant observation. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for <b>qualitative</b> <b>research,</b> including narrative, phenomenology, ethnography, case study, and grounded theory. Qualitative researchers sometimes aim to enrich interpretations or critiques of symbols, subjective experiences, or social structures. Sometimes hermeneutic and critical aims can {{give rise to}} quantitative research, as in Erich Fromm's study of Nazi voting or Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.|$|E

25|$|Qualitative {{psychological}} {{research has}} crystallised {{as one of}} the most effective ways of gathering insight into the behaviours, attitudes and decision-making processes of consumers and customers. Most <b>qualitative</b> <b>research</b> companies in the world will claim that they employ psychologists and base their findings on psychological theories.

25|$|Research {{designed}} {{to answer questions}} about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of individuals is known as descriptive research. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. <b>Qualitative</b> <b>research</b> is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.|$|E
25|$|Through fMRI, EEG, {{steady state}} {{topography}} (SST) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) scans, marketers {{are able to}} study how consumers react, as a step towards understanding how they can influence consumption through marketing efforts.

40|$|Within {{the last}} two decades <b>qualitative</b> social <b>research</b> has {{established}} itself in most, if not all, of the social sciences. But this emergence has proceeded very differently in institutional and in socio-cognitive aspects. From the beginnings of <b>qualitative</b> social <b>research,</b> critical stances toward science, the sociology of science, and methodological reflexivity organized self-observation. For a long time <b>qualitative</b> social <b>research</b> compared itself primarily to quantitative social research. But in the last years, <b>qualitative</b> social <b>research</b> began focusing more on its own processes and evaluative criteria. The concept of performativity is suitable to ground a theoretical reflection on this new focus in self-observation. This concept has proved useful in analyzing the practices of science, especially in approaches as Actor-Network-Theory and Social Studies of Finance.
