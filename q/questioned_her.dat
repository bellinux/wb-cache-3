5|$|Mamie Till Bradley {{testified that}} she had {{instructed}} her son to watch his manners in Mississippi and that should a situation ever come to his being asked to get on his knees to ask forgiveness of a white person, he should do it without a thought. The defense <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> identification of her son in the casket in Chicago and a $400 life insurance policy she had taken out on him.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{confirmed}} in the Catholic Church in 1966, she adopted Veronica as a confirmation name. She {{was raised in}} the Detroit suburbs of Pontiac and Avon Township (now Rochester Hills). Months before her mother died of breast cancer at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason. Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.|$|E
5|$|What {{at first}} {{seems to be}} an open-and-shut case becomes {{confused}} though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goody Bandit and had reason to believe that Red and Granny were the culprits. Locating Red, he <b>questioned</b> <b>her,</b> hoping {{to get to the bottom}} of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Granny's house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.|$|E

5|$|The {{manager and}} {{investigator}} summoned Collins {{for an interview}} and <b>questioned</b> <b>her.</b> Collins asked {{for the presence of}} a union representative several times but was refused by the manager each time. Upon questioning, Collins explained that she had put four pieces of chicken (which cost $1 total) into a larger box (one which could hold $2.98 of chicken) because the store had run out of the four-piece sized boxes. To check Collins's story, the investigator left to ask the coworker who had reported her. The coworker confirmed that the store had run out of $1 size boxes and admitted she did not know how much chicken Collins had placed in the larger box. The investigator returned to the interview, apologized to Collins, and prepared to let her go.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began with}} the {{swearing-in}} of the jury and introductions from various legal representatives, including a lawyer hired for Lucan by his mother. Thurston introduced the jury to the case and explained their duties. He had selected 33witnesses to be called over the following few days, including Veronica Lucan, who each day wore a dark coat and white headscarf. Thurston <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> on her relationship with Lucan, her marriage, her financial affairs, her employment of Rivett and what had happened {{on the night of}} the attack. The Dowager Countess's Queen's Counsel attempted to ask Lady Lucan about the nature of their relationship, if she hated her husband, but Thurston ruled his line of questioning inadmissible. Woman Detective Constable Sally Blower, who had taken a statement from Frances on 20November 1974, read the young girl's words to the court. Frances had heard a scream, and a few minutes later had watched as her mother (blood on her face) and father had entered the room. Her mother had then sent her to bed. She later heard her father calling for her mother, asking where she was, and watched as he left the bathroom and walked downstairs. She also described how Sandra Rivett did not normally work on Thursday nights.|$|E

25|$|Many of Catherine's contemporaries <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> {{adherence}} to Enlightenment ideals and {{thought she was}} an egoist, merely using concepts from the Age of Enlightenment to further her selfish gains. Gender played a primary role in these criticisms. Contemporaries interpreted her personality as combining masculine strength with feminine vanity.|$|E
25|$|Nadezhda von Meck's {{claim of}} {{bankruptcy}} {{was not entirely}} untrue. Along with his fortune, Karl von Meck had left a sizable amount of debt upon his death, and this debt proved {{to be far more}} extensive than his wife had previously known. Rumors of this debt started circulating publicly in the early 1880s. Tchaikovsky had <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> about it in his letters.|$|E
25|$|The al-Hakam germ warfare center, {{headed by}} the British-educated Iraqi {{biologist}} Dr. Rihab Rashid Taha, was blown up by UNSCOM in 1996. According to a 1999 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the normally mild-mannered Taha exploded into violent rages whenever UNSCOM <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> about al-Hakam, shouting, screaming and, on one occasion, smashing a chair, while insisting that al-Hakam was a chicken-feed plant.|$|E

25|$|Kenny's {{success was}} controversial; many Australian doctors (and the British Medical Association) <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> results and methodology. Raphael Cilento, {{who was in}} charge of the QHD evaluation, wrote a report that was {{somewhat}} complimentary but mainly critical. Kenny replied publicly, fiercely taking Cilento to task for his criticisms (unusual from a self-taught bush nurse at that time in Australia). This response caused a contentious relationship among Kenny, Cilento, the BMA and the Australian Medical Association (AMA).|$|E
25|$|Pageant {{officials}} {{launched an}} investigation after rumors began to surface about her background and past. Gage lied to reporters or {{declined to comment}} when they <b>questioned</b> <b>her,</b> but a day later, she confessed the truth: she was actually 18, not 21, had been married twice, and was {{a mother of two}} young children. Her mother and mother- in-law confirmed to reporters that the rumors were true. As being a wife and mother were clear violations of the contest rules, Gage was immediately disqualified and stripped of her Miss USA crown.|$|E
25|$|Bulgaria's initial candidate, Rumiana Jeleva, {{was forced}} to step down due to {{opposition}} from MEPs, mainly the PES, who <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> suitability and financial interests despite backing from the EPP (to which her national party belongs). Bulgaria rapidly submitted Kristalina Georgieva, but this forced the vote on the commission to be delayed weeks so Georgieva's hearings could be arranged. The only other commissioner-designate to lack support was returning commissioner Neelie Kroes, who was also seen to perform poorly in her hearing. However, she was invited back and secured more support, indicating she will get approval from Parliament.|$|E

25|$|As Roberts {{drove away}} with Mangum, {{the two women}} began to argue. Roberts pulled over and {{attempted}} to push Mangum out of the car. When that failed, Roberts drove Mangum to a nearby Kroger supermarket, went inside, and told a female security guard that a woman was refusing to leave her car. The guard walked {{to the car and}} asked Mangum to leave, but Mangum remained in the vehicle. The guard said that she did not smell alcohol on Mangum's breath, but thought she might have been under the influence of other drugs. At 1:22 AM, the guard called 911 to report that Mangum refused to leave the car. Police then arrived, removed Mangum from the car and <b>questioned</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
25|$|Price testified {{again that}} a dozen armed negro men entered the gondola car. She said Patterson had fired {{a shot and}} ordered all whites but Gilley off the train. She said the negros had ripped her clothes off and {{repeatedly}} raped her at knife point, and pointed out Patterson {{as one of the}} rapists. She said they raped her and Bates, afterward saying they would take them north or throw them in the river. She testified that she had fallen while getting out of the gondola car, passed out and came to seated in a store at Paint Rock. Leibowitz <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> until Judge Callahan stopped court for the day at 6:30. When he resumed the next morning, he pointed out many contradictions among her various versions of the rape.|$|E
25|$|Peete later {{moved to}} Waco, Texas, where she became romantically {{involved}} with wealthy oil baron Joe Appel; {{one week after}} the two met, Appel was found shot to death and his diamond jewelry missing. Peete was arrested for his murder, but convinced a grand jury that she killed Appel in self-defense after he attempted to rape her. In 1913, Peete moved to Dallas where she quickly married Harry Faurote, a night clerk who worked at the St. George Hotel. Shortly after the two married, Peete stole $20,000 worth of jewels from the hotel's safe. Police questioned Faurote but cleared him of any involvement. Police suspected Peete of the theft and <b>questioned</b> <b>her,</b> but had no evidence of her involvement. Embarrassed over being accused of theft and despondent over his wife's infidelities, Faurote shot himself. His death was ruled a suicide.|$|E

25|$|Diana {{was born}} into the British Spencer family, {{different}} branches of which currently hold the titles of Duke of Marlborough, Earl Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, and Baron Churchill of Whichwood. The Spencers claimed descent from a cadet branch of the powerful medieval Despenser family, but its validity is <b>questioned.</b> <b>Her</b> great-grandmother was Margaret Baring, {{a member of the}} German-British Baring family of bankers and the daughter of Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke. Diana's distant noble ancestors included John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Prince of Mindelheim and his wife Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. Diana and Charles were distantly related, as they were both descended from the House of Tudor through Henry VII of England. She was also descended from the House of Stuart through Charles II of England by Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, and Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and his brother James II of England by Henrietta FitzJames.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{she named}} Ramon V. Mitra, {{a friend of}} her husband Ninoy and then Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives, as her {{candidate}} for the presidential race in 1992. However, she later on backtracked and instead threw her support behind the candidacy of her defense secretary and EDSA Revolution hero, General Fidel V. Ramos, who constantly stood by and defended her government from the various coup attempts and rebellions that were launched against her. Her sudden change of mind and withdrawal of support from Mitra drew criticism not only from her supporters in the liberal and social democratic sectors {{but also from the}} Roman Catholic Church, which <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> anointing of Ramos since the latter was a Protestant. Nevertheless, Aquino's candidate eventually won the 1992 elections, albeit with only 23.58% of the total votes in a wide-open campaign, and was sworn in as the 12th President of the Philippines on June 30, 1992.|$|E
25|$|Doudna entered Pomona College in Claremont, California {{to study}} biochemistry. During her sophomore year, while taking {{a course in}} general chemistry, she <b>questioned</b> <b>her</b> own ability {{to pursue a career}} in science, and {{considered}} switching her major to French. However, her French teacher suggested her to stick with science. Fred Grieman and Corwin Hansch, both professors of chemistry at Pomona, had a major impact on her. She started her first scientific research in the lab of Sharon Panasenko. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry from Pomona College in 1985. She went to Harvard Medical School for her doctoral study and earned a Ph.D. in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989. Her Ph.D. thesis was on engineering a self-replicating catalytic RNA and was supervised by Jack W. Szostak. From 1989 to 1991, she held research fellowships in molecular biology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in genetics at Harvard Medical School. From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P. Markey Postdoctoral Scholar in Biomedical Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she worked with Thomas Cech.|$|E
