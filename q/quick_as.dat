5|$|The 2nd Infantry Brigade {{took over}} {{the vanguard of the}} advance on 2 September, tasked with {{clearing}} the Germans from their positions overlooking Haplincourt. This they did after overcoming numerous machine gun nests, plus the guns of two disabled tanks being used as outposts. Over 350 prisoners of war were taken, along with 80 machine guns plus a field gun. Their advance was not as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> that of the 42nd Division, making a corresponding move forward, which had made good progress and the British, until the New Zealanders caught up, had to lay down heavy suppressing fire on both flanks. The New Zealand Division now halted for a few days as pressure was being placed on the German lines elsewhere and the emphasis for IV Corps was now to pursue the enemy to the Hindenburg Line.|$|E

While the impression was being made from the one form, the type was being put in place on the other. When the printing of the one form was finished, the other was then ready. In this way the two forms alternated and the printing was done with great rapidity.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of the Israeli Air Force's air strike on Iraqi nuclear power plant in Osirak in 1981, Pakistan Armed Forces had been alerted since then. According to memoirs of nuclear {{strategist}} and theorist Munir Ahmad Khan, the hectic discussion took place every day between ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs, in an amid fears that India might attack Pakistan who was en route to become subsequent nuclear power. Since 1981, the commanders of the Pakistan's unified armed forces were given the standing orders to mobilize their forces at once, from all directions, as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> it can to divert such attacks.|$|E

Alistair Campbell and Grant Flower had also faced Waqar Younis at his peak, and Wasim Akram and the Pakistani pace battery before this. They had in fact played a full 3-Test series in January 1995, when they had won their first Test match, thrashing Pakistan by an innings and 64 runs and scoring 544/4 declared in their only innings. But even {{they said that they}} had never faced anyone as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> Srinath.|$|E

Cars carrying dozens of officers from both the Los Angeles Police and Sheriff’s Department rushed to the area. Although no sign of the threat that brought all this about materialized, for many days after the canyon resembled an armed camp.|$|E
25|$|Polybius also blamed Demetrius' {{influence}} for Philip's tyrannical behavior. One incident involved Philip's apparent role in {{a massacre}} {{carried out by the}} people against their leaders that occurred at Messene in 215 BC. Arriving on the scene the day after the massacre and wanting to seize the acropolis, Philip asked his advisors whether the entrails of a sacrifice which had been made indicated that he should quit the citadel or hold it. Demetrius responded by saying: if you have the heart of an augur, quit it as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> you can, but as a gallant and wise king, keep it, lest if you quit it now you may never have so good an opportunity again, for it is by thus holding the two horns that you can alone keep the ox under your control.|$|E
25|$|Mansell {{took over}} the car Senna {{was brought in to}} drive {{toward the end of the}} 1994 campaign. Mansell was paid {{approximately}} £900,000 per race, compared to his teammate Hill being paid £300,000 for the entire season. Mansell's return was helped by Bernie Ecclestone helping unravel his contracts in the United States. It was important for F1 to have a world champion driving that season and with worldwide TV viewing figures starting to decline, they needed Mansell. The 40-year-old was not as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> Damon Hill in race trim but signs that his speeds were coming back were evident in Japan during a fantastic battle with the Ferrari of Jean Alesi. Mansell took his final Grand Prix victory in Adelaide, the last race of the season, having out-qualified the two title contenders at the time, Damon Hill and Michael Schumacher, in the process (helped out by the second qualifying session being held on a wet track, with the times from the first session making up the grid). The plan initially was for Mansell to protect Hill from Schumacher, but both drivers passed him at the start and eventually collided (causing the retirement of both), handing Schumacher his first world title.|$|E

25|$|Several {{variations}} on the game of quiz bowl exist that affect question structure and content, rules of play, and round format. One standardized format is the pyramidal tossup/bonus format, which is used in ACF (or mACF) and NAQT competitions. ACF/mACF tossups are written in pyramidal style and are generally much longer than College Bowl and NAQT questions. It has a rigorous emphasis on academics, with very little popular culture. Games are usually untimed and last until a total of 20 tossups are read. NAQT is another common variation on the tossup/bonus format that balances academic rigor with {{a wider variety of}} subjects, including popular culture and an increased amount of current events and geography content. Unlike many mACF events, most questions used in this format are written and sold by NAQT themselves. NAQT also uses powers their in tossups, which reward players with 15 points instead of 10 for a tossup answered before a predetermined point. Games played on NAQT rules consist of two nine-minute halves and a total of 24 tossups. NAQT tossups are typically shorter than most other pyramidal tossups because of a character limit enforced on the questions. The format used for the now-defunct College Bowl tournament uses comparatively shorter questions. Gameplay is relatively <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> it is played in eight-minute halves, to a usual total of 22–24 tossups read. The Honda Campus All Star Challenge and University Challenge use similar formats.|$|E

Not only was the Xbox360 release imminent, but the PlayStation3 launch was scheduled not long afterwards. This put tremendous pressure on the team to develop for both systems.

500|$|Soeman {{has been}} {{categorized}} {{as a minor}} author of the Poedjangga Baroe period. The Dutch scholar of Indonesian literature A. Teeuw writes that, though Soeman's poetry maintained a conventional form, his detective stories were [...] "unpretentious but pleasantly written". However, he considers Soeman's short story collection, Kawan Bergeloet, his most interesting contribution to literature, owing to its [...] "well observed and realistically described" [...] sketches. Alisjahbana, meanwhile, praised Soeman's innovative use of Malay but considered the author's plotlines to be at times inconsequential and illogical, with the narrative acting as [...] "a child who <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> lightning shows his toys, then hides them again to pique his friends' curiosity". He considered Soeman's work best read for its entertainment value.|$|E

[...] Rufus Avery wrote in his account, [...] "I believe there was not less than five or six hundred men of the enemy on the parade in the fort.

500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> anything {{you would want to}} see." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} The Little Mermaid II: Pinball Frenzy was primarily positive, with many video game commentators complimenting its visuals and appeal to girls. It {{was determined to}} be a good fit for a female gamer by IGN's Craig Harris. However, Harris was more critical of the physics of the pinballs, describing the mechanics as [...] "a little on the floaty side" [...] and [...] "not as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> the previous pinball incarnations". Frank Provo felt the game would be popular with a younger audience, and complimented the vibrant colors of the tables and recreation of the films' soundtracks. The minigames and tables' designs were praised by a writer from Spong.com, who felt the game was a [...] "polished, playable pinball title that deserves checking out". Brett Allan Weiss of AllGame thought the game's multiplayer tournaments and adjustable difficulties encouraged family members to play together.|$|E
500|$|Glee is choreographed by Zach Woodlee and {{features}} {{four to eight}} production numbers per episode. Once Murphy selects a song, rights are cleared with its publishers by music supervisor P. J. Bloom, and music producers Adam Anders and Peer Astrom rearrange it for the Glee cast. Numbers are pre-recorded by the cast, while Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed. Studio recordings of tracks are then made. The process begins {{six to eight weeks}} before each episode is filmed, and can end as late as the day before filming begins. Each episode costs at least $3million to produce, and can take up to ten days to film {{as a result of the}} elaborate choreography. In late 2010, Bloom reported the process has been even shorter; [...] "as <b>quick</b> <b>as</b> a few weeks". For the second season, the creators were offered listens of upcoming songs in advance by publishers and record labels, with production occurring even before song rights are cleared.|$|E
