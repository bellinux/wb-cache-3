The eigenvalues {{need not}} be distinct. Define a square matrix <b>Q</b> whose <b>columns</b> are the n linearly independent eigenvectors of A,Since each <b>column</b> of <b>Q</b> is an eigenvector of A, right multiplying A by <b>Q</b> scales each <b>column</b> of <b>Q</b> by its associated eigenvalue,With this in mind, define a diagonal matrix Λ where each diagonal element Λii is the eigenvalue associated with the ith <b>column</b> of <b>Q.</b> ThenBecause the <b>columns</b> of <b>Q</b> are linearly independent, Q is invertible. Right multiplying {{both sides of the}} equation by Q−1,or by instead left multiplying both sides by Q−1,A can therefore be decomposed into a matrix composed of its eigenvectors, a diagonal matrix with its eigenvalues along the diagonal, and the inverse of the matrix of eigenvectors. This is called the eigendecomposition and it is a similarity transformation. Such a matrix A is said to be similar to the diagonal matrix Λ or diagonalizable. The matrix Q is the change of basis matrix of the similarity transformation. Essentially, the matrices A and Λ represent the same linear transformation expressed in two different bases. The eigenvectors are used as the basis when representing the linear transformation as Λ.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A gas chromatographic {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} the determination of nanogram quantities of hydrocyanic acid using a flame ionization detector. Excellent chromatograms were obtained on a porous polyaromatic polymer <b>column</b> (Porapak <b>Q)</b> at 60 °C. The {{procedure was}} employed {{for the analysis of}} HCN in aqueous cyanide solutions. Solutions as low as 1 μg /liter (ppb) HCN were analysed in five minutes after a 30 minute concentration period in which air is swept through the solution and HCN collected in a cold trap for gas chromatographic analysis. When interferences are encountered on the Porapak <b>Q</b> <b>column</b> preliminary separation is achieved on a 1, 2, 3 -tris(2 -cyanoethoxy) -propane (TCEP) on Chromosorb W column. The HCN is trapped from the TCEP column effluent and reinjected on a Porapak <b>Q</b> <b>column</b> for analyses. The amount of chloroform in chlorinated water was also determined by this procedure, Deactivated diatomaceous earth supports and the fluorocarbon supports were evaluated for the determination of trace quantities of HCN. These supports were either inefficient or adsorption on the solid support caused severe tailing. Several stationary phases were investigated. Best results were obtained with Carbowax 1540 or 1, 2, 3 -tris(2 -cyanoethoxy) -propane when Chromosorb W was used as a solid support...|$|R

40|$|Ferredoxins are iron-sulfur {{proteins}} that transfer electrons in different cellular processes. In Bacillus cereus {{there are two}} genes for ferredoxins that have been identified, one present with a [2 Fe- 2 S] cluster (BC 2795) and one with a [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster (BC 1483). These proteins can potentially receive electrons from three possible ferredoxin-NADP+-reductases, and further activate different enzymes. In this project, the starting point was to purify and structurally characterize the two ferredoxins in B. cereus and potentially their interactions with redox partners. For the [4 Fe- 4 S] ferredoxin several attempts to overexpress this protein was unsuccessful. However, the [2 Fe- 2 S] ferredoxin (106 amino acids, 11. 4 kDa) was successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli. This [2 Fe- 2 S] ferredoxin was purified {{in a series of}} purification steps involving ammonium sulphate, desalting <b>column,</b> <b>Q</b> Sepharose or DEAE columns, and Superdex 75 column. The purification procedure showed to be troublesome because of possible low iron-sulfur cluster content, and because of low UV-vis detection due to the absence of tryptophanes and tyrosines in the protein. Due to the high content of apoprotein, it was also tried to establish a reconstitution procedure for BC 2795. The apoform of the protein was crystallized.
