40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{implement}} a computer system for Night Vision Goggles based on appropriate design principles {{for the development of}} instructional multimedia systems. Multimedia has tremendous potential to enhance computer-based instruction. The design of any effective instructional multimedia application, however, must incorporate instructional, multimedia, and system design principles. This thesis explores cognitive learning theories, media selection, and the use of a developmental model for creating multimedia systems. This thesis concludes that the presentation of material must complement the internal learning processes of a user and the right combination of media must be used to present the content. The designers of an application must adopt a systems approach, also. This aper employs examples from a multimedia application that provides instruction on the use of night vision goggles. The application allows the user to interactively determine the sequence and pace of instruction. The application makes use of a pull-down <b>menu</b> for <b>quick</b> <b>access</b> to <b>menu</b> selections, includes question and answer sessions to test a user's learning, and full-motion video, text, audio, and graphics be used in combination, or independently, to present the content.
