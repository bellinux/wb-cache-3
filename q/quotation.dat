5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{beginning with}} a biblical <b>quotation</b> for the vox Christi, Jesus speaking. A set of aria and recitative {{is followed by a}} chorus on another biblical <b>quotation</b> from the gospel, while an aria leads to the closing chorale. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. The duration of the cantata is given as 20 minutes.|$|E

50|$|As {{described}} in its introduction, The Yale Book of <b>Quotations</b> {{is characterized by}} its greater focus, relative to its nearest competitors, Bartlett's Familiar <b>Quotations</b> and The Oxford Dictionary of <b>Quotations,</b> on modern American <b>quotations,</b> including {{those that do not}} have conventional literary sources. These include <b>quotations</b> from politicians, judges, journalists, sportscasters, athletes, screenwriters, songwriters, and anonymous sources. There are special sections for some kinds of <b>quotations,</b> including advertising slogans, film lines, folk and anonymous songs, political slogans, proverbs, and television catchphrases. There is also coverage of traditional literary sources. There are, for example, 400 <b>quotations</b> from the Bible, 106 <b>quotations</b> from Charles Dickens, 127 <b>quotations</b> from T. S. Eliot, 153 <b>quotations</b> from Mark Twain, and 455 <b>quotations</b> from William Shakespeare. This coverage is less extensive than that offered by Bartlett's, which provides 1,642 <b>quotations</b> from the Bible and 1,906 from Shakespeare.|$|R

5|$|The {{text of the}} cantata {{is taken}} from a 1704 {{collection}} of librettos from Meiningen, many {{of which had been}} set to music in the cantatas of Bach's distant cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, Capellmeister at Meiningen. The librettos have been attributed to his employer Duke Ernst Ludwig von Sachsen-Meiningen. The symmetrical structure of seven movements is typical for this collection: the opening <b>quotation</b> from the Old Testament, followed by a recitative and an aria; then the central <b>quotation</b> from the New Testament, followed by an aria and a recitative, leading into the final chorale. The theme of BWV 39 is an invocation to be grateful for God's gifts and to share them with the needy.|$|E

5|$|This {{language}} is not from the Court’s opinion in Lucas v. Earl. Instead, it is an almost direct <b>quotation</b> from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the <b>quotation.</b> As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the <b>quotation,</b> and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E

5|$|In April 1998, Wooller {{claimed that}} the council of the ICAEW was obstructing his {{campaign}} to increase democracy after it refused to allow the original text of motions that were to be published to be heard at the annual general meeting in June 1998. Wooller's first motion was about electing {{the president of the}} ICAEW democratically by ballot. The other two motions came about from the Gerrard report. The second motion said the district societies should be self-financing and the third motion was on reducing the number of council members to fifty-three. The first motion used a <b>quotation</b> from an Accountancy Age interview with council member Ian Hay Davison, and Wooller was told to stop circulating Hay Davison's <b>quotation</b> after he objected to being quoted. The ICAEW asked members to vote on {{an increase in the number}} of council members from seventy-five after requests made in the Gerrard report. Wooller asked members to reduce the number of council members to fifty-three, which was recommended by the Gerrard report as the ideal council quota. A 54% majority of the ICAEW members supported Wooller's motion to reduce the number.|$|E
