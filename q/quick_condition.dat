40|$|High {{sensitivity}} GPS receivers {{have expanded}} {{the use of}} the GNSS to areas with difficult reception of the signals from the satellites. Difficult conditions indicate attenuation and reflection of the signals. Receivers achieve higher sensitivity of signal reception by larger number of correlators and longer integration time. The present doctoral dissertation deals with classical methods of observation processing in normal conditions used for observation processing in challenging environments. Some of the methods are more effective in difficult conditions than others. Processing of observation data in dynamic and <b>quick</b> changing <b>conditions</b> requires careful and consistent treatment. Otherwise a gross error in position determination can occur. Multipath has the biggest influence on final results and has a special effect on code observations. Therefore, Doppler observations are also included in the position determination. The custom developed procedure of positioning in challenging environments beside well known and established methods includes additional methods which assure higher accuracy and reliability of the determined position. Processing procedures have been tested in different conditions in static and kinematic cases. The acquired results have been compared to those processed inside the receiver. A so-called conditional DGPS has been developed, which determines the position differentially by using only data from strong signals. ...|$|R
40|$|Sensitive clay {{is a kind}} of clay, which {{loses its}} shear {{strength}} when it is subjected to cyclic loading. High-rise buildings, towers, bridges etc., founded on sensitive clays usually suffer from reduction of the safety factor during its life span. Cyclic loading on foundation of sensitive clay during the undrained period may lead to <b>quick</b> clay <b>condition</b> and a catastrophic failure of the structure. In the literature, governing parameters such as cyclic deviator stress, pore water pressure, axial strain, pre-consolidation pressure, confining stress, initial degree of saturation, water content, liquidity index and the number of cycles are divided into two categories and then presented as a function of sensitivity. Nevertheless the limited data available has restricted the use of empirical formulae. It is of interest to note that sensitive clay's shear strength increases due to consolidation and decreases due to cyclic load. In this case, the pre-consolidation pressure plays the role of governing parameter. In this investigation, the experimental results available at Concordia University as well as the data available in literature will be used to evaluate the empirical formulae and models. The governing parameters will be evaluated on this basis. Based on this analysis, a procedure to assist practicing engineers in designing foundation on sensitive clay is proposed...|$|R
