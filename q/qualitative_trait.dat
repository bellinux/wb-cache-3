40|$|Abstract Univariate {{genome-wide}} {{association analysis}} of {{quantitative and qualitative}} traits has been investigated extensively in the literature. In the presence of correlated phenotypes, it is more intuitive to analyze all phenotypes simultaneously. We describe an efficient likelihood-based approach for the joint association analysis of quantitative and qualitative traits in unrelated individuals. We assume a probit model for the <b>qualitative</b> <b>trait,</b> under which an unobserved latent variable and a prespecified threshold determine {{the value of the}} <b>qualitative</b> <b>trait.</b> To jointly model the quantitative and qualitative traits, we assume that the quantitative trait and the latent variable follow a bivariate normal distribution. The latent variable is allowed to be correlated with the quantitative phenotype. Simultaneous modeling of the quantitative and qualitative traits allows us to make more precise inference on the pleiotropic genetic effects. We derive likelihood ratio tests for the testing of genetic effects. An application to the Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 data is provided. The new method yields reasonable power and meaningful results for the joint association analysis of the quantitative trait Q 1 and the <b>qualitative</b> <b>trait</b> disease status at SNPs with not too small MAF. </p...|$|E

HMW and LMW glutenin subunits were evaluated using SDS-polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in 33 genotypes. Statistical analysis including correlation coefficients, factor analysis, cluster analysis of genotypes based on <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits,</b> analysis of variance in <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits</b> based on HMW, LMW, and combination of subunits {{as well as all}} of subunits, and canonical correlation analysis between glutenin subunits and <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits</b> were used.

Fine mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and <b>qualitative</b> <b>trait</b> genes {{plays an important role}} in gene cloning, molecular-marker-assisted selection (MAS), and trait improvement. However, the genetic control of agronomic traits in the adzuki bean remains poorly understood. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are invaluable in the construction of high-density genetic maps. We mapped 26 agronomic QTLs and five <b>qualitative</b> <b>trait</b> genes related to pigmentation using 1, 571 polymorphic SNP markers from the adzuki bean genome via restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing of 150 members of an F 2 population derived from a cross between cultivated and wild adzuki beans. We mapped 11 QTLs for flowering time and pod maturity on chromosomes 4, 7, and 10. Six 100 -seed weight (SD 100 WT) QTLs were detected. Two major flowering time QTLs were located on chromosome 4, firstly VaFld 4. 1 (PEVs 71. 3 %), co-segregating with SNP marker s 690 - 144110, and VaFld 4. 2 (PEVs 67. 6 %) at a 0. 974 cM genetic distance from the SNP marker s 165 - 116310. Three QTLs for seed number per pod (Snp 3. 1, Snp 3. 2, and Snp 4. 1) were mapped on chromosomes 3 and 4. One QTL VaSdt 4. 1 of seed thickness (SDT) and three QTLs for branch number on the main stem were detected on chromosome 4. QTLs for maximum leaf width (LFMW) and stem internode length were mapped to chromosomes 2 and 9, respectively. Trait genes controlling the color of the seed coat, pod, stem and flower were mapped to chromosomes 3 and 1. Three candidate genes, VaAGL, VaPhyE, and VaAP 2, were identified for flowering time and pod maturity. VaAGL encodes an agamous-like MADS-box protein of 379 amino acids. VaPhyE encodes a phytochrome E protein of 1, 121 amino acids. Four phytochrome genes (VaPhyA 1, VaPhyA 2, VaPhyB, and VaPhyE) were identified in the adzuki bean genome.

The partial root zone drying (PRD) method introduced in Australia {{for the first time}} and its goal was controlling the vine’s excessive growth. This goal gained by alternative drying the rootzone. Basically the theory of PRD method, is expanding the plant’s roots by applying alternative stress on different sides of the roots. So the plants with PRD irrigation method can have different root system in comparison with other irrigation methods. At this method the plant’s condition would be OK by uptaking water from wet side, and the roots at the dry side can release abscisic acid hormone which decrease the stomatal conductance and consequently the water use efficiency would be increase. There had been studies on the effect of water tension on strawberry. The previous studies on strawberry indicated that the water stress can increase the plant’s brix concentration and some of plant acids. The awareness of the impact of water deficit stress on strawberry plant quantity and quality is essential for irrigation and product management, and at the current study, effect of different deficit irrigation methods on quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits</b> of strawberry have been evaluated.

40|$|Background: Intensified {{selection}} of polled individuals has recently gained importance in predominantly horned dairy cattle breeds {{as an alternative}} to routine dehorning. The status quo of the current polled breeding pool of genetically-closely related artificial insemination sires with lower breeding values for performance traits raises questions regarding the effects of intensified selection based on this founder pool. Methods: We developed a stochastic simulation framework that combines the stochastic simulation software QMSim and a self-designed R program named QUALsim that acts as an external extension. Two traits were simulated in a dairy cattle population for 25 generations: one quantitative (QMSim) and one <b>qualitative</b> <b>trait</b> with Mendelian inheritance (i. e. polledness, QUALsim). The assignment scheme for <b>qualitative</b> <b>trait</b> genotypes initiated realistic initial breeding situations regarding allele frequencies, true breeding values for the quantitative trait and genetic relatedness. Intensified selection for polled cattle was achieved using an approach that weights estimated breeding values in the animal best linear unbiased prediction model for the quantitative trait depending on genotypes or phenotypes for the polled trait with a user-defined weighting factor. Results: Selection response for the polled trait was highest in the selection scheme based on genotypes. Selection based on phenotypes led to significantly lower allele frequencies for polled. The male selection path played a significantly greater role for a fast dissemination of polled alleles compared to female selection strategies. Fixation of the polled allele implies selection based on polled genotypes among males. In comparison to a base breeding scenario that does not take polledness into account, intensive selection for polled substantially reduced genetic gain for this quantitative trait after 25 generations. Reducing selection intensity for polled males while maintaining strong selection intensity among females, simultaneously decreased losses in genetic gain and achieved a final allele frequency of 0. 93 for polled. Conclusions: A fast transition to a completely polled population through intensified selection for polled was in contradiction to the preservation of high genetic gain for the quantitative trait. Selection on male polled genotypes with moderate weighting, and selection on female polled phenotypes with high weighting, could be a suitable compromise regarding all important breeding aspects...|$|E

In {{an effort}} to improve plant growth and productivity by {{increasing the amount of}} N 2 -fixation, a two-year field experiment was designed to study the combined effect of potassium and two strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum (L- 1897 and L- 2097) on quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits</b> of lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus). Bacterial inoculation and potassium application (0 kg K ha- 1 and 50 kg K ha- 1) caused measurable changes in the observed characteristics in both years of study. In addition to growth characteristics, chemical- and bio-fertilizer treatments also affected the nitrogen and potassium concentration in seeds and seed protein content. Yield and yield characteristics improved more with the combined application as compared with a single treatment and control. Among the bacterial strains, L- 1897 along with potassium fertilization resulted in highest yield. We conclude that optimum potassium fertilization is required for the favorable and sustained action of Rhizobium to influence growth characteristics and <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits</b> and hence, yield and yield components...|$|R
40|$|Admixture mapping is {{a popular}} tool to {{identify}} regions of the genome associated with traits in a recently admixed population. Existing methods have been developed primarily for identification of a single locus influencing a dichotomous trait within a case-control study design. We propose a generalized admixture mapping (GLEAM) approach, a flexible and powerful regression method for both quantitative and <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits,</b> which is able to test for association between the trait and local ancestries in multiple loci simultaneously and adjust for covariates. The new method {{is based on the}} generalized linear model and utilizes a quadratic normal moment prior to incorporate admixture prior information. Through simulation, we demonstrate that GLEAM achieves lower type I error rate and higher power than existing methods both for <b>qualitative</b> <b>traits</b> and more significantly for quantitative traits. We applied GLEAM to genome-wide SNP data from the Illumina African American panel derived from a cohort of black woman participating in the Healthy Pregnancy, Healthy Baby study and identified a locus on chromosome 2 associated with the averaged maternal mean arterial pressure during 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy...|$|R
