40|$|Stable mutants highly {{resistant}} to the protein synthesis inhibitor diphtheria toxin (dipr) have been selected in human diploid fibroblast cells at a frequency of 1 - 8 X 10 (- 6). Treatment of cells with mutagens, (e. g., ethylmethanesulfonate, nitrosoguanidine, and ICR- 170), increased the frequencies of dipr mutants by 50 - to 500 -fold in different experiments, and the optimal expression time for dipr mutation was about 5 days. All mutants examined thus far have bred true, and no effects of cell density or cross feeding have been observed on the selection. Fluctuation analysis showed that the dipr mutation occurs in these fibroblasts {{at the rate of}} 5 - 6 X 10 (- 7) mutations per cell per generation. Protein synthesis in mutant extracts was resistant to diphtheria toxin, indicating that the dipr lesion in such mutants lies in the protein synthesis machinery. The characteristics of the dipr marker should make this system particularly useful for studies of <b>quantitative</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> in human diploid cells...|$|E
40|$|Stable and {{heritable}} {{variants of}} Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells which {{are resistant to}} different levels (0. 1, 1. 0 and 10 [mu]g/ml) of the toxin abrin have been isolated and characterized. The frequency of resistant colonies to abrin was increased with the concentration of a chemical mutagen. There was no effect of cell density or cross-feeding on the recovery of variants. In experiments using fluorescein-labeled abrin and ricin which bind to terminal (non-sialylated) galactose residues of cell-surface oligosaccharides, parental cells exhibited strong binding toward both toxins, whereas no fluorescence was observed in the resistant clones. A fluorescein-conjugated lectin, BS II, which is specific for terminal N-acetyl [...] glucosaminyl residues, did not interact with the parental cells, but did with the resistant clones. This suggests that {{on the surface of}} resistant cells the number of terminal galactosyl residues of oligosaccharide chains in glycoproteins was reduced, exposing the penultimate N-acetyl [...] glucosaminyl residues. The number of available endogenous acceptor sites for galactosyl transferase in the abrin-resistant clones was directly proportional to the degree of resistance. In the presence of great excess of exogenous acceptor, the rates of galactosyl transfer were similar in all the abrin-resistant cell types tested, with levels ranging from 1. 4 to 1. 7 times parental cell values. Studies with tetraploid cell hybrids reveal that resistance was a recessive trait. Fluctuation analysis showed that abrin resistance occurred in CHO cell populations at a rate of 4 - 7 x 10 - 8 /cell/generation. The system may serve as a new marker for <b>quantitative</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> studies...|$|E
40|$|SummaryA {{regulated}} {{mechanism of}} cargo loading {{is crucial for}} intracellular transport. N-cadherin, a synaptic adhesion molecule that is critical for neuronal function, must be precisely transported to dendritic spines in response to synaptic activity and plasticity. However, the mechanism of activity-dependent cargo loading remains unclear. To elucidate this mechanism, we investigated the activity-dependent transport of N-cadherin via its transporter, KIF 3 A. First, by comparing KIF 3 A-bound cargo vesicles with unbound KIF 3 A, we identified critical KIF 3 A phosphorylation sites and specific kinases, PKA and CaMKIIa, using <b>quantitative</b> phosphoanalyses. Next, <b>mutagenesis</b> and kinase inhibitor experiments revealed that N-cadherin transport was enhanced via phosphorylation of the KIF 3 A C terminus, thereby increasing cargo-loading activity. Furthermore, N-cadherin transport was enhanced during homeostatic upregulation of synaptic strength, triggered by chronic inactivation by TTX. We propose the first model of activity-dependent cargo loading, in which phosphorylation of the KIF 3 A C terminus upregulates the loading and transport of N-cadherin in homeostatic synaptic plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Numerous nuclear {{proteins}} bind to chromatin by targeting unique DNA sequences {{or specific}} histone modifications. In contrast, HMGN proteins recognize the generic {{structure of the}} 147 -bp nucleosome core particle. HMGNs alter the structure and activity of chromatin by binding to nucleosomes; however, the determinants of the specific interaction of HMGNs with chromatin are not known. Here we use systematic <b>mutagenesis,</b> <b>quantitative</b> fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, fluorescence imaging, and mobility shift assays to identify the determinants important for the specific binding of these proteins to both the chromatin of living cells and to purified nucleosomes. We find that several regions of the protein affect the affinity of HMGNs to chromatin; however, the conserved sequence RRSARLSA, is the sole determinant of the specific interaction of HMGNs with nucleosomes. Within this sequence, each of the 4 amino acids in the R-S-RL motif are the only residues absolutely essential for anchoring HMGN protein to nucleosomes, both in vivo and in vitro. Our studies identify a new chromatin-binding module that specifically recognizes nucleosome cores independently of DNA sequence or histone tail modifications...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{investigated}} the molecular basis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) using Opticin (OPTC) {{as a candidate}} gene {{on the basis of}} its expression in the trabecular meshwork cells involved in the disease pathogenesis. Two hundred POAG patients and 100 controls were enrolled in this study. The coding sequence of OPTC was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of POAG patients, followed by SSCP, DHPLC and DNA sequencing. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis, sitedirected <b>mutagenesis,</b> <b>quantitative</b> RT-PCR and western blot experiments were performed to address the functional significance of a 'silent' change in the OPTC coding region while screening for mutations in POAG patients. Results: We detected two missense (p. Glu 66 Gly & p. Ile 89 Thr) and one silent change (p. Phe 162 Phe; c. 602 C>T) that was present in 3 different patients but in none of the 100 controls screened. The mutant (c. 602 T) mRNA was predicted to have remarkably different secondary structure compared to the wild-type transcript by in silico approaches. Subsequent wet-lab experiments showed lower expression of the gene both at the mRNA and protein levels. Conclusion: Our study suggests OPTC as a candidate gene for POAG. Further, it highlights the importance of investigating the 'silent' variations for functional implication that might not be apparent from only in silico analysis...|$|R
40|$|Many tumors exhibit {{extensive}} chromosomal instability, but karyotypic alterations will {{be significant}} in carcinogenesis only by influencing specific oncogenes or tumor suppressor loci within the affected chromosomal segments. In this investigation, {{the specificity of}} chromosomal rearrangements attributable to radiation-induced genomic instability is detailed, and a qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> correspondence with <b>mutagenesis</b> is demonstrated. Chromosomal abnormalities preferentially occurred {{near the site of}} prior rearrangements, resulting in complex abnormalities, or near the centromere, resulting in deletion or translocation of the entire chromosome arm, but no case of an interstitial chromosomal deletion was observed. Evidence for chromosomal instability in the progeny of irradiated cells also included clonal karyotypic heterogeneity. The persistence of instability was demonstrated for at least 80 generations by elevated mutation rates at the heterozygous, autosomal marker locus tk. Among those TK- mutants that showed a loss of heterozygosity, a statistically significant increase in mutation rate was observed only for those in which the loss of heterozygosity encompasses the telomeric region. This mutational specificity corresponds with the prevalence of terminal deletions, additions, and translocations, and the absence of interstitial deletions, in karyotypic analysis. Surprisingly, the elevated rate of TK- mutations is also partially attributable to intragenic base substitutions and small deletions, and DNA sequence analysis of some of these mutations is presented. Complex chromosomal abnormalities appear to be the most significant indicators of a high rate of persistent genetic instability which correlates with increased rates of both intragenic and chromosomal-scale mutations at tk...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{breeding}} {{relies on}} genetic variation and selection to gradually improve plants for traits {{that are of}} interest to the grower and the consumer. This variability has been in part assessed through an efficient use of the available germplasm. Although breeding efforts have continuously produced improved varieties throughout the years, recent developments in the field of biotechnology and molecular biology can now be employed to facilitate and speed up cultivar development. These methods are mainly DNA-based techniques and basically use the hybridization of cloned probes to detect genomic sequences that are polymorphic for internal restriction sites, such as in restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or on the amplification of DNA fragments using the polymerase chain reaction (e. g. random amplified polymorphic DNA or simple sequence repeats (or microsatellites)). The amplified fragment length polymorphism method is conceptually a hybrid technique, relying on polymorphisms in the recognition sequences of restriction enzymes that are revealed through selective PCR amplification of adapter sequences. These techniques, when integrated with other resources such as mutants generated by chemical and insertional <b>mutagenesis,</b> <b>quantitative</b> trait locus mapping, cDNA sequencing projects, high throughput mass spectrometry and proteomics, physical and comparative mapping, have made gene cloning far more efficient. Advanced bioinformatic tools for data retrieval and subsequent statistical analysis have been developed, allowing for a quick and reliable management of enormous amount of data obtained in several plant species. The objective of the present manuscript is to offer an overview of the most common molecular markers used in the genetic analysis of traits that are relevant as targets for crop improvement. The advantages and disadvantages of current marker technologies are also discussed. 2004 Suplementt, 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDespite much {{progress}} {{in understanding the}} folding and the aggregation processes of proteins, the rules defining their interplay {{have yet to be}} fully defined. This problem is of particular importance since many diseases are initiated by protein unfolding and hence the propensity to aggregate competes with intramolecular collapse and other folding events. Here, we describe the roles of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in defining the length of the lag time and the apparent rate of elongation of the 100 -residue protein human β 2 -microglobulin at pH  2. 5, commencing from an acid-denatured state that lacks persistent structure but contains significant non-random hydrophobic interactions. Using a combination of site-directed <b>mutagenesis,</b> <b>quantitative</b> kinetic analysis and computational methods, we show that only a single region of about 10 residues in length, determines the rate of fibril formation, despite the fact that other regions exhibit a significant intrinsic propensity for aggregation. We rationalise these results by analysing the effect of incorporating the conformational properties of acid-unfolded β 2 -microglobulin and its variants at pH  2. 5 as measured by NMR spectroscopy into the Zyggregator aggregation prediction algorithm. These results demonstrate that residual structure in the precursor state modulates the intrinsic propensity of the polypeptide chain to aggregate and that the algorithm developed here allows the key regions for aggregation to be more clearly identified and the rates of their self-association to be predicted. Given the common propensity of unfolded chains to form non-random intramolecular interactions as monomers and to self-assemble subsequently into amyloid fibrils, the approach developed should find widespread utility for the prediction of regions important in amyloid formation and their rates of self-assembly...|$|R
40|$|Four human IFNo: {{chromosomal}} genes {{have been}} isolated from a newly constructed placental DNA library in XL 47. Restriction and sequencing {{analysis revealed that}} each gene had been described previously. However, one gene, SMTlll. lA, which encodes a full length IFN, is an allelic varient of a previously characterised pseudogene, thus indicating some degeneracy of the IFNa gene family. A chimaeric gene comprising the MuIFNx 1 promoter (- 188 to + 52) and cat gene coding sequences has been constructed in vitro, enabling promoter function to be examined in mouse cells. Reproducible polyrI. rC mediated induction of CAT expression from the MuIFNx 1 promoter has been demonstrated in pools of stably transfected, but not transiently transfected, L 929 cells. Monitoring mRNA production revealed the transient accumulation of correctly initiated hybrid gene transcripts which precede optimum CAT production. Aspects of the structure/function relationship of the MuIFNx 1 promoter have been investigated by oligonucleofide site directed mutagenesis. Comparative studies of IFNx promoter sequences identified prospective regulatory regions for <b>mutagenesis.</b> <b>Quantitative</b> CAT assays have been employed for promoter assessment. Additionally, {{the construction of a}} pseudogene comprising the wildtype MuIFNa 1 promoter linked to an internally deleted cat gene has enabled both mutant and wildtype promoters functioning simultaneously in the same cell population to be assessed by S- 1 nuclease protection studies using a common probe. Such studies have revealed three distinct cis-acting regions implicated in MuIFNx 1 promoter function. Two are located upstream of the TATA box, defined by mutations at - 87 and between - 66 and - 33 respectively. These reduce promoter activity 2 to 5 fold. The third, is defined by a mutation at + 14, within the untranslated leader sequence. This enhances activity 2 to 3 fold. A deletion derivative of the MuIFNx 1 promoter containing only 94 bp of upstream sequence is inactive. Cis-activation by the Mo-MuSV enhancer restores inducibility to this promoter whereas the intact MuIFNx 1 promoter is refractory to this element. This suggests that distinct cis-acting sequences dictate the efficiency and regulation of MuIFNx 1 gene transcription...|$|R
