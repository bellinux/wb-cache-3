5|$|Through {{studies of}} carbon isotope ratios (similar to the {{methodology}} used in carbon dating, except with the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), {{it has been}} shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as harzburgitic, are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios. Diamonds that have come to the Earth's surface are generally <b>quite</b> <b>old,</b> ranging from under 1billion to 3.3billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} the Rova's {{buildings}} possessed unique design features. The modest wood building then known as Manjakamiadana was also called Felatanambola ("Silver Hands") for the hand-shaped sculptures crafted from melted silver piastres and attached {{to each of the}} building's four tandrotrano (roof horns)—an architectural design element formed from the crossed gable beams that extended past the roof line of all traditional aristocratic Merina houses. Felatanambola's decorative silver hands were later affixed to the roof horns of Besakana. Another distinctive building from this period was called Bevato ("Many Stones") because its foundation was atypically composed of stone blocks. Manatsara was said to be the most well constructed of the many houses because it was built using ambora (Tambourissa parrifolia), an extremely durable and rot-resistant indigenous hardwood, rather than a traditional wood called hazomena (Weinmannia rutenbergii). According to oral history, Manatsara was treasured by Andrianampoinimerina and the house was <b>quite</b> <b>old</b> but still well preserved in the mid-19th century when Queen RanavalonaI decided to recover its interior walls with wood taken from Sihanaka country.|$|E
5|$|The defence was {{supported}} by a strong artillery component that included 41 Breda Model 35 20mm antiaircraft guns; 85 47mm antitank guns; 26 Solothurn S-18/1000 anti-tank rifles; 41 Cannone da 65/17 modello 13 65mm infantry support guns; 147 Cannone da 75/32 modello 37 75mm and 77mm field guns; 76 Skoda 100 mm Model 1916 and Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider 105mm guns; and 27 120mm and Obice da 149/12 modello 14 149mm medium howitzers. The large number of different gun models, many of them <b>quite</b> <b>old,</b> created difficulties with the supply of spare parts. The older guns often had worn barrels, which caused problems with accuracy. Ammunition stocks were similarly old and perhaps as many as two-thirds of the fuses were out of date, resulting in excessive numbers of dud rounds. There were also multiple models of machine guns, with seven different types of ammunition in use. The Breda 30, the principal light machine gun, had a low rate of fire and a reputation for jamming. The Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914 was a bulky and complicated weapon that was also prone to stoppages. Some of these had been rebuilt as Fiat-Revelli Modello 1935s which, while an improvement, were still unreliable. The principal medium machine gun, the Breda M37, had its shortcomings, the main one being that it used 20-round strips of cartridges, which gave it a reduced rate of fire. Shortages of raw materials, coupled with the increased technological sophistication of modern weapons, led to production problems that frustrated efforts to supply the entire Italian Army with the best available equipment. The result was that the firepower of the Italian defenders was neither as great nor as effective as it should have been.|$|E

25|$|Often {{an owner}} {{does not want}} to take a {{valuable}} competition mare out of training to carry a foal.

Other times, a mare may have physical problems that prevent or discourage breeding. However, there are now several options for breeding these mares. These options also allow a mare to produce multiple foals each breeding season, instead of the usual one. Therefore, mares may have an even greater value for breeding.|$|E

25|$|The 18th century saw an {{increasing}} emphasis on America itself as fit subject matter for its poets. This trend is {{most evident in}} the works of Philip Freneau (17521832), who is also notable for the unusually sympathetic attitude to Native Americans shown in his writings, sometimes reflective of a skepticism toward Anglo-American culture and civilization. However, as might be expected from what was essentially provincial writing, this late colonial poetry is generally somewhat old-fashioned in form and syntax, deploying the means and methods of Pope and Gray in the era of Blake and Burns. The work of Rebecca Hammond Lard (1772–1855), although <b>quite</b> <b>old,</b> still apply to life in today's world.

25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the {{shear forces}} {{applied to the}} building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although this will require exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be <b>quite</b> <b>old</b> and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.|$|E

25|$|In 1618, {{after the}} death of Powhatan, his brother Opitchapam, a lame and <b>quite</b> <b>old</b> man, became {{paramount}} chief of the confederacy. Their youngest brother, Opchanacanough, was probably the effective leader, with his friend, war-chief and advisor Nemattanew, and both of them did not believe peaceful relations with the colonists could be maintained. Perhaps in 1620-1621 Opitchapam retired or he was deposed (but possibly he died in 1630) and he was succeeded by his youngest brother, and Opchanacanough and Nemattanew began to predispose plans for the unavoidable war. Having recovered from their defeat commanding Pamunkey warriors during the First Anglo-Powhatan War, they planned to shock the English with an attack that would leave them contained in a small trading outpost, rather than expanding throughout the area with new plantations. In the spring of 1622, after a settler murdered his adviser Nemattanew, Opchanacanough launched a campaign of surprise attacks on at least 31 separate English settlements and plantations, mostly along the James River, extending as far as Henricus.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} island was {{apparently}} settled to some extent in prehistoric times, it may already have lost bird species then. The geological data indicates that Kiritimati is <b>quite</b> <b>old,</b> was never completely underwater in the Holocene at least, and thus it might have once harbored highly distinct wetland birds. The limited overall habitat diversity on Kiritimati nonetheless limits the range of such hypothetical taxa, as does biogeography due to its remote location. At least one, possibly several Gallirallus and/or Porzana rails make the most likely candidates, given their former {{presence in the region}} and that conditions on Kiritimati would seem well suited. Perhaps a Todiramphus kingfisher was also present; such a bird would probably have belonged to the sacred kingfisher (T. sanctus) group as that species today occurs as a vagrant in Micronesia, and related forms are resident in southeastern Polynesia. These birds would have fallen victim to the Polynesian rat and, {{in the case of the}} rails which would have almost certainly been flightless, hunting by natives.|$|E
