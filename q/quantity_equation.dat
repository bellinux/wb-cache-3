5000|$|Historically, a {{great deal}} of {{economic}} literature was concerned with the question of what causes inflation and what effect it has. There were different schools of thought as to the causes of inflation. Most can be divided into two broad areas: quality theories of inflation and quantity theories of inflation. The quality theory of inflation rests on the expectation of a seller accepting currency to be able to exchange that currency at a later time for goods that are desirable as a buyer. The quantity theory of inflation rests on the <b>quantity</b> <b>equation</b> of money that relates the money supply, its velocity, and the nominal value of exchanges. Adam Smith and David Hume proposed a quantity theory of inflation for money, and a quality theory of inflation for production.|$|E

It is noteworthy that the <b>quantity</b> <b>equation</b> can be derived both in a demand-side context and in a long run supply-side approach. Moreover, a new derivation is presented for the case of an open economy and it is shown that trade as well as foreign direct investment should be expected to have an influence on the price level and the inflation rate, respectively.

40|$|Most {{macroeconomic}} models, {{such as the}} IS-LM, assume equilibrium {{in money}} markets. Since money demand is an inverse function of velocity, an inaccurate estimate of velocity will lead to errors in calculating the monetary and general equilibria.

The algorithm arises from the <b>quantity</b> <b>equation</b> of exchange, which one may prefer to an ad hoc model of velocity. ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Quantity</b> <b>Equation</b> was the {{complement}} to the Classical theory {{of production and}} distribution. Although the subject is contentious, it is has been argued with strong textual backing that the Classics applied their value theory to money. A certain sum of real value, in an appropriate medium, would be required for circulation; this depended {{on the structure of}} the economy and on institutional arrangements, and in normal circumstances would be represented by a rectangular hyperbola. The money article was made of metal which was mined and minted; its value thus depended, like any other good, on costs of production (including seignorage as the analogue to profit.) Over some range these costs might well be constant, but at some point costs at the external margin would rise. The intersection of this supply function with the circulation requirements then defined a longperiod normal position 1, determining the quantity of circulating money and its value. Temporary changes in this quantity, which could be engineered by governments, or caused by wars and social dislocation, would, in the short run, be reflected in (more or less) equiproportional changes in the price level. Following Sraffa, the Classical approach has been revived and redeveloped. But the <b>Quantity</b> <b>Equation</b> has fallen into the hands of Monetarists, and ‘New Classcials’. This paper proposes to rescue the <b>Quantity</b> <b>Equation</b> and show that, in the right circumstances, it is indeed a true and proper consort for the Classical Theory of Production. In the Classical world, employment was fixed in short run as well as the long – allowing, of course, for minor variations. The Classical system is not closed until wages are given; here we shall take the real wage to be fixed. Output also tended to be fixed for the Classics, but it could vary more significantly in the short run, because productivity could 1 E. g., Green, R. 1992. Blaug, 1995, discusses this approach but considers it only {{one of a number of}} possible interpretations of the Classics. W. E.

40|$|Volatility {{in money}} {{velocity}} destabilizes spending and output, generating business cycles. This note develops a gauge of this volatility, {{based on the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>equation</b> of exchange. In contrast to ad hoc regression, the gauge measures the impacts on volatility of the three determinants of velocity – money supply, output, and the price level. The algorithm allows covariances among these variables. An application to a fast-growing transition economy, Kazakhstan, finds that at the margin, price shocks affect volatility more than do real shocks, by several orders of magnitude.

This is opposed to the influence mechanism taken by liquidity on the real economy. We conclude by analyzing the relationship between liquidity in real economy, financial economy, and inflation...|$|E
