5|$|The Sm ion is a {{potential}} activator for use in warm-white light emitting diodes. It offers high luminous efficacy due to the narrow emission bands, however, the generally low <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> and insufficient absorption in the UV-A to blue spectral region hinders commercial application.|$|E
5|$|In the end, four {{broadband}} filters were chosen, centred at wavelengths of 300 nm (near-ultraviolet), 450nm (blue light), 606nm (red light) and 814nm (near-infrared). Because the <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Hubble's detectors is quite low at 300nm, the noise in observations at this wavelength is {{primarily due to}} CCD noise rather than sky background; thus, these observations could be conducted at times when high background noise would have harmed the efficiency of observations in other passbands.|$|E
25|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> is most usefully {{expressed}} as a spectral measurement (that is, {{as a function of}} photon wavelength or energy). Since some wavelengths are absorbed more effectively than others, spectral measurements of <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> can yield valuable information {{about the quality of the}} semiconductor bulk and surfaces. <b>Quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> alone is not the same as overall energy conversion efficiency, as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell.|$|E

Considerable research has been invested in developing blue OLEDs with high external <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> as well as a deeper blue color. External <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> values of 20% and 19% have been reported for red (625nbsp&nm) and green (530nbsp&nm) diodes, respectively.

They feature fast response times (higher than their p-n counterparts), running into several tens of gigahertz, making them ideal for high speed optical telecommunication applications. Similarly, silicon p-i-n photodiodes have even higher <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> but can only detect wavelengths below the bandgap of silicon, i.e. ~1100 nm.|$|R

25|$|To improve {{electron}} transport {{in these}} solar cells, {{while maintaining the}} high surface area needed for dye adsorption, two researchers have designed alternate semiconductor morphologies, such as arrays of nanowires and a combination of nanowires and nanoparticles, to provide a direct path to the electrode via the semiconductor conduction band.

25|$|Balanced charge {{injection}} {{and transfer}} {{are required to}} get high internal efficiency, pure emission of luminance layer without contaminated emission from charge transporting layers, and high stability. A common way to balance charge is optimizing {{the thickness of the}} charge transporting layers but is hard to control. Another way is using the exciplex. Exciplex formed between hole-transporting (p-type) and electron-transporting (n-type) side chains to localize electron-hole pairs. Energy is then transferred to luminophore and provide high efficiency. An example of using exciplex is grafting Oxadiazole and carbazole side units in red diketopyrrolopyrrole-doped Copolymer main chain shows improved external <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> and color purity in no optimized OLED.|$|E
25|$|Air mass affects output. In space, {{where there}} is no atmosphere, the {{spectrum}} of the sun is relatively unfiltered. However, on earth, air filters the incoming light, changing the solar spectrum. The filtering effect ranges from Air Mass 0 (AM0) in space, to approximately Air Mass 1.5 on Earth. Multiplying the spectral differences by the <b>quantum</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the solar cell in question yields the efficiency. Terrestrial efficiencies typically are greater than space efficiencies. For example, a silicon solar cell in space might have an efficiency of 14% at AM0, but 16% on earth at AM 1.5. Note, however, that the number of incident photons in space is considerably larger, so the solar cell might produce considerably more power in space, despite the lower efficiency as indicated by reduced percentage of the total incident energy captured.|$|E

Oxidation of the cesium to cesium oxide in later versions improved the sensitivity {{in a similar way}} to third generation photocathodes. The same technology that produced the fiber optic bundles that allowed the creation of cascade tubes, allowed, with a slight change in manufacturing, the production of micro-channel plates, or MCPs. The micro-channel plate is a thin glass wafer with a Nichrome electrode on either side across which a large potential difference of up to 1,000 volts is applied.|$|E
