The paper proposes a query language extension for constraining <b>data</b> <b>quality</b> when querying both data and its associated QoD metadata.

In areas where good <b>quality</b> <b>data</b> is available, the intensity and height of a flood can be predicted with fairly good accuracy and plenty of lead time. The output of a flood forecast is typically a maximum expected water level and the likely time of its arrival at key locations along a waterway, and it also may allow for the computation of the likely statistical return period of a flood. In many developed countries, urban areas at risk of flooding are protected against a 100-year flood – that is a flood that has a probability of around 63% of occurring in any 100-year period of time.|$|E
