40|$|After {{years of}} {{relative}} obscurity, the International Atomic Energy Agency {{has received a}} lot of public attention over the past decade. International political discourse – and journalistic coverage thereof – portray the IAEA as the most authoritative judge of a nation's ability to produce atomic weapons. In this discourse, the agency's impartiality is guaranteed both by the technical <b>qualifications</b> <b>of</b> its <b>inspectors</b> and the diversity of their national origins. The verdict <b>of</b> IAEA weapons <b>inspectors</b> determines whether the nation under scrutiny has become a "rogue state " or whether it has remained within the bounds of acceptable technopolitical behavior. When the United States ignored IAEA findings about Iraq's nuclear weapons capabilities, international protest grounded itself in results of the IAEA inspections process to insist on the failure (or fabrication) of US "intelligence " and the illegitimacy of its war efforts. At least symbolically, most political leaders treat the IAEA as ultimate arbiter of global nuclearity, notwithstanding the agency's inability to temper bellicose behavior – be it of the world's most powerful nation, or of the world's worst pariahs. A complex, historical explanation for the IAEA's failure to control the spread of nuclear weapons would require a volume unto itself, an endeavor attempted by some international relations experts. 1 Although they vary in their approach, these scholars all frame their work i...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a concise {{overview}} of the problem of building decay in Hong Kong, the current government measures concerning dilapidated buildings and the latest development and implementation of the mandatory building inspection scheme (MBIS). A comparison of various MBISs from other jurisdictions of the world is also given. Design/methodology/approach – A desktop study of building inspection procedures, repair and maintenance policies was carried out, followed by an industry-wide opinion survey conducted by means of self-administered questionnaires. Target respondents are within the construction community of Hong Kong. The perceived benefits, potential difficulties and insightful recommendations or good practices are investigated. A comparison of the relative ranking of individual mean scores from various groups of respondents is presented in this paper. Findings – The execution of MBIS was found to be effective in enhancing public awareness of the importance of building upkeep and recognition of the property owner's legal responsibilities in this respect. Private property owners were made aware of the necessity to take holistic preventive measures to maintain the overall safety of their own buildings. A comparison of MBIS with other similar MBISs across different cities, revealed similarities as regards the inspection cycle, scope <b>of</b> inspection and <b>qualifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>inspectors.</b> The main difference related to the age rather than the height of target buildings. Practical implications – Proper inspection and maintenance is necessary to keep buildings in good condition to avoid injury or loss of life due to sudden collapse of structures or their elements such as concrete spalling and fall of window frames. The official launch of MBIS on 30 June 2012 is one of the proposed effective measures to resolve the long-standing problems of building neglect and deterioration in Hong Kong with particular regard to the existing old private premises. Originality/value – The execution of MBIS should be useful in improving the safety and health status of the dilapidated premises and in so doing safeguarding the residents and general public. To further identify the perceived benefits and potential difficulties of MBIS, and to suggest insightful recommendations or good practices for its successful future implementation, an opinion survey was launched among construction practitioners in Hong Kong between March and April of 2012.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the quality of}} the continuing training and vocational education for the construction inspector job and the harmonized European recognition <b>of</b> this <b>qualification.</b> It {{is the result of a}} survey realized in 5 EU countries (Greece, Hungary, Poland, Portugal and Romania) within the fame of the project entitled “Analysis and Comparative Study on construction inspection job performance regulations. European comparative study – KNOWLEDGE”. The general objective was to give recommendations for improving the <b>qualification</b> <b>of</b> civil construction <b>inspectors</b> by identifying the gap between the existing vocational education / training systems, and people/companies’ expectations and needs, as resulted from current literature, in-depth interviews and questionnaire surveys. The conclusions are related to the necessity of developing a training/certification program for the construction inspector, the magnitude and European dimension of such training and certification program, and the thematic areas that the program will cover to meet the construction industry requirements. Courses approaching New Construction Materials, Quality Control Procedures, Legislation on Town Planning, Private Constructions and Public Works, Legislation on Safety Issues in the Construction Industry, and the EU directives were identified as being necessary for updating the knowledge <b>of</b> the construction <b>inspectors.</b> Relevant graphs presenting the continuing training needs <b>of</b> the construction <b>inspectors</b> resulted from the in-depth interviews are presented.

Qualification to obtain QEI certification includes extensive previous experience {{in the field of}} elevators (and other conveyances), experience working as an inspector and passing a comprehensive written examination. An application {{is available}} from the National Association of Elevator Safety Authorities, maintaining current certification that includes meeting standards for continuing education, required to be renewed annually. The qualifications for QEI Inspectors and QEIS (inspector supervisors) and Certifying Organizations and performance standards for inspectors {{can be found in the}} ASME standard QEI-1 Standard for the <b>Qualification</b> <b>of</b> Elevators and <b>Inspectors.</b> Inspectors are required by the ASME standards to avoid situations that are considered unethical, such as conflicts of interest that include performing or witnessing inspections and test on conveyances that they or their employer have financial interest in. Inspections are performed using the ASME A17.2 Guide for Inspection of Elevators, Escalators and Moving Walks as well as other relevant reference standards and local building codes. In most cases, inspectors are required to verify that conveyances meet the standards that they were originally installed under, however some jurisdictions may require conveyances that meet more current standards, including US federal authorities that often require conveyances meeting the minimum standards of the ASME A17.3 Safety Code for Existing Elevators and Escalators. Additionally, all conveyances are required to meet current safety standards for maintenance and inspection regardless of the date of original installation.|$|R

50|$|While the IG Act of 1978 {{requires}} that inspectors general be selected {{based upon their}} qualifications and not political affiliation, presidentially appointed inspectors general are considered political appointees and are often selected, if only in part {{and in addition to}} their <b>qualifications,</b> because <b>of</b> their political relationships and party affiliation. An example of the role political affiliation plays in the selection <b>of</b> an <b>inspector</b> general, and the resulting pitfalls, {{can be seen in the}} 2001 Republican appointment (and resignation under fire) of Janet Rehnquist (daughter of former Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist) to the post <b>of</b> <b>inspector</b> general for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.|$|R
