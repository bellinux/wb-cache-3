2500|$|The next hunting {{method is}} the “contour flight with short glide attack”, which is {{considered}} the most commonly utilized hunting method for golden eagles. This consists of a low-level <b>quartering</b> <b>flight</b> often at only [...] above the ground so they do not break the sky-line when observed {{from the ground and}} they can hug the contours of the earth below. This method is useful for hunting colonial (often burrowing) prey such as ground squirrels, densely populated leporids or birds found in concentrations, such as breeding grouse or even seabirds. The individual prey item is apparently selected in a manner of seconds before the strike. If the first attempt fails, the eagle may fly around and attempt to ambush the prey again.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} 10 years of {{constant}} {{observation of the}} population from the Matobo Hills, only two kills were witnessed. However, enough hunting behavior has been ultimately observed to give a good idea how a Verreaux's eagle obtains its prey. This species most often forages in low-level <b>quartering</b> <b>flight,</b> with the rock hyraxes chiefly caught after a rapid, somewhat twisting dive in the few seconds after the eagle “surprises” the hyrax. Like the golden eagle, Verreaux's eagle uses natural contours of the ground in rocky and mountainous habitats to increase the element of surprise, as hyraxes (appropriately considering their diverse range of predators) tend to be highly wary. Verreaux's eagle {{have been known to}} hunt from a perch, which, although not abnormal, is certainly rare. [...] Hunting hyrax cooperatively has been recorded, with one eagle of a pair flying past and distracting the prey while the other strikes from behind. Verreaux's eagle may knock hyraxes off cliffs and take arboreal prey from treetops but usually kills on the ground. The daily estimate food requirements of this species are around 350 g, nearly a third more than that of a golden eagle despite the latter’s marginally heavier body weight. Rock hyraxes are often difficult to observe other than a quick flash for humans, but a Verreaux's eagle can fly out and then return to the nest with a kill in the matter of a few minutes.|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} restrictions {{placed on}} helicopter noise levels over recent decades have encouraged manufacturers {{to better understand}} tail rotor noise and its aerodynamic sources. A generic single main rotor and tail rotor helicopter has been simulated in high speed forward, and <b>quartering,</b> <b>flight</b> using the Vorticity Transport Model. The unsteady loads developed on the tail rotor blades and the resulting acoustic noise propagation have been computed. The sound propagation from isolated tail rotors with top-aft and top-forward senses of rotation in high speed forward flight results in impulsive sound being directed downward from the former and upward from the latter. The principal source of tail rotor noise in high speed forward flight is a periodic blade-vortex interaction between the tail rotor blades. The effect of aerodynamic interaction on tail rotor noise is highly dependent on the flight speed and trajectory, such that the noise produced {{as a result of}} interaction is, for the particular helicopter geometry simulated here, greater in <b>quartering</b> <b>flight</b> than in high speed forward flight. The sound pressure produced by periodic impulsive loads in high speed forward flight and the high frequency sound generated in <b>quartering</b> <b>flight</b> is sensitive to the scales to which the vortical features within the wake, and the radial and azimuthal distributions of blade loading, are resolved...|$|E

40|$|A semi-empirical and physics-based {{analytical}} {{formulation of}} the induced velocities generated by the fuselage shell of the Bo 105 wind tunnel model in the volume around the rotor is derived from velocity data computed by a panel code. The reduced-order analytical model is several orders of magnitude faster than the panel code and thus is predestinated for use in comprehensive rotor codes. Angle of attacks investigated include vertical descent, shallow descent, level flight and climb to vertical ascent. Side-slip angles range from forward to <b>quartering</b> <b>flight.</b> The analytical induced velocity model can be directly used {{to account for the}} inflow at the blade elements and also allows for analytical or numerical integration of rotor wake convection to compute the associated displacements of rotor blade tip vortices travelling downstream within this velocity field. This model will be used to replace a fully panelized fuselage (and thus significantly reduce the computational effort) throughout a simulation with an aeromechanics code to account for the influence of the fuselage (e. g., in a design stage). The usage within an aerodynamics code (e. g., a panel code) reduces the panelization to the rotor blades only, leaving the computation of the fuselage-induced velocities to the model. The focus of this paper is the analytical evaluation of fuselage–rotor interference in side-slip angles on rotor trim controls, using blade element momentum theory. The results are compared to the influence of thrust-induced inflow gradients on rotor trim...|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic {{interference}} {{between the}} main and tail rotor {{can have a}} strong negative influence on the flight mechanics of a conventional helicopter. Significant unsteadiness in the tail rotor loading is encountered under certain flight conditions, but {{the character of the}} unsteadiness can depend on the direction of rotation of the tail rotor. Numerical simulations, using Brown’s vorticity transport model, of the aerodynamic interaction between the main and tail rotors of a helicopter are presented for a range of forward and lateral flight trajectories. Distinct differences are predicted in the behavior of the system in left and right sideward flight that are consistent with flight experience that the greatest fluctuations in loading or control input are required in left sideways flight (for a counterclockwise rotating main rotor). These fluctuations are generally more extreme for a system with tail rotor rotating top-forward than top-aft. Differences are also exposed in the character of the lateral excitation of the system as forward flight speed is varied. The observed behavior appears to originate in the disruption of the tail rotor wake that is induced by its entrainment into the wake of the main rotor. The extent of the disruption is dependent on flight condition, and the unsteadiness of the process depends on the direction of rotation of the tail rotor. In intermediate-speed forward flight and right sideward flight, the free stream delays the entrainment of the tail rotor wake far enough downstream for the perturbations to the rotor loading to be slight. Conversely, in left sideward and <b>quartering</b> <b>flight,</b> the free stream confines the entrainment process close to the rotors, where it causes significant unsteadiness in the loads produced by the system...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} 40 years many {{helicopters}} have suffered {{adverse effects on}} their performance and handling qualities {{as a result of}} various forms of aerodynamic interaction. These problems have tended to become apparent only after a substantial amount of development work has been performed and flight testing has commenced, leading to expensive re-designs. Aerodynamic interaction between the main rotor and stabiliser leads to pitch-up in low speed forward. flight, whilst interaction between the main rotor and tail rotor in a conventional helicopter is known to strongly influence the performance of the tail rotor. Consequently, poor handling qualities in response to loss of tail rotor effectiveness and dynamic characteristics such as tail shake can emerge. The capability of an advanced numerical model for the simulation of rotorcraft flows, the Vorticity Transport Model, has been demonstrated by investigating the circumstances in which these interactions occur, and used to expose some of the underlying fluid dynamic mechanisms. This dissertation shows that the origin of pitch-up lies in the impingement of the main rotor wake on the stabiliser of a helicopter, and that the characteristic pitch and roll moments on the vehicle are dependent on the helicopter geometry and the angle of sideslip. The characteristic effects of main rotor - tail rotor interaction are also a function of helicopter geometry, but are highly dependent on the flight trajectory and are sensitive to the sense of rotation of the tail rotor. In forward flight with a high angle of sideslip, the predominant effect is to change the steady thrust developed by the tail rotor. This is caused by a modification of the velocity field at the tailÃƒ?Ã‚?Ãƒ?Ã‚Â· rotor which benefits tail rotors with a top-aft sense of rotation. In aft <b>quartering</b> <b>flight,</b> the predominant effect is of substantial unsteadiness in tail rotor performance, which is greater for a top-forward tail rotor, and is related to the dynamics of the helicopter wake.
