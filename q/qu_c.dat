Kernel-Based Fuzzy-Rough Nearest Neighbour Classification, Proceedings of the 20 th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (Fuzz-IEEE 2011), pp. 1523 - 1529, 2011 Fuzzy-rough sets play an {{important}} role in dealing with imprecision and uncertainty for discrete and real-valued or noisy data. However, there are some problems associated with the approach from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. These problems have motivated the hybridisation of fuzzy-rough sets with kernel methods. Existing work which hybridises fuzzy-rough sets and kernel methods employs a constraint that enforces the transitivity of the fuzzy $T$-norm operation. In this paper, such a constraint is relaxed and a new kernel-based fuzzy-rough set approach is introduced. Based on this, novel kernel-based fuzzy-rough nearest-neighbour algorithms are proposed. The work is supported by experimental evaluation, which shows that the new kernel-based methods offer improvements over the existing fuzzy-rough nearest neighbour classifiers. Non peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFolding of porin-like β-barrel outer {{membrane}} proteins can {{be achieved}} {{in the presence of}} phospholipid vesicles, and takes place concurrently with incorporation into the membrane. The pronounced dependence found for the insertion of the protein OmpA on membrane thickness (Kleinschmidt, J. H., and L. K. Tamm. 2002. J. Mol. Biol. 324 : 319 – 330) is analyzed in terms of the effects of out-of-plane elastic fluctuations on the area dilation modulus (Evans, E., and W. Rawicz. 1990. Phys. Rev. Lett. 64 : 2094 – 2097). For unstrained large unilamellar vesicles, the elastic free energy for membrane insertion is predicted to depend on the fourth power of the membrane thickness. The influence of thermally induced bending fluctuations on the effective tilt of the OmpA β-barrel in disaturated phosphatidylcholine membranes of different thicknesses (Ramakrishnan, M., J. <b>Qu,</b> <b>C.</b> L.

International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{evidence}} for a role of tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and body mass index (BMI) in the etiology of small intestine cancer is based mainly on case-control studies from Europe and United States. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We harmonized the data across 12 cohort studies from mainland China, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, comprising over 500, 000 subjects followed {{for an average of}} 10. 6 years. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for BMI and (only among men) tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking. RESULTS: A total of 134 incident cases were observed (49 adenocarcinoma, 11 carcinoid, 46 other histologic types, and 28 of unknown histology). There was a statistically non-significant trend toward increased HR in subjects with high BMI [HR for BMI> 27. 5 kg/m 2, compared with 22. 6 - 25. 0, 1. 50; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 76 - 2. 96]. No association was suggested for tobacco smoking; men drinking> 400 g of ethanol per week had an HR of 1. 57 (95 % CI 0. 66 - 3. 70), compared with abstainers. CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the hypothesis that elevated BMI may be a risk factor for small intestine cancer. An etiologic role of alcohol drinking was suggested. Our results reinforce the existing evidence that the epidemiology of small intestine cancer resembles that of colorectal cancer...|$|E

40|$|We analyze lepton flavor violating τ → µγ and µ → eγ {{processes}} in SUSY GUT {{model in which}} sfermions have special mass spectrum. It is assumed that only third generation sfermions which are contained in 10 (<b>Q,U</b> c,E <b>c)</b> of SU(5) can have a different mass from the others. This mass spectrum is led from E 6 GUT model with horizontal symmetries. It is shown that branching ratios of τ → µγ and µ → eγ depend strongly on a right-handed stau mass. The weak scale stability requires the light stau, so large decay rates can be expected in this scenario. When stau is around 150 GeV and tan β ∼ 10, the branching ratios can be larger than Br(τ → µγ) ≃ 10 − 8 and Br(µ → eγ) ≃ 5 × 10 − 12, which are within reach of future experiments.

The mixing was efficient, and we constructed kinetics in the 0. 15 – 2. 1 -ms time range by plotting the continuous wave EPR signal taken during flow versus the reciprocal of flow velocity. We followed the refolding kinetics of iso- 1 -cytochrome c spin-labeled at Cysteine 102. At 20 °C, upon dilution of guanidinium hydrochloride denaturant, a fast phase of refolding was resolved with an exponential time constant of 0. 12 ms, which was consistent with the “burst” phase observed by optically detected flow techniques.

2500|$|The rich {{tradition}} of Chinese poetry began with two influential collections. In northern China, the Shijing or Classic of Poetry (approx. 10th-7th century BC) comprises over 300 poems {{in a variety}} of styles ranging from those with a strong suggestion of folk music to ceremonial hymns. The word shi has the basic meaning of poem or poetry, as well as its use in criticism to describe one of China's lyrical poetic genres. Confucius is traditionally credited with editing the Shijing. Its stately verses are usually composed of couplets with lines of four characters each (or four syllables, as Chinese characters are monosyllabic), and a formal structure of end rhymes. Many of these early poems establish the later {{tradition of}} starting with a description of nature that leads into emotionally expressive statements, known as bi, xing, or sometime bixing. Associated with what was then considered to be southern China, the Chuci is ascribed to <b>Qu</b> Yuan (<b>c.</b> 340-278 BC) and his follower Song Yu (fl. 3rd century BC) and is distinguished by its more emotionally intense affect, often full of despair and descriptions of the fantastic. In some of its sections, the Chu Ci [...] uses a six-character per line meter, dividing these lines into couplets separated in the middle by a strong caesura, producing a driving and dramatic rhythm. Both the Shijing and the Chuci have remained influential throughout Chinese history.|$|R

5000|$|Van Gulik (1967:33) {{suggests}} that Chinese yuan [...] "gibbon" [...] was a loanword from {{the language of}} Chu, the southernmost state of the Zhou realm. <b>Qu</b> Yuan's (<b>c.</b> 3rd-century) Chuci uses the term yuanyou 猿狖 three times (in Nine Pieces); for instance (tr.

[...] This text also uses yuan 猿 once (Nine Songs), yuan 蝯 once (in Nine Laments), and houyuan 猴猿 once (in Nine Longings).

[...] You 狖 was (Van Gulik 1967:31) a Zhou synonym for [...] "gibbon".During the first centuries of our era, the binoms naoyuan or yuannao were superseded as words for [...] "gibbon" [...] by the single term yuan 猨, written with the classifier [...] "quadruped" [...] instead of that for [...] "insect" [...] 虫; and one prefers the phonetic 袁 to 爰 (rarely 員). This character yuan 猿 has remained the exclusive term for the Hylobatidae as long as the Chinese in general were familiar with the gibbon. However, when {{in the course of the}} centuries more and more mountainous regions were brought under cultivation, and as the deforestation increased accordingly, the habitat of the gibbon shrank to the less accessible mountain forests in the south and south-west, and the Chinese had few opportunities for seeing actual specimens. Until about the 14th century A.D. one may assume with confidence that when a Chinese writer employs the word yuan 猿, he means indeed a gibbon.

At present, there is no effective treatment for this abnormality. In the current study, we established an ex vivo conjunctival squamous metaplasia model by culturing human conjunctival tissues at an air-liquid interface for durations of up to 12 days. We then investigated the effects of amniotic membrane (AM) on squamous metaplasia through coculture of conjunctival tissues with AM or AM extract. We found that metaplasia features such as hyperproliferation and abnormal epidermal differentiation of conjunctival epithelium could be inhibited by AM or its extract. In addition, existing squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelium could be reversed to a nearly normal phenotype by AM. The mechanism by which AM prevents squamous metaplasia may involve downregulation of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Wnt signaling pathways, which were activated in conjunctival explants cultured with an airlift technique. In conclusion, AM can inhibit and reverse squamous metaplasia of conjunctival epithelium. This finding may shed new light on prevention and treatment of diseases that involve epithelial squamous metaplasia...|$|R
