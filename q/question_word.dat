5|$|Questions can {{be formed}} {{in several ways}} in Nafaanra. Basic yes–no {{questions}} are constructed by adding a sentence-final question marker rá. Constituent questions (sometimes called Wh-questions or <b>question</b> <b>word</b> questions) are doubly marked. They contain a sentence-initial <b>question</b> <b>word</b> and are marked with a sentence-final question marker hin.|$|E

25|$|The {{acquisition}} of non-manual features follows an interesting pattern: When {{a word that}} always has a particular non-manual feature associated with it (such as a wh- <b>question</b> <b>word)</b> is learned, the non-manual aspects {{are attached to the}} word but don’t have the flexibility associated with adult use. At a certain point, the non-manual features are dropped and the word is produced with no facial expression. After a few months, the non-manuals reappear, this time being used the way adult signers would use them.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} adequate framework to describe <b>question</b> <b>words.</b> On {{the basis of this}} framework some universal tendencies within the constructions of <b>question</b> <b>words</b> will be established and some new insights will be exposed. Through the analysis of the <b>question</b> <b>words</b> of several languages an implicational hierarchy of the semantic categories of <b>question</b> <b>words</b> will be postulated. Furthermore, it will become clear that general <b>question</b> <b>words</b> need to be treated differently from <b>question</b> <b>words</b> which have a specified meaning regardless of the context. When looking at the internal constructions of <b>question</b> <b>words,</b> I conclude that all <b>question</b> <b>words</b> consist of a Q-element (QE), which indicates the interrogative mood and a Semantic Indicator Element (SIE), which specifies the exact content of the interrogative mood. The order of these two elements appears to be similar to the order of the head and dependent of nominal constructions. Finally I discuss the fact that this division between QE and SIE is also to be found in sign languages, and therefore universally applicable. Also, from a historical point of view the order of QE and SIE within submorphemes can be an indication of the head and dependent order in Proto-languages...|$|R
