40|$|The {{dependency}} {{of electricity}} is constantly increasing in today’s society. It is therefore {{important that the}} <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> electricity is reliable. The reliability of the electricity {{can be defined as}} the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply.</b> In order to ensure that the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply</b> is good, it is regulated with for example guaranteed standards that are defined by regulatory authorities. Electricity customers that are sensitive to disturbances in the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> electricity might, however, be interested in a customized <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply.</b> A regulatory tool used to meet individual customers <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply</b> needs, is a premium quality contract. A premium quality contract is an agreement between a network operator and a customer that requests customized <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply.</b> The customer pays the network operator for the contract, and the network operator compensates the customer in case the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply</b> that is specified in the contract is not supplied. This master thesis aims to investigate the applicability <b>of</b> premium <b>quality</b> contracts in Sweden. Studying the use <b>of</b> premium <b>quality</b> contracts internationally, and Swedish energy market actors’ views <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply</b> and implementing premium quality contracts in Sweden will investigate this purpose. The participating actors in Sweden are DSOs, industries and the regulatory authority. The conclusions of the study are that premium quality contracts are applicable in Sweden. This, since higher <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply,</b> than the guaranteed standards, is requested by the participating industries. The DSOs are also, in principal, willing to enter a contract and discuss the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> electricity <b>supply</b> problems with its customers. However, the DSOs are not sure if the standards that are requested by the customers can be guaranteed. It is also concluded that regulations would facilitate the implementing <b>of</b> premium <b>quality</b> contracts, and {{that it is possible to}} introduce such regulations in the Swedish regulatory system. Other alternatives of changes in the quality regulation that possibly could satisfy the customers and the DSOs are also discussed. The alternatives discussed are, defining good quality for different kind of customers, include power quality specifications in the connection agreement or keep the regulations as they are today without any further operations. If premium quality contracts or any of the other alternatives is most suitable in Sweden, has to be studied further. ...|$|R

Under the Rural Kerosine Distribution Improvement Program, the ministry financed the fabrication and distribution of 700 kerosene tanks for each of the country's 110 districts. The ministry distributed televisions and installed solar panels in 160 Junior High Schools in all ten regions of Ghana to enable school children in rural communities to watch the weekly Presidents Special Initiative on Distance Learning Program while in school.

50|$|Following complaints, a Royal {{commission}} {{was set up}} in 1827 to investigate the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> The commission found that the water was of poor quality and cleanliness, and was in need of improvement. A select committee endorsed this view in 1828 and recommended that a scheme should be devised by Thomas Telford, to supply the whole metropolis with clean water. Telford reported in 1834, and despite several outbreaks of cholera, little action was taken until the Metropolis Water Act 1852 introduced regulation of the supply companies; including minimum standards of water quality for the first time. A further Royal commission reported in 1869 and recommended that the supply should be taken into public management. The Metropolis Water Act 1871 introduced further regulation, but fell short of taking the supply into public control. In the meantime the corporations of major provincial towns such as Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds began operating their own municipal supplies. The Metropolitan Board of Works promoted several unsuccessful bills between 1878 and 1886 which would have allowed them to offer a municipal water supply; with a further eight bills promoted by the London County Council in 1895. During the course of a further series of commissions, set against the backdrop of continuing supply problems, the county councils of Middlesex, Essex, Kent and Surrey indicated they would not accept any scheme which allowed the London County Council authority over their areas in respect of water supply. It was therefore decided that the Metropolitan Water Bill would create an entirely new body to supply water to the greater London area.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Based on the {{regulation}} of grid fees and the regulatory requirements on the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> grid operators attempt to find an optimal balance between costs and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> One main aspect of the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is the non-availability of supply, which strongly depends on {{the duration of the}} re-supply process and therefore on the availability of resources. Consequently, grid operators need to analyze the relation between a certain configuration of resources and the corresponding costs and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> Focusing on the re-supply process in medium- and lowvoltage grids, this paper presents a detailed grid operation model which allows to quantify this relation. Depending on legal, regulatory or strategic requirements, this model allows to evaluate and compare different configurations of resources and the resulting <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|E
40|$|The causal {{relationship}} between tourist demand and supply is investigated employing four time series models - {{the first model}} includes nights of stay and number <b>of</b> <b>supplied</b> accommodation; the second model uses nights <b>of</b> stay and <b>supplied</b> beds (i. e. capacity); the third model employs nights of stay and the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplied</b> accommodation; finally, the fourth model includes nights of stay and the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supplied</b> capacity. To test for Granger causality {{in the presence of}} a cointegration relationship between the economic variables of interest, a bivariate VAR model is used. Empirical results are from four distinctive models for Sardinia (Italy) over the time span 1955 to 2004. The first model suggests a unidirectional {{causal relationship}} running from demand to accommodation firms; the second model suggests a bi-directional causal relationship between demand and capacity. The third and fourth models indicate the existence of a unidirectional causal relationship running from quality to demand. This empirical finding implies that the environmental conservation policy (Piano Paesaggistico Regionale), adopted by the Region of Sardinia, may be feasible without compromising the number of tourists visiting Sardinia and hence, its economic growth. tourist demand, supply, quality, growth, granger causality...|$|R

40|$|Regulatory {{regimes that}} put focus on {{performance}} rather than {{looking at the}} actual costs of the distribution system operators (DSOs) create strong cost-cutting incentives, and to avoid system reliability deterioration the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is most often a feature in the performance yardstick. This has raised the stakes due to quality and consequently increased the interest that the DSOs have regarding their <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> As in many European countries, this is the scenario in Sweden. As a tool to value the DSOs’ performance the Swedish regulator uses the Network Performance Assessment Model (NPAM), which is a reference network model. Since the direct link between the DSOs ’ costs and income is weak, the costcutting incentives are rather strong, thus the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> features within the regulation makes a significant contribution in the performance yardstick. This have resulted in that now the distribution system operators can be penalized due to poor <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> which means that greater effort is now put into analysing and evaluation their quality performance.
