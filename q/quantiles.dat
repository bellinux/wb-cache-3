We further extend our partial <b>quantile</b> covariance techniques to functional composite <b>quantile</b> regression (CQR) defining partial composite <b>quantile</b> covariance. There are three major contributions. (1) We define partial <b>quantile</b> covariance between two scalar variables through linear <b>quantile</b> regression. We compute PQR basis by sequentially maximizing the partial <b>quantile</b> covariance between the response and projections of functional covariates. (2) In order to efficiently extract PQR basis, we develop a SIMPQR algorithm analogous to simple partial least squares (SIMPLS).

A <b>quantile</b> empirical-likelihood-based method is proposed firstly {{to study a}} <b>quantile</b> {{linear regression}} model with response data missing at random. It follows that a class of <b>quantile</b> empirical log-likelihood ratios including <b>quantile</b> empirical likelihood ratio with complete-case data, weighted <b>quantile</b> empirical likelihood ratio and imputed <b>quantile</b> empirical likelihood ratio are defined for the regression parameters. Then, a bias-corrected <b>quantile</b> empirical log-likelihood ratio is constructed for {{the mean of the}} response variable for a given <b>quantile</b> level. It is proved that these <b>quantile</b> empirical log-likelihood ratios are asymptotically χ 2 distribution. Furthermore, a class of estimators for the regression parameters and the mean of the response variable are constructed, and the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators is established. Our results can be used directly to construct the confidence intervals (regions) of the regression parameters and the mean of the response variable.

In most cases, the loss functions used in machine learning assume symmetric noise models, and seek to estimate the unknown function parameters. However, loss functions such as <b>quantile</b> and <b>quantile</b> Huber generalize the symmetric ℓ_ 1 and Huber losses to the asymmetric setting, for a fixed <b>quantile</b> parameter. In this paper, we propose to jointly infer the <b>quantile</b> parameter and the unknown function parameters, for the asymmetric <b>quantile</b> Huber and <b>quantile</b> losses. We explore various properties of the <b>quantile</b> Huber loss and implement a convexity certificate {{that can be used}} to check convexity in the <b>quantile</b> parameter.

Results with synthetic and real data demonstrate that the proposed approach can automatically recover the <b>quantile</b> parameter corresponding to the noise and also provide an improved recovery of function parameters.
