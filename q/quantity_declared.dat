40|$|Abstract. The {{theory of}} plane, elastic trusses is reconsidered from the {{viewpoint}} of the continuum theory of elastic media. A main difference between continuum and discrete theories is the following: In the continuous case all <b>quantities</b> are <b>declared</b> throughout the whole body, whereas in the discrete case each quantity has its own “carrier”. In a truss, for instance, displacements and applied forces are declared in the nodes while strain and stress live in the members of the truss. The paper deals with the proper formulation of compatibility conditions for a truss. They are derived along the same lines as St. -Venant’s compatibility conditions of plane elasticity, i. e. by stipulating that Cesàro’s integrals are path independent. Compatibility conditions can be formulated at each inner node of a truss, and they relate the strains of all members which constitute the rosette surrounding the inner node. 1. Continuous and discrete elastic systems Continuum theories are usually developed from physical models that are discrete in nature. A continuous distribution of dislocations, for instance, would hardly be conceivable, if we had no...|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} sources of anthropic Hg is {{metallic}} Hg {{which is used to}} amalgamate gold in gold mining processes. In 2005, in French Guiana, the gold production came for a quarter from primary gold ores (for 4 extraction sites only) and three quarters from alluvial placer deposits. At this time all mining techniques used Hg in the process (since 01 / 01 / 2006 the use of Hg is banned in France). Picot et al. (1993) estimated a Hg/Au ratio of 1.37. Using this ratio and the <b>quantity</b> of gold <b>declared</b> in 2005, the total losses of Hg can be estimated to be around 286  T in French Guiana.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: When {{building}} materials are {{in contact with}} indoor air they have some effect to moderate the variations of indoor humidity in occupied buildings. But so far {{there has been a}} lack of a standardized quantity to characterize the moisture buffering capability of materials. It has been the objective of a recent Nordic project to define such a <b>quantity,</b> and to <b>declare</b> it {{in the form of a}} NORDTEST method. The Moisture Buffer Value is the figure that has been developed in the project as a way to appraise the moisture buffer effect of materials, and the value is described in the paper. Also explained is a test protocol which expresses how materials should be tested for determination of their Moisture Buffer Value. Finally, the paper presents some of the results of a Round Robin Test on various typical {{building materials}} that has been carried out in the project...|$|R

Open access to the transmission system places {{an emphasis on the}} intensive use interconnected network reliably, which requires knowledge of the network capability. Available Transfer Capability (ATC) {{is a measure of the}} remaining power transfer capability of the transmission network for further transactions. Available transfer capability in the transmission network has become essential <b>quantity</b> to be <b>declared</b> well in advance for its commercial use in a competitive electricity market. The assessment of ATC using AC Power transfer distribution factors (AC PTDFs) based approach has been used for single and simultaneous transactions using power transfer sensitivity and jacobian calculated with N-R method. The AC PTDFs are derived using sensitivity based approach for the system intact case. A study of ATC determination using AC Power Transfer Distribution Factor (AC PTDF). We predicted the AC PTDF is different for different transactions and ATC is also different with the help of MATLAB Programming. Simultaneous and single transactions have been carried out on IEEE 24 bus RTS for the assessment of ATC.

40|$|The US and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) have {{recently}} <b>declared</b> <b>quantities</b> of weapons materials, including weapons-grade (WG) plutonium, excess to strategic requirements. One {{of the leading}} candidates for the disposition of excess WG plutonium is irradiation in light water reactors (LWRs) as mixed uranium-plutonium oxide (MOX) fuel. A description of the MOX fuel fabrication techniques in worldwide use is presented. A comprehensive examination of the domestic MOX experience in US reactors obtained during the 1960 s, 1970 s, and early 1980 s is also presented. This experience is described by manufacturer and is also categorized by the reactor facility that irradiated the MOX fuel. A limited summary of the international experience with MOX fuels is also presented. A review of MOX fuel and its performance is conducted {{in view of the}} special considerations associated with the disposition of WG plutonium. Based on the available information, it appears that adoption of foreign commercial MOX technology from one of the successful MOX fuel vendors will minimize the technical risks to the overall mission. The conclusion is made that the existing MOX fuel experience base suggests that disposition of excess weapons plutonium through irradiation in LWRs is a technically attractive option...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{validate}} {{a method}} for determining the simvastatin content of compounded capsules, using high performance liquid chromatography. METHODS: Eighteen samples of simvastatin 40 mg capsules from compounding pharmacies in the cities of Sao Paulo, Guarulhos, Sao Bernardo do Campo and Campinas, Southeastern Brazil, prescribed for fictitious patients were assessed. The analyses {{were based on the}} Brazilian Pharmacopoeia and on the high performance liquid chromatography method, optimized and validated in accordance with national and international standards for identification and quantification tests on compounded capsules. RESULTS: The mean weight of the capsules ranged from 70 mg to 316 mg; four samples presented weight variation outside of the specification. The simvastatin content in the capsules was within the specification in 11 samples. In six, the content ranged from 4 % to 87 % of the <b>declared</b> <b>quantity,</b> thereby not complying with the content requirements for the active agent. For one sample, no content or uniformity determinations were performed. In the content uniformity test, 15 samples presented indices of less than 85 %, with relative standard deviations greater than 6 %. Three pharmacies had met the specification in this test. In the dissolution test, eight samples presented unsatisfactory results in the first stage of the test, while the remainder presented inconclusive results. CONCLUSIONS: The method used was shown to be suitable for application to quality control, and it revealed the poor quality of the simvastatin capsules produced by some compounding pharmacies...|$|R
30|$|In the RLMS, {{individual}} {{alcohol consumption}} is self-reported by the respondent {{in the health}} module. In Russia, alcohol consumption is measured in grams instead of litres, so each respondent is asked to declare how many grams of beer, wine, fortified wine, home-made liquor, vodka, and other alcoholic beverages they usually drink per day during the last 30 days. However, only from round XV {{it is possible to}} identify the actual monthly consumption, since respondents have also to declare the days per month they have been drinking. Following Baltagi and Geishecker (2006), these amounts are adjusted for pure alcohol content {{in order to make the}} various types of alcoholic beverages comparable and then summed up to compute total individual alcohol consumption. The weights used are 5 % for the alcohol content of beer, 10 % for wine, 19 % for fortified wine, 45 % for home made liquor, 40 % for vodka, and 20 % for other alcohol. Finally, the alcohol variables included in the equations are computed as the logarithm of grams of total alcohol intake per week, and divided by the body mass index of the person, in order to control for the possibly different impact of similar amounts of alcohol on different sized individuals. As to the possible doubts on the validity of self-reported measures of alcohol consumption, we follow the idea, again found in Baltagi and Geishecker (2006), that self-declared alcohol consumption in Russia should not be under-reported, since there is no social stigma attached to alcohol consumption within the country. Recall errors are still possible, but at least there should not be a clear negative bias in the <b>declared</b> <b>quantities.</b>|$|R

60|$|This {{paragraph}} {{illustrates the}} kind of {{way in which the}} philosopher is tempted to give an air of absoluteness and necessity to empirical generalisations, of which only the approximate truth in the regions hitherto investigated can be guaranteed by the unaided methods of science. It is very often said that the persistence of something or other is a necessary presupposition of all scientific investigation, and this presupposition is then thought to be exemplified in some <b>quantity</b> which physics <b>declares</b> to be constant. There are here, as it seems to me, three distinct errors. First, the detailed scientific investigation of nature does not presuppose any such general laws as its results are found to verify. Apart from particular observations, science need presuppose nothing except the general principles of logic, and these principles are not laws of nature, for they are merely hypothetical, and apply not only to the actual world but to whatever is possible. The second error consists in the identification of a constant quantity with a persistent entity. Energy is a certain function of a physical system, but is not a thing or substance persisting throughout the changes of the system. The same is true of mass, {{in spite of the fact}} that mass has often been defined as quantity of matter. The whole conception of quantity, involving, as it does, numerical measurement based largely upon conventions, is far more artificial, far more an embodiment of mathematical convenience, than is commonly believed by those who philosophise on physics. Thus even if (which I cannot for a moment admit) the persistence of some entity were among the necessary postulates of science, it would be a sheer error to infer from this the constancy of any physical quantity, or the a priori necessity of any such constancy which may be empirically discovered. In the third place, it has become more and more evident with the progress of physics that large generalisations, such as the conservation of energy or mass, are far from certain and are very likely only approximate. Mass, which used to be regarded as the most indubitable of physical quantities, is now generally believed to vary according to velocity, and to be, in fact, a vector quantity which at a given moment is different in different directions. The detailed conclusions deduced from the supposed constancy of mass for such motions as used to be studied in physics will remain very nearly exact, and therefore over the field of the older investigations very little modification of the older results is required. But as soon as such a principle as the conservation of mass or of energy is erected into a universal a priori law, the slightest failure in absolute exactness is fatal, and the whole philosophic structure raised upon this foundation is necessarily ruined. The prudent philosopher, therefore, though he may with advantage study the methods of physics, will be very chary of basing anything upon what happen at the moment to be the most general results apparently obtained by those methods.|$|R
