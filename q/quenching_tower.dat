5000|$|The works was {{situated}} by the dam marking the upper tidal {{limit of the}} river, where Swalwell Juniors F.C. now stands. The CPP which washed and blended the coal prior to the coking process stood at the north-eastern end of the site, along with large storage bunkers. A conveyor fed blended coal from these bunkers into another bunker {{on top of the}} ovens which in turn fed the charging car. The ovens themselves were parallel to the A694, which passes the site, and stood on the area of land now occupied by the two football pitches. There were several railway sidings for both coal and coke between the ovens and the road. The pusher was {{on the opposite side of}} the ovens, and the coke was shoved out on the side nearest the road. The <b>quenching</b> <b>tower</b> was at the north-eastern end of the battery of ovens, near the CPP, and the chimney was at the opposite end. Between the ovens and the river were the power plant with its associated boilers and chimneys, as well as the by-products plant. The latter [...] "scrubbed" [...] the gas produced in the ovens, extracting chemicals such as tar and ammonia, which were piped into storage tanks. The gas was then stored in a tall gas holder to the south-east of the site, near the river.|$|E
50|$|The vast {{majority}} of modern switchers are diesels, but countries with near-total electrification, like Switzerland, use electric switchers. Prior {{to the introduction of}} diesel-electric locomotives, electric shunting locomotives were used to an extent in Great Britain where heavy trains needed to be started on steep gradients. The steeply-graded Quayside Branch in Newcastle upon Tyne was electrified by the North Eastern Railway in 1905, and two steeplecab locomotives were built to handle all traffic on the line. One of these, No. 1, is now part of the National Collection and resides at Locomotion in Shildon. On {{the opposite side of the}} Tyne, the electrified lines owned by the Harton Coal Company in South Shields for the movement of coal and colliery waste to shipping facilities on the river was one of the more extensive industrial networks. A number of the early German locomotives built for use on these lines have been preserved. Electric locomotives were also extensively employed for moving the coke cars at cokeworks, obtaining power from a side wire, as third rail or overhead line electrification would have been impractical. These specialised locomotives were tall steeple-cab types not seen anywhere else, and operated on a short length of track between the ovens and the <b>quenching</b> <b>tower.</b> Despite their ubiquity, very few have survived into preservation as there is very little scope of operating them due to their unique means of obtaining power, slow speed and the fact they greatly exceed the loading gauge of most railway lines. One example built by Greenwood and Batley in Armley, Leeds is preserved at the Middleton Railway, not far from where it was built. Small industrial shunters are sometimes of the battery-electric type. An early battery-electric shunting locomotive is shown here. The Tyne and Wear Metro has three battery electric shunters built by Hunslet, which are used to haul engineering trains when the overhead supply is switched off. Flywheel energy storage was also used experimentally by Sentinel.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the management of wood waste generated after demolition of a typical 33 year old coke <b>quenching</b> <b>tower</b> from an integrated steelworks. Wood in the coke <b>quenching</b> <b>tower</b> was treated with traditional waterborne preservative, Copper-Chromium-Arsenic (CCA). Due to the growing environmental concern, changes were introduced in the legislation governing the disposal of waste. Hence, the aim of the thesis was to perform a waste management study by investigating CCA treated wood waste and to develop a waste disposal technique. During the characterisation of the wood waste, elemental analysis was performed to confirm CCA concentration remaining in the treated wood waste. Concentration of CCA elements ranged from 300 mg/kg to 10, 000 mg/kg. The concentration reduced with increase in the years of service life of the treated wood. Leaching tests according to British Standards were performed for different durations from 1 hour to 1 month to determine the leaching behaviour exhibited by the wood. Standard and customised sampling procedures were carried out for leaching tests to study and simulate the loss of CCA from the treated wood during a quenching process. These tests provided a leaching pattern that the loss of CCA follows a trend of As > Cu > Cr which was in agreement with the final concentrations of the <b>quenching</b> <b>tower</b> wood, such that chromium was most resistant to leaching and arsenic was most susceptible to leach. Correlations and linear equations were established between the arsenic-chromium and arsenic-copper leach concentrations. Equations were developed to help in predicting the ratio of leach ability of the CCA elements with respect to each other. It was also found that the wood from the tower contained a substantial amount of iron which was further investigated. The growth ring analysis showed that iron was mainly deposited on the wood surface. The prime sources of iron were identified to be kish, an air borne particulate matter found in steelworks environment as well as coke and coke ash. Leaching studies performed to determine the leachability of iron showed that there was a potential for iron to restrict the mobility of CCA elements in soil. A novel three-step chemical extraction method was developed after analysing the sequential analysis performed with different chemical reagents and leaching behaviour of the CCA wood waste. Step one used sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to break down the wood structure by lignin depolymerisation. The use of NaOH provided alkaline conditions and facilitated the process of lignin depolymerisation mainly to release arsenic as water soluble compounds. This was followed by ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl) for release of copper, due to the high affinity of ammonium group to form complexes with copper. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used as a strong oxidising agent and primarily to release the chromium by forming chromium complexes which are readily soluble in water. The effect of the pH, temperature, concentration and order of the reagent to be used were studied. Therefore, CCA wood was subjected to the three-step process, where the order was designed as NaOH followed by NH 4 Cl and then H 2 O 2 for 1 hour at 100 oC with 1 M, 2 M and 2 M concentration respectively. 98...|$|E
40|$|Coke plants, {{which produce}} {{various types of}} coke (metallurgical, foundry or heating), at {{temperatures}} between 600 and 1200 °C, with limited access to oxygen, are major emitters of particulates and gaseous pollutants to air, water and soils. Primarily, the process of wet quenching should be mentioned, {{as one of the}} most cumbersome. Atmospheric pollutants include particulates, tar substances, organic pollutants including B(a) P and many others. Pollutants are also formed from the decomposition of water used to quench coke (CO, phenol, HCN, H 2 S, NH 3, cresol) and decomposition of hot coke in the first phase of quenching (CO, H 2 S, SO 2) [1]. The development of the coke oven technology has resulted in the changes made to different types of technological installations, such as the use of baffles in <b>quench</b> <b>towers,</b> the removal of nitrogen oxides by selective NOx reduction, and the introduction of fabric filters for particulates removal. The BAT conclusions for coke plants [2] provide a methodology for the measurement of particulate emission from a wet, low-emission technology using Mohrhauer probes. The conclusions define the emission level for wet quenching process as 25 g/Mgcoke. The conducted research was aimed at verification of the presented method. For two of three <b>quench</b> <b>towers</b> (A and C) the requirements included in the BAT conclusions are not met and emissions amount to 87. 34 and 61. 35 g/Mgcoke respectively. The lowest particulates emission was recorded on the <b>quench</b> <b>tower</b> B and amounted to 22. 5 g/Mgcoke, therefore not exceeding the requirements...|$|R

2500|$|Ethylene is {{produced}} in the petrochemical industry by steam cracking. In this process, gaseous or light liquid hydrocarbons are heated to 750–950°C, inducing numerous free radical reactions followed by immediate quench to stop these reactions. This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated compression and distillation. In a related process used in oil refineries, high molecular weight hydrocarbons are cracked over zeolite catalysts. Heavier feedstocks, such as naphtha and gas oils require at least two [...] "quench towers" [...] downstream of the cracking furnaces to recirculate pyrolysis-derived gasoline and process water. When cracking a mixture of ethane and propane, only one water <b>quench</b> <b>tower</b> is required.|$|R
40|$|Coke oven {{battery is}} complex and {{multifaceted}} facility in terms of air pollutant emissions. As far as stack or <b>quenching</b> <b>tower</b> does not cause major difficulties of emission measurement, the fugitive emission measurement from sources such as battery top elements (charging holes, ascension pipes) or oven doors is still complicated and not fully solved problem. This article presents the discussion concerning main problems and errors likely {{to be made in}} particular stages of procedure of fugitive emissions characterization from coke oven battery (selection of sampling points, sampling itself, measurement of air velocity over battery top and laboratory analyses). In addition, results of concentrations measurements of selected substances characteristic for the coking process (naphthalene, anthracene, 4 PAHs and TSP) originating from fugitive sources of coke oven battery and subjected to reporting under the E-PRTR are presented. The measurements were carried out on coke oven battery top in points {{selected on the basis of}} the preceding detailed air convection velocity measurements over battery top. Results of the velocity measurements were compared with results of numerical modelling using CFD software. The presented material is an attempt to cross-sectional presentation of issues related to the quantitative evaluation of fugitive emission from coke oven battery, discussed on the example of PAHs emission as a group of substances characteristic for coking of coal...|$|E
40|$|Electric {{arc furnace}} (EAF) steel {{manufacturing}} {{is an important}} recycling activity which contributes to the recovery of steel resources and steel scrap/waste minimization. Because {{of the content of}} plastics, coatings and paintings as well as other nonferrous materials in the charge during melting, a strong emission of pollutants, including polluting substance group consists of persistent organic pollutions (POPs) represented by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) occurs. This study was set out to investigate emissions of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDDs/Fs) from the stack of a new electric-arc furnace-dust treatment plant installed during modernisation of the Melt Shop in CMC SISAK d. o. o., Croatia. Obtained results have been compared with previously obtained results of PCDDs/Fs emission measurements from the old electric-arc furnace dust treatment without dust drop-out box, as well as <b>quenching</b> <b>tower.</b> The total PCDDs/Fs concentration in the stack off gases of both electric arc furnaces EAF A and EAF B were 0. 2098 and 0. 022603 ng I-TEQ/Nm 3 respectively, and these results are close to previous obtained results by other authors. The calculated values of the emission factors for PCDDs/Fs calculated on the basis of measured PCDDs/Fs concentration in the stack off gases in 2008 and 2011 were 1. 09 and 0. 22 ng I-TEQ / ton steel, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a project {{funded by the}} Department of Energy, with additional funding from Bechtel National, to develop a copper electrowinning process with lower costs and lower emissions than the current process. This new process also includes more energy efficient production by using catalytic-surfaced anodes and a different electrochemical couple in the electrolyte, providing an alternative oxidation reaction that requires up to 50 % less energy than is currently required to electrowin the same quantity of copper. This alternative anode reaction, which oxidizes ferric ions to ferrous, with subsequent reduction back to ferric using sulfur dioxide, was demonstrated to be technically and operationally feasible. However, pure sulfur dioxide {{was determined to be}} prohibitively expensive and use of a sulfur burner, producing 12 % SO{sub 2 }, was deemed a viable alternative. This alternate, sulfur-burning process requires a sulfur burner, waste heat boiler, <b>quench</b> <b>tower,</b> and reaction towers. The electrolyte containing absorbed SO{sub 2 } passes through activated carbon to regenerate the ferrous ion. Because this reaction produces sulfuric acid, excess acid removal by ion exchange is necessary and produces a low concentration acid suitable for leaching oxide copper minerals. If sulfide minerals are to be leached or the acid unneeded on site, hydrogen was demonstrated to be a potential reductant. Preliminary economics indicate that the process would only be viable if significant credits could be realized for electrical power produced by the sulfur burner and for acid if used for leaching of oxidized copper minerals on site...|$|R
40|$|The Army’s current {{chemical}} weapons (CW) disposal program involves robotic, machine disassembly {{of the chemical}} weapon as appropriate for each specific munition. The various waste materials from disassembly are incinerated separately. These include the chemical agent, explosives and propellants, empty munitions and nonexplosive (storage) containers, and shipping and packing materials (dunnage). Preliminary separation produces individual waste streams that are relatively homogeneous, which makes it feasible to optimize conditions for the incineration of each. To handle the various waste streams produced by disassembly, four different furnace systems are required: Incinerator for the liquid chemical agent and process liquid waste; Rotary kiln furnace {{for the destruction of}} explosives and propellants, with an accompanying heated discharge conveyer to remove leftover materials; Metal parts furnace to decontaminate by incineration the empty bulk containers, shells, and bombs; and Dunnage incinerator for the combustion of waste packaging. The resulting gases and other products of incineration are treated with a variety of modern pollution abatement equipment, including a <b>quench</b> <b>tower,</b> venturi scrubber, scrubber tower, demister, and for the dunnage furnace, a baghouse for removal of particulate. Brine produced by the scrubbers is evaporated, and the resulting salts are packed in drums for eventual landfill. The final products that will require disposal such as landfill are scrap metal, drums of salt, and ash (l). The time required to dispose of the stockpiles at the eight continental U. S. sites after the incinerators begin to work was estimated in the 1988 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to be from 11 months (at Lexington-Blue Grass Arm...|$|R
30|$|Two common {{methods can}} be used to {{mitigate}} red-oil from formation and accumulation: (1) carbonyl traps to reduce the rate of aldol formation [2]; and (2) aromatic solvent washes [1, 4]. Carbonyl traps are often effective in reducing the rate of aldol condensation and in removing aldols through the caustic purges, but they do not suppress the Diels–Alder type oligomerization mechanism. Additional use of dispersants on top of the carbonyl trapping agent (and even a radical scavenger) are thus often proposed by chemical vendors to cover all possible mechanisms, leading to costly treatments [9]. Within our company, the “aromatic solvent washes” option proved to be a very efficient and cheap alternative and was achieved by rerouting a plant stream containing high amounts of aromatic compounds with low unsaturated hydrocarbons content (e.g., a Toluene–Xylene cut: “TX-cut”). This aromatic wash acts as a solvent, which efficiently displaces the oligomeric red-oils from the water phase into the aromatic phase avoiding their further oligomerization and precipitation. Since aromatic solvents are often of commercial value in the industry, a cheaper gasoline stream, i.e. pyrolysis gasoline (PyGas) from the <b>quench</b> water <b>tower</b> (QWT) of the plant, was used instead. This stream contains a high amount of reactive compounds (about of 7  % of indene, styrene, cyclopentadiene,…), which might have the potential of enhancing the mass of red-oil type of fouling through pathways A or C shown in Fig.  1.|$|R
