50|$|For sealings, {{there are}} {{variations}} in cross-section design other than circular. The shape can have different profiles, an x-shaped profile, commonly called the X-ring, Q-ring, {{or by the}} trademarked name <b>Quad</b> <b>Ring.</b> When squeezed upon installation, they seal with 4 contact surfaces—2 small contact surfaces {{on the top and}} bottom. This contrasts with the standard O-ring's comparatively larger single contact surfaces top and bottom. X-rings are most commonly used in reciprocating applications, where they provide reduced running and breakout friction and reduced risk of spiraling when compared to O-rings.|$|E
40|$|Double-negative {{metamaterials}} using cross-polarised split-ring resonators in a microstrip line {{have been}} implemented. The split-ring resonators comprised <b>quad</b> <b>ring</b> structures and were {{connected with the}} microstrip line in series. Four different structures, with the shorted rings in varying locations, were fabricated to demonstrate reconfigurable bandpass characteristics. The effective permittivities and permeabilities were extracted using the Ziolkowski method. Excellent agreement between the developed circuit model and the measurement was observed up to 10 GHz...|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} the U. S. Department of Transportation Specification 7 A Type A (DOT- 7 A) compliance test {{results of the}} 1 -L Liquid Shipper packaging. The 1 -L Liquid Shipper consists of the 3 M SafeSend polyethylene canister base and cap with integral sorbent material, a <b>quad</b> <b>ring</b> gasket, a plastic bag, and six foam inserts. A 1 -L narrow-mouth, Teflon bottle with Tefzel lid holds contents. The inner bottle is placed inside the SafeSend container. The inner bottle content weight cannot exceed 2000 g (4. 4 lb). Total bottle weight, including contents cannot exceed 2167. 5 g (4. 78 lb). The nominal gross weight of the assembled packaging is {{to be no more}} that 3830. 5 g (8. 4 lb). The approved packaging system is designed to ship Type A quantities of radioactive materials, normal form. Contents may be liquid or solid form. Liquid contents may have a specific gravity {{less than or equal to}} (< 2). Solid materials are limited in weight, to include packaging, to the gross weight of the as-tested liquids and bottles...|$|E
40|$|In a {{cellular}} or PCS CDMA handset, power monitoring and gain control {{are provided by}} a Schottky detector diode in the transmit side of the unit. This detector diode must exhibit very good stability or consistency {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Consistency in a Schottky diode can be defined in two ways: 1. Lot-to-lot consistency in key parameters, and 2. Diode-to-diode parameter match, over a wide temperature range, when two or more diodes are put into a single plastic package. Lot-to-lot consistency is important in order to insure good yields in the manufacture of certain high volume products such as cellular handsets. For example, variation in the junction capacitance or detection sensitivity of the diode used in the handset’s AGC circuit can result in handsets being out of spec when diodes from certain lots are used. Parameter match between two or four diodes in a single package is necessary in many applications. For example, port-port isolation and distortion performance in a double balanced mixer is related to {{the degree to which the}} four <b>ring</b> <b>quad</b> diodes are matched. Another example is the differential detector, illustrated in Figure 1. This circuit is used in DC biased detectors to differentiate between the voltage on the detector diode due to DC bias (Vf) and that due to rectification of the RF signal (Vo). The same DC bias is applied to the detector and a second (reference) diode, and a differential amplifier is used to cancel Vf. This circuit will only work if the two diodes are matched, having the same value of Vf at the chosen value of bias current and over the range of operating temperatures. differential amplifie...|$|R
