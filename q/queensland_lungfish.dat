25|$|More than 5000 {{species of}} fish inhabit Australia's waterways; of these, 24% are endemic. However, because of the {{relative}} scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only about 300 species of freshwater fish. Two families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the arowana or bonytongues, and the <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish.</b> The <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> is the most primitive of the lungfish, having evolved before Australia separated from Gondwana. One of the smallest freshwater fish, peculiar to the southwest of Western Australia, is the salamanderfish, which can survive desiccation in the dry season by burrowing into mud. Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae. Apart from the ancient freshwater species, 70% of Australia's freshwater fish have affinities with tropical Indo-Pacific marine species that have adapted to freshwater. These species include freshwater lampreys, herrings, catfish, rainbowfish, and some 50 species of gudgeon, including the sleepy cod. Native freshwater game fish include the barramundi, Murray cod, and golden perch. Two species of endangered freshwater shark {{are found in the}} Northern Territory.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{moderate}} and severe hypoxia on air breathing frequency and respiratory {{properties of the}} blood of the <b>Queensland</b> (Australian) <b>lungfish</b> Neoceratodus forsteri were measured in fish exposed to these conditions for 14 - 22 days at 20 degrees C. Haemoglobin oxygen affinity increased after exposure to moderate hypoxia (PwO 2 = 60 mmHg), but did not increase further after exposure to severe hypoxia (PwO 2 = 40 mmHg). The P 50 of whole blood (20 degrees C, PCO 2 = 16. 0 mmHg) fell from 22. 0 +/- 1. 5 mmHg in normoxic conditions to 19. 0 +/- 1. 0 mmHg in hypoxic conditions. Under both moderate and severe hypoxia, haematocrit, haemoglobin, blood lactate, and erythrocyte phosphate concentrations did not differ from normoxic values. The observed increase in haemoglobin oxygen affinity in response to aquatic hypoxia is typical of compensatory responses seen in obligate water breathers, but smaller. This suggests that the capacity of lungfish to respond to hypoxia by breathing air removes the necessity for further left-shifting of the oxygen equilibrium curve...|$|R
40|$|Lungfish are a relict {{group of}} basal fishes, {{survivors}} of an extensive fossil fauna that {{first appeared in}} the Devonian era. The Australian lungfish Neoceratodus forsteri is the only survivor of this fossil fauna in Australia, and is now confined to only 3 natural environments in southeast Queensland, as well as a few lakes and rivers to which the species has been introduced, all in southeast <b>Queensland.</b> The <b>lungfish</b> is under threat from many aspects of human activity in this highly populated part of the state, notably from conversion of the natural riverine environment into large reservoirs for water conservation where conditions are not ideal for adults or for eggs, embryos and hatchling lungfish. Food in reservoir environments is limited for all stages of the life cycle, and refuges for young fish do not exist because the water level fluctuates, especially in spring when lungfish are spawning. Lack of refuges for small fish has been identified as a possible danger to recruitment of young lungfish to the adult population. Comparison of embryological development between eggs and embryos found in unaltered reaches of the Brisbane River to eggs and embryos from a spawning event in Lake Wivenhoe, where lungfish were trapped when the reservoir was built over the Brisbane River in 1984, suggests that lungfish may face more problems than lack of shelter for the young. None of the material collected from Lake Wivenhoe developed normally, possibly because the level of nutrition for parent fish in this lake was so poor that they were unable to produce viable young.

5000|$|William Hay Caldwell (1859-28 August 1941) was a Scottish zoologist. Attending Cambridge University, he was {{the first}} {{recipient}} of an studentship founded in honour of his supervisor Francis Maitland Balfour, who died in a climbing accident in 1882. Two years after graduating from Cambridge in 1880, Caldwell was appointed Demonstrator in Comparative Anatomy, working for Professor Alfred Newton. In 1884, Caldwell used his studentship, which consisted of [...] "£200 studentship, a £500 grant, the prestige and backing of the Royal Society, and letters of introduction from Newton to travel to Australia" [...] to investigate whether the platypus laid eggs. With the assistance of the local Aborigines, Caldwell set up camp {{on the banks of the}} Burnett River in northern <b>Queensland,</b> hunting for <b>lungfish,</b> echidna, and platypus eggs. After extensive searching assisted by a team of 150 Aborigines, he discovered a few eggs. Mindful of the high cost per word, Caldwell famously but tersely wired London, [...] "Monotremes oviparous, ovum meroblastic." [...] That is, monotremes lay eggs, and the eggs are similar to those of reptiles in that only part of the egg divides as it develops. Caldwell stayed away from the beginning stages of Darwinism and wanted to study evolutionary patterns himself. He believed that patterns of individual development could assist in developing and understanding the process of evolution.|$|R
25|$|Ichthyosaurs had fin-like {{limbs of}} varying {{relative}} length. The standard interpretation is that these, {{together with the}} dorsal fin and tail fin, were used as control surfaces for directional stability, controlling yaw, and for stabilising pitch and roll, rather than propulsion. However, during the 1980s the German paleontologist Jürgen Riess proposed an alternative model. After having studied the flying movement made by the forelimbs of plesiosaurs, he suggested that at least those ichthyosaurs that had long flippers used them for a powerful propulsive stroke, moving them up and down. This would explain the non-degenerated shoulder girdle {{and the evolution of}} the hand bones, whose perfect hydrofoil profile would have been useless if it was not functionally employed. He thought to have discovered modern analogues in the <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> and the Amazon river dolphin, which he presumed also used their long fins for propulsion. Riess expounded upon this hypothesis in a series of articles. This alternative interpretation was generally not adopted by other workers. In 1998, Darren Naish pointed out that the lungfish and the river dolphin actually do not use their fins in this way and that e.g. the modern Humpback whale has very long front flippers, supported by a mosaic of bones, but that these nevertheless mainly serve as rudders. In 2013, a study concluded that broad ichthyosaur flippers, like those of Platyptergygius, were not used for propulsion but as a control surface.|$|E
2500|$|The river travels [...] from Mount Stanley. [...] The {{river is}} dammed by the Wivenhoe Dam, forming Lake Wivenhoe, the main water supply for Brisbane. The {{waterway}} is a habitat for the rare <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish,</b> Brisbane River cod and bull sharks. The largest ship {{built on the}} river was the Robert Miller. The 66,000 tonne vessel became un-moored in the 1974 Brisbane flood. While not the highest experienced along the river since European settlement, this flood was the most damaging. Major floods also occurred in January 2011 and multiple times during 1893.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> is {{essentially}} a sedentary species, spending its life within a restricted area. Its home range rarely extends beyond a single pool or, occasionally, two adjacent pools. It does not follow a set migratory path, but may actively seek out suitable spawning habitats between July and December.|$|E
50|$|Through {{convergent}} evolution, lungfishes {{have evolved}} internal nostrils {{similar to the}} tetrapods' choana, and a brain with certain similarities to the lissamphibian brain (except for the <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish,</b> which branched off in its own direction about 277 million {{years ago and has}} a brain resembling that of the Latimeria).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> is {{incapable}} of surviving complete desiccation of its habitat, although it can live out of water for several days if the surface of its skin is constantly moist.

50|$|Human {{activities}} currently {{threaten the}} <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish,</b> particularly water development. It is potentially {{at risk in}} much of its core distribution in the Burnett and Mary Rivers, as 26% of these river systems are presently impounded by weirs and dams.

50|$|The <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> is {{primarily}} nocturnal, and is essentially carnivorous. In captivity, it will feed on frogs, earthworms, pieces of meat, and pelleted food. In the wild, its prey includes frogs, tadpoles, fishes, {{a variety of}} invertebrates, and plant material. No quantitative dietary data are available, but anecdotal observations clearly indicate the diet of the lungfish changes with development. This is proven to be correlated with a change in dentition.|$|E
5000|$|The name Ceratodus {{was given}} to the {{settlement}} about 1922 [...] and derives from that of the <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish,</b> Neoceratodus forsteri. A railway station opened here 26 April 1924. On 12 September 1924, the District Postal Inspector, Maryborough Division, reported that 100 railway employees were camped at Ceratodus, engaged on bridge building and other railway work, and that there was one permanent settler (named Falconer) in the locality.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> spawns and completes {{its entire}} {{lifecycle}} in freshwater systems. The age of first breeding {{is estimated to}} be 17 years for males and 22 years for females. Males typically become mature at 738-790 mm and females at 814-854 mm. After an elaborate courtship, the lungfish spawn in pairs, depositing large adhesive eggs amongst aquatic plants. They spawn from August until November, before the spring rains, in flowing streams that are at least a metre deep.|$|E
50|$|It {{is one of}} six extant {{representatives of}} the ancient {{air-breathing}} Dipnoi (lungfishes) that flourished during the Devonian period (about 413-365 million years ago) and is the most primitive surviving member of this lineage.The five other freshwater lungfish species, four in Africa and one in South America, are very different morphologically from N. forsteri. The <b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> can live for several days out of the water, if it is kept moist, but will not survive total water depletion, unlike its African counterparts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Queensland</b> <b>lungfish</b> {{can be very}} fast-growing, {{yet with}} a delayed first {{breeding}} age. For a long-lived species with naturally low mortality rates, successful spawning and juvenile recruitment is not essential every year and may only occur irregularly in medium to long cycles, even in natural environments. The length of these cycles could easily mask the potentially deleterious impacts on recruitment for many years. Additionally, large adults could remain common for decades and give no indication of a declining population in the longer term.|$|E
