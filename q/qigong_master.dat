5000|$|The modern qigong {{movement}} {{emerged in}} the early 1950s, when Communist cadres embraced the techniques {{as a way to}} improve health. The new term was constructed to avoid association with religious practices, which were prone to being labeled as [...] "feudal superstition" [...] and persecuted during the Maoist era. Early adopters of qigong eschewed its religious overtones and regarded qigong principally as a branch of Chinese medicine. In the late 1970s, Chinese scientists purported to have discovered the material existence of the qi energy which qigong seeks to harness. In the spiritual vacuum of the post-Mao era, tens of millions of mostly urban and elderly Chinese citizens took up the practice of qigong, and a variety of charismatic <b>qigong</b> <b>masters</b> established practices.

As chronic pain {{patients}} are increasingly seeking alternatives to Western medicine (Eisenberg et al. 1998), this anecdotal study was designed as an open trial to collect some pilot data without a control. The study was anecdotal without much plan due to the tight schedule of the qigong healer who was visiting the U. S. {{for the first time in}} a short notice. Subjects: 10 chronic orofacial pain patients (all white females, mean age 54 years) from a private dental practice (JJM) participated. Their duration of pain ranged from 2 years to 35 years (mean = 15 years). Among the 10 patients, four of them meet criteria for Myofascial face pain (MFP), four for MFP and comorbid fibromyalgia, and 7 of them for phantom tooth pain (4 patients meet criteria for multiple disorders). All of them experienced constant or daily pain when they came to the clinic, and most had not heard of qigong before the study. Intervention: The subject was seated in a treatment room along with the Qigong healer and the translator (KC). Qigong healer administered qi emission for 5 to 10 minutes.

40|$|CONTEXT: Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of qigong in the West, few well-controlled studies using a sham master to assess the clinical efficacy of qigong have been conducted. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of qigong on treatment-resistant patients with late-stage complex regional pain syndrome type I. DESIGN: Block-random placebo-controlled clinical trial. SETTING: Pain Management Center at New Jersey Medical School. PATIENTS: 26 adult patients (aged 18 to 65 years) with complex regional pain syndrome type I. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental group received qi emission and qigong instruction (including home exercise) by a <b>qigong</b> <b>master.</b> The control group received a similar set of instructions by a sham master. The experimental protocol included 6 forty-minute qigong sessions over 3 weeks, with reevaluation at 6 and 10 weeks. Assessment included comprehensive medical history, physical exam, psychological evaluation, necessary diagnostic testing. Symptom Check List 90, and the Carleton University Responsiveness to Suggestion Scale. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thermography, swelling, discoloration, muscle wasting, range of motion, pain intensity rating, medication usage, behavior assessment (activity level and domestic disability), frequency of pain awakening, mood assessment, and anxiety assessment. RESULTS: 22 subjects completed the protocol. Among the genuine qigong group, 82 % reported less pain {{by the end of the}} first training session compared to 45 % of control patients. By the last training session, 91 % of qigong patients reported analgesia compared to 36 % of control patients. Anxiety was reduced in both groups over time, but the reduction was significantly greater in the experimental group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Using a credible placebo to control for nonspecific treatment effects, qigong training was found to result in transient pain reduction and long-term anxiety reduction. The positive findings were not related to preexperimental differences between groups in hypnotizability. Future studies of qigong should control for possible confounding influences and perhaps use clinical disorders more responsive to psychological intervention...|$|E

40|$|Body {{cultivation}} practices {{known as}} qigong 1 {{were the most}} widespread form of popular religiosity in post-Mao urban China between 1979 and 19992. It is estimated that {{at the height of}} “qigong fever” {{in the middle of this}} period, over 100 million people [...] over 20 % of the urban population [...] practiced the gymnastic, breathing and meditative exercises of qigong in some form or another. Hundreds of charismatic <b>qigong</b> healers and <b>masters</b> rose to fame and built organisations which, in the two cases of Zhonggong and Falungong, could claim as many or more adherents as the 40 -million-strong Chinese Communist Party (CCP) – the largest mass organizations independent of government control in China. Falungong has become well known in the West since April 25, 1999, when it staged a 10, 000 -person protest around the CCP headquarters. This was followed by a harsh state repression campaign against Falungong, which has also led to the dismantling of most other qigong groups. Media images of Falungong repression and resistance should not, however, blind us to the complex reality of the qigong movement in the Peoples’ Republic. For much of the post-Mao period, government support played an instrumental role in the spread of the qigong craze. Qigong was touted as a cheap and powerful healing technology, as a “somatic science” that could lead to revolutionary discoveries for harnessing the powers of the human mind, and as a secularized training system that contained the key to the mysteries of traditional Chinese wisdom without the dross of religion or superstition. And yet, while these modernizing discourses lent legitimacy to qigong, practitioners plunged into the legends and symbols of Buddhist magicians and Taoist immortals, dabbled in talismans and divination, and often experienced, through trance states, visions of popular demons and deities. The indeterminacy of qigong, as a type of body practice that allows one to pass in a breath from physical fitness exercises to mystic visualisations or apocalyptic militancy, opened a space for the massive spread of a body-centred religiosity under the cover of health, sports, and science, outside the supervision of the official Bureau of religious affairs. And yet, the enthusiasm of Party leaders for qigong in the 1980 ’s, followed by their fear of Falungong and other qigong groups today, suggests that body cultivation can come dangerously close to the religious roots of Chinese political power and legitimacy. In this chapter, I will begin with a brief overview of body cultivation in traditional China, followed by an account of the changing configurations of body cultivation in mainland Chinese society after 1949. I will attempt to show that while body cultivation was a fundamental aspect of traditional Chinese religion, it was also ideally suited for adaptation to the organization of modern life centred on the individual body. As such, qigong became a remarkably modern form of reappropriation and transformation of Chinese religious tradition. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{well known}} that qigong {{practice}} is beneficial to human health, but it is less known, even in China, that qigong may also be an effective therapy to treat various diseases. This report documents the story of a 58 -year-old Caucasian male patient with a series of chronic conditions, including high prostate-spe-cific antigen (PSA) mark (but not a confirmed cancer), atrial septal defect, asthma, allergies, multiple injuries by an automobile accident, high blood pressure, and edema in legs. Can medical qigong help such a patient to cure multiple symptoms simultaneously? Method: The intensive qigong workshop involved the training and practice of gathering qi, magnifying qi energy and using it for self-healing with visualization and guided imaginary; plus supervised energetic fasting. The patient practiced qigong 4 -plus hours per day during intensive training, and approximately 1 to 2 hours daily thereafter. About 10 sessions of external qi healing were performed by a <b>qigong</b> <b>master</b> for his pain and systematic adjustment. Settings/Location: The intensive medical qigong workshop took place in the World Institute for Self-Heal-ing, Inc. (WISH) office at Middlesex, NJ; and the patient practiced qigong at home for the rest of time. Results: After workshop and qigong therapy, the patient discontinued all medications (8 in total) and lost 35 pounds; his blood pressure dropped from 220 / 110 with medication to 120 / 75 without medication (in 2 weeks); pulse rate dropped from 88 beats per minute resting to 68 beats per minute in the mornings and 55 bpm in the evening; the edema in his legs went away; symptoms of asthma or allergies disappeared; PSA level dropped from 11 to 4 (normal), all without any medications. Conclusion: This kind of simultaneous recovery from multiple “incurable ” conditions and other documented successes cannot be explained by any known medical theories, and call for formal clinical trials to closely ex-amine the qigong self-healing therapy. ...|$|E

Our previous pilot {{study showed that}} qigong exercise can reduce fatigue and improve {{quality of life for}} patients with CFS. Objectives: In this study, the effect of qigong exercise in reducing fatigue and its dose-response relationship were investigated. METHODS: One hundred and thirty seven participants completed an RCT (intervention: n= 72, age, 42. 4 (6. 7), female: 72 %; control: n= 65, age, 42. 5 (6. 4), female: 82 %). Intervention was ten 2 -hour sessions of qigong exercise training (Wuxing Pingheng-gong) by an experienced Daoist <b>qigong</b> <b>master</b> (YLP). The primary outcome measure was Chalder et al’s fatigue score. In addition, to evaluate the dose-response relationship, participants in the intervention group were asked to record weekly the frequency and duration of their qigong practice. RESULTS: The intervention and control groups were comparable at baseline. After the intervention, changes in fatigue score were - 14. 7 (10. 3) and - 5. 8 (7. 3) for the intervention and control groups respectively (p<. 001). Among the intervention group participants, those who practiced qigong at least three times per week (n= 38) reported significantly bigger improvements than those who practiced fewer than three times per week (n= 18) [- 17. 3 (8. 9) vs - 9. 3 (11. 4), p =. 006].

40|$|Poster Session D, D- 127 Background: Chronic fatigue {{syndrome}} (CFS) with unknown etiology {{is a common}} health problem, but is usually neglected. There is a controversy in the definition and treatment of CFS. Western drugs for CFS have many side-effects and little clinical benefit. Only graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy have evidence of efficacy. Qigong is a traditional Chinese movement exercise including meditation, which focuses on the balance between yin and yang, as well as regulating the circulation of qi (vital energy in the body) to attain holistic health. Few large studies on Qigong and CFS have been conducted. This study was the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) study to assess the efficacy of Qigong as an alternative approach {{in the treatment of}} CFS. Methods: A RCTstudy for adult CFS patients was conducted with Qigong group (n= 56) and control group (n= 58). Ten sessions (twice a week for 5 weeks) of Qigong exercise (WuXingPingHengGong) of 2 hours each was delivered by an experienced Taoist <b>Qigong</b> <b>master</b> (YLP). The primary outcomewas a change of Chalder’s Fatigue scale between baseline and post-intervention (T 1 - T 0). The secondary outcomes were Chinese Brief Fatigue Inventory (CBFI) and SF- 12 Health Survey Questionnaire. Results: Two groups were comparable in demographic characteristics and other aspects at baseline. Mean (SD) of Chalder’s fatigue score at baseline and postintervention for Qigong group were 34. 5 (9. 0) and 23. 3 (10. 3), respectively, versus 35. 8 (9. 6) and 29. 6 (10. 7) for control group. The changes of Chalder’s fatigue (T 1 -T 0) were − 11. 2 and − 6. 2 for Qigong and control groups respectively (p= 0. 004). There were also the improvements in terms of CBFI (- 1. 6 vs - 0. 5, p= 0. 004) and quality of life (SF- 12 PCS: 5. 5 vs 2. 6, p= 0. 056; SF- 12 MCS: 7. 6 vs 1. 5, p= 0. 003).

Independent T-test and pairwise T-test were used to analyze between groups and within group changes in all measures. RESULTS: From baseline (T 0) to 3 month post-intervention (T 2), the change of fatigue was significantly greater in Qigong group than in control group (- 16. 1 ± 10. 8, and - 6. 8 ± 8. 2, p < 0. 001). Both groups did not differ significantly in the change of physical functioning (4. 4 ± 7. 4 and 3. 2 ± 6. 6, p= 0. 373); but Qigong group showed greater improvement than control group in mental functioning (8. 2 ± 11. 7 and 1. 2 ± 9. 5, p= 0. 001). The change of telomerase activity in Qigong group is marginally significant greater than control group (0. 08 ± 0. 2 vs 0. 02 ± 0. 06, p= 0. 099). Qigong group also had a significant increase in telomerase activity from T 0 to T 2 (from 0. 10 ± 0. 05 to 0. 18 ± 0. 20, p= 0. 033), but this was not found in the control group (from 0. 09 ± 0. 04 to 0. 10 ± 0. 06, p= 0. 176). CONCLUSION: Qigong exercise helps reduce fatigue and improve mental health functioning in long term and also has anti-aging effect on CFS patients...|$|E
