5|$|Although Robert {{refused to}} consecrate Spearhafoc, {{there is little}} {{evidence}} that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church reform being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a reform movement later known as the Gregorian Reform, initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing reform movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the reform position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for reform. There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a <b>quid</b> <b>pro</b> quo for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.|$|E
5|$|In late September, Izetbegović and Tuđman {{met again}} and {{attempted}} to create military coordination against the VRS, but to no avail. By October, the agreement had collapsed and afterwards Croatia diverted delivery of weaponry to Bosnia and Herzegovina by seizing a significant amount for itself. Boban had abandoned a Bosnian government alliance and ceased all hostilities with Karadžić. The dominant Croatian–Bosnian defense of Posavina fell apart after Tuđman and/or Gojko Šušak ordered {{the withdrawal of the}} Croatian Army (HV), enabling the Serbs to gain control of the corridor and connect their captured territories in western and eastern Bosnia. On 8 October, the town of Bosanski Brod was abandoned by the HVO and left to the VRS. By that time, the HV and the HVO had sustained approximately 7,500 casualties, out of 20,000 troops committed to the battle to control Posavina. The pullout appeared to be a <b>quid</b> <b>pro</b> quo for the JNA withdrawal from Dubrovnik's hinterland that took place in July. Still, a Central Intelligence Agency analysis concluded that there is no direct evidence of such arrangements. On 9 October, the HVO signed a cease-fire with the VRS in Jajce in exchange for providing electricity.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{there were}} several years of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima, and contending cities across the state, over {{proposals}} to move Genesee College to Syracuse.

They agreed to a <b>quid</b> <b>pro</b> quo donation of $25,000 from Senator Cornell in exchange for their (Methodist) support for his bill. Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill and Cornell became New York State's Land Grant University in 1865. In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875. By that time, however, the court injunction had been made moot by the founding of a new university on March 24, 1870. On that date the State of New York granted the new Syracuse University its own charter, independent of Genesee College. The City of Syracuse had offered $100,000 to establish the school. Bishop Jesse Truesdell Peck had donated $25,000 to the proposed school and was elected the first president of the Board of Trustees.|$|E
60|$|Cowes {{resembles a}} toy-town. The houses are tiny; the streets, in the main, are narrow, and not {{particularly}} straight, while everything is neat as wax. Some new avenues, however, are well planned, and, long ere this, are probably occupied; {{and there were}} several small marine villas {{in or near the}} place.

The bluff King Hall caused another castle to be built here also, which, I understood, was inhabited at the time by the family of the Marquis of Anglesey, who was said to be its governor. A part of the system of the English, government patronage is connected with these useless castles and nominally fortified places. Salaries are attached to the governments, and the situations are usually bestowed on military men. This is a good or a bad regulation, as the patronage is used. In a nation of extensive military operations it might prove a commendable and a delicate way of rewarding services; but, as the tendency of mankind is to defer to intrigue, and to augment power rather than to reward merit, the probability is, that these places are rarely bestowed, except in the way of political <b>quids</b> <b>pro</b> quos.|$|R

40|$|Analyst {{research}} {{is alleged to}} be biased because of conflicts of interest when analysts’ employers underwrite securities for the firms covered. I posit that affiliated analyst optimism should be the strongest for offering firms {{with a desire to}} over-inflate stock prices. I hypothesize that a firm’s corporate governance and its CEO incentives are related to the affiliation bias. Using stock recommendations data, I find evidence that the affiliation bias is indeed more pervasive for firms with high CEO wealth sensitivity to stock price (i. e., high CEO delta). The larger affiliation bias for high delta firms remains even after the introduction of regulatory reforms aimed at limiting analyst optimism. There is mixed evidence that firms with poorer corporate governance have more serious analyst affiliation biases. Examining event reactions to recommendations, I find that the market does not sufficiently discount the fact that affiliated analyst optimism is more serious for some firms. I also show post-offering evidence suggestive of <b>quid</b> quo <b>pro</b> in that hyping banks win more future deals for high delta firms while the firm’s CEO makes more insider stock sales...|$|R

5000|$|From Chamberlain's {{point of}} view, it was {{desirable}} to keep Romania and its oil out of German hands; since Germany had hardly any natural supplies of oil, the Royal Navy's ability {{to impose a}} blockade was a British trump card to deter, and if necessary win, a war. Chamberlain's [...] "guarantee" [...] of Polish independence on 31 March 1939 was intended both to tie Poland to the West (the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Józef Beck was widely, if mistakenly, believed to be pro-German), and of ensuring a <b>pro</b> <b>quid</b> quo thereby Poland would commit itself to protecting Romania and its oil from a German attack. The Polish “guarantee” {{was the first time}} that a British government had made a direct security commitment in Eastern Europe, regarded since 1919 as too unstable, and likely to involve Britain in unwanted wars (in 1925, Chamberlain’s half-brother, the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Austen Chamberlain had famously stated in public that the Polish Corridor was [...] "not worth the bones of a single British grenadier").|$|R
25|$|The {{circumstances}} {{behind the}} war were complicated {{as was the}} final settlement. In going to war in 1919 against British India, Amir Amanullah's war aims were complicated. Even up against a depleted British Indian Army, a tactical victory was unlikely; however, the war served the dual purpose of deflecting domestic criticism and also offering the opportunity for strategic political gains. As {{a result of the}} peace treaty that was negotiated, the British ceased payment of the Afghan subsidy, and thus ended their claim to direct Afghan foreign policy, which had been the <b>pro</b> <b>quid</b> quo of the Emir accepting the subsidy. The British had traditionally wanted Afghanistan as a buffer state between India and the Russian Empire. In 1919, the Russian Civil War was raging and any threat from Russia to India at the time was potential rather than real. Moreover, the British were by far the largest supporters of the White movement in the Russian Civil War with the British contributing more arms to the Whites than all of the other nations supporting the Whites did combined. It was assumed in London that if the Whites won the Civil War, a new era in Anglo-Russian relations might possibly open as the victorious Whites might be grateful for British support, rendering the need for a buffer state in Central Asia irrelevant. The British also stopped arms sales from India to Afghanistan. But, as British influence declined, the Afghans were able to gain control of their own foreign affairs and in the aftermath emerged as a fully independent state. The British also made some political gains, most notably the reaffirmation of the Durand Line – which had long been a contentious issue between the two nations – as the political boundary separating Afghanistan from the North-West Frontier, and the undertaking that the Afghans made to stop interference on the British side of the line.|$|R
2500|$|By summer 1942, German {{representatives in}} Romania {{obtained}} Antonescu's approval to deport the remaining Jewish population to extermination camps in occupied Poland. Among those involved on the German side were mass murderer Adolf Eichmann and his aide Gustav Richter, while the Romanian side {{was represented by}} Jewish Affairs Commissioner Lecca (reporting to Antonescu himself). Richter directed Lecca in setting up the Central Jewish Office, which he assumed would function as a Judenrat to streamline extermination policies. According to such plans, only some 17,000 Jews, labeled useful to Romania's economy, were to be exempt. The transports had already been announced to the Romanian Railways by autumn 1942, but the government eventually decided to postpone these measures indefinitely as was done with most other deportations to Transnistria. Antonescu's new orders on the matter were brought up in his conversations with Hitler at Schloss Klessheim, where both leaders show themselves aware of the fate awaiting Jewish deportees to Poland. By then, German authorities charged with applying the Final Solution in Eastern Europe completely abandoned their plans with respect to Romania. In August 1942, Antonescu had worked out plans with the SS for deporting all of the Jews of the Regat or the [...] "Old Kingdom" [...] to the German-run death camps in Poland, but then cancelled the deportation. The principal reasons for his change of mind were signs of disapproval from court circles, a warning from the American government passed on by the Swiss ambassador that he would prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity after the Allies had won if the deportation went ahead, and most importantly because Hitler would not undo the Second Vienna Award and return northern Transylvania to Romania. Antonescu saw the deportation of the Jews of the Regat as the <b>pro</b> <b>quid</b> quo {{for the return of}} Transylvania and unable to obtain satisfactory promises from the German Ambassador Baron Manfred von Killinger that Romania would be rewarded with the return of Transylvania in exchange for handing over its Jews, Antonescu cancelled the deportation until the Germans would make him a better offer.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Money for nothing? For {{some years}} the heavy {{reliance}} of both major Australian political parties on developer donations {{has been known}} 1. One developer (Jeff McCloy) memorably told the NSW Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC, 2014 b. p. 5328 T) {{he felt like a}} “walking ATM”. This sentiment was echoed by lobbyist Frank Dunlop, who told the Mahon Tribunal in Ireland that his phone would “walk off the desk” with calls from candidates seeking money as soon as a general election was called (Mahon, 2012 p. 757). Both givers and recipients have insisted that nothing is expected and nothing is given in return for these donations, and it has been impossible to disprove this ‘money for nothing’ proposition. Instead {{it has been suggested that}} donations are simply a way of ‘participating in the political process’. This suggestion reflects US Supreme Court jurisprudence, which has elevated donations to the status of ‘speech’ and forbidden US legislatures to act to prevent anything short of ‘quid pro quo’ corruption. The Australian High Court followed the US Supreme Court part of the way along this path, characterising donations as a form of ‘political communication’. An attempt to confine donations to voters (as is the case in Canada) was successfully challenged in the High Court by Unions NSW, on the basis that this was an unreasonable imposition on an “implied freedom of political communication” 2. A recent challenge by Mr McCloy to the constitutional validity of the preexisting NSW ban on donations from property developers, and caps on the amount of donations, was however unsuccessful in both respects 3. The High Court rejected the US Supreme Court’s reasoning that governments may only limit political communication to prevent <b>quid</b> quo <b>pro</b> corruption. It confirmed that the prevention of both corruption and undue influence are valid reasons for legislatures to restrict political donations, and that in the final analysis, the Australian constitution must be interpreted to serve the interests of democracy. This should come as a great relief to Australian citizens. Anti-corruption agencies with strong investigative powers (including the power to undertake covert operations) have uncovered what many suspected was the truth, both here and in Ireland. There is now firm empirical evidence of cases in which donations from the property development sector have in fact had ‘strings attached’. Something was expected of public officials in return, whether explicitly stated or not, and that something was some form of rezoning or development approval, or an action that cleared the way for these approvals. Whether or not this behaviour constitutes corruption is a question of significance in terms of the possibility of sanctions against individuals. The issue for the integrity of the planning system is not however confined to corruption. It is the broader question of donor influence that has been brought into sharp focus by the work of anti- corruption agencies in Australia and elsewhere. Influence is the subject of this research paper, rather than corruption. Some forms of influence are indeed corrupt by any standard. Other forms of influence are better characterised as ‘undue influence’; they may fall short of corruption but their potential impact on planning systems are, nonetheless, significant. Research question The central concern addressed in this paper is whether, and if so, how, political donations pose a risk to the integrity of the planning system. It concerns both the corruption of decision-makers and undue influence over them. Both corruption and undue influence have the potential to distort planning processes and outcomes. ___   1 See for example New South Wales Parliament Legislative Council, Select Committee on Electoral and Political Party Funding June 2008, Report no. 1, Electoral and Political Party Funding in New South Wales p. 6 2 Unions New South Wales and Others v New South Wales [2013] HCA 58 3 High Court of Australia, McCloy v State of New South Wales [2015] HCA 34, 7 October 2015...|$|R

Chrétien was due to face a leadership review in February 2002, but the Liberal national executive, which was controlled by partisans of Paul Martin, agreed to Chrétien's request in early January 2001 that the leadership review be pushed back to February 2003. In agreeing to this request, Martin believed that this was the <b>quid</b> <b>pro</b> quo for allowing Chrétien a decent interval to retire with dignity sometime in 2002, an interpretation that Chrétien did not hold. Chrétien saw the extra year as merely giving him more time to win the leadership review.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the pardon}} by President Bill Clinton of several convicted {{members of the}} New Square Hassidic community, Greenwald was interviewed by several media outlets {{regarding}} his opinion and even {{his role in the}} affair. The fact that Greenwald had ties to the New Square community, was a former business associate of Marc Rich, another person pardoned by Clinton {{at the end of his}} term and had been questioned by the FBI during its investigation into the pardons, made his opinions regarding the incident highly sought after by media outlets.

25|$|Despite {{the terror}} and {{unprecedented}} propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed {{to bring the}} majority for the NSDAP that Hitler had hoped for. Together with the German National People's Party (DNVP), however, {{he was able to}} form a slim majority government. With accommodations to the Catholic Centre Party, Hitler succeeded in convincing a required two-thirds of a rigged Parliament to pass the Enabling act of 1933 which gave his government full legislative power. Only the Social Democrats voted against the Act. The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the Länder; the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal Weimar constitution. Germany left the League of Nations. The coalition parliament was rigged on this fateful 23 March 1933 by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently, in July the Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a <b>quid</b> <b>pro</b> quo with the Pope under the anti-communist Pope Pius XI for the Reichskonkordat; and by these manoeuvres Hitler achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. It is interesting to note, however, that according to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the elections held between 1928 and November 1932. The Communist Party was proscribed in April 1933. On the weekend of 30 June 1934, he gave order to the SS to seize Röhm and his lieutenants, and to execute them without trial (known as the Night of the Long Knives). Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency to be vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as Führer (Leader) and Chancellor.|$|E
