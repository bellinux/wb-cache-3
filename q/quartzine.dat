40|$|Quantitative X-ray texture {{analysis}} was used to identify the fiber elongation direction of microfibrous quartz varieties in materials that contain narrow bands of closely spaced, radially divergent spherulitic fiber bundles. The statistical approach of X-ray texture analysis makes it possible to determine the fiber axis direction even when the maximum divergence angle of fibers within spherulitic fiber bundles diverge +/- 20 degrees from a common growth direction. Representative samples of chalcedony [11 (2) over bar 0], <b>quartzine</b> [0001], and pseudochalcedony were selected for additional study with transmission electron microscopy. All varieties of microfibrous quartz were found to contain high concentrations of polysynthetic Brazil twins and domains characterized by a modulated microstructure. Trace element profiles of aluminum and iron concentration were measured by electron microprobe analysis for an agate sample that contains alternating bands of chalcedony [11 (2) over bar 0] and <b>quartzine</b> fibers. The elemental concentration profiles were measured in a direction parallel to the growth direction of microfibrous quartz. Although fibers within the chalcedony bands initially displayed cooperative helical twisting, the fibers became untwisted during the later stages of growth within any one band. The trace element profiles revealed that higher concentrations of aluminum are associated with <b>quartzine</b> and non-twisted [11 (2) over bar 0] fibers, rather than twisted chalcedony [11 (2) over bar 0] fibers. Except for the presence of iron-rich inclusions between <b>quartzine</b> and chalcedony bands, trace concentrations of iron were below the detection limit for the different varieties of microfibrous quartz analyzed. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Upper Pennsylvanian cyclothems {{of western}} Nebraska and southeastern Utah contain {{abundant}} brachiopods and crinoids replaced by red <b>quartzine</b> (length-slow chalcedony). Red fossils typically occur within silty wackestones that were deposited below fair-weather wave base during eustatic high stands. Within the "D " zone cyclothem of the Lansing-Kansas City Group (Nebraska), a well-documented paleosol recording an episode ofsubaerial exposure lies several meters above the chert-bearing rocks. The upper {{member of the}} Hermosa Formation (Utah) contains large-scale cross-stratified olianites resting directly upon three red-chert-bearing limestones. Petrographic study of the silicified fossils from these two sequences shows that although fossils are presently hematitic, iron was initially concentrated within the skeletal material as scattered pyrite framboids and euhedra. Anaerobic decay of the organic material within shells during their replacement by <b>quartzine</b> {{may have led to}} the precipitation of pyrite. During a subsequent event, acid generated by the oxidation of pyrite inclusions allowed migration of dissolved iron through the <b>quartzine.</b> Buffering of these solutions by surrounding, unreplaced skeletal material caused preferential accumulation of iron oxide at the perimeters of the silicified zones. Silicification, pyrite precipitation, and pyrite oxidation all predated the crushing of shells during mechanical compaction of the matrix. We hypothesize that oxidation took place when the regional groundwater table dropped as the sea regressed and overlying beds were subaerially exposed. Cherts with similar histories hould be present in other strata that bear internal sources of silica, iron, and organic material, and record large-scale, rapid changes of sea level...|$|E
40|$|The disused sphalerite-galena mine at Vedrin, Belgium, shows a 160 m-thick uninterrupted, well-stratified {{series of}} limestones and mainly dolostones. Several evaporitic horizons are {{characterized}} by pseudomorphous lenticular or lozenge-shaped gypsum and nodular anhydrite. Petrographic study distinguished 12 carbonate microfacies of sedimentary environments similar to supratidal sabkhas. The dynamic evolution is described {{on the basis of}} dolomitization in which pseudomorphs of lutecite and <b>quartzine</b> type occur.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} some agates from the Gurasada area (Mures Valley, West Romania) and their igneous host rocks. Agates occur in the vesicles of strongly altered pyroclastic rocks (“banatites”), such as basaltic andesites, trachyandesites, trachytes and dacites or in the alluvial sediments along the Gurasada valley. The age of host-rocks is Late Cretaceous-Early Paleogene. Agates consist mainly of various types of α-quartz such as: chalcedony, <b>quartzine</b> and microquartz, associated with moganite. The genesis of agates is related with the hydrothermal solutions which altered the host-rocks. ...|$|E
40|$|Varieties of {{chalcedony}} (calcedonite, <b>quartzine,</b> and lutecite) {{and other}} optical micro- and cryptocrystalline textures of quartz and opal from Miocene silcretes of the Madrid Basin were studied using a Thermo Fisher DXR Raman microscope. The microscope has a point-and-shoot Raman capability of 1 µm spatial resolution and was {{coupled with a}} standard optical microscope. Our results show that all the varieties of chalcedony can have a composite Raman spectrum of both quartz and moganite. The spectra are independent of the chalcedony origin by ageing, direct replacement, and cementation processes. Moganite was absent only in some calcedonite cements. The presence of moganite is independent of the surface sedimentary setting of the host rocks in which the silcretes are formedPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{subsurface}} mid-Tertiary Tikorangi Formation is {{the sole}} limestone and the only fracture-producing hydrocarbon reservoir within Taranaki Basin. This study, based on core material from seven wells in the onshore Waihapa/Ngaere Field, uses a range of petrographic (standard, CL, UV, SEM) and geochemical techniques (stable isotope, trace element data, XRD) to unravel a complex diagenetic history for the Tikorangi Formation. A series of eight major geological-diagenetic events for the host rock and fracture systems have been established, ranging from burial cementation through to hydrocarbon emplacement within mineralized fractures. For each diagenetic event a probable temperature field has been identified which, combined with a geohistory plot, has enabled the timing of events to be determined. This study {{has shown that the}} Tikorangi Formation comprises a complex mixed siliciclastic-carbonate-rich sequence of rocks that exhibit generally tight, pressure-dissolved, and well cemented fabrics with negligible porosity and permeability other than in fractures. Burial cementation of the host rocks occurred at temperatures of 27 - 37 °C from about 0. 5 - 1. 0 km burial depths. Partial replacement dolomitisation occurred during late burial diagenesis at temperatures of 36 - 50 °C and at burial depths of about 1. 0 km, without any secondary porosity development. Fracturing occurred after dolomitisation and was associated with compression and thrusting on the Taranaki Fault. The location of more carbonate/dolomite-rich units may have implications for the location of better-developed fracture network systems and for hydrocarbon prospectivity and production. Hydrocarbon productivity has been ultimately determined by original depositional facies, diagenesis, and deformation. Within the fracture systems, a complex suite of vein calcite, dolomite, <b>quartzine,</b> and celestite minerals has been precipitated prior to hydrocarbon emplacement, which have substantially healed and reduced fracture porosities and permeabilities. The occurrence of multiple vein mineral phases, collectively forming a calcite/dolomite-celestite-quartzine mineral assemblage, points to fluid compositions varying both spatially and temporally. The fluids responsible for vein mineralisation in the Tikorangi Formation probably involved waters of diverse origins and compositions. Vein mineralisation records a history of changing pore fluid chemistry and heating during burial, punctuated by changes in the relative input and mixing of downward circulating meteoric and upwelling basinal fluids. A sequence of mineralisation events and their probable burial depth/temperature fields have been defined, ranging from temperatures of 50 - 80 °C and burial depths of 1. 0 - 2. 3 km. Hydrocarbon emplacement has occurred over the last 6 m. y. following the vein mineralization events. The Tikorangi Formation must continue to be viewed as a potential fracture reservoir play within Taranaki Basin...|$|E
