The larger flat end of bamboo satay sticks are {{more commonly used}} for single application of dots to paintings, but the sharp pointier end is used to create fine dots.

5|$|As the 19thcentury {{gave way}} to the 20th, there {{followed}} in <b>quick</b> <b>succession</b> the Philippine Revolution, which spawned the short-lived First Philippine Republic, followed by the bloody Philippine–American War of conquest by US military force. Aside from the period of Japanese occupation, the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until after World War II, when the Philippines was recognized as an independent nation. Since then, the Philippines has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by a non-violent revolution.|$|E

On leaving Oxford, Edgeworth and Day attempted to teach Edgeworth's first son, Dick, in the style of Emile, a learning-by-doing approach. Accompanying Edgeworth to Ireland as Dick's tutor, Day fell in love and was spurned first by Edgeworth's sister, and then by at least three other women in <b>quick</b> <b>succession.</b>|$|E

Aratus faced the hard decision of whether to give the city to Antigonus or to let it fall to Cleomenes. He chose to conclude an alliance with Antigonus and sent his son as a hostage to Macedon.

60|$|Other {{characteristics}} can {{be produced}} by different modifications of the above. In Fig. 2 the original hemispherical mirror is shown broken up into three different sectors, BB', CC', and DD'; so that with the same velocity of revolution the periods of light and darkness will be produced in <b>quicker</b> <b>succession.</b> In this figure (Fig. 2) the three sectors have been shown as subtending equal angles, but {{if one of them}} were increased in size and the other two diminished (as in Fig. 3), we should have one long steady illumination and two short flashes at each revolution. Again, the number of sectors may be increased; and by varying both their number and their relative size, a number of additional characteristics are attainable.|$|R
30|$|Using {{the final}} FiltRes-prototype made of POM (Figs.  2 a, b, 3) {{we were able}} to reduce the total contact time to the cold aqueous {{methanol}} quenching solution to 15.7  ±  2.5  s (without any washing step) for glucose-limited mycelium of P. ochrochloron. Each additional washing step added 10 – 15  s to the procedure. In comparison to centrifugation, which required in our case at least 20  min and did not result in a reasonable pellet, this was a considerable improvement. In addition, if three single FiltRes-devices were arranged in a triplet (Fig.  3 g) it allowed to process three samples in 1  min with a skilled team. Also the triplet can be rapidly exchanged with another triplet for a <b>quicker</b> <b>succession</b> of samples, which will be necessary for intended future studies with this organism.|$|R

Also, {{the increase in the}} initial concentrations of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + from 25 to 750  mg/L also amounted in the proportionate increase in Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + biosorbed by TISW from 11.55 to 146.89 and 10.48 to 176.22  mg/g, respectively. It is noteworthy to mention here that the increase in the initial concentration of sorbate ions led to the corresponding increase in their uptakes, as they occupied the functional moieties on the surface of TISW. The binding of these solute ions to these functional moieties in the active sites occurred in <b>quick</b> <b>successions</b> until they were occupied [25, 29].|$|R
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Shackleton's near miss, Captain Scott {{organised}} the Terra Nova Expedition, 1910–13, in which securing the South Pole for the British Empire was an explicitly stated prime objective.

However, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, who had been developing plans for a North Pole expedition, changed his mind when, in September 1909, the North Pole was claimed in <b>quick</b> <b>succession</b> by the Americans Frederick Cook and Robert Peary. Amundsen resolved to go south instead.|$|E

The route proceeds northward along Purchase Street as a two-lane street through the Locust Avenue Business District, intersecting a handful of local streets and serving Rye's station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. Past the station, the highway passes under the New Haven Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line, and I-95 in <b>quick</b> <b>succession</b> ahead of the Purchase Street Business District.

50|$|The singing itself places Bandish (the composition) at {{the heart}} of the {{presentation}} because of the gharana's belief that the full melody of the raga and guidance on its singing is provided by the bandish. The asthayi section is sung twice before the antara, to be followed by swar-vistar in medium tempo. This slow rendition of the notes is known as the Behlava, and is sung from Ma in the lower register to Pa in the higher register, following the pattern of the Aroha (ascent) and Avaroha (descent) of the raga. The behlava is divided into the asthayi (from Ma to Sa) and antara (from Ma, Pa, or Dha to Pa of the higher register). The Dugun-Ka-Alap follows in which groups of two or four note combinations are sung in <b>quicker</b> <b>succession</b> but the basic tempo remains the same.|$|R

Waiting for multiple gauges to charge facilitates more options, such as making multiple moves in <b>quick</b> <b>succession,</b> but this gives the enemy more opportunity to attack.

The eruptions consisting of two fast CMEs (1400 km/s and 2000 km/s) and M-class flares that occurred in active region 11402 located at N 28 W 36. The two CMEs occurred in <b>quick</b> <b>successions,</b> so they interacted very close to the Sun. The second CME caught up with the first one at a distance of 11 - 12 Rsun. The CME interaction may be responsible for the elevated SEP flux and significant changes in the intensity profile of the SEP event. The compound CME resulted in a double-dip moderate geomagnetic storm (Dst = - 73 nT). The two dips are due to the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field in the shock sheath and the ICME intervals. One possible reason for the lack of a stronger geomagnetic storm may be that the ICME delivered a glancing blow to Earth. Comment: 29 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in ADSP...|$|R
