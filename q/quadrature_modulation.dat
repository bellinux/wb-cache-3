50|$|By {{representing}} a transmitted symbol {{as a complex}} number and modulating a cosine and sine carrier signal with the real and imaginary parts (respectively), the symbol can be sent with two carriers on the same frequency. They are {{often referred to as}} quadrature carriers. A coherent detector is able to independently demodulate these carriers. This principle of using two independently modulated carriers is the foundation of <b>quadrature</b> <b>modulation.</b> In pure phase modulation, the phase of the modulating symbol is the phase of the carrier itself and this is the best representation of the modulated signal.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some forms}} of AM, the carrier may be reduced, to save power. The term DSB - Reduced Carrier {{normally}} implies enough carrier remains in the transmission to enable a receiver circuit to regenerate a strong carrier or at least synchronise a phase-locked loop but there are forms where the carrier is removed completely, producing double sideband with suppressed carrier (DSB-SC). Suppressed carrier systems require more sophisticated circuits in the receiver and some other method of deducing the original carrier frequency. An example is the stereophonic difference (L-R) information transmitted in stereo FM broadcasting on a 38 kHz subcarrier where a low-power signal at half the 38-kHz carrier frequency is inserted between the monaural signal frequencies (up to 15 kHz) and {{the bottom of the}} stereo information sub-carrier (down to 38-15 kHz, i.e. 23kHz). The receiver locally regenerates the subcarrier by doubling a special 19 kHz pilot tone. In another example, the <b>quadrature</b> <b>modulation</b> used historically for chroma information in PAL television broadcasts, the synchronising signal is a short burst of a few cycles of carrier during the [...] "back porch" [...] part of each scan line when no image is transmitted. But in other DSB-SC systems, the carrier may be regenerated directly from the sidebands by a Costas loop or squaring loop. This is common in digital transmission systems such as BPSK where the signal is continually present.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 56 - 57) Wireless communication {{has always}} been one of the important sources of communication. But since the introduction of cellular phone technology about two decades ago, it has grown at an unprecedented rate. Wireless communication has evolved a lot, and is no more limited to the telephone service. Spectrum is limited and is getting congested with increasing wireless devices and different technologies, causing interference. One of the emerging technology which has potential to provide solution for this problem is ultra Wideband (UWB) communication. UWB technology employs the approach of sharing already occupied spectrum by means of the overlay principle. UWB is a rapidly developing wireless technology which occupies a very large bandwidth of about 7. 5 GHz, and promises very high data rates for short range communication. This thesis covers the aspect of pulse generation of orthogonal UWB signals using the Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS). We discuss DPSS and their characteristics. Set of 16 DPSS, 0 th order through 15 th order, are generated. We employ these set of DPSS to generate two different orthogonal signals for binary modulation techniques, and four different orthogonal signals for <b>quadrature</b> <b>modulation</b> techniques. Moore Penrose pseudoinverse is used while generating these pulses to meet the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) regulations for power emission for indoor communications within the stipulated bandwidth of 3. 1 [...] 10. 6 GHz. A detailed design analysis is provided in this thesis. The performance of the designed signals is investigated under two different Binary modulation schemes and two different <b>quadrature</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes. For Binary modulation schemes we employ Pulse Position modulation (2 -PPM) and Pulse Shape modulation (2 -PSM). For <b>quadrature</b> <b>modulation</b> schemes we employ Pulse Shape modulation (4 -PSM) and combination of PPM and PSM (4 -PPM-PSM). It is shown that the designed signals provide an efficient and robust means of communication under Additive White Gaussian Noise(AWGN) channel and under a multipath channel using the Saleh Valenzuela model. Bit error rate (BER) curves are plotted for both these channel conditions...|$|E
