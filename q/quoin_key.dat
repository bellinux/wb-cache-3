The hole to {{the right}} of center is for a <b>quoin</b> <b>key.</b> The quoin is about 190 mm (7.5 in) long, and 18 mm (0.7 in) tall. The width expands by about 10 points, from 17 mm (0.68 in) to 21 mm (0.82 in) as the <b>quoin</b> <b>key</b> is turned clockwise.|$|E

The five wedges on the part in the foreground remain fixed, while five corresponding wedges in the background part slide when a <b>quoin</b> <b>key</b> (not shown) is inserted and turned.

5000|$|Lock-up is {{the final}} step before printing. The printer removes the cords that hold the type together, and turns the <b>quoins</b> with a <b>key</b> or lever to [...] "lock" [...] the entire complex of type, blocks, furniture, and chase (frame) into place - {{creating}} {{what is called a}} form or forme. The printer takes the finished form to the printing press, a newspaper setting, each page needs a truck for errors before starting the printing run.|$|R
