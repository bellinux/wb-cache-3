5|$|In {{spite of}} this progress, the {{relationship}} between strings and five-dimensional branes remained conjectural because theorists were unable to <b>quantize</b> the branes. Starting in 1991, {{a team of researchers}} including Michael Duff, Ramzi Khuri, Jianxin Lu, and Ruben Minasian considered a special compactification of string theory in which four of the ten dimensions curl up. If one considers a five-dimensional brane wrapped around these extra dimensions, then the brane looks just like a one-dimensional string. In this way, the conjectured relationship between strings and branes was reduced to a relationship between strings and strings, and the latter could be tested using already established theoretical techniques.|$|E

30|$|As {{it can be}} {{seen from}} Tables  6 and 7, the {{compression}} percentage of the <b>quantized</b> norms is higher than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients. Since the variation of the <b>quantized</b> norms is less than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients, the conditional probability of the encoding symbol of the <b>quantized</b> norms is bigger than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients. Moreover, the correlation in the time domain of the <b>quantized</b> norms is higher than that of the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients because of the less variation of norms. As a result, the scheme of the context-based adaptive arithmetic coding used for the <b>quantized</b> norms has a better performance than that used for the <b>quantized</b> MDCT coefficients.|$|R

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{predict a}} giant <b>quantized</b> Goos-Hänchen (GH) {{effect on the}} surface of graphene in quantum Hall regime. The giant <b>quantized</b> GH effect manifests itself as an angular shift whose <b>quantized</b> step reaches the order of mrad for light beams impinging on a graphene-on-substrate system. The <b>quantized</b> GH effect can be attributed to <b>quantized</b> Hall conductivity, which corresponds to the discrete Landau levels in quantum Hall regime. We find that the <b>quantized</b> step can be greatly enhanced for incident angles near the Brewster angle. Moreover, the Brewster angle is sensitive to the Hall conductivity, and therefore the <b>quantized</b> GH effect can be modulated by the Fermi energy and the external magnetic field. The giant <b>quantized</b> GH effect offers a convenient way to determine the <b>quantized</b> Hall conductivity and the discrete Landau levels by a direct optical measurement.

25|$|Common {{criticisms of}} the Copenhagen {{interpretation}} often lead {{to the problem of}} continuum of random occurrences: whether in time (as subsequent measurements, which under certain interpretations of the measurement problem may happen continuously) or even in space. A recent experiment showed that a particle may leave a trace about the path which it used when travelling as a wave ndash& and that this trace exhibits equality of both paths. If such result is raised to the rank of a wave-only non-transactional worldview and proved better ndash& i.e. that a particle is in fact a continuum of points capable of acting independently but under a common wavefunction ndash& it would rather support theories such as Bohm's one (with its guiding towards the centre of orbital and spreading of physical properties over it) than interpretations which presuppose full randomness, because with the latter it will be problematic to demonstrate universally and in all practical cases how can a particle remain coherent in time, in spite of non-zero probabilities of its individual points going into regions distant from the centre of mass (through a continuum of different random determinations). An alternative possibility would be to assume that there is a finite number of instants/points within a given time or area, but theories which try to <b>quantize</b> the space or time itself seem to be fatally incompatible with the special relativity.|$|E
500|$|Attendees at Feynman's first seminar, {{which was}} on the {{classical}} version of the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory, included Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, and John von Neumann. Pauli made the prescient comment that the theory would be extremely difficult to <b>quantize,</b> and Einstein said that one might try to apply this method to gravity in general relativity, which Sir Fred Hoyle and Jayant Narlikar did much later as the Hoyle–Narlikar theory of gravity. Feynman received a PhD from Princeton in 1942; his thesis advisor was John Archibald Wheeler. His doctoral thesis applied the principle of stationary action to problems of quantum mechanics, inspired {{by a desire to}} <b>quantize</b> the Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory of electrodynamics, laying the groundwork for the path integral formulation and Feynman diagrams, and was titled [...] "The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics". A key insight was that positrons behaved like electrons moving backwards in time. James Gleick wrote: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{requirement}} of Lorentz invariance takes on perhaps its most dramatic effect in string theory. Classical relativistic strings {{can be handled}} in the Lagrangian framework by using the Nambu–Goto action. This results in a relativistically invariant theory in any spacetime dimension. But as it turns out, the theory of open and closed bosonic strings (the simplest string theory) is impossible to <b>quantize</b> {{in such a way}} that the Lorentz group is represented on the space of states (a Hilbert space) unless the dimension of spacetime is 26. The corresponding result for superstring theory is again deduced demanding Lorentz invariance, but now with supersymmetry. In these theories the Poincaré algebra is replaced by a supersymmetry algebra which is a -graded Lie algebra extending the Poincaré algebra. The structure of such an algebra is to a large degree fixed by the demands of Lorentz invariance. In particular, the fermionic operators (grade [...] ) belong to a [...] or [...] representation space of the (ordinary) Lorentz Lie algebra. The only possible dimension of spacetime in such theories is 10.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{photonic}} spin Hall effect (SHE) in a graphene-substrate {{system with the}} presence of external magnetic field. In the quantum Hall regime, we demonstrate that the in-plane and transverse spin-dependent splittings in photonic SHE exhibit different <b>quantized</b> behaviors. The <b>quantized</b> SHE can be described as a consequence of a <b>quantized</b> geometric phase (Berry phase), which corresponds to the <b>quantized</b> spin-orbit interaction. Furthermore, an experimental scheme based on quantum weak value amplification is proposed to detect the <b>quantized</b> SHE in terahertz frequency regime. By incorporating the quantum weak measurement techniques, the <b>quantized</b> photonic SHE holds great promise for detecting <b>quantized</b> Hall conductivity and Berry phase.

2500|$|Programming of drum {{machines}} are varied by the products. [...] On most products, {{it can be}} done in real time: the user creates drum patterns by pressing the trigger pads as though a drum kit were being played; or using step-sequencing: the pattern is built up over time by adding individual sounds at certain points by placing them, as with the TR-808 and TR-909, along a 16-step bar. For example, a generic 4-on-the-floor dance pattern could be made by placing a closed high hat on the 3rd, 7th, 11th, and 15th steps, then a kick drum on the 1st, 5th, 9th, and 13th steps, and a clap or snare on the 5th and 13th. This pattern could be varied in a multitude of ways to obtain fills, break-downs and other elements that the programmer sees fit, which in turn could be sequenced with song-sequence — essentially the drum machine plays back the programmed patterns from memory in an order the programmer has chosen.
