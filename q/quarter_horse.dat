5|$|A {{significant}} crossbreeding influence used {{to revitalize}} the Appaloosa was the Arabian horse, as evidenced by early registration lists that show Arabian-Appaloosa crossbreeds as ten of the first fifteen horses registered with the ApHC. For example, one of Claude Thompson's major herd sires was Ferras, an Arabian stallion bred by W.K. Kellogg from horses imported from the Crabbet Arabian Stud of England. Ferras sired Red Eagle, a prominent Appaloosa stallion added to the Appaloosa Hall of Fame in 1988. Later, Thoroughbred and <b>Quarter</b> <b>Horse</b> lines were added, as well as crosses from other breeds, including Morgans and Standardbreds. In 1983 the ApHC {{reduced the number of}} allowable outcrosses to three main breeds: the Arabian horse, the American <b>Quarter</b> <b>Horse</b> and the Thoroughbred.|$|E

The National Quarter Pony Association requires that stallions be registered with the AQHA before they can be registered with the NQPA.

The International Quarter Pony Association allows Pinto and Appaloosa markings, and simply requires that ponies be of Quarter-type conformation and good disposition for registry. Any type of pony meeting these requirements may be registered through the hardship registration program, which includes a special inspection. However, if ponies have a parent registered with an approved breed registry (approved breeds include the Quarter Pony, <b>Quarter</b> <b>Horse,</b> Paint horse, Appaloosa and Pony of the Americas), they are automatically eligible for registration, with no inspection required. Crosses with gaited breeds are not accepted for registration.|$|E
5|$|Thoroughbreds {{are used}} mainly for racing, {{but are also}} bred for other riding {{disciplines}} such as show jumping, combined training, dressage, polo, and fox hunting.
