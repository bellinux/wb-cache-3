40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{suggestion}} that increased QT dispersion (QTD) {{is due to}} increased differences in local action potential durations within the myocardium is wanting. An alternative explanation was sought by relating QTD to vectorcardiographic T-loop morphology. METHODS AND RESULTS: The T loop is characterized by its amplitude and width (defined as the spatial angle between the mean vectors {{of the first and}} second halves of the loop). We reasoned that small, wide ("pathological") T loops produce larger QTD than large, narrow ("normal") loops. To quantify the relationship between QTD and T-loop morphology, we used a program for automated analysis of ECGs and a database of 1220 standard simultaneous 12 -lead ECGs. For each ECG, <b>QT</b> <b>durations,</b> QTD, and T-loop parameters were computed. T-loop amplitude and width were dichotomized, with 250 microV (small versus large amplitudes) and 30 degrees (narrow versus wide loops) taken as thresholds. Over all 1220 ECGs, QTDs were smallest for large, narrow T loops (54. 2 +/- 27. 1 ms) and largest for small, wide loops (69. 5 +/- 33. 5 ms; P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: QTD is an attribute of T-loop morphology, as expressed by T-loop amplitude and width...|$|E
40|$|Atypical T wave {{morphology}} on scalar ECG {{may reflect}} abnormalities of the ventricular repolarization process but {{the link between}} these abnormalities and the occurrence of arrhythmic events is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether the occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) have specific T wave morphology that may characterize their increased risk for cardiac death (CD). From 24 -hour Holter ECG recordings, T-wave morphology and symmetry were quantified in the three orthogonal leads using T-wave area based measurements in addition to conventional QT interval measurements. We compared the T wave characteristics (duration and morphology) between patients according to their cardiac history (VT or CD). Our results did not evidence significant differences in <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> between patients with and without a history of VT at any heart rate but revealed a prolongation of the terminal portion of the T-wave at high heart rate in patients with VT (91 ± 21 vs. 102 ± 20 ms, p= 0. 03 for RR between 600 - 700 ms).

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect that percutaneous coronary intervention has on the depolarization and repolarization parameters of surface electrocardiography in patients with chronic stable angina.

We measured parameters including QRS duration, QT and corrected <b>QT</b> <b>durations,</b> and JT and corrected JT duration in both electrocardiograms and compared the values.

40|$|Introduction Despite its {{degradation}} by ectonucleotidases, interstitial {{adenosine triphosphate}} concentration ([ATP]out) increases after an {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) and correlates with the occurrence of ventricular premature beats and ventricular tachycardia. It has been recently shown that extracellular ATP activates a depolarizing arrhythmogenic current carried by the transient receptor potential (TRP) channels TRPC 3 / 7. A decrease in [ATP]out could be a strategy to prevent arrhythmias during an acute ischemic episode. Previous results from our laboratories in a rat model of AMI suggest {{that this could be}} the case. Objective To study whether extracellular creatine would serve as a buffer for the sudden increase of [ATP]out and decrease arrhythmic events in an isolated rat heart model of AMI. Method Electrical and contractile activities were recorded on isolated Langendorff perfused rat hearts. The left coronary artery was occluded to induce a myocardial infarction. Results Under control condition, creatine (1 - 3 mmol/L) had no major effects on QRS and <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> nor on RR interval or force of contraction. The ligature of the left coronary artery markedly decreased the ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT). However, when hearts were previously treated with creatine (1 - 3 mmol/L) the VFT was significantly higher after the AMI compared to untreated hearts. Moreover, in hearts perfused with creatine after coronary ligature, VFT was also increased but to a lesser extent. Conclusion Our results suggest that creatine, at a relatively high concentration, would serve as a buffer for the sudden release of ATP during the early phase of ischemia thus having an antiarrhythmic effect. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: It {{is thought}} that arrhythmias are {{responsible}} for sudden deaths in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). QT intervals may predict malignant arrhythmia potential in these patients. The aim {{of the present study}} is to assess QT variables in patients with MVP. Methods: We studied 46 patients with non-rheumatic, uncomplicated and isolated MVP and 25 healthy control subjects. All individuals underwent full M-mode; two-dimensional and color-Doppler examinations. MVP was defined as superior displacement of the mitral leaflets of more than 2 mm during systole and as a maximal leaflet thickness of at least 5 mm during diastole. Maximum (QTmax), minimum (QTmin) durations, corrected QT intervals and QT dispersion were measured in every case. The results of MVP patients were compared with the data gathered from the control cases. Results: Demographic and clinical variables were similar between the two groups. Anterior mitral leaflet thickness (AMLD), maximal leaflet displacement (DMR) and degree of mitral regurgitation (DMR) were found to be significantly higher in the patient group. QTc max, QT dispersion (QTd) and corrected QT dispersion (QTcD) were also significantly higher in MVP patients. A significant and fairly strong correlation was found between QTc max, QTcD and AMLT, MLD and DMR. Conclusion: <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> were significantly increased in patients with isolated MVP, which may explain increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in this population. Furthermore QT variables were related with the mitral leaflet thickness and degree of mitral regurgitation; which means QT variables increases with the the severity of the disease.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} atrial conduction and ventricular repolarization inhomogeneities using P-wave dispersion (Pwd) and QT dispersion (QTd) analyses in acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Methods: Sixty patients were retrospectively included in this case-controlled study. Thirty acute CO poisoning patients were assigned to the Group with acute CO poisoning (ACOP). Patients who did not have acute CO poisoning were assigned to the control group (Group C, n= 30). Anthropometric measurement, body mass index, electrocardiogram (ECG) and serum electrolyte levels were recorded in all patients. Also, carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels were recorded in Group ACOP. Pwd, QT interval and QTd durations were measured. Corrected QT (QTc) and QTc dispersion (QTcd) intervals were determined with the Bazett formula. Independent samples t and Chi-square tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: No statistically significant difference was found between the age, gender distribution, anthropometric measurement, serum electrolytes, PR and <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> between the groups. The Pwd (56. 33 ± 17. 11 msec vs 28. 33 ± 11. 16 msec, p< 0. 001) and QTd (63. 33 ± 26. 69 msec vs 42. 16 ± 7. 84 msec, p< 0. 001) were significantly longer in Group ACOP than in Group C. In addition, QTc and QTcd durations of Group ACOP were also found to be significantly longer than in Group C (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: In our study, we found in ECG analyses of patients with acute CO poisoning that the Pwd, QTc and QTcd durations were significantly prolonged when compared with control group. For this reason, patients with acute CO poisoning need close attention because of arrhythmias, which can be related to increased QTcd and Pwd durations...|$|E

40|$|Heterologous {{expression}} {{systems such}} as COS- 7 cells have demonstrated the profound effects of KCNAB 1 - 3 or Kvβ 1 - 3 proteins on voltage gated potassium channels (Kv) channels. Indeed, {{in the presence of}} these β-subunits transiently expressed Kv channels are often modulated in multiple ways. Kv channel membrane expression is often increased in the presence of β-subunits. In addition, non-inactivating Kv currents suddenly become fast-inactivating and fast-inactivating channels become even faster. While much research has demonstrated the profound effects the β-subunits in particular the Kvβ 1 subunit have on transiently expressed Kv currents little to date is known of the physiological role it may play. One study demonstrated that by “knocking out” Kvβ 1 cardiomyocyte current changes were noted including a decrease in the Ito,f current. While this novel finding demonstrated a key cardiac physiological role of the Kvβ 1 subunit it left many unanswered questions as to determine the cardiovascular regulation the Kvβ 1 subunit provides. Indeed, cardiac arrhythmias and other electrical abnormalities within the heart such as long QT present patients with many unfortunate unknowns. Many of these incidences occur often abruptly with cardiac electrical abnormalities. Genetic research has begun to shine light on key cardiovascular genes in particular those coding for ion channels and auxiliary subunits or β-subunits. Kv channels and their β-subunits have gained particular notoriety in their key responsibility in restoring the resting membrane potential known as the repolarization phase. Indeed genetic manipulation and physiological examination of Kv channels and recently their β-subunits has demonstrated profound physiological results including prolonged <b>QT</b> <b>durations</b> within mice altered functional activity during physiological cycles such as estrus. While initial findings of Kvβ 1 have demonstrated profound cellular and cardiomyocyte current alterations much still remains unknown. Therefore, this work hypothesizes that the Kvβ 1 subunit provides a profound cardiovascular role in regulation and redox sensing at the physiological and pathophysiological level in both males and females. This work identifies a sex-based difference in cardiovascular regulation by Kvβ 1 as well as demonstrated a profound redox sensing ability during altered metabolic states seen in pathophysiological conditions...|$|E

Results: Patients with normal before-haloperidol QTc duration (male = 450 ms, female >= 470 ms). In contrast, a significant decrease occurred in patients with borderline (male 430 - 450 ms, female 450 - 470 ms) or abnormal before-haloperidol QTc duration (15 ms and 46 ms, respectively); twenty-three percent of patients in the borderline group, and only 9 % of patients in the abnormal group obtained abnormal levels.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess the diagnostic value of common electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters to differentiate Fabry disease (FD), amyloidosis, and nonobstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) from hypertensive heart disease (HHD) and aortic stenosis (AS). In 94 patients with newly diagnosed FD (n = 17), HHD (n = 20), amyloidosis (n = 17), AS (n = 20), and HC (n = 20), common ECG parameters were analyzed and tested for their diagnostic value. A stepwise approach including the Sokolow-Lyon index, corrected <b>QT</b> <b>duration,</b> and PQ interval minus P-wave duration in lead II to overcome P-wave abnormalities was applied. A corrected <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> 440 ms and a Sokolow-Lyon index </= 1. 5 mV were found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 85 % and 100 %, respectively, for the diagnosis of amyloidosis and differentiation from HC, AS, and HHD.

50|$|The QT {{interval}} is {{a measure}} of the combined duration of ventricular depolarization (QRS) and repolarization (T-wave). The QRS complex is usually of fixed duration in healthy individuals and does not change during long-duration space flight. Thus, changes in <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> represent alterations in ventricular repolarization. The QT interval of the surface ECG is a spatial and temporal summation of all cardiac cellular action potentials. Not all cells within the heart share identical action potentials; therefore, a certain degree of variability, or inhomogeneity, in their repolarization time exists. The degree of inhomogeneity during repolarization directly correlates with the overall morphology of the QT waveform (primarily the T-wave) and in most cases with the <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration.</b> A clear association between the magnitude of inhomogeneity of repolarization and the risk for the development of ventricular arrhythmias has been established.|$|R

Interactions between quinidine-related vagolytic properties and autonomic modulation on ventricular repolarization are unknown. The relative role of the two components, if present, might improve {{our understanding of the}} therapeutic and proarrhythmic mechanisms of quinidine on the ventricular tissue. Methods. Rate-related changes in the QT interval were investigated after an abrupt increase in heart rate in 15 patients during atrial pacing. In the control study, the QT interval was measured at six paced cycle lengths (600, 540, 500, 460, 430 and 400 ms) both in the basal state and after autonomic, blockade (intravenous propranolol, 0. 2 mg/kg, and intravenous atropine, 0. 04 mg/kg); oral quinidine was then administered at a daily dosage of 1, 200 mg for 3 to 4 days, after which the <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> was reassessed using the same method in a second study. Results. During the control study, the mean slope of the regression curve estimating the correlation between pacing cycle length and <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> was significantly lower after autonomic blockade (0. 14 ± 0. 05) than in the (0. 27 ± 0. 10, p < 0. 05). Quinidine exhibited a prominent but opposite effect on the mean slope of the regression curves in basal conditions (from 0. 27 ± 0. 10 to 0. 20 ± 0. 07, p < 0. 05) and after withdrawal of autonomic modulation (from 0. 14 ± 0. 05 to 0. 19 ± 0. 05, p < 0. 05), thus annulling the differences observed between the two states in the control study. Conclusions. A quinidine-induced increase in <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> as cycle length is prolonged is consistent with a reverse use dependence effect on ventricular repolarization.

40|$|IntroductionSeveral studies {{proved that}} {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA) is {{associated}} with cardio-vascular diseases such as cardiac arrhythmia. <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> and dispersion reflect the heterogeinity of ventricular repolarization and are considered as precursors of ventricular arrhythmiaAimThe {{aim of this study}} is to assess the relation between the severity of OSA parameters as apnea hypopnea index and QT intervals. MethodsForty patients (18 men and 22 women) who were diagnosed with OSA by overnight polysomnography were included in this prospective study. The mean age was 56 ± 10 years old. They were all in sinus rhythm. Before initiating continuous positive airway pressure therapy, we calculated on a 12 lead ECG : <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> (QTend) corrected to Bazett formula and QT dispersion (QT end max -QT end min). ResultsTwenty four patients had severe OSA (AHI > 30), 4 had moderate OSA (AHI between 15 and 30) and 12 had a mild OSA (AHI between 5 and 15). There was a significant positive correlation between QT dispersion and AHI (r= 0. 48, p= 0. 001) ConclusionThe severity of OSA seems to be correlated with ventricular repolarization heterogeinity These results suggest that the higher is the AHI the higher is the risk of ventricular arrhythmia occurence.

40|$|Background: Abnormalities in the electrocardiographic <b>QT</b> {{interval}} <b>duration</b> {{have been}} associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. However, there is substantial uncertainty about the effect of modifiable factors such as coffee intake, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity on <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration.</b> Methods: We studied 7795 men and women from the Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III, 1988 – 1994). Baseline QT interval was measured from the standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram. Coffee and tea intake, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activities over the past month, and lifetime smoking habits were determined using validated questionnaires during the home interview. Results: In the fully adjusted model, the average differences in QT interval comparing participants drinking $ 6 cups/day to those who did not drink any were 21. 2 ms (95 % CI 24. 4 to 2. 0) for coffee, and 22. 0 ms (211. 2 to 7. 3) for tea, respectively. The average differences in <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> comparing current to never smokers was 1. 2 ms (20. 6 to 2. 9) while the average difference in <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> comparing participants drinking $ 7 drinks/week to non-drinkers was 1. 8 ms (20. 5 to 4. 0). The age, race/ethnicity, and RR-interval adjusted differences in average <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> comparing men with binge drinking episodes to non-drinkers or drinkers without binge drinking were 2. 8 ms (0. 4 to 5. 3) and 4. 0 ms (1. 6 to 6. 4), respectively.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionCardiovascular safety {{assessment}} requires accurate evaluation of QT interval, which {{depends on the}} length of the cardiac cycle and also on core body temperature (BT). Increases in <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> {{have been shown to be}} associated with decreases in BT in dogs. MethodsAn example of altered <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> associated with changes in body temperature observed during a 4 -week regulatory toxicology study in dogs is presented. Four groups of Beagle dogs received the vehicle or test item once on Day 1, followed by a 4 -week observation period. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters were continuously recorded on Days 1 and 26 by jacketed external telemetry (JET). Core body temperature (BT) was measured with a conventional rectal thermometer at appropriate time-points during the Day 1 recording period. ResultsDecreased BT was observed approximately 2 h after treatment on Day 1, along with increased <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> corrected according to the Van de Water formula (QTcV), but the effect was no longer observed after correction for changes in BT [QTcVcT=QTcV− 14 (37. 5 −BT) ] according to the Van der Linde formula. No significant changes in QTcV were reported at the end of the observation period, on Day 26. DiscussionThe present study demonstrates that core body (rectal) temperature can easily be monitored at appropriate time-points during JET recording in regulatory toxicology studies in dogs, in order to correct <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> values for treatment-related changes in BT. The successful application of the Van der Linde formula to correct QTc prolongation for changes in BT was demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{investigated}} the ability of <b>QT</b> <b>duration,</b> <b>QT</b> dispersion (QTD) and clinical diagnostic criteria to correctly identify genetically documented LQT 1 type long QT syndrome (LQTS) patients, and to separate symptomatic and asymptomatic LQT 1 patients. Background. Ventricular repolarization has played an essential role both in diagnosis and risk assessment of LQTS. Today, molecular genetic techniques permit unequivocal identification of many LQTS patients. Methods. QT interval and QTD in 12 symptomatic and 18 asymptomatic LQT 1 patients and their 43 healthy relatives were evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of upper normal limits of QT interval, two QT interval adjustment methods (Bazett’s and Fridericia’s formulas), and the proposed clinical criteria for LQTS were assessed. Occurrence of a mutant (D 188 N) KVLQT 1 gene was considered {{as the basis of}} classification into affected and nonaffected individuals. Results. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity values were 90 % and 88 % using Bazett’s formula, and 80 % and 100 % using Fridericia’s cubic root formula or upper normal limits for QT interval. Suggested diagnostic criteria for LQTS reached 100 % specificity, but 47 % of the DNA-documented LQT 1 patients were classified into the category of low or intermediate probability of LQTS. QT interval and heart rate did not differ between symptomatic (464 ± 47 ms, 70 ± 9 min− 1) and asymptomatic 460 ± 41 ms, 65 ± 13 min− 1) LQT 1 patients. QTD was increased in symptomatic LQT 1 patients compared to unaffected relatives (66 ± 48 vs. 37 ± 15 ms, p = 0. 02), but symptomatic patients LQT 1 did not differ from asymptomatic (45 ± 19 ms). Conclusions. Not all LQT 1 patients can be distinguished from healthy relatives by assessment of <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> or clinical criteria. Presence of LQT 1 gene can carry the risk of cardiac events even with no or only marginal prolongation of QT interval...|$|R

However, the effect of iron overload with cardiac T 2 * magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on cardiac repolarization remains unclear yet. We aimed to examine relationship between repolarization parameters and iron loading using cardiac T 2 * MRI in asymptomatic β-TM patients. Twenty-two β-TM patients and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled to the study. From the 12 -lead surface electrocardiography, regional and transmyocardial repolarization parameters were evaluated manually by two experienced cardiologists. All patients were also undergone MRI for cardiac T 2 * evaluation. Cardiac T 2 * score < 20 [*]msec was considered as iron overload status. Of the <b>QT</b> parameters, <b>QT</b> <b>duration,</b> corrected <b>QT</b> interval, and <b>QT</b> peak <b>duration</b> were significantly longer in the β-TM group compared to the healthy controls.

40|$|BackgroundIn {{the long}} QT {{syndrome}} (LQTS) the clinical efficacy of beta-blocker treatment differs {{according to the}} genotype. We aimed to asses the effect of beta-blocker treatment in LQT 1 and LQT 2 patients. Patients and methods 24 -hour Holter ECG were recorded before and after beta-blocking therapy initiation in genotyped LQT 1 (n= 30, 8 males, mean age 21 ± 17) and LQT 2 patients (n= 16, 8 males, mean age 19 ± 15). <b>QT</b> <b>duration</b> was measured on consecutive 1 -minute averaged QRS-T complexes leading to up to 1440 QT-RR pairs for each recording. Then, we computed subject- and condition-specific log/log QT/RR relationships which were used to calculate <b>QT</b> interval <b>duration</b> at RR= 1000 ms (QT 1000 = 1000 *). ResultsBefore treatment, coefficients were higher in LQT 2 than in LQT 1 patients (0. 53 ± 0. 10 vs. 0. 40 ± 0. 11, p< 0. 001) and QT 1000 was longer in LQT 2 than in LQT 1 patients (521 ± 38 vs. 481 ± 39 ms, p< 0. 01). Beta-blockers significantly prolonged the mean RR interval (RR = 827 ± 161 ms before treatment and 939 ± 197 ms on beta-blocker, p< 0. 0001). The coefficients were not significantly modified by beta-blockers (0. 41 ± 0. 9 in LQT 1 patients and 0. 52 ± 0. 12 LQT 2 patients). Beta-blocker treatment {{was associated with a}} prolongation of the QT 1000 interval (from 481 ± 39 to 498 ± 43 ms, p< 0. 01) in LQT 1 patients but with a shortening in LQT 2 patients (from 521 ± 38 to 503 ± 32 ms, p< 0. 01). ConclusionsOur results confirm the elevated coefficient of the QT/RR relationship in LQTS patients. LQT 2 patients showed higher coefficient and longer QT 1000 when compared to LQT 1 patients. The effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on <b>QT</b> 1000 <b>duration</b> was gene-specific. Given the demonstrated efficacy of beta-blockers in LQT 1 and 2 patients, our data suggest that QT 1000 might be a poor predictor of outcome under anti-adrenergic therapy...|$|R
