40|$|This paper {{considers}} a single-item replenishment problem where every n periods the buyer {{plans for the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> for each upcoming period. Assuming that demand not filled immediately is backlogged, we suggest that the <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> in the immediately upcoming period be of any size and the <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> {{in each of the}} subsequent (n- 1) periods be equal to or smaller than a fixed quantity Q. We derive the average cost per n periods and compute the optimal order-up-to level for the proposed replenishment policy. Next, assuming a fixed cost for reviewing inventory and planning deliveries, we obtain the optimal n by minimizing the expected cost per period. Finally, the optimal Q can also be determined. The proposed periodic review policy is easy to implement. Inventory Periodic review Stochastic model...|$|R

50|$|The lack of {{charcoal}} continued under Ancher & Wærn's ownership of Moss Jernverk, {{even though they}} paid better than other iron works and gave bonus to those that delivered more than requested. The main reason for dismal <b>quantities</b> <b>delivered</b> was that producing charcoal almost always was less profitable than other use of the timber. Under his ownership, Bernt Anker {{tried to get the}} authorities' permission to have a certain <b>quantity</b> charcoal <b>delivered</b> from each farm.|$|R

30|$|From the {{observations}} {{in the existing}} literature in which the ordering cost is fixed per cycle, it is seen that whenever the number of replenishment cycles is more, the ordering cost be very high than the ordering cost in one cycle though in each case total <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> is same in finite time horizon. Practically, in real business world, this concept is not completely error free. Again, whenever number of replenishment cycles is more then the shipment cost is reduced inversely since the <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> is less per cycle. That is, if a_ 1 be the shipment cost for total quantity Q to be delivered in one time in the business period then for n replenishment, the shipment cost per cycle will be a_ 1 /n, since {{in this case the}} total <b>quantity</b> Q is <b>delivered</b> in n cycle of amount Q/n per cycle. So, the shipment cost per cycle varies inversely with n. Again, if the total <b>quantity</b> Q is <b>delivered</b> in more than one cycle, clearly due to the processing the delivery supplier must claim an extra charge which is known as processing cost. Notedly, this type of cost will be increased whenever number of replenishment cycles also increases. That is, the ordering cost can not be constant for a fixed time horizon. But, till now, no one has considered variable ordering cost depending on replenishment cycle in a fixed time horizon.|$|R

50|$|The Average OLT {{based on}} Volume (OLTV) is the {{addition}} of all the multiplications between the volume of product we <b>deliver</b> (<b>quantity)</b> and the OLT divided by the total <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> {{in the period of}} time we are studying for that specific facility. By doing this the company will {{be able to find a}} relation of volume weighted between the quantities of material required for an order and the time requested to accomplish it. The volume metric could be applied to the 4 types of OLT. The figure obtained from this calculation will be the average time (e.g. in days) between order placing and the requested delivery date of a specific customer under consideration of the average quantities ordered during that particular time.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} design required 42000 t for the cantilevers only, of which 12000 t {{was to come}} from Siemens' steel works in Landore, Wales and the remainder from the Steel Company of Scotland's works near Glasgow. When modifications to the design necessitated a further 16000 t, about half of this was supplied by the Steel Company of Scotland Ltd. and half by Dalzell's Iron and Steel Works in Motherwell. About 4200 t of rivets came from the Clyde Rivet Company of Glasgow. Around three or four thousand tons of steel was scrapped, some of which was used for temporary purposes, resulting in {{the discrepancy between the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> and the <b>quantity</b> erected.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Provided {{that energy}} {{consumption}} goes together with CO 2 emissions and high production costs, multinational companies seek perpetually {{to implement the}} best practices {{in an effort to}} satisfy customers not in terms of fair prices, quality and <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered</b> but also in terms of delivering products that respect environmental regulations. It seems that it is no longer optional for companies to opt for environmental practices, while having two major reasons to remain cost efficient and customer seductive: their production processes will no more tolerate waste in energy and their customers are consciously more than ever seeking eco-friendly products. In this paper, we conduct a cost analysis based on a comparison traditional with eco-friendly technologies in manufacturing detergent products based on different sources of energy...|$|R
40|$|The {{variable}} energy {{characteristics of}} solid wastes, biomass and other low grade fuels, when utilized in cogeneration applications, introduce several additional plant design considerations. The effects of longer term heating value and/or quantity variability of these energy sources, beyond that {{which can be}} outdated by fuel storage, can {{have a significant impact}} on plant equipment selection and performance. This paper discusses the impact of this fuel variability on plant equipment sizing and energy production, and its effect on system economic evaluation. The effects of the range of heating values, <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered,</b> process heat to power requirement and use of supplemental fuel will be illustrated and described. The relative economics of alternatives for a specific cogeneration application will be developed and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The player earns {{revenue by}} picking up {{resources}} or passengers at a certain station, and delivering them to another station {{where there is a}} demand for them. Demand is determined by the area which surrounds the station; for example stations close to towns will demand passengers. The revenues will depend on the delivery time, distance, and <b>quantity</b> <b>delivered.</b> The influence of these factors on revenue varies according to the type of goods being delivered. For example, mail will rapidly fall in value, meaning that it can only be delivered profitably over short distances, or over long distances very fast. On the other hand, coal loses value very slowly, so it can be transported in bulk over long distances whilst remaining profitable.|$|R
