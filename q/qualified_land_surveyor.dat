50|$|Details of Whitworth's {{early life}} {{have not been}} found, but in 1761 he {{produced}} plans of an estate in Erringden, by which {{time he was a}} <b>qualified</b> <b>land</b> <b>surveyor.</b> He undertook a variety of tasks, which included measuring the stonework of Sowerby Church, so that the contractors who had built it could be paid the correct amount, and conducting a survey of the religious affiliations of families in Sowerby. Although its purpose is unknown, he surveyed part of the River Calder and produced a plan. The engineer John Smeaton had been working on the Calder and Hebble Navigation since 1759, working upstream from Wakefield. There is no direct evidence to connect the two men, but it seems likely that Whitworth would have taken an interest in such a significant project, and that he learnt a great deal from watching Smeaton's methods.|$|E
