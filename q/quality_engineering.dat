40|$|Flight {{simulators}} {{are integral}} to the design/development, testing/qualification, training and research communities and their utilisation is expanding rapidly. The quantification of simulation fidelity underpins the confidence required {{for the use of}} flight simulation in design, to reduce real life testing, and to provide a safe environment for pilot training. Whilst regulatory simulator standards exist and new standards are in development, previous research has shown that current standards do not provide a fully quantitative approach for assessing simulation fidelity, even in a research environment. This paper reports progress on developments of the HELFLIGHT-R flight simulator at the University of Liverpool, and its subsequent use in a research project (Lifting Standards) aimed at creating new predicted and perceived measures of simulator fidelity, derived from handling <b>qualities</b> <b>engineering.</b> Results from flight tests on the National Research Council (Canada) Bell 412 ASRA research aircraft and HELIFLIGHT-R piloted simulation trials are presented to show the strong connection between handling <b>qualities</b> <b>engineering</b> and fidelity assessment. The issue of (pilot) perceived fidelity is examined and the development of new metrics discussed. Copyright (c) 2010 by the American Helicopter Society International, Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
