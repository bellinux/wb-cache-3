5|$|During the 9th century, the Tang seaport at Guangzhou {{had a large}} Muslim population. During the Song dynasty the {{importance}} of the latter seaport declined as the ports of <b>Quanzhou</b> and Fuzhou in Fujian province eclipsed it. This was followed by a decline of Middle Eastern sea merchants in China and an increasing amount of Chinese ship owners engaging in maritime trade. However, Middle Eastern merchants and other foreigners were not entirely absent, and some even gained administrative posts. For example, the Muslim Pu Shougeng—of either Persian or Arab descent—served as the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for <b>Quanzhou</b> between the years 1250 and 1275. There was also the Arab astronomer Ma Yize (910–1005), who became the chief astronomer of the Song court under Taizu. Aside from these elites, Chinese seaports were filled with resident Arabs, Persians, and Koreans who had special enclaves designated for each of them.|$|E
5|$|As {{the once}} great Indian Ocean {{maritime}} {{power of the}} Chola dynasty in medieval India had waned and declined, Chinese sailors and seafarers began to increase their own maritime activity in South East Asia and into the Indian Ocean. Even during the earlier Northern Song period, when {{it was written in}} Tamil inscriptions under the reign of Rajendra Chola I that Srivijaya had been completely taken in 1025 by Chola's naval strength, the succeeding king of Srivijaya managed to send tribute to the Chinese Northern Song court in 1028. Much later, in 1077, the Indian Chola ruler Kulothunga Chola I (who the Chinese called Ti-hua-kia-lo) sent a trade embassy to the court of Emperor Shenzong of Song, and made lucrative profits in selling goods to China. There were other tributary payers from other regions of the world as well. The Fatimid-era Egyptian sea captain Domiyat traveled to a Buddhist site of pilgrimage in Shandong in 1008, where he presented the Chinese Emperor Zhenzong of Song with gifts from his ruling Imam Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, establishing diplomatic relations between Egypt and China that had been lost during the collapse of the Tang dynasty in 907 (while the Fatimid state was established three years later in 910). During the Northern Song, <b>Quanzhou</b> was already a bustling port of call visited by a plethora of different foreigners, from Muslim Arabs, Persians, Egyptians, Hindu Indians, Middle-Eastern Jews, Nestorian Christians from the Near East, etc. Muslims from foreign nations dominated the import and export industry (see Islam during the Song dynasty). To regulate this enormous commercial center, in 1087 the Northern Song government established an office in <b>Quanzhou</b> {{for the sole purpose of}} handling maritime affairs and commercial transactions. In this multicultural environment there were many opportunities for subjects in the empire of foreign descent, such as the (Arab or Persian) Muslim Pu Shougeng, the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for <b>Quanzhou</b> between 1250 and 1275. Pu Shougeng had gained his reputable position by helping the Chinese destroy pirate forces that plagued the area, and so was lavished with gifts and appraisal from Chinese merchants and officials. <b>Quanzhou</b> soon rivaled Guangzhou (the greatest maritime port of the earlier Tang dynasty) as a major trading center during the late Northern Song. However, Guangzhou had not fully lost its importance. The medieval Arab maritime captain Abu Himyarite from Yemen toured Guangzhou in 993, and was an avid visitor to China. There were other notable international seaports in China during the Song period as well, including Xiamen (or Amoy).|$|E
5|$|By October1, {{officials}} in Mainland China issued warnings for Fujian Province and urged residents to evacuate. An estimated 537,000people heeded these warnings in Fujian and a further 86,000 and 61,860 evacuated in Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces, respectively. The majority of evacuees {{were from the}} cities of Ningde, Fuzhou, Putian, <b>Quanzhou,</b> Xiamen, and Zhangzhou, with 376,000 evacuating from Xiamen alone. Along the coast, roughly 38,000seagoing vessels returned to port. Thousands of {{officials in}} the province oversaw flood preparations. Public transportation across Fujian Province was temporarily suspended as well. The airport in Xiamen shut down late on October2 as rain bands from the storm began impacting the area. Throughout Fujian, more than 120flights were canceled.|$|E

Along with Fuzhou's Gushan Spring Temple (鼓山涌泉寺), <b>Quanzhou's</b> Kaiyuan Temple (开元寺), and Xiamen's Nanputuo Temple, the Guanghua Temple {{was known as}} one of the four great Buddhist monasteries or Conglin (丛林) of Fujian Province.|$|R
5|$|During the Qing Dynasty's two-century {{rule over}} Taiwan, the {{population}} of Han on the island increased dramatically. However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and <b>Quanzhou</b> in Fujian province, or from a variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth. Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.|$|E
5|$|In Taiwan, where Morakot {{first made}} landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} resulted in flooding. Commercial flights, schools, and rail service {{in some areas}} was cancelled {{in advance of the}} storm. Precipitation there peaked at 653mm (25.71in) over a period of nearly two days in Taitung County. Crop damage also resulted from the rainfall, and was estimated at over NT$70million (US$2million). In China, record rainfall was reported. The worst impacted city was <b>Quanzhou,</b> where losses due to Morakot reached CN¥240million (US$29million) and one death was reported. Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China. Due to preexisting drought conditions, 703cloud seeding operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area. Overall, Morakot caused roughly $31million in damage and three deaths.|$|E
5|$|Su Song was a Hokkien who {{was born}} in modern-day Fujian, near medieval <b>Quanzhou.</b> Like a contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031–1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose {{expertise}} spans a significant number of different interests. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose {{to the top of the}} examination list for writing the best essay on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time he was fond of writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049–1106). He also was an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties.|$|E

On the right, southeastern side, Licheng District includes a much larger area, with both urban and suburban parts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sources of}} the Shijing River are in the hilly area near the border of <b>Quanzhou's</b> Nan'an City and Xiamen's Xiang'an District. The Shibi Reservoir (石壁水库; dam at [...] ) {{constructed}} in 1955-1958 on the upper course of the Daying Stream (...) (one of the Shijing's tributaries) is used for irrigation and water supply in several towns within the county-level cities of Nan'an and Jinjiang. The reservoir also has a 1 MW hydroelectric plant.|$|R
5|$|The sails {{of these}} vessels {{are made of}} strips of bamboo, woven into the form of matting. The sailors never lower them (while sailing, but simply) change the {{direction}} of them according to whether {{the wind is blowing}} from one side or the other. When the ships cast anchor, the sails are left standing in the wind. Each of these ships is worked by 1,000 men, 600 sailors and 400 marines, among whom there are archers and crossbowmen furnished with shields, and men who throw (pots of) naptha. Each great vessel is followed by three others, a 'nisfi', a 'thoulthi' and a 'roubi' (f endnote: a pinnace, a small boat fitted with a rudder, and a rowing boat). These vessels are nowhere made except in the city of Zayton (<b>Quanzhou)</b> in China, or at Sin-Kilan, which is the same as Sin al-Sin (Guangzhou).|$|E
5|$|Any hope of {{resistance}} was centered on two young princes, Emperor Gong's brothers. The older boy, Zhao Shi, who {{was nine years}} old, was declared emperor on June 14, 1276, in Fuzhou. The court sought refuge in <b>Quanzhou,</b> seeking an alliance with the Superintendent of Maritime Shipping, the Muslim Pu Shougeng. However, he secretly formed an alliance with Kublai, so the Song court was forced to flee in 1277. The court then sought refuge in Silvermine Bay (Mui Wo) on Lantau Island. The older brother became ill and died on May 8, 1278 at age ten, and was succeeded by his younger brother who became Emperor Huaizong of Song, aged seven. The Sung Wong Toi monument in Kowloon commemorates his enthronement. On March 19, 1279 the Song army was defeated in its last battle, the Battle of Yamen, fought against the Yuan army led by the Chinese general Zhang Hongfan in the Pearl River Delta. Song Prime Minister Lu Xiufu {{is said to have}} taken the boy emperor in his arms and jumped from his sinking ship into the sea, drowning both of them.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Chinese {{living in}} capital city Jakarta and other towns located in Java are not fluent in Chinese languages, due to New Order's banning of Chinese languages, {{but those who}} are living in non-Java cities {{especially}} in Sumatra and Kalimantan are enabled to speak Chinese and its dialects fluently. The Chinese along the North-Eastern coast of Sumatra, especially in North Sumatra, Riau, Riau Islands and Jambi are predominantly Hokkien speakers, {{and there are also}} two different variants of Hokkien being used, such as Medan Hokkien, which is based on the Zhangzhou dialect and Riau Hokkien, which is based on the <b>Quanzhou</b> dialect. There are also Hokkien speakers in Java, Sulawesi and Kalimantan (Borneo). Meanwhile, the Hakkas are the majority in Aceh, Bangka-Belitung and West Kalimantan north of Pontianak. Some Hakkas also live in parts of Java. The Cantonese peoples mainly living in big cities like Jakarta, Medan, Batam, Surabaya and Pontianak. The Teochew people become the majority in West Kalimantan especially in Central to Southern area such as Ketapang, Kendawangan and Pontianak, as well as in Riau Islands.

5000|$|Its Arabic name Zaiton or [...] "Zayton" [...] (...) , once {{popular in}} English, means [...] "City of Olives" [...] {{and is a}} calque of <b>Quanzhou's</b> former Chinese {{nickname}} Citong Cheng meaning [...] "tung-tree city", which {{is derived from the}} avenues of oil-bearing tung trees ordered to be planted around the city by the city's 10th-century ruler Liu Congxiao. Variant transcriptions from the Arabic name include Caiton, Çaiton, Çayton, Zaytún, Zaitûn, Zaitún, and Zaitūn.

5000|$|The Jin dynasty {{was founded}} in [...] 265 by Sima Yan, posthumously known as Emperor Wu (the [...] "Martial Emperor of Jin"). He forced Cao Huan's abdication but {{permitted}} him to live in honor as the prince of Chenliu and buried him with imperial ceremony. The Jin dynasty conquered the Eastern Wu in 280, and united the country. The period of unity was shortlived as the state was soon weakened by corruption, political turmoil, and internal conflicts. Sima Yan's son Zhong, posthumously known as Emperor Hui (the [...] "Benevolent Emperor of Jin"), was developmentally disabled. Conflict over his succession in 290 expanded into the devastating War of the Eight Princes. The weakened dynasty was then engulfed by the Uprising of the Five Barbarians and lost control of northern China. Large numbers of Chinese fled south from the Central Plains; among other effects, these refugees and colonizers gave <b>Quanzhou's</b> Jin River its name as they settled its valley in Fujian. The Jin capital Luoyang was captured by Liu Cong in 311. Sima Chi, posthumously known as Emperor Huai (the [...] "Missing Emperor of Jin"), was captured and later executed. His successor Sima Ye, posthumously known as Emperor Min (the [...] "Suffering Emperor of Jin"), was captured at Chang'an (present-day Xi'an) in 316 and also later executed.|$|R
5|$|Tropical Storm Morakot, {{known in}} the Philippines as Tropical Storm Juaning, brought {{significant}} rainfall to Taiwan before alleviating drought conditions in mainland China in August2003. The tenth named storm in the western Pacific that year, Morakot spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July31. Tracking northwest, favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August2. Morakot reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85km/h (50mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system; {{this was followed by}} Morakot making landfall on southern Taiwan on August3. Subsequently, the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near <b>Quanzhou,</b> China the next day. The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland, and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall.|$|E
5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as paddle wheel craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful paddle wheel warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had paddle wheel warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and paddle wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle wheel craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle wheel craft into junk ships and galleys) not to limit the number of paddle wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, paddle wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for <b>Quanzhou,</b> the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that paddle wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E
25|$|Li Nu, {{the son of}} Li Lu, from a Han Chinese Li {{family in}} <b>Quanzhou</b> visited Hormuz in Persia in 1376. He married a Persian or an Arab girl, and {{brought her back to}} <b>Quanzhou.</b> He then {{converted}} to Islam. Li Nu was the ancestor of Ming Dynasty reformer Li Chih.|$|E
25|$|In 1277, when Fuzhou {{fell to the}} Mongols, {{the exiled}} dynasty fled to <b>Quanzhou,</b> where Zhang Shijie, the Grand General of Song, hoped to borrow boats to {{continue}} their flight. However, the Muslim merchant Fu Shougeng refused their request, prompting Zhang to confiscate Fu's properties and flee on stolen boats with the Song court. In fury, Fu slaughtered the imperial clan and many officials in <b>Quanzhou</b> and surrendered to the Yuan, strengthening the Mongols' naval power.|$|E

25|$|Hinduism {{is practiced}} by a {{minority}} of residents of China. The religion itself has a very limited presence in modern mainland China, but archaeological evidence suggests the presence of Hinduism in different provinces of medieval China. Hindu influences were also absorbed in the country through the spread of Buddhism over its history. Practices originating in the Vedic tradition of ancient India such as yoga and meditation are also popular in China.Hindu community, particularly through Tamil merchant guilds of Ayyavole and Manigramam, once thrived in medieval South China; evidence of Hindu motifs and temples, {{such as in the}} Kaiyuan Temple, continue to be discovered in <b>Quanzhou,</b> Fujian province of southeast China.

When introduced in January 2001, they allowed only those with household registrations in Kinmen and Matsu to use the trade links, as well as China-based Taiwan businessmen. Travels must be done in groups. Restrictions were lifted to allow individual travelers, as well as to open the routes to former residents and relatives of Kinmen and Matsu. <b>Quanzhou</b> was also added to the list in the same year.|$|E
25|$|In the East, {{a certain}} degree of {{cultural}} and artistic interaction is known due to the development of Christianity among the Mongols.

25|$|Admiral Zheng He {{may have}} left the Chinese coast {{in the autumn of}} 1417. Admiral Zheng He first made port at <b>Quanzhou</b> to load up the fleet's cargoholds with {{porcelain}} and other goods. Archaeological finds of contemporary Chinese porcelain have been excavated at the East African places visited by Zheng He's fleet. A Ming tablet at <b>Quanzhou</b> commemorates that Admiral Zheng He burned incense for divine protection for this voyage on 31 May 1417. The fleet visited the following places: Champa, Pahang, Java, Palembang, Malacca, Semudera, Lambri, Ceylon, Cochin, Calicut, Shaliwanni (possibly Cannanore), Liushan (Maladive and Laccadive Islands), Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and Malindi. For Arabia and East Africa, the most-likely route was Hormuz, Lasa, Aden, Mogadishu, Brava, Zhubu, and then Malindi. Duyvendak suggested that Zheng He made a show of military force at Mogadishu and Lasa due to the unwelcome reception by the locals.|$|E
