The use of multi-threading masks {{the effect of}} memory latency by increasing processor utilization. As one thread stalls, additional threads are instantly fed into the pipeline and executed, resulting in a significant gain in application throughput. Users can allocate dedicated processing bandwidth to real-time tasks resulting in a guaranteed <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> (<b>QoS).</b> MIPS’ MT technology constantly monitors the progress of threads and dynamically takes corrective actions to meet or exceed the real-time requirements. A processor pipeline can achieve 80-90% utilization by switching threads during data-dependent stalls or cache misses. All of this leads to an improved mobile device user experience, as responsiveness is greatly increased.|$|E

Selection <b>of</b> <b>service</b> still is an important challenge, especially, when a set <b>of</b> <b>services</b> fulfilling user’s capabilities requirements have been discovered, among these services which one will be eventually invoked by user is very critical, generally depending on a combined evaluation <b>of</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>services</b> (<b>Qos).</b> This paper proposes a QoS-based selection <b>of</b> <b>services.</b> Initially we specify a QoS ontology and its vocabulary using the Web Services Modeling Ontology (WSMO) for annotating service descriptions with QoS data. We continue by defining quality attributes and their respective measurements along with a QoS selection model.

40|$|We present new {{admission}} {{tests for}} periodic real-time threads with explicitly stated deadlines scheduled {{according to the}} earliest deadline first (EDF) algorithm. In traditional real-time periodic scheduling, the deadline of a periodic thread is conventionally {{the end of the}} current period. In contrast, our tests support periodic threads in which the deadline may be earlier than the end of the current period. In the extreme case, the deadline may be specified as identical to the per period execution time, which results in perfectly isochronous periodic threads. The provision of such threads, which we refer to as jitter constrained threads, helps end-systems to honour jitter- as well as throughput-related QoS parameters in distributed multimedia systems. In addition, such threads can reduce end-toend delay and buffer memory requirements as less buffering is needed to smooth excessive delay jitter. 1.

25|$|The MIPS MT {{architecture}} {{also allows}} {{the allocation of}} processor cycles to threads, and sets the relative thread priorities with an optional <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> (<b>QoS)</b> manager block. This enables two prioritization mechanisms that determine {{the flow of information}} across the bus. The first mechanism allows the user to prioritize one thread over another. The second mechanism is used to allocate a specified ratio of the cycles to specific threads over time. The combined use of both mechanisms allows effective allocation of bandwidth to the set of threads, and better control of latencies. In real-time systems, system-level determinism is very critical, and the QoS block facilitates improvement of the predictability of a system. Hardware designers of advanced systems may replace the standard QoS block provided by MIPS Technologies with one that is specifically tuned for their application.|$|E

This policy is called FP/FIFO. However real time applications have deadline requirements which aren’t taken into account with the I O discipline. That is why we propose to introduce the Earliest Deadline First (D) discipline to schedule applications sharing a same priority.

In a first step, all quality characteristics are identified from related international standards or specifications ("identification"). Those that are essential and decision-relevant for end user perception are chosen next ("rating"). They have to be selected for evaluation ('selection') and quantified ("quantification") before simple, objective, and cost-effective evaluation methods can be used ("evaluation") in the last step. 2.

The author hypothesizes that shared roadways should only be implemented when automobile Level <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> (LOS), bicycle LOS, and facility safety are "acceptable. " The author accomplishes the objectives by generating data using microsimulation models. The author uses microsimulation model data to evaluate automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> on shared roadways. In the evaluation <b>of</b> automobile <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> the measures <b>of</b> effectiveness are automobile LOS threshold (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in automobile LOS) and automobile average travel speed (the average travel time divided by the segment length, a space mean speed). To compare automobile and bicycle <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> the author uses the bicycle LOS model in NCHRP Report 616 to generate bicycle LOS thresholds (the maximum automobile flow-rate before a change in bicycle LOS). After generating bicycle LOS thresholds, the author compares the bicycle LOS thresholds to the automobile LOS thresholds.
