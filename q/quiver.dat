5|$|The Byzantine cavalry {{was armed}} with a long sword, known as the spathion. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a kontarion and a bow (toxarion) with forty arrows in a <b>quiver,</b> hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as skoutatoi, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the {{shoulder}} across the back and a <b>quiver</b> of arrows. Cavalry armor consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant, i.e. a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armor. Light lamellar and scale armor was also used.|$|E

5|$|His {{research}} and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted {{the government to}} initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a <b>quiver</b> of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating 388 crores for the mission, named Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.|$|E
5|$|Hartlaub {{considered}} the chestnut sparrow's colouration and morphology to be distinct enough to allocate {{it to its}} own monotypic genus, Sorella. Although a few authors have followed Hartlaub's treatment, it is usually placed in the genus Passer. It {{is very similar to}} the two golden sparrows, from which it may have once been only clinally different. The male Arabian golden sparrow is almost entirely gold-coloured, the male chestnut sparrow is mostly chestnut, and the male Sudan golden sparrow is intermediate between the two. British ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen {{considered the}}se three species to be conspecific; however, the range of the Sudan golden sparrow overlaps with that of the chestnut sparrow without any known interbreeding in a small area of Sudan. These species are similar in their behaviour, which is adapted to the unpredictable conditions of their arid habitat. In particular, they and the Dead Sea sparrow share a courtship display in which males <b>quiver</b> their wings above their body. This intense display is probably an adaptation to nesting in a clump of trees surrounded by similar habitat, where such an intense display may serve important purposes in keeping a colony together.|$|E
25|$|Here, {{rather than}} the two straps that cross around Artemis A's chest, only one strap crosses over the figure's right {{shoulder}} and under her left arm, supporting part of the <b>quiver</b> that is still intact. The <b>quiver</b> itself was cast separately {{from the rest of}} the statue and had to be reattached to the statue at some point in antiquity, setting the <b>quiver</b> in a slightly different position than it had been originally. The <b>quiver</b> strap itself is also elaborate; it is decorated with a meander and dot pattern with silver inlay.|$|E

25|$|One {{special case}} {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact on representation theory, namely the representation theory of quivers. A <b>quiver</b> is simply a directed graph (with loops and multiple arrows allowed), but it can be made into a category (and also an algebra) by considering paths in the graph. Representations of such categories/algebras have illuminated several aspects of representation theory, for instance by allowing non-semisimple representation theory questions about a group to be reduced in some cases to semisimple representation theory questions about a <b>quiver.</b>|$|E

25|$|The taller {{of the two}} Artemis statues, a <b>quiver</b> strap runs diagonally {{over the}} figure's right {{shoulder}} and under her left arm. There is a trace of lead solder on the strap on the statue’s back, which shows where the <b>quiver</b> was attached. Her hand still contains a lump of clay {{that was used to}} anchor her bow. There are also two small, bronze remnants of a phiale (offering bowl) that she would have held in her upturned right hand.

25|$|The goddess's {{reputation}} {{as not only}} a protector but a huntress becomes much clearer in fourth-century statuary.

25|$|Artemis {{may have}} been {{represented}} as a supporter of Troy because her brother Apollo was the patron god {{of the city and}} she herself was widely worshipped in western Anatolia in historical times.

Hera struck Artemis on the ears with her own <b>quiver,</b> causing the arrows to fall out. As Artemis fled crying to Zeus, Leto gathered up the bow and arrows.|$|E
