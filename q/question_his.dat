5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion experience was necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to <b>question</b> <b>his</b> theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E

5|$|Bitterest {{of all was}} the {{whispering}} campaign {{directed at}} Anthony Molloy, captain of HMS Caesar. Molloy was accused of cowardice by fellow officers for his failure to follow Howe's orders on both 29 May and 1 June.

5|$|His {{performances}} merited {{inclusion in}} the national team and {{attracted the attention of}} Liverpool's manager Graeme Souness, who bought Bjørnebye for £600,000 less than one year after moving to Rosenborg. Signed as a replacement for David Burrows, Bjørnebye debuted inauspiciously on 19 December 1992 in a 5–1 defeat to Coventry City. Initial difficulties adapting to the Premier League caused many fans to <b>question</b> <b>his</b> displays on the pitch and he returned to Norway on loan to Rosenborg in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In his ministerial role, Constantine {{promoted}} {{development of}} Trinidad's road, rail, {{water and electricity}} infrastructure. However, in late 1958 {{he was accused of}} corruption, over a ship leasing deal. His angry response to the charge, in the Legislative Council, created a perception of arrogance among his colleagues, and suggested that he had not sufficiently adapted to parliamentary politics. According to Mason, the speech was a miscalculation which made the public, perhaps already sceptical of his commitment to Trinidad after so many years away, <b>question</b> <b>his</b> fitness for a ministerial role, a view increasingly held by commentators.|$|E

5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony Froude published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts {{the causes and}} consequences of a young priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, Froude came to <b>question</b> <b>his</b> Christian faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. Froude was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the new approach to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E

5|$|Across the Way is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him <b>question</b> <b>his</b> sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead of Sparks. The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E

5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} of the House in 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money <b>question.</b> <b>His</b> leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace for control of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E

Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him.|$|E
5|$|Blade Runner is a 1982 American neo-noir {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Ridley Scott, written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, and starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, and Edward James Olmos.

5|$|Farrell was {{inspired}} to try acting when Henry Thomas' performance in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial moved him to tears. With his brother's encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, dropping out when he was cast as Danny Byrne on Ballykissangel, a BBC drama about a young English priest who becomes part of an Irish rural community. As an 18-year-old travelling in Sydney, he was at one time suspected for attempted murder. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in <b>question.</b> <b>His</b> only alibi was apparently a journal kept by his friend that explained the two had been across town that night, taking MDMA.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to obscure}} the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts {{spreading}} a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside Kevin (Brian Baumgartner), that Kelly is anorexic, that Toby (Paul Lieberstein) is still a virgin, that Pam (Jenna Fischer) is pregnant, and that Andy (Ed Helms) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this {{about him in the}} past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to <b>question</b> <b>his</b> sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.|$|E
5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} {{an existential}} quest {{to establish his}} identity, seemingly finding an answer in the PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to <b>question</b> <b>his</b> own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E
