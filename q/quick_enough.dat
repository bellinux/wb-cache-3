It took a run out to remove Morris; he {{attempted}} a quick run to third man after being called through by Tallon but was not <b>quick</b> <b>enough</b> for the substitute fielder's arm, leaving Australia at 8/359. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring, before both were out on 389, ending Australia's innings. In the second innings, Tallon caught Hutton from Miller and conceded nine byes as England were dismissed for 188 and lost by an innings, sealing a 40 series victory for Australia.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time <b>quick</b> <b>enough</b> to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|Not many predators {{challenge}} {{an adult}} black mamba {{although it does}} face a few threats such as birds of prey, particularly snake eagles. Although all species of snake eagle commonly prey on snakes, there are two species in particular that do so with high frequency, including preying on black mambas. These are the black-chested snake eagle (Circaetus pectoralis) and the brown snake eagle (Circaetus cinereus). The Cape file snake (Mehelya capensis), which is apparently immune to all African snake venoms and preys on other snakes including venomous ones, is a common predator of black mambas (limited only by the size it can swallow). Mongooses, which also are partially immune to venom, and are often <b>quick</b> <b>enough</b> to evade a bite, will sometimes tackle a black mamba for prey. Humans do not usually consume black mambas, but they often kill them out of fear.|$|E

5|$|The Union {{increased}} its pace with Andrew Wenger playing wide {{on the left}} where he repeatedly got past Yedlin {{to get to the}} byline or cut back to shoot. Maidana and Le Toux strengthened Philadelphia's position by combining {{on the other side of}} the field to penetrate Seattle's defense. Wenger connected with Le Toux who took a shot, but Seattle goalkeeper Stefan Frei was <b>quick</b> <b>enough</b> to make the stop. In the 38th minute, Maidana was fouled by Leonardo González wide right of the penalty area. Maidana's resulting free kick curled towards the back post where Brad Evans lost his footing and Edu glanced the ball with his forehead to put it in the back of the net. The home team kept control of the first half and continued creating scoring opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{came out}} for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was not}} <b>quick</b> <b>enough</b> to make something of the chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} race as a three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate <b>quick</b> <b>enough</b> and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E

5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his eighth pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, in a time of 1:35.825. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Häkkinen, who was nine thousands of a second slower than his championship rival and battled him for grid position throughout the session. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified third, and conceded that he was not <b>quick</b> <b>enough</b> to challenge for pole position. The two Williams drivers qualified on the third row of the grid; Button ahead of Ralf Schumacher although both drivers had mixed feelings over their performance. Both Jaguar drivers took seventh and tenth and were satisifed with their pace. Frentzen reported that his car was difficult to handle but was happy to manage an qualifying position of eighth. Villeneuve took ninth despite suffering from excessive oversteer and was unable to improve his time because he changed his car in the opposite direction. Herbert who rounded out the top ten felt he could have qualified on the fourth row despite changes to his set-up. Wurz qualified eleventh and missed on qualifying in the top ten by nearly two thousands of a second. His teammate Fisichella started from twelfth position and reported his car lost performance after the morning practice sessions. Both Arrows drivers filled the seventh row of the grid–de la Rosa was faster than Verstappen–and were affected with problems on the cars limiting their running. Trulli had car handling issues and qualified 15th. Heidfeld qualified 16th, ahead of teammate Jean Alesi. Zonta had limited qualifying time because of an engine change and managed 18th overall. The tenth row of the grid was filled by both Sauber drivers; Mika Salo in front of Pedro Diniz. Salo used the spare Sauber because his race car had alternator issues. Both of Diniz's two fastest qualifying times were disallowed because of him laying oil on the circuit in the morning practice sessions. The two Minardi drivers qualified {{at the rear of the}} grid with Marc Gené ahead of Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E

40|$|The {{dispersion}} of longitudinal stress waves as they propagate in pressure bars distorts {{the shape of}} the puise, and so can be a limitation to the accuracy of high strain rate tests such as the compressive split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB). The method of dispersion correction described in this paper is based on a bar phase characteristic which is derived entirely from measured stress pulses generated by the elastic impact of small spheres. This method does not depend on any theoretical model of wave propagation, and automatically includes all distortions that could arise in mechanical or electronic aspects of the test.

A {{case in point}} is simulation-based optimization of complex systems. An obvious idea to push the improvement one step further is to combine several VRTs for a given simulation. But such combinations often give rise to new issues. This paper studies the combination of stratification with control variates. We detail and compare several ways of doing the combination. Nontrivial synergies between the two methods are exhibited. We illustrate this with a telephone call center simulation, where we combine a control variate with stratification with respect to one of the uniform random variates that drive the simulation. It turns out that using more information in the control variate degrades the performance (significantly) in our example. This seemingly paradoxical behavior is not rare and our theoretical analysis explains why...|$|R
