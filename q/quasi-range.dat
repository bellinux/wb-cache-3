40|$|Building {{from the}} {{consideration}} of closeness, we propose the mode <b>quasi-range</b> as an alternative scale parameter. Application of this scale parameter to formulate the population standard deviation is investigated leading to an efficient sample estimator of standard deviation {{from the point of}} asymptotic variance. Monte Carlo studies, in terms of finite sample efficiency and robustness of breakdown point, have been performed for the sample mode <b>quasi-range.</b> This study reveals that this closeness consideration-based mode, <b>quasi-range,</b> is satisfactory because these statistical procedures based on it are efficient and are less misleading for drawing conclusion from the sample results. breakdown point, range, robustness, <b>quasi-range,</b> scale parameter,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} one of {{the primary}} problems of visual information processing known as image restoration. Image restoration is a challenging task because of its ill-posed inverse nature. A modified Hopfield neural network with fuzzy adaptive regularization is proposed that shows potential to minimize constraint mean square error in order to guarantee the optimized results. Adaptive regularization was achieved by using fuzzy <b>quasi-range</b> edge detector. The visual results along with the statistical measurements of the resultant images are presented in the paper. Improved SNRs show that the fuzzy regularization method is superior to other statistical and neural network methods when used along with the modified Hopfield neural networ...|$|E
40|$|There the new {{computing}} {{relations for}} the statistic and energy characteristics of RNS signal for the relative mode in relaying of satellite signal have been obtained. The offers to estimate the <b>quasi-range</b> of multibeam signal have been presented, the asymptotic optimality of new difference-range-finder determinations according to the criterion of minimum of integral error has been proved. The practical importance of work consists in the approximation of integral error of navigation determination for the noise error of receiver, {{in the rise of}} accuracy of position fixing of aircraft.

40|$|Physical {{quantities}} {{referring to}} angles, like vector direction, color hue e. t. c. exhibit an inherently periodic nature. Due to this periodicity, digital filters and edge operators proposed for {{data on the}} line cannot be applied on such data. In this paper we introduce filters for angular signals (circular mean, circular median, circular a-trimmed mean, circular modified trimmed mean). Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} circular median filter for which some interesting properties are derived. We also use estimators of circular dispersion to introduce edge detectors for angular signals. Three variations for the extension of <b>quasi-range</b> to circular data are proposed and expressions for their output pdf are derived. These "circular" quasi-ranges have good and user-controlled properties as edge detectors in noisy angular signals. The performance of the proposed edge operators is evaluated on angular edges, using certain quantitative criteria. Finally, a series of experiments featuring 1 -D [...] ...|$|E
