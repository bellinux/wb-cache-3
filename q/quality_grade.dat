5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest <b>quality</b> <b>Grade</b> A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>quality</b> <b>grades</b> or standards in the supply chain. A model is employed which shows that <b>quality</b> <b>grading</b> provides information that lower search cost of buyers. Thus, when such standards are inadequate, information is distorted which results to asymmetric price transmission. The model is applied in the vegetable industry in Southern Philippines using primary and secondary data. A price asymmetry marketing margin model is estimated using secondary data for cabbage and onion. Results show that price transmission is symmetric for cabbage and asymmetric for onion. Asymmetry in price transmission implies that marketing information are not effectively transmitted in the food chain and that establishing <b>quality</b> <b>grades</b> or standards is necessary to improve efficiency in the supply chain.

40|$|The {{topic of}} online product quality {{inspection}} (OPQI) with smart visual sensors is attracting increasing interest {{in both the}} academic and industrial communities {{on account of the}} natural connection between the visual appearance of products with their underlying qualities.
