The heating of F-region electrons near the point of reflection of the RF wave leads to electron impact excitation of oxygen atoms to the O(1 D) state. It is shown that the resulting region of enhance 6300 A emission is localized to the region of electron energy absorption for heating at the lower altitudes. At 225 km the measured time constants for intensity buildup following transmitter turn-on and for intensity decay following turn-off are identical and equal to (13 plus or minus 1) sec. Time constants varying from 30 to 80 sec are found for the altitude range 260 to 300 km. The inferred quenching coefficient for the whole altitude range, 225 to 300 km, is 4. 4 + 2 or - 1 x 10 to the minus 11 th power cu cm/sec at 950 K, in good agreement with laboratory data.

Two approaches to access excitations, a static and a dynamic one, {{have been studied}} and contrasted. In static simulations the low-lying excitations have been computed by utilizing the LR-MCTDHB method - a linear response theory constructed on-top of a static MCTDHB solution. Complimentary, we propose two dynamic protocols that address excitations by propagating the MCTDHB wave-function. In particular, we investigate dipole-like oscillations induced by shifting {{the origin of the}} confining potential and breathing-like excitations by <b>quenching</b> <b>frequency</b> of a parabolic part of the trap.

We found out that the variance is the most sensitive and informative quantity - along with excitations it contains information about the de-excitations even in a linear regime of the induced dynamics.

On a finite time scale $[0,T]$, the system is known to be self-averaging: the empirical measure of the system converges as $N\to\infty$ to the deterministic solution of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation which exhibits a stable manifold of synchronized stationary profiles for large interaction. On longer time scales, competition between the finite-size effects of the noise and disorder makes the system deviate from this mean-field behavior. In the main result of the paper we show that on a time scale of order $\sqrt N$ the fluctuations of the disorder prevail over the fluctuations of the noise: we establish the existence of disorder-induced traveling waves for the empirical measure along the stationary manifold.

Microwave radiation forces the electron orbits to move back and forth being damped by interaction with the lattice. We show that this damping depends dramatically on microwave frequency and also on temperature. An increase in frequency or temperature gives rise to an increase in the lattice damping producing eventually a quenching effect in the magnetoresistance oscillations.

Here we employ a parsimonious (mesoscopic) approach to study analytically and computationally the synchronization (Kuramoto) dynamics on the actual human-brain connectome network. We elucidate the existence of a so-far-uncovered intermediate phase, placed between the standard synchronous and asynchronous phases, i. e. between order and disorder. This novel phase stems from the hierarchical modular organization of the connectome.

We {{consider the case}} of non-identical oscillators, with distributed intrinsic frequencies within the array and study the steady-state properties of the system. In two dimensions no macroscopic mutual entrainment is found but, for identical oscillators, critical behavior of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type is shown to be present. We then discuss the stability of (BKT) order in the physical case of distributed <b>quenched</b> random <b>frequencies.</b> In order to do that, we show how the steady-state dynamical properties of the two dimensional array of non-identical oscillators are related to the equilibrium properties of the XY model with quenched randomness, that has been already studied in the past. We propose a novel set of recursion relations to study this system within the Migdal Kadanoff renormalization group scheme, by mean of the discrete clock-state formulation. We compute the phase diagram in the presence of random dissipative coupling, at finite values of the clock state parameter.

By correlating the thermal Brownian vibrating {{motion of the}} microcantilever with the surrounding liquid temperature, the near-field microscale temperature distributions at the probing site are determined at separation distances of z = 5, 10, 20, and 40 µm while the microheater temperature is maintained at 50 °C, 70 °C, or 90 °C. In addition, the near-field correction of the correlation is discussed {{to account for the}} <b>quenched</b> cantilever vibration <b>frequencies,</b> which are <b>quenched</b> due to the no-slip solid-wall interference. Higher thermal sensitivity and spatial resolution is expected when the vibration frequencies increase with a relatively short and thick cantilever and the dimensions of the microcantilever are reduced.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{sustained}} behavior of a candle flame in microgravity determined in the glovebox facility aboard the First United States Microgravity Labomtofy. In a quiescent, microgmvjfy environment, diffusive transport becomes the dominant mode of heat and mass transfer; whether the diffusive transport rate is fast enough to sustain low-gravity candle flames in air was unknown to this series of about 70 tests. After an initial transient in which soot is observed, the microgravity candle flame in air becomes and remains hemispherical and blue (apparently soot-Ne) with a large flame standoff distance. Near flame extinction, spontaneous flame oscillations are regularly observed; these are explained as a flashback of flame through a premixed combustible gas followed by a retreat owed to flame <b>quenching.</b> The <b>frequency</b> of oscillations {{can be related to}} diffusive transport rates, and not to residual buoyant convective flow. The fact that the flame tip is the last point of the flame to survive suggests that it is the location of maximum fuel reactivity; this is unlike normal gravity, where the location of maximum fuel reactivity is the flame base. The flame color, size, and shape behaved in a quasi-steady manner; the finite size of the glovebox, combined with the restricted passages of the candlebox, inhibited the observation of true steady-state burning. Nonetheless, through calculations, and inference from the series of shuttle tests, if is concluded that a candle can burn indefinitely in a large enough ambient of air in microgravity. After igniting one candle, a second candle in close pximity could not be lit. This may be due to wax coating the wick and/or local oxygen depletion around the second, unlit candle.

Ultrahigh yield strength of ~ 1000. MPa with high elongation of ~ 15 % and high low temperature toughness of 55. J (half thickness) at - 40. °C was obtained after quenching from austenitization at 900. °C for 30. min, and tempering at 600. °C for 15. min by induction reheating with a reheating rate of ~ 50. °C/s.

We show that, in general, even when the natural frequencies have zero mean the oscillators synchronize (for sufficiently strong interaction) around a common rotating phase, whose frequency is sharply estimated. We also establish the stability properties of these solutions (in fact, limit cycles). These results are obtained by identifying the stable hyperbolic manifold of stationary solutions of an associated non disordered model and by exploiting the robustness of hyperbolic structures under suitable perturbations. When the disorder distribution is symmetric the speed vanishes and there is a one parameter family of stationary solutions : in this case we provide more precise stability estimates.

The spectrum of these excitations, obtained typically from inelastic neutron and x-ray scattering, is the spatial and temporal Fourier transform of the density-density correlation function of the system, which dictates how a perturbation propagates in space and time. As frequency-domain measurements do not generally contain phase information, time-domain measurements of these fluctuations could yield a more direct method for investigating the excitations of solids and their interactions both in equilibrium and far-from equilibrium. Here we show that the diffuse scattering of femtosecond x-ray pulses produced by a free electron laser (FEL) can directly measure these density-density correlations due to lattice vibrations in the time domain.
