50|$|Josh Parker (Jason Bateman), Chief Technical Officer of Zenotek's Chicago branch, {{meets with}} his lawyer, Ezra (Matt Walsh), to {{finalize}} his divorce {{in time for}} the holidays. Zenotek meanwhile has failed to meet its <b>quarterly</b> <b>quota,</b> and interim CEO Carol Vanstone (Jennifer Aniston) threatens to lay off 40 percent of the staff, cut bonuses, and cancel the annual Christmas party. Her brother, branch manager Clay (T. J. Miller), is desperate to keep his staff. Carol harbors resentment toward Clay, who she believed was her father's favorite, and threatens to shut down the branch. Josh and Clay, along with Josh's head of tech, Tracey Hughes (Olivia Munn), propose partnering with financial giant Walter Davis (Courtney B. Vance), whom they are having lunch with later that day, and Carol gives them the chance to win his business. Walter is pleased with the pitch, but concerned with another recent branch closure at Zenotek, feeling that the company is more about the budget than their people. Clay invites him to their Christmas party in hopes of showing him that their company is in good standing. Before leaving town, Carol offers Josh a position at her New York headquarters, confident her brother will fail.|$|E

40|$|The United States {{imposed a}} tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on lamb meat in July 1999. Early {{analysis}} suggested {{the possibility that}} lamb growers could lose welfare via the creation of packer market power. This paper considers how subsequent events modify that analysis. Observed prices suggest reduced pass-through. Lamb prices are unchanged and more stable. Using an annual quota instead of a <b>quarterly</b> <b>quota</b> reduces the opportunity for market conduct switching. Early termination of the TRQ {{to comply with the}} WTO rulings magnifies any welfare loss. Assistance payments prevent welfare losses to growers with little impact on the market.

40|$|Using data on {{individual}} level sales force performance over a 3 year period at a Fortune 500 firm, we propose and estimate a dynamic structural model of sales force {{response to a}} bonusbased compensation plan. We combine Arcidiacono and Miller's new EM algorithm approach within a two step conditional choice probability (CCP) estimator to allow for sales force response heterogeneity, while preserving the computational advantage of the CCP estimators. Our model accommodates hyperbolic discounting {{on the part of}} the sales force. We find that bonuses enhance sales productivity. The current bonus-based plan that includes quarterly and annual bonuses and an overachievement commission rates produces 18. 5 % higher revenues relative to a simple linear commission-only plan. Even adjusting for commission rates to allow for the same total compensation cost as in the current plan, the current bonus-based plan obtains 4. 6 % higher revenues. Eliminating over-achievement commission rates for sales beyond quotas reduces revenues (and profits) by roughly 6 %. The elimination of quarterly bonuses (holding the annual bonus and overachievement rates constant) reduces total revenues by 13. 6 % and December (year-end) revenues by 7 %. Even if the eliminated quarterly bonus amounts are added to the annual bonus, revenues fall by 4 %. Thus annual quotas or over-achievement commission rates have smaller impact on performance without the <b>quarterly</b> <b>quotas.</b> 1 I...|$|R
