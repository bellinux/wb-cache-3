40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the dimensions of}} <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> of nursing care, more appropriate {{to the reality of}} the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies. Methodology: Exploratory study of descriptive and literature review. Articles were surveyed in the national literature published in the last decade, indexed in the following databases: Lilacs, BIREME, PubMed and SciELO using the descriptors: <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> in healthcare, nursing, <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> and nursing care. Results: Thirty articles were selected. The amount of <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> identified according to size was: 55 % in administrative / management, 36 % in the biological / clinical, and 9 % in educational / psychosocial, adding a total of 197 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> found. The <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> were further divided according to their coverage area, 72 indicators of a biological / clinical <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> ranked 17 in the educational dimension / psychosocial. Also, 108 <b>indicators</b> of <b>quality</b> were found in the administrative dimension, also known as management dimension; 177 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> were selected as most suitable to the reality of HRAC/USP. Conclusion: The <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> selected according to the reality of HRAC-USP were: systematization of nursing care, professional performance and production, medications, probes, catheters and drains, educational, skin injury, falls, blood products, pulmonary / respiratory and swallowing.

30|$|To this end, it is {{significant}} to establish a way to unify a vocabulary of <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> and their interpretation including their whole structures.

Moreover, to calculate {{the results of the}} <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> from databases in hospitals, one has to calculate the results in a coherent manner.

40|$|CONTEXT: In some {{countries}} (the United States in particular), <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> {{for palliative care}} have already been developed. However, these <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> often cover one specific setting or target group, for example, palliative cancer care or palliative home care. OBJECTIVES: This article describes the development and initial testing {{of a set of}} <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> for palliative care, applicable for all settings in which palliative care is being provided for adult patients in the Netherlands. METHODS AND RESULTS: In {{the first phase of the}} project, an inventory was made of existing relevant <b>quality</b> <b>indicators.</b> Most <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> focused on the process or outcome of palliative care, and <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> for the structure of palliative care were rare. Most of the existing <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> fall within the domain of physical care, and very few concern the social and spirituals domains of palliative care. In the second phase, a new draft set of <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> was developed. In addition to the previous inventory of existing indicators, interviews with patients, relatives, and caregivers provided input for the development of the draft set. Drafts of the set were tested among experts. In the third phase, the feasibility and usability of a draft set was established in 14 Dutch care organizations providing palliative care. CONCLUSION: As a result of these phases, a set of <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> for palliative care has been developed, consisting of 33 indicators for palliative patient care and 10 indicators for support for relatives before and/or after the patient's death.

Given this, it is conducted a qualitative study with assistant managers in a hospital. The purpose of the study is to increase knowledge and understanding of how assistant managers are affected by <b>quality</b> <b>indicators.</b> The aim of the study is to illustrate assistant managers’ experience with <b>quality</b> <b>indicators,</b> and how the indicator results contribute to changes in procedures and quality in the hospital. Research question: What experience do assistant managers have with <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> for cancer treatment at a hospital? Methods: It is conducted semi-structured interviews with six assistant managers at a hospital. The design is descriptive, and qualitative analysis was used. Results: The results describe assistant managers of entities that examines and treats cancer have limited experience and knowledge of <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> for cancer treatment, and the results have a small impact on the entities everyday activity. Conclusion: The study shows that assistant managers to a small extent change procedures and quality based on the <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> for cancer treatment. Based on the experience of the assistant managers, other master plans and strategies, regional practices, and local needs have an influence on the changes described.

Twenty-seven key interventions, 16 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> at patient level and 27 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> at STEMI care programme level were selected. Eighteen additional items were suggested. Experts received personal feedback, benchmarking their score with group results (response rate, mean, median and content validity index). Consequently, 32 experts (71 % response rate) openly discussed items with an item-content validity index above 75 %. By consensus, the expert panel validated a final set of 25 ?key interventions, 13 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> at patient level and 20 <b>quality</b> <b>indicators</b> at care programme level prior for improvement of in hospital care for STEMI.
