You said the title tag is a ranking signal, but you said that you use a part of the title tag. And that's really stuck with me. And I was just wondering what you meant by that, when you say you use a part of the title tag as a ranking signal.JOHN MUELLER: We use that just as a part. I think it's not like the primary ranking factor of a page, to put it that way.DANIEL PICKEN: Right.JOHN MUELLER: We do use it for ranking, but it's not the most critical part of a page. So it's not worthwhile filling it with keywords to kind of hope that it works that way. In general, we try to recognize when a title tag is stuffed with keywords because that's also a bad user experience for users in the search results. If they're looking to understand what these pages are about and they just see a jumble of keywords, then that doesn't really help.Moz has already been cited as assigning critical importance to the Title tags. However, they have the following to say about the Meta description:... it's important to note that meta descriptions do not directly influence Google's ranking algorithms for normal web search.

60|$|For {{a moment}} Graham stood with the deferential {{attendant}} listening to Ostrog's retreating steps. There {{was a sound}} of <b>quick</b> <b>question</b> and answer and of men running. The curtain was snatched back and Ostrog reappeared, his massive face glowing with excitement. He crossed the room in a stride, clicked the room into darkness, gripped Graham's arm {{and pointed to the}} mirror.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, our fireman {{with the}} epaulettes, who was foreman of that district, went about like a general in action, {{watching}} the flames sternly,--giving a quiet order to one, indicating {{a point of}} vantage to another, giving a helping hand here and there with the hose, answering a <b>quick</b> <b>question</b> promptly, and doing his utmost to dispose his force {{in such a way}} as to quell the raging fire. All this time he moved about among smoke and flames and falling materials as if he bore a charmed life--which, indeed, he did: for, as he afterwards said himself, the hand of God shielded him, and nothing on earth could kill him till his work on earth was done; and nothing on earth could save him when his time to die should come. This sentiment was, partly at least, the secret of the fireman's cool courage in the midst of danger.|$|E

60|$|And, suddenly, quickly, {{interrupting}} herself, Mrs. Gordon gave a long, wondering cry. Bernard {{heard her}} spring to her feet, {{and the two}} other ladies rise from their seats.

6000|$|That {{fact the}} lady of Lancaster Gate had up to this moment, as we know, enshrouded, and her friend's <b>quick</b> <b>question</b> had {{produced}} a change in her face. She blinked--then looked at the question hard; after which, whether she had inadvertently betrayed herself or had only reached a decision and then {{been affected by the}} quality of Mrs. Stringham's surprise, she accepted all results. What took place in her for Susan Shepherd was not simply that she made the best of them, but that she suddenly saw more in them to her purpose than she could have imagined. A certain impatience in fact marked in her this transition: she had been keeping back, very hard, an important truth, and wouldn't have liked to hear that she hadn't concealed it cleverly. Susie nevertheless felt herself pass as not a little of a fool with her for not having thought of it. What Susie indeed, however, most thought of at present, in the quick, new light of it, was the wonder of Kate's dissimulation. She had time for that view while she waited for an answer to her cry. [...] "Kate thinks she cares. But she's mistaken. And no one knows it." [...] These things, distinct and responsible, were Mrs. Lowder's retort. Yet they weren't all of it. [...] "You don't know it--that must be your line. Or rather your line must be that you deny it utterly." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{now that}} the spell of silence was broken the sounds came thick and fast. From boat to shore and back from shore to boat came <b>quick</b> <b>question</b> and answer, all in the fiercest whispers. I looked back--a fatal thing to do--for in the instant someone caught sight of my face, which showed white on the dark water, and shouted. Hands pointed to me, {{and in a moment}} or two the boat was under weigh, and {{following}} hard after me. I had but a little way to go, but quicker and quicker came the boat after me. A few more strokes and I would be on the shore, but I felt the oncoming of the boat, and expected each second to feel the crash of an oar or other weapon on my head. Had I not seen that dreadful axe disappear in the water I do not think that I could have won the shore. I heard the muttered curses of those not rowing and the laboured breath of the rowers. With one supreme effort for life or liberty I touched the bank and sprang up it. There was not a single second to spare, for hard behind me the boat grounded and several dark forms sprang after me. I gained the top of the dyke, and keeping to the left ran on again. The boat put off and followed down the stream. Seeing this I feared danger in this direction, and quickly turning, ran down the dyke on the other side, and after passing a short stretch of marshy ground gained a wild, open flat country and sped on.|$|E

40|$|Speaking {{skill is}} very {{important}} because it is as an important tool to communicate each other. With communication, people can express their ideas creatively. Therefore, speaking should be introduced in every school. The success of teaching speaking {{is influenced by the}} technique which is used by the teacher. By using a good technique, the teacher is able to attract the students more active in speaking. Based on the reason above, the writer investigated the technique of teaching speaking used by the teacher of second year class at SMAN 1 Pandaan. In this study, the writer used descriptive qualitative research and the subject of this study was English teachers who taught English at SMAN 1 Pandaan. There were six teachers. Four of them taught international class. One class consisted of two teachers or team teaching and two of them taught the regular class. This research is to compare teaching technique used by teacher of international class and teacher of regular class. To collect the data, the writer did some observation and interview to the teachers. The result of this study showed that the techniques used by the teachers of international class in teaching speaking were role-play, one <b>quick</b> <b>question,</b> and describing picture. In addition, the techniques used by the teachers of regular class were dialogue, telling story and discussion. ...|$|E
40|$|In many low-income countries, where {{computer}} {{ownership and}} home and business internet access is rare, public access venues, {{especially in the}} form of business-operated cybercafés, are how most people access computers and the internet. This form of public access is often viewed as having been born of economic necessity and considered to be a second-best alternative when compared to private, individualized access. In this study, we interrogate this assumption, finding that public access can support forms of collaboration and knowledge sharing that enhance learning and productivity and offer rich opportunities for interaction and co-work. In this way, public shared access is not necessarily second-best to private, individualized connection, but may, in some contexts, be a preferred access method. In order to better understand the forms of collaborative co-present sharing in cybercafés, as well as the advantages and disadvantages associated with this sharing, we conducted a survey of users in two cybercafés in Accra, Ghana. Survey results reveal that public access enables forms of sharing and collaboration among patrons that range from the most simplistic (such as asking a café employee a <b>quick</b> <b>question),</b> to the more formalized (such as meeting business partners and working together around a single computer), to the fleeting and voyeuristic (such as glancing at a stranger’s computer screen and noticing an interesting website). Contrary to the belief that resource constraints drive public shared access, the participants surveyed who do share computers highlighted the learning benefits of working together much more frequently than the economic grounds for sharing. Following these surveys, we designed a system to promote opportunities for co-located sharing and collaboration between users at an internet café. ...|$|E
