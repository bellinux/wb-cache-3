5000|$|The intensity, direction, and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighting</b> can {{influence}} an audience’s understanding of characters, actions, themes and mood. Light (and shade) can emphasize texture, shape, distance, mood, {{time of day}} or night, season, glamour; it affects the way colors are rendered, {{both in terms of}} hue and depth, and can focus attention on particular elements of the composition. Highlights, for example, call attention to shapes and textures, while shadows often conceal things, creating a sense of mystery or fear. For this reason, lighting must be thoroughly planned in advance to ensure its desired effect on an audience. Cinematographers are a large part of this process, as they coordinate the camera and the lighting.|$|E

40|$|This Phase II project {{follows a}} {{previous}} project titled Strategies to Address Nighttime Crashes at Rural, Unsignalized Intersections. Based {{on the results}} of the previous study, the Iowa Highway Research Board (IHRB) indicated interest in pursuing further research to address the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighting,</b> rather than just the presence of light, with respect to safety. The research team supplemented the literature review from the previous study, specifically addressing lighting level in terms of measurement, the relationship between light levels and safety, and lamp durability and efficiency. The Center for Transportation Research and Education (CTRE) teamed with a national research leader in roadway lighting, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI) to collect the data. An integral instrument to the data collection efforts was the creation of the Roadway Monitoring System (RMS). The RMS allowed the research team to collect lighting data and approach information for each rural intersection identified in the previous phase. After data cleanup, the final data set contained illuminance data for 101 lighted intersections (of 137 lighted intersections in the first study). Data analysis included a robust statistical analysis based on Bayesian techniques. Average illuminance, average glare, and average uniformity ratio values were used to classify <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighting</b> at the intersections...|$|E

This study deepens our knowledge of realgar degradation and determines the capacity of inducing degradation by different lamps.

The results confirm literature studies on realgar degradation and suggest that the LED lamp produces less degradation, keeping a high <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>lighting...</b>|$|E

As {{a result of this}} study, new PLB and shoots were successfully regenerated on modified MS medium under different <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>lights.</b> The highest PLB formation rate (100 %) and the highest shoot formation rate (85 %) were observed amongst explants cultured on medium supplemented with 10 g/l sucrose + 10 g/l trehalose under green LED.
