25|$|Since most of Kings Canyon is {{wilderness}} and roads extend {{only a small}} distance into the park, backpacking (and less commonly, horsepacking) are {{the only way to}} see the majority of the park. Unlike day hikers, overnight backpackers must obtain a wilderness permit from a ranger station or visitor center. During the peak tourist season (typically between May and September), a quota applies for wilderness permits, of which 75percent are set aside for prior reservations, with the remainder for walk-ins. Outside the <b>quota</b> <b>period</b> permits are still required, although the limit no longer applies. Although backpackers account for a relatively small percentage of the total visitors, some of the backcountry trails are still quite heavily used. Due to the popularity of some backcountry camps, stays can be limited to one or two nights. During the summer, the Park Service staffs backcountry ranger stations at McClure Meadow, Le Conte Meadow, Rae Lakes, Charlotte Lake and Roaring River.|$|E

40|$|Research PaperUntil {{recently}} {{the execution of}} the fisheries management schemes in the Netherlands was to a large extend centralized. In 1993, however, part of the executionary responsibilities was delegated to the fishing industry. In this new system, responsibilities in the management of individual transferable quota (ITQs) has been devolved to groups of fishermen. This Dutch co-management system proved to be successful in quota management; landings did not exceed <b>quota</b> in the <b>period</b> 1993 - 2001. A 1996 evaluation of the system concluded that the combination of positive inducements and some coercion made individual fishermen decide to become and to remain cooperative; that the fleet succeeded in a more economic use of the quota; and, that the distribution of net benefits had improved to some extent. Both fishermen and government are enthusiastic about the management system. Since January 2002 a Steering group has started to investigate the possibilities to extend the management responsibilities of the fishermen’s groups.

The time span studied was April 1998 to April 2001. We obtained condemnation data randomly from the Chicken Farmers of Ontario, Canada and analysed the data with a generalized mixed model. The (weighted) average prevalence of cellulitis in Ontario between April 1998 and 2001 was 0. 94 % (0. 87 %, 1. 03 %). The prevalence of cellulitis ranged from 0 to 14. 9 %, with one outlier at 30 and 95 % of the data between 0 and 2. 58 %. The final mixed model we {{used to describe the}} variation in the prevalence of cellulitis between lots included random effect terms, the plant where the birds were processed, the producer, the <b>quota</b> <b>period</b> when the birds were processed, and the interaction term <b>quota</b> <b>period</b> by processing plant, as well as fixed effects terms, the type of inspection system and the average weight of the birds. The final model containing these variables explained approximately 78 % of the total variation in the data. Our findings indicate all three random effects variables accounted for a significant amount of variation in the cellulitis data; however, the greatest source of variation was ascribed to the plants where the birds were processed. Some of the variation in cellulitis associated with processing plants was explained by the type of inspection system used by the plant, but even after controlling for this factor, there remained a relatively large amount of variation between processing plants (approximately 30 %). These findings suggest there may be discrepancies in the diagnoses of the condition. Some of the variation in the prevalence of cellulitis (~ 13 %) was also attributed to the producer; however, more of the variation in the data was attributed to differences in lot-specific factors (~ 22 %). Therefore, future control efforts for cellulitis should focus on standardizing the classification of cellulitis at processing plants and identifying lot specific factors that may increase the risk of the condition...|$|E

Among these Asian countries, Korea and China are important countries to compare in the textile and apparel industry. According to the WTO (World Trade Organization) International Trade Statistics, China, a developing country, has been ranked first in textile and apparel exports from 2010 to 2012. Despite rising labor costs, reminbi (RMB) appreciation, and lower demand from export markets, China’s textile industry is still growing at a healthy pace and looks to dominate the global apparel sector, both as a producer and as a consumer for years to come (Apparel Technology 2014). In comparison with other Asian textile and apparel players, even though Korea ranked eighth regarding textile and apparel exports in 2010 – 2012, as a developed country, it is also an important.

In 2016, the first year when the law was effective, the female share increased again by 4. 5 percentage points. Using a hand-collected dataset, we investigate whether the rise in female board representation was accompanied by a change in gender differences in board member characteristics and board involvement. We do not find evidence for the "Golden Skirts" phenomenon, i. e., the rise in the female share was not achieved via a few female directors holding multiple board memberships. After controlling for firm heterogeneity, the remuneration of female shareholder (employee) representatives is about 16 (9) percent lower than for males. We interpret this as an overall indication that women are not only underrepresented in German supervisory boards, they are even more underrepresented in important board positions. Indeed, women are less likely to become a chairman and are less often assigned to board committees (except for the nominating committee).

During {{the past}} three decades {{considerable}} changes have taken place within the Icelandic pelagic industry which, previously considered rather fragmented, is now a highly concentrated vertically integrated industry due to considerable consolidations of <b>quotas.</b> During this <b>period,</b> changes in the ecosystem around Iceland have also brought valuable pelagic species such as Atlanto-Scandian herring and Atlantic mackerel to the EEZ, while other species such as capelin have declined. Part of the concentration within the pelagic sector can be attributed to changes in the ITQ management system and company adjustments to laws and regulations.   Another aspect {{can be attributed to the}} entrance of valuable species into the Icelandic EEZ and decreasing quotas of fishmeal oriented species. Finally technology changes have increased production efficiency in processing and fisheries. All this has altered the Icelandic pelagic industry in three ways: Firstly, processing for human consumption has increased with additional species and advances in processing technology.   Secondly, raw material for the fishmeal industry has declined parallel with lower capelin quotas.   Thirdly, a number of processing utilities and vessels have been scrapped, affecting employment in many fishing villages...|$|R
40|$|At the University of Adelaide, {{the total}} number of {{students}} enrolled in any course is controlled by quotas on the number of new entrants to the course each year. A linear relationship is used to forecast total enrolment given the number of new students in each previous year; for future years, the number of new students is taken to be the size of the quota. Chapter 1 relates the methods in use at the University of Adelaide to the work of other authors and demonstrates how a Markov model may be used to obtain the lifetimes of students in a particular course, namely the Ph. D. degree course. Chapter 2 then develops a linear programming model which mimicks the forecasting method already in use and which determines the intake <b>quotas</b> over a <b>period</b> of years that use as much as possible of the course capacity while satisfying certain constraints. These constraints en - sure that the total enrolment each year is no greater than the capacity in that year and that the intakes are non - decreasing and no greater than some maximum value. In particular, the programme is designed to be used to determine strategies which move the course into a constant enrolment, or non - growth, period while accounting for restrictions on the permissible rate of growth. It is shown that the special structure of the problem may be exploited to find a particular solution which is optimal for several, commonly encountered objective functions. The requirement that the intakes should be integral is discussed and is shown to pose very little additional difficulty. An example from the University of Adelaide is used to illustrate the methods. Chapter 3 considers extensions of the basic model (the single - grade, single - course case) to situations where there are several grades within a course with capacities on some of these grades or where several inter - related courses are to be planned at the same time.

Fear (tense muscles reduce buoyancy and affect movement) is the biggest issue when learning to swim. Children are afraid of water, drowning and unknown environment and new people – other swimming teachers. To this end, {{it is vital that}} the class teacher be present during swimming lessons for pupils in the first educational period because they are emotionally attached to the teacher, know and trust him. Note that pupils at this age are not "tiny adults", which is why their class teacher should be the one to teach them. However, this is not always possible, so they are often taught by a physical education teacher or even an external service provider with a valid certificate as a swimming instructor. This research thus aims at examining the opinion of pupils about the pedagogical actions of their teachers during swimming lessons in the first educational period. Their opinion about their teacher's pedagogical actions reflects their true experience with those actions. This research explores pedagogical actions of a class teacher, a physical education teacher and a certified swimming instructor as perceived by their pupils. The main goal of the thesis is to compare pupils' opinions about their teachers' actions, and identify the differences in the pedagogical actions of the class teacher, the physical education teacher and the certified swimming instructor. The research was empirical using the survey method with a quantitative research approach. It was developed in line with the descriptive and causal non-experimental research method. The sample involved pupils attending the third grade of primary school who had already completed a twenty-hour swimming class in the first educational <b>period.</b> <b>Quota</b> sampling, i. e. non-probability and convenience sampling, was used to select 12 pupils (6 girls and 6 boys) for individual group of swimming teachers, namely 5 class teachers (n = 5), 5 physical education teachers (n = 5) and 5 external certified swimming instructors (n = 5). In total, 180 pupils were surveyed. The questionnaire was devised by Cankar and Ambrožič (1991). The research results revealed statistically significant differences in the pupils' assessment of the pedagogical actions of their swimming teachers whether it was their class teacher, physical education teacher or an external provider with a valid certificate as a swimming instructor. Two dimensions of pedagogical actions stood out, particularly "Encouraging personal relations and understanding" and "Leadership". It can be confirmed that the pupils who were taught by their class teacher provided a higher statistically significant assessment of his encouraging actions and understanding than those taught by a physical education teacher or an external swimming instructor. Moreover, pupils taught by an external swimming instructor provided a lower statistically significant average assessment of the teacher than those taught by a physical education teacher or a class teacher. The pupils also assessed certain pedagogical actions of the class teacher during swimming lessons with a higher statistically significant average, as follows: –	for the statement: "I can trust him. " Compared to pupils' assessment of certified external swimming instructors, –	for the statement: "He helps us. " compared to pupils' assessment of two groups of swimming teachers, i. e. physical education teachers and certified external swimming instructors, –	for the statement: "He encourages us. " compared to pupils' assessment of two groups of swimming teachers, i. e. physical education teachers and certified external swimming instructors, –	for the statement: "He loves me. " compared to pupils' assessment of two groups of swimming teachers, i. e. physical education teachers and certified external swimming instructors, –	for the statement: "He commends us. " compared to pupils' assessment of physical education teachers, –	for the statement: "He makes an effort. " compared to pupils' assessment of certified external swimming instructors. The practical value of different opinions about the actions of swimming teachers attests to the fact that pupils in this educational period value certain important pedagogical actions of their class teacher more. The research also confirms the importance of the class teacher in swimming lessons during the first educational period. The findings could improve this aspect of learning to swim by promoting training among class teachers, so they could be qualified for teaching swimming or be active in this process. Certain pedagogical actions in swimming lessons at such a tender age can only be performed by class teachers. The research on the pedagogical actions of swimming teachers in the first educational period contributes to the field and has a practical value in terms of developing more effective pedagogical actions in swimming lessons in the first educational period. ...|$|R
