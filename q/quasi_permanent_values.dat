25|$|This {{acceleration}} of the current {{takes place in the}} direction of waves and dominant wind. Accordingly, when the sea depth increases, the rotation of the earth changes the direction of currents, in proportion with the increase of depth while friction lowers their speed. At a certain sea depth, the current changes direction and is seen inverted in the opposite direction with speed current becoming nul: known as the Ekman spiral. The influence of these currents is mainly experienced at the mixed layer of the ocean surface, often from 400 to 800 meters of maximum depth. These currents can considerably alter, change and are dependent on the various yearly seasons. If the mixed layer is less thick (10 to 20 meters), the <b>quasi</b> <b>permanent</b> current at the surface adopts an extreme oblique direction in relation to the direction of the wind, becoming virtually homogeneous, until the Thermocline.|$|R

30|$|Let {{me first}} {{mention that the}} {{empirical}} analysis of intergenerational income mobility has focussed on fathers and sons since the rate of female labor force participation in most countries has been quite low in the past {{so that there is}} not enough data to draw conclusions about the comparison between mothers and daughters. It is also {{important to point out that}} the study of intergenerational mobility in quantitative variables should rely on the <b>permanent</b> <b>values</b> of these variables in order to minimize potential biases and measurement errors arising from using one year observations for both fathers and sons. Those <b>permanent</b> <b>values</b> are obtained by averaging the observed values over several years. Moreover, it is necessary to control for the ages of both fathers and sons at the time those variables are measured.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} in parallel machine scheduling in combinatorial optimization {{suggests that the}} desirable parallel efficiency could be achieved when the jobs are sorted in the non-increasing order of processing times. In this paper, {{we find that the}} time spending for computing the permanent of a sparse matrix by hybrid algorithm is strongly correlated to its <b>permanent</b> <b>value.</b> A strategy is introduced to improve a parallel algorithm for sparse permanent. Methods for approximating permanents, which have been studied extensively, are used to approximate the <b>permanent</b> <b>values</b> of sub-matrices to decide the processing order of jobs. This gives an improved load balancing method. Numerical results show that the parallel efficiency is improved remarkably for the permanents of fullerene graphs, which are of great interests in nanoscience.
