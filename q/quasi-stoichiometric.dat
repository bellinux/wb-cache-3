Polyurethanes are formed through {{the reaction of}} an isocyanate component with polyether or polyester polyols or other active hydrogen compounds. This paper refers to polyurethane adhesives made from polyester polyols with long aliphatic chains (up to 36 carbon atoms) and MDI (diphenylmethane- 4, 4 ’-diisocyanate). The polyester polyols have been made from dimer acids obtained from renewable sources and short chain diols. The polyols that were used presented different degrees of unsaturation.

Depending on the film composition, the conductivity can vary up to six orders of magnitude. Data analysis of σ(T) revealed a clear relation between the pre-exponential factor and the thermal activation energy, suggesting the validity of the Meyer- Neldel rule. For all investigated films, typical Meyer-Neldel parameters assume values in a narrow range: 10 − 8 < σ 00 < 10 − 6 (Ωcm) − 1 and 41 < EMN < 51 meV.

40|$|Fundamental {{knowledge}} on intrinsic plutonium colloids {{is important for}} the prediction of plutonium behaviour in the geosphere and in engineered systems. The first synthetic route to obtain salt-free intrinsic plutonium colloids by ultrasonic treatment of PuO 2 suspensions in pure water is reported. Kinetics showed that both chemical and mechanical effects of ultrasound contribute to the mechanism of Pu colloid formation. In the first stage, fragmentation of initial PuO 2 particles provides larger surface contact between cavitation bubbles and solids. Furthermore, hydrogen formed during sonochemical later splitting enables reduction of Pu(IV) to more soluble Pu(III), which then re-oxidizes yielding Pu(IV) colloid. A comparative study of nanostructured PuO 2 and Pu colloids produced by sonochemical and hydrolytic methods, has been conducted using HRTEM, Pu LIII-edge XAS, and O K-edge NEXAFS/STXM. Characterization of Pu colloids revealed a correlation between the number of Pu-O and Pu-Pu contacts and the atomic surface-to-volume ratio of the PuO 2 nanoparticles. NEXAFS indicated that oxygen state in hydrolytic Pu colloid is influenced by hydrolysed Pu(IV) species {{to a greater extent than}} in sonochemical PuO 2 nanoparticles. In general, hydrolytic and sonochemical Pu colloids can be described as core-shell nanoparticles composed of <b>quasi-stoichiometric</b> PuO 2 cores and hydrolysed Pu(IV) moieties at the surface shell.

30|$|A new nanostructured hybrid {{material}} is developed by direct grafting {{of a model}} thiophene-based organic dye on 3 C-SiC/SiO 2 core/shell nanowire surface. A structural characterization carried out on the as-grown nanostructures reveals that the nanowires are a 3 C-SiC core wrapped in a <b>quasi-stoichiometric</b> silicon dioxide. The cathodoluminescence spectroscopy presents two broad emission bands that resulted from three different components that peaked at 2.43 eV, related to the near-band-edge emission from the 3 C-SiC core, and at 2.74 and 3.6 eV, involving the triplet and singlet states of ODC(II) in the silicon dioxide shell. TEM-EDX analysis of the functionalized nanowires reveals that the carbon distribution is more spread {{than it would be}} considering only the SiC core size, suggesting a main contribution from C of the oligothiophene framework. Further, a sulfur signal not detected in the as-grown samples is found along the treated wires. In addition, the confocal fluorescent spectroscopy shows similar line shapes of functionalized NWs and T 3 Pyr in solution, confirming homogeneous molecule grafting on the nanowire surface, without any influence of the luminescence properties of the inorganic component. Chemical and luminescence characterizations confirm a homogeneous functionalization of the nanowires; in particular, the organic dye maintains its optical properties after the grafting, thus opening a possible perspective of this new nanostructured hybrid material in the field of chemo-/biosensing applications.|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic systems {{continue}} {{to be an interesting}} area in condensed matter physics and LiNiO 2 is one such among them. Here we present a detailed experimental magnetic study of the <b>quasi-stoichiometric</b> LixNi 2 -xO 2 system (0. 67 <x< 0. 98). It exhibits a variety of magnetic ground states-namely spin glass, cluster glass, re-entrant spin glass and ferromagnetic. This study deals with the magnetic properties of these four distinct ground states. The spin glass state is evidenced by the frequency-dependent peak shift as well as the time-dependent slow dynamics (magnetic relaxation, magnetic memory effect etc). By tuning the Li deficiency in a controlled manner, an increase in the ordering temperature is observed. Most strikingly, with the Li deficiency the nature of the magnetic ground state is changed from spin glass to ferromagnetic, with two intermediate states-namely cluster glass and re-entrant spin glass. The critical behaviour of the re-entrant spin glass is also studied here. The critical exponents (beta, gamma and delta) are extracted from the modified Arrot plot, Kouvel-Fisher method, and critical isotherm analysis. The critical exponents match with the long-range mean-field model. The values of the critical exponents are confirmed by the Widom scaling law: delta = 1 + gamma beta(- 1). Furthermore, the universality class of the scaling relations is verified, where the scaled m and scaled h collapse into two branches.

The most outstanding result concerns the coexistence over part (0. 06 ≲ x ≲ 0. 16) of the total (0. 06 ≲ x ≲ 0. 25) superconducting range of two different fractions showing different local behaviours. The first fraction corresponds to intrinsic spin-freezing, below ∼ 8  K, in the Cu sublattice. The relative sample volume of this fraction which is attributed to semiconducting domains decreases as x increases. In the second fraction which is presumably superconducting, {{there is no evidence}} of intrinsic Cu moments, however iron induced local magnetic order is present.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental investigation performed upon a single-ended self-recuperative radiant tube burner fuelled by natural gas in the non-premixed mode, which is used in the steel industry for surface treatment. The main goal of the research activity was a systematic investigation of the burner aimed to find the best operating conditions in terms of optimum equivalence ratio, thermal power and lower pollutant emissions. The analysis, which focused on the main parameters influencing the thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at the exhaust (NOx and CO), has been carried out for different operating conditions of the burner: input thermal powers from 12. 8 up to 18 kW and equivalence ratio from 0. 5 (very lean flame) to 0. 95 (<b>quasi-stoichiometric</b> condition). To significantly reduce pollutant emissions ensuring {{at the same time the}} thermal requirements of the heating process, it has been developed a new burner configuration, in which a fraction of the exhaust gases recirculates in the main combustion region through a variable gap between the burner efflux and the inner flame tube. This internal recirculation mechanism (exhaust gases recirculation, EGR) has been favoured through the addition of a pre-combustion chamber terminated by a converging nozzle acting as a mixing/ejector to promote exhaust gas entrainment into the flame tube.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{is to determine the}} optimal deposition conditions of copper indium diselenide (CuInSe 2 or CIS) thin films for photovoltaic cells. The films were produced by vacuum free Close-Spaced Vapour Transport (CSVT) process. They were deposited on glass substrate from a source heated at temperatures of 400, 450, 500, 550 and 600 °C. The deposition time was about 3 h. Characterizations were carried out by means of compositional, structural and morphological analysis. The composition of the CIS films was determined by Energy Dispersive Spectrometry (EDS) coupled to a scanning electron microscope. The results showed a <b>quasi-stoichiometric</b> composition in the range of source temperatures starting from 400 to 600 °C. The best stoichiometry was obtained at a source temperature of 500 °C. Structural characterization of the CIS films was made by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The spectra revealed that all the films were polycrystalline in nature with chalcopyrite structure. The preferred orientation along (112) direction suitable for photovoltaic device was obtained at a source temperature of 500 °C with a maximum intensity. When the source temperature was higher than 500 °C, secondary phases appeared and the intensity of the peak (112) decreased. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs showed that the films deposited at source temperature of 500 °C had the best morphology to be used as solar cells. As a result of the characteristics of CIS films obtained by EDS, XRD and SEM studies, the source temperature 500 °C is the most apt to produce photovoltaic cells with high efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The chalcopyrite-type {{semiconductor}} CuGaSe 2 {{was prepared}} and investigated aiming at its application as an absorber in thin film solar cells. Epitaxial layers of different chemical composition were grown by MOVPE {{in order to}} study fundamental properties of this semiconductor and its device free from the influence of grain boundaries. As a first step the growth parameters for the MOVPE of CuGaSe 2 on GaAs(001) were investigated and the chemical composition was adjusted. Characterization by photoluminescence focussed on two main topics: a) the investigation of excitonic line spectra in <b>quasi-stoichiometric</b> CuGaSe 2 and b) studies concerning optical transitions involving defects in Cu x Ga y Se 2 {{as a function of}} chemical composition. The binding energy of the free exciton was determined to be E FX = (13 ± 2) meV. Radiative recombination from bound excitons was attributed to neutral acceptor bound excitons: (A 0, X). In contradiction to reports in the literature no anomalous temperature dependence of the band gap energy could be deduced from the investigation of the free excitonic line as a function of temperature. Defect-correlated optical transitions were explained in a recombination model consisting of two acceptor and one donor levels showing ionisation energies of (60 ± 10) meV, (100 ± 10) meV and (12 ± 5) meV, respectively. The existence of a flat compensating donor in Cu x Ga y Se 2 is the most important new aspect in this model. Photoluminecence properties of layers showing Ga-rich compositions were described in a model of highly doped and highly compensated semiconductors - the model of fluctuating potentials. As a first step towards the device the heterojunction between CuGaSe 2 and ZnSe was investigated for the first time. A "type-I"-band allignment was found.

40|$|Since 1960 s, from {{experimental}} observation, {{there are}} several stages for liquid droplets in multi-phase combustion: pure heating, pure evaporation without individual droplet combustion, and individual droplet combustion (burning) with individual flame around which enhances evaporation. As for individual burning droplets, they have envelope flame or wake flame regimes. From experimental and theoretical research, in liquid fuel combustion chambers, according to {{the space between the}} droplets, there are four typical droplet group combustion modes. Generally, the external group combustion mode and the internal group combustion mode are the two main modes, and there are individual burning droplets in multiphase combustion. Up to now, based on the literature information, no matter in Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) method, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method or Point Direct Numeral Simulation (PDNS) method, droplets in multi-phase combustion are treated as pure evaporation points, corresponding to the bright blue flame condition, i. e., small droplets in hot gas mixture with the pure evaporation stage, so in species equation and energy equation, the droplet points are mass source and heat sink. As for the individual droplets burning mode, in point source simulation method, corresponding to the big droplet in cold gas phase mixture with yellow trail flame condition, the source terms in the species equation and energy equation should be the mass sink and heat source. The individual burning droplets affects the NO formation because the flame around the droplet has higher temperature than the local gas phase mixture mostly for the <b>quasi-stoichiometric</b> ratio reaction in individual droplet flame. In this paper, a new spray combustion model with the consideration of individual droplets combustion mode is brought forward. The existing modeling approach is extended with an ignition criterion and a droplet combustion correlation. The ignition criterion, which judges the droplet stage between pure evaporation and burning, and the droplet combustion correlation, which integrates the micro-scales droplet burning effects into point source term frame, are both selected from pioneer's experimental work and added to the present existing widely used multi-phase combustion model. Then a jet spray flame is tested by the new model with RANS and LES method. The prediction results are compared with the literature experimental results. New model gives better simulation results in downstream regions. According to the results, this model added the individual droplet combustion mode in multi-phase combustion model, while its combustion correlations are quite rough at present.
