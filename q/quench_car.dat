The equipment it manufactured seldom ran on the rails of Class I railroads, but were often used to shuttle freight cars around inside manufacturing plants. Atlas's products ranged from small 2-ton end cab switchers up to 65-ton center cab switchers. They also built a wide variety of equipment for the steel industry including blast furnace transfer cars, scale <b>cars,</b> coke <b>quench</b> <b>cars,</b> coke <b>quench</b> locomotives (to 75 tons), furnace cars and self-propelled flatcars. While most equipment was built for steel and coke plants within the United States, some equipment was shipped outside the country (for example 5 scale cars to Russia).|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{paper is}} {{presented}} technology of bimetallic layer casting in configuration: working part (layer) from ferritic or austenitic alloy steel and bearing part from grey cast iron. Design/methodology/approach: In applied technology surface layer {{on the basis}} of alloy steel at 2 or 5 mm thickness was put directly in founding process of cast iron with use of preparation of mould cavity method. Quality of bimetallic layer castings was estimated on the base of ultrasonic non-destructive testing and examination of the structure and selected usable properties i. e. hardness. Findings: The results of studies and their analysis show efficiency of new, innovative technology of heat-resisting layer castings. Research limitations/implications: In further research, authors of this paper are going to application of different type of alloy steels on working part (layer) of bimetallic casting. Practical implications: On the basis of research results was affirmed that application of thinner plates i. e. about thickness 2 mm causes their deformation in time of pouring, what disqualify this layer casting for industrial application. Considerably best results was obtained with use thickness of plate 5 mm. Originality/value: The value of this paper resides in new effective method of manufacture of heat-resisting castings, mainly for lining of <b>quenching</b> <b>car</b> to coke production...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{paper is}} {{presented}} technology of bimetallic layered castings based on founding method of layer coating directly in cast process so-called method of mould cavity preparation. Design/methodology/approach: Prepared bimetallic layered castings consist two fundamental parts i. e. bearing part and working part (layer). The bearing part of bimetallic layered casting is typical foundry material i. e. pearlitic grey cast iron, whereas working part (layer) is depending on accepted variant plates of alloy steels sort X 6 Cr 13, X 12 Cr 13, X 10 CrNi 18 - 8 and X 2 CrNiMoN 22 - 5 - 3. The ratio of thickness between bearing and working part is 8 : 1. The verification of the bimetallic layered castings was evaluated {{on the basis}} of ultrasonic NDT (non-destructive testing), structure and macro- and microhardness researches. Moreover was made computer simulation of solidification of bimetallic layered casting in NovaFlow&Solid software. Findings: The results of studies and their analysis show efficiency of new, innovative technology of corrosion and heat resisting layered castings. Research limitations: In further research, authors of this paper are going to application of different material on bearing part of bimetallic layered casting. Practical implications: Prepared bimetallic layered castings according to work out technology can work in conditions, which require from working surface layer of element a high heat resistance and/or corrosion resistance in medium for example of industrial water.

40|$|Electronic {{interactions}} between chlorophylls (Chl) and carotenoids (Car) {{play a major}} role in the regulation of photosynthetic light harvesting of higher plants and green algae. In this contribution, we discuss different electronic regulation models that are based on various Chl-Car interactions, leading to switching between efficient light harvesting and thermal dissipation of excess energy. Most regulation models are based on three types of electronic Chl-Car interactions: direct Chl -> Car S- 1 energy transfer, <b>quenching</b> by <b>Car</b> radical cations and bidirectional quenching processes. We will give an overview of the observations that have been made in our as well as other laboratories supporting one or the other model and discuss possible scenarios that may provide a unified picture considering all three types of regulation models...|$|R
40|$|Selective 2 -photon {{excitation}} (TPE) of carotenoid dark states, Car S 1, {{shows that}} in the major light-harvesting complex of photosystem II (LHCII), the extent of electronic interactions between carotenoid dark states (Car S 1) and chlorophyll (Chl) states, φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl, correlates linearly with chlorophyll fluorescence quenching under different experimental conditions. Simultaneously, a linear correlation between both Chl fluorescence quenching and φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl with the intensity of red-shifted bands in the Chl Qy and carotenoid absorption was also observed. These results suggest <b>quenching</b> excitonic <b>Car</b> S 1 −Chl states as origin for the observed effects. Furthermore, real time measurements of the light-dependent down- and up-regulation of the photosynthetic activity and φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl in wild-type and mutant (npq 1, npq 2, npq 4, lut 2 and WT+PsbS) Arabidopsis thaliana plants reveal that also in vivo the quenching parameter NPQ correlates always linearly with the extent of electronic Car S 1 –Chl interactions in any adaptation status. Our in vivo measurements with Arabidopsis variants show that during high light illumination, φCouplingCar S 1 −Chl depends {{on the presence of}} PsbS and zeaxanthin (Zea) in an almost identical way as NPQ. In summary, these results provide clear evidence for a very close link between electronic Car S 1 –Chl interactions and the regulation of photosynthesis. These findings support a photophysical mechanism in which short-living, low excitonic carotenoid–chlorophyll states serve as traps and dissipation valves for excess excitation energy...|$|R
40|$|Upon high light {{excitation}} in photosynthetic bacteria, various triplet {{states of}} pigments can accumulate leading to harmful effects. Here, the generation and lifetime of flash-induced carotenoid triplets (3 Car) {{have been studied}} by observation of the quenching of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) fluorescence in different strains of photosynthetic bacteria including Rvx. gelatinosus (anaerobic and semianaerobic), Rsp. rubrum, Thio. roseopersicina, Rba. sphaeroides 2. 4. 1 and carotenoid- and cytochrome-deficient mutants Rba. sphaeroides Ga, R- 26, and cycA, respectively. The following results were obtained: (1) 3 <b>Car</b> <b>quenching</b> is observed during and not exclusively after the photochemical rise of the fluorescence yield of BChl indicating that the charge separation in the reaction center (RC) and the carotenoid triplet formation are not consecutive but parallel processes. (2) The photoprotective function of 3 Car {{is not limited to}} the RC only and can be described by a model in which the carotenoids are distributed in the lake of the BChl pigments. (3) The observed lifetime of 3 Car in intact cells is the weighted average of the lifetimes of the carotenoids with various numbers of conjugated double bonds in the bacterial strain. (4) The lifetime of 3 Car measured in the light is significantly shorter (1 - 2 mus) than that measured in the dark (2 - 10 mus). The difference reveals the importance of the dynamics of 3 Car before relaxation. The results will be discussed not only in terms of energy levels of the 3 Car but also in terms of the kinetics of transitions among different sublevels in the excited triplet state of the carotenoid...|$|R
40|$|The aim of my {{dissertation}} {{work was}} to synthesize and validate {{the concept of}} photodynamic therapy (PDT) beacons that are specific to cancer cell-associated targets that can be simultaneously used for near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and PDT. I have focused on decreasing the background for imaging and the treatment sideffects. I targeted three groups of molecular fingerprints of cancer cells [...] -unique mRNAs, overexpressed proteases, and cancer-associated receptors [...] -by attaching either DNA, a short peptide, or Folate to the fluorescent photosensitizer Pyropheophorbide a (Pyro). I synthesized three main classes of PDT beacons differing in the quencher attached. The first, so-called 2 ̆ 2 killer beacon 2 ̆ 2, contains carotenoid (<b>Car),</b> <b>quenching</b> both fluorescence and singlet oxygen. The DNA or peptide linker holds the Pyro and Car together until this beacon finds a cancer-specific mRNA or protease. Once the DNA linker hybridizes to a mRNA target or the target protease cleaves the peptide linker, Pyro and Car {{are no longer in}} close proximity and both fluorescence and 1 O 2 production are restored, thus imaging and consequently killing the diseased cells. This concept was validated in solution by monitoring the 1 O 2 and fluorescence restoration and partly also in cells. The second class has no quencher to reduce the light-dependent toxicity or fluorescence. It uses a short hydrophilic peptide and Folate (targeting cancer-overexpressed folate receptor) attached to Pyro to enhance cancer selectivity. The cell work and in vivo biodistribution revealed the positive impact of peptide on tumor-selective uptake and avoidance of liver and spleen. Because of their excellent biodistribution, the probes in this class show particular promise for clinical applications. The third class contains a fluorescence quencher BHQ- 3, connected to Pyro through various peptide linkers, serving as substrates for target proteases. These fluorescence-quenched beacons incorporate the lessons learned from experiments on the second class and, depending on their design, they were either proven to be useful for assessing the success of PDT (or other anticancer therapy) by monitoring caspase- 3 activity, imaging the sites of apoptosis by restored Pyro fluorescence in situ, or they were shown to identify cells with protease-of-interest expression by restored fluorescence, to focus the subsequent therapy. ...|$|R
40|$|Sensitization of singlet delta oxygen (O 2 (1 Δg)) by bacteriochlorophyll e (BChle) {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{to gain a better}} understanding of the photoprotection mechanism(s) operating in chlorosomes of green photosynthetic bacteria. The sensitization process has been studied in media where BChle forms monomers (acetone and aqueous solutions containing 0. 5 % Triton X- 100 [TX]) and in systems where BChle aggregates, namely, aqueous solutions containing 0. 003 % monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG) and chlorosomes (control as well as hexanol perturbed) from Chlorobium phaeobacteroides strain CL 1401. In Ar-purged acetone, BChle triplets (BChle†) have a lifetime of a few tens of microseconds; however, in air-saturated acetone, quenching of BChle† by ground-state oxygen (O 2 (3 Σ−g)) and formation of O 2 (1 Δg) take place. The O 2 (1 Δg) so formed is susceptible to quenching by BChle 0, a ground-state BChle molecule. A Stern–Volmer analysis reveals a linear fit between the decay rate of O 2 (1 Δg) and the BChle concentration. The rate constants for the quenching of O 2 (1 Δg) by BChle 0 and for the deactivation of O 2 (1 Δg) by the solvent come out to be kq= (1. 4 ± 0. 1) × 10 ^ 9 M− 1 s− 1 and k 0 = (18. 5 ± 0. 7) × 10 ^ 3 s− 1, respectively. The absolute quantum yield of O 2 (1 Δg) sensitization by BChle monomers is 0. 65 ± 0. 15 in air-saturated acetone. In aqueous phase, the triplet lifetime of BChle aggregates in native or hexanol-perturbed chlorosomes shortens by more than two orders of magnitude when compared with the triplet lifetime of BChle monomers in 0. 5 % TX solution (a few hundreds of microseconds). <b>Quenching</b> by carotenoids (<b>Car)</b> makes only a minor contribution to the decay of BChle† in aggregates. Because O 2 (1 Δg) sensitization by BChle† could be detected neither in MGDG aggregates nor in chlorosomes (control as well as hexanol perturbed), it is concluded that (1) this process is highly likely when BChle is present as a monomer but not when it is tightly packed in artificial aggregates or in chlorosomes; and (2) Car, though vital for the baseplate BChla, are dispensable for BChle.
