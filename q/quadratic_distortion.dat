40|$|Distortion in the ISAR {{image of}} a target is known to cause by {{non-uniform}} rotational motion of the target during image formation. The conventional explanation describes the image <b>distortion</b> as a <b>quadratic</b> phase <b>distortion</b> effect. This <b>quadratic</b> phase <b>distortion</b> effect is significant only when the target image is integrated {{over an extended period}} of time; i. e., over a large angular rotation by the target. In many measured ISAR images such as those from in-flight aircraft, the distortion can be quite severe; but the image integration time is only a few seconds in duration and the target’s relative rotational displacement is only a few degrees at the most. <b>Quadratic</b> phase <b>distortion</b> is not adequate in explaining the severe blurring in many of these observations. Furthermore, time-frequency analysis of the distorted images often reveals that the Doppler frequency of the target is fluctuating randomly in nature and displays no quadratic phase behaviour temporally. A numerical model based on a time-varying target rotation rate has been developed to model the observed distortion. It has successfully modelled the severe distortion with all the observed characteristics. The model’s simulated results have been validated by experimental data. The severe distortion is attributed to the phase modulation effect where a time-varying Doppler frequency provides the smearing mechanism. It has been shown that the <b>quadratic</b> phase <b>distortion</b> can be considered as a special case of the phase modulatio...|$|R

The lensing data is constructed {{to make a}} direct comparison between mass reconstructions with and without flexion. We show that {{in the absence of}} flexion measurements, significant galaxy-group scale substructure can remain undetected in the reconstructed mass profiles, and that the resulting profiles underestimate the aperture mass in the substructure regions by ∼ 25 - 40 %. When flexion is included, subhaloes down to a mass of ∼ 3 × 10 ^ 12 M_ can be detected at an angular resolution smaller than 10. Aperture masses from profiles reconstructed with flexion match the input distribution values to within an error of ∼ 13 %, including both statistical error and scatter. This demonstrates the important constraint that flexion measurements place on substructure in galaxy clusters and its utility for producing high-fidelity mass reconstructions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{recently}} synthesized {{and isolated}} low-coordinate FeV nitride complex has numerous implications {{as a model}} for high-oxidation states in biological and industrial systems. The trigonal [PhB(tBuIm) 3 Fe VN]+ (where (PhB-(tBuIm) 3 − = phenyltris(3 -tert-butylimidazol- 2 -ylidene)), (1) low-spin d 3 (S = 1 / 2) coordination compound is subject to a Jahn−Teller (JT) distortion of its doubly degenerate 2 E ground state. The electronic structure of this complex is analyzed by a combination of extended versions of the formal two-orbital pseudo Jahn−Teller (PJT) treatment and of quantum chemical computations of the PJT effect. The formal treatment is extended to incorporate mixing of the two e orbital doublets (30 %) that results from a lowering of the idealized molecular symmetry from D 3 h to C 3 v through strong “doming ” of the Fe−C 3 core. Correspondingly we introduce novel DFT/CASSCF computational methods in the computation of electronic structure, which reveal a <b>quadratic</b> JT <b>distortion</b> and significant e−e mixing, thus reaching a new level of synergism between computationa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A {{network with}} two sensors {{communicating}} a re-mote measurement {{to a common}} access point (AP) is investigated. The sensors are connected via out-of-band and finite-capacity communication links, e. g., thanks to an orthogonal radio inter-face, thus enabling partial cooperation. Focusing on a Gaussian model for source and observation noise and a <b>quadratic</b> (MSE) <b>distortion</b> metric, both the source coding problem (corresponding to error-free and orthogonal links to the AP), {{also known as the}} "CEO problem", and the joint source-channel coding problem over a Gaussian multiple access channel to the AP are considered. In the first case, an achievable rate-distortion trade-off is derived that generalizes known results for the CEO problem in the absence of cooperation between the sensors. For the latter case, achievable distortions are derived with separate or joint source-channel coding. Optimality of the proposed schemes is established asymptotically with the capacity of the inter-sensor links. Moreover, it is concluded that, for both scenarios, even modest values of such capacity enable the optimal performance with full cooperation to be approached. I...|$|R

Numerical simulation validates our analytical results.

30|$|In the literature, {{there are}} several zero-delay coding systems. One {{of the most common}} zero-delay coding systems is the {{well-known}} differential pulse code modulation (DPCM). In a nutshell, the current sample to be coded is predicted from previously coded samples. This prediction is used as a reference, and it is compared with the current sample. Hence, the output of the encoder is the prediction error. The inverse operation takes place at the decoder side. According to [11], DPCM was first introduced in a US patent by C. Cutler in 1952. Since then, many results have appeared. In particular, the autoregressive (AR) model has received special attention for the study of zero-delay coding schemes. Some of the early works on AR models date back to the 1960 s. The works in [12, 13] analyze the <b>quadratic</b> rate <b>distortion</b> of DPCM (the reader can find an extended description of the rate distortion in Chapter 13 of [14]). The work in [15] extends these results assuming a Gaussian distribution of the predicted error. Other works proposed algorithms for non-uniform quantizers optimized in order to minimize the distortion rate [16].|$|R
30|$|Distortion in the ISAR {{image of}} a target {{is a result of}} {{nonuniform}} rotational motion of the target during the imaging period. In many of the measured ISAR images from moving targets, such as those from in-flight aircraft, the distortion can be quite severe. Often, the image integration time is only a few seconds in duration and the target's rotational displacement is only a few degrees. The conventional <b>quadratic</b> phase <b>distortion</b> effect is not adequate in explaining the severe blurring in many of these observations. A numerical model based on a time-varying target rotation rate has been developed to quantify the distortion in the ISAR image. It has successfully modelled the severe distortion observed; the model's simulated results are validated by experimental data. Results from the analysis indicate that the severe distortion is attributed to the phase modulation effect where a time-varying Doppler frequency provides the smearing mechanism. For target identification applications, an efficient method on refocusing distorted ISAR images based on time-frequency analysis has also been developed based on the insights obtained from the results of the numerical modelling and experimental investigation conducted in this study.|$|R

30|$|The current {{implementation}} of the rate control algorithm in the JM reference software follows the adaptive scheme as described in JVT-G 012 r [4]. There is however some limitation on the adaptive rate control algorithm and improvements have been proposed by several researchers. The adaptive rate control in [4] has two main objectives: the computation {{of the number of}} target bits and the mapping of the target bits to an appropriate QP that will be used for coding the current frame. The computation of the target bits relies on the estimation of the frame complexity using a linear MAD prediction of the previous frames. Since the prediction does not consider the complexity of the current frame to be encoded, the MAD prediction is not an accurate estimate of the frame complexity, especially in complex sequences containing a lot of motion. The mapping of the frame QP to the target bits uses a <b>quadratic</b> rate <b>distortion</b> model; the number of bits allocated for residue depends on the computed target bits and the average header bits used in the previous frames. For low bit-rate applications and complex sequences, the target and header bits are not accurately predicted. Thus, the resulting QP assignment for encoding the current frame may not be optimal. Also the design of the rate control does not consider the overhead of using FMO; hence, whenever FMO is enabled, the adaptive rate control cannot accurately meet the target bits.|$|R
