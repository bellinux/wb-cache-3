In humans, a gene encoding INMT is determined to be located on chromosome 7. Northern blot analyses reveal INMT messenger RNA (mRNA) to be highly expressed in rabbit lung, and in human thyroid, adrenal gland, and lung. Intermediate levels of expression are found in human heart, skeletal muscle, trachea, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, testis, prostate, placenta, lymph node, and spinal cord. Low to very low levels of expression are noted in rabbit brain, and human thymus, liver, spleen, kidney, colon, ovary, and bone marrow. INMT mRNA expression is absent in human peripheral blood leukocytes, whole brain, and in tissue from 7 specific brain regions (thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, amygdala, substantia nigra, and corpus callosum). Immunohistochemistry showed INMT {{to be present in}} large amounts in glandular epithelial cells of small and large intestines. In 2011, immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of INMT in primate nervous tissue including retina, spinal cord motor neurons, and pineal gland.|$|E

40|$|According to Matthew Lipman, the {{community}} of philosophical inquiry {{can be understood as}} a social matrix generating a variety of social relationships and building up the framework of the cognitive matrices whose outcomes are cognitive relationships. From this perspective, {{the community}}, intended both as an existential as well as a social structure, is the ground for the emergence and development of complex thinking involving both critical, creative and caring cognitive processes. A community goes back to a pattern of relationships and interactions built on the recognition and acceptance of a cultural, ideological, religious or social reference with which the members of the group identify, and which represents the reason for them to form as a group. Communities generate relationships of commitment, sharing, and understanding that are the ground of caring thinking habits, but they are also the generative context of a process of continuous building/re-building/validation of shared meanings and sensibilities which is the ground for critical thinking. In a community context the dynamic between individual-individual and individual-community is both the expression and the management of conflict and opposition, and the construction of new existential, expressive and cognitive forms that allow for the emergence of thoughts capable of composition, integration, <b>qualitative</b> <b>leaps,</b> and surpassing and transcending phases therefore generating creative forms of thinking. As such, {{the community of}} philosophical inquiry represents a socio-relational matrix that is inseparably both epistemic and existential, and which reverberates along new links that build up between objects, between people, and within the world in a continuous circuit, and in which new senses and meanings are always being generated.

40|$|Initiation of {{the modern}} era of surface science, {{generally}} acknowledged as starting in the late 1960 s, {{was made possible by}} two distinct <b>qualitative</b> <b>leaps</b> forward. One was the Sputnik-inspired development of ultra-high vacuum and electron-optical technologies. The other was the recognition and development of theoretical and measurement techniques for studying surface properties and processes on the (single!) atomic level. The field emission spectroscopy result reported in this 1969 NBS paper [1] was the first work in which the electronic energy level spectra of adsorbed atoms was observed and theoretically interpreted. All subsequent electron energy level spectroscopy of adsorbed atoms and molecules, whether based on tunneling processes such as in this work or on photon-induced processes, can legitimately be considered as logical consequences of this pioneering study. The spectroscopic information so obtained is the essential ingredient required in all quantum mechanical modeling of chemical bonding, catalysis, dynamics, and reactivity at solid surfaces, and {{it is for this reason}} that the advances reported in this paper have had lasting and historical significance. The situation at NBS at the time was particularly well suited for the laboratory to become one of the three or four pre-eminent international centers of excellence leading the transformation of then-existing surface studies from a qualitative mystical art into a quantitative and intellectually stimulating hard science in which the basic systems and processes under study could be understood at the most fundamental atomic level. Major efforts in atomic and electron physics were focused on the development of monochromatic electron sources and energy analyzers (of special importance here, the work of John Simpson and Chris Kuyatt) and in their utilization for basic atomic physics studies, particularly those theoretically inspired by Ugo Fano (discussed elsewhere in this volume). A major direction in electron beam production relied upon field emitted/ tunneled electrons as a promising source, and it was within this context that Russ Young came to NBS in 1961 and soon was attracting world-wide attention for his measurements and interpretation of field emission energy distributions as a new probe of the electroni...|$|R

40|$|This AAA {{symposium}} on {{the emergence of}} global society is a welcome expression of a revival of interest by anthropologists in issues of world-wide scale. For too long, anthropologists believed such matters to be the proper domain of economists and political scientists onlyThe emergence of global society {{is nothing less than}} the evolution of a new system at a higher level of integration. Julian Steward told us in 1951 that, in culture, simple forms, such as those represented by the family or band, do not wholly disappear when a more complex state of development is reached, but they gradually become modified as specialized dependent parts of new kinds of total configurations. Anthropologists have overemphasized the nation-state, treating {{it as if it were}} a fundamental component of the universe instead of merely one among many institutional products of cultural evolution. To understand the emergence of global society, we must understand evolution. Within a sociocultural system is a hierarchy of sub-systems each with some identity of its own. Although all sociocultural systems exhibit some degree of integration, the mode of integration of systems at different levels is not necessarily the same. The rules or principles that govern systems at different levels are different. In the physical sciences, the forces that govern the organization of nanoelements [...] quarks, corpuscles, atoms – are different from those that govern macrocosms of satellite systems and galaxies. In the biological realm, also, are systems at different levels organized by different principles. [...] from the colloidal aggregates to organisms, populations, ecosystems. Analogous to these other systemic hierarchies is the sociocultural hierarchy that diverges in another dimension from the organic hierarchy. We get from such meager beginnings as domestic groups and bands to an anticipated global society not by mere expansion, but by the emergence of new forms generated by the interaction among original elements. Global society and global culture will be a new synthesis using as its components modified forms of the subsystems that now exist [...] Instead of assuming that a system is bounded and that every part is within that boundary, we must take the interdependence of components as problematic, so that system parts may be more or less autonomous and dependent with respect to the total configuration. The use of network models to analyze situations where groups are not well defined is another example of deliberate flexibility in our way of thinking. Even the concept 2 ̆ 2 society 2 ̆ 2 needs to be reconsidered, for all societies are much more open systems than earlier theories would have them. Newly developing mathematical approaches describe generative processes where a continuously changing factor has an abrupt novel effect. New methods of analysis help us to model, and hence to understand a variety of morphogenetic phenomena which appear to be <b>qualitative</b> <b>leaps.</b> In evolutionary terms, it holds promise of explaining how a new sociocultural system can emerge at a higher level of integration. The hierarchical arrangement improves the probability of the evolution of a still higher level of system. It remains an empirical question to discover how and to what degree the system or systems of global scale constrain or compel the behavior of constituent subsystems and institutional components such as nation-states, multinational corporations, cities, families, etc. I also argue that the decline of state power commensurate with the currently increasing activity of multinational corporations has increased the autonomy of some cities relative to the states wherein they are located...|$|R

He was called: “Abu Abdollah Mahmoud ibn Hammad At-Tehrani Ar-Razi”. As the predecessor of Isfahan, the previous Iranian capital of two of the greatest Islamic Empires, the Seljuks and the Safavids, Tehran has a rather short background as a capital and a shorter one as a worldwide well-known megalopolis. On one hand as one of the ten largest cities all around the world, Tehran is faced with all the problems that other metropolises already have. On the other hand it is faced with another fundamental problem: despite many of other cities in its scale or even lower, it has been benefiting from no permanent river in its terrain.

40|$|Our lecture {{explores the}} medial {{construction}} and aestheticising of the war, examining current TV documentaries on the First World War. Two time planes are here intertwined: {{on the first}} level we see how the film medium during World War One lends to the industrialised war events a new aesthetic dimension. In the second, contemporary level, this film material is reassembled and charged with additional significance. Both temporal levels are inseparably intertwined with one another – both construct the modern mythos of the “clean” war. In contemporary TV documentaries the aesthetic of mechanised war is endowed with an additional function that transcends the former. It ties in with a widespread tendency in German mnemonic culture of perceiving the Germans primarily as victims. World War One was not – as is so often asserted – the “first mediatised war“. Already in the American Civil War, {{as well as in}} subsequent wars, intensive photo coverage was developed, ever more frequently with the work of amateur photographers. Photographs of war action became ubiquitous. Nevertheless, a <b>qualitative</b> developmental <b>leap</b> did occur in film portrayal during the First World War. At that time, war reports resorted repeatedly to traditional iconographic stylistic devices and pictorial aesthetic conventions of war photography: the weapon still life, “general’s-eye-views“ of the battle field, heroic soldiers, war as “picnic”; especially the non-functional film reports, though, remained rigid, and with a multitude of artificial scenes, delivered a hardly realistic view of combat events. However, the fictional portrayal of war in movies supervened, and by writing over real war experiences with played out scenarios, gradually blurred the distinction between fiction and reality, transforming war into entertainment. The TV documentaries we examined resort to wartime pictorial material, though in their recombination of the film sequences following our contemporary video-aesthetic, with a high pictorial content, quick cuts and dramatic production. This aesthetic is closely oriented towards our contemporary images of the modern, engineered war. Our first part consists in a detailed film- and picture analysis of wartime film material. In our second part, we examine how TV authors work with this material. Our focus here will be on the aestheticising of technological artefacts in war events and the stylising of scientific war research as symbols of modern warfare. These two inquiries constitute the basis of a conclusive synthesis, which examines continuities and breaks in the narration these pictures transport. The lecture offers a contribution to the discussion on the treatment of pictures in the media and in historical science. Inherent in this research is also the principal question of whether the little picture- and film material we have determines our view of the First World War. Are not the images of World War One not rather reread and reassembled in the course of contemporary discourse...|$|R
40|$|The {{life and}} work of the Alsatian hermeticist and Egyptosophist, René-Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz (1887 - 1961) attests to the {{continued}} presence of a distinctly nondual current of alchemical precept and practice in which material transmutation and spiritual transmutation are not separate nor merely coincidental endeavours but two indispensably linked {{sides of the same}} coin. The link, for Schwaller, was perceived as a juncture of meta-physical and proto-physical forces, a process conceived in terms of an alchemical “salt” (a neutralisation reaction between an “acid” and a “base”). This thesis demonstrates that Lubiczian alchemy, by centring on the esoteric formation of all “bodies”, to include the hidden “nucleus” of continuity between metallurgical, biological and spiritual corporeality, speaks directly to the perception of alchemy as a nondual, operative-spiritual process. Before examining Schwaller’s work proper, part one of this thesis deals with methodological and historiographical considerations at some length. I begin by detailing the “hermetic problem of salt” through cultural-historical, mythographical, chemical and alchemical lenses in order to introduce the phenomenon of salt as an “abstract concretion” resulting from polarised opposites (acid and base, fire and water, sun and sea, sulphur and mercury, etc.) The juncture of opposing principles perceived in the “hermetic problem” of salt anticipates the methodological discussion, which examines the dichotomy between history and phenomenology, along with the materialist and metaphysical sympathies of these methodologies. Form mirroring content, the method employed in this thesis seeks to establish a “neutralisation reaction” between such extremes, encompassing both empirical-historical and eidetic-phenomenological approaches. The guiding model for this synthesis is the Heraclitean palintonos harmoniē (counter-stretched harmony), in which inherently opposed tensions are viewed as integral rather than antithetical to the deeper vitality of the whole. Following from this, the broader argument of this thesis is based upon the perception that the modern academic caricature of alchemy as either operative (reducible to chemical explanations) or spiritual (reducible to psychological explanations) is in many respects a false dichotomy. In support of a more integrative premise, detailed examples are adduced from both eastern and western branches of alchemy (i) to argue for the revision of rigidly dualistic biases within the historiography of alchemy and (ii) to lend support to the adoption of a more nuanced critical apparatus that is able {{to come to terms with}} nondualistic currents within the plurality of alchemies. Upon these premises, the {{life and work}} of Schwaller de Lubicz is turned to as a modern exemplar of this nondual current in alchemy. Part two of this thesis focuses on Schwaller de Lubicz’s life and work, his colour theory, and his alchemy. Through a detailed bio-bibliographical survey, the keys to Schwaller’s intellectual development are presented and situated within their relevant contexts. I examine his artistic, Theosophical, socio-political, initiatic, alchemical and Egyptological milieus. As a student of Matisse, Schwaller had a life-long interest in colour and light. For this reason, the colour phenomenon is presented as a guiding thread for the dynamics of Lubiczian alchemy in general and the “manipulation of salt” in particular. The colour theory is examined with reference to Newton’s Opticks, Goethe’s Farbenlehre and ultimately to the operative work on stained glass that Schwaller undertook with Jean-Julien Champagne (alias Fulcanelli). The work on colour, metals and stained glass is for Schwaller a propadeutic for understanding the process by which spirit (light, colour) transforms the bodies in which it is incarnated (matter, substance). Ultimately, the “hermetic problem of salt” is seen to centre directly upon the mineral register of an entity’s consciousness (palingenetic memory); because this imperishable register of consciousness is also the determiner of an entity’s form, salt is consequently regarded as the mechanism of evolution, resurrection and palingenesis. The deeper dynamics of Lubiczian alchemy thus concerns the role of this “fixed nucleus” in the formation of bodies, from mineral to human. In particular, I examine the principles of Schwaller’s metallurgical alchemy in order to understand how the “spirit of metals” acts as a fiery metallic seed (sulphur) that “coagulates” a nutritive substance (mercury) into a bodily form (salt). This understanding is applied to the stained-glass work. I then look at his meta-biological alchemy, in which it is not the genetic seed but the palingenetic mineral salt that forms the determining principle in the biological entity’s evolution. In essence, Schwaller’s “hermetic problem of salt” is understood as the fulcrum not only of individual immortality, but also of the <b>qualitative</b> mutations (<b>leaps)</b> between kingdoms and species. More specifically, the kingdoms of nature are seen to emerge alchemically through ‘qualitative exaltations’ induced by the divine seed-ferment (sulphur) upon the primordial materia (mercury) giving rise to a neutral centre of gravity: the saline magnetic nucleus or ‘styptic coagulating force’, the spiritual locus of physical form. In the final analysis, Schwaller’s alchemy is quintessentially nondual in the sense that it encompasses both operative and spiritual processes. These are not separate but deeply interrelated realities. Through the idea of salt, Schwaller offers a holarchical explanation for the continuities between mineralogical, biological and spiritual bodies, and thus a theory for the material mechanism by which consciousness transforms phenomenal form. To approach this kind of alchemy as exclusively chemical or psychological is thus completely inadequate and reinforces the necessity for a nondual critical apparatus...|$|R

All made with the brand of Professor Moniz Pereira, who imposed a discipline of iron at the time of training, who ministered without tolerating delays even if there was an earthquake.|$|E

It {{should be noted that}} after {{the events of}} 1997, MP had a {{tremendous}} growth {{on the basis of a}} project with the Italian Delegation of Experts (DIE). At that time, with the assistance of Italian specialists, for the first time, the MP battalion was created in Tirana, which was equipped with the necessary logistics and materials, and it was conceived according to Italian Carabinieri battalions. The establishment of MP battalion in Tirana marks a <b>qualitative</b> <b>leap</b> in the activity of this modern structure and the most qualitative of the time, which became apparent in the events of 1998, when the MP not only suffered any damage, but it defended several state institutions such as, the Radio Televizioni Shqiptar, Albtelecom, General Prosecutor’s Office and several international institutions.|$|E
5000|$|The {{enactment}} of the Temporary Securities Law, No. 23 of the year 1997, was a landmark; indeed, it was a <b>qualitative</b> <b>leap</b> and {{a turning point for}} the Jordanian capital market. Its aim was to restructure and regulate the Jordanian capital market, and to complete its infrastructure in consistence with international standards, in order to secure transparency and safe trading in securities. The central feature of this restructuring effort was the separation of the supervisory and legislative role from the executive role of the capital market. The latter was left to the private sector, whereby Amman Stock Exchange/ Securities Market (ASE) and the Securities Depository Center (SDC) played the executive role, and the supervisory and legislative role was entrusted to Jordan Securities Commission (JSC). The Law provided for setting up three new institutions to replace AFM, namely: ...|$|E

Optical fibers underlie high-speed communication in access, metro, and long-haul networks, making the use of the Internet possible over intercontinental distances. Light is also at the heart of integrated optoelectronic devices for data modulation and routing, CDs and optical data storage, and all types of displays.ICFO conducts research in classical communications, covering areas such as integrated optics, optoelectronics, and optical fiber devices. ICFO also investigatesdisruptive approaches based on nanophotonics and quantum technologies. Nanophotonics offers an unprecedented miniaturization potential. As for quantuminformation systems, they represent a <b>qualitative</b> <b>leap</b> forward in the design of specialized communication systems for applications like high-security transactionsof commercial or strategic interest.Ongoing research programs focus on areas as diverse as transparent and advanced displays, plasmonic-based devices, light emission and detection by nanoantennas, wide-scope transparent ultrathin-film electrode technologies, novel micro and nanofabrication technologies, compact quantum cryptography, quantum satellite communications (sponsored by the European Space Agency), quantum memories, quantum computation, and advanced quantum information protocols.|$|E
