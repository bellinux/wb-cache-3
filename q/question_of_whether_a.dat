5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), the Court held that a motion for a new trialas authorized by the § 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion. Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), the Court held that {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time that the presidential run was being considered, there was also some {{speculation}} that Bloomberg could be a candidate for the vice presidency in 2008.

25|$|The term {{external}} affairs avoided the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> colony or Dominion—self-governing and hence sovereign in some respects—could, by definition, have foreign affairs. Implicitly, since {{the department was}} responsible for affairs with both Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries, all external relations were of a type, even when {{the head of state}} was shared with other nations.|$|E

25|$|Suffrage {{is often}} {{conceived}} {{in terms of}} elections for representatives. However, suffrage applies equally to referenda and initiatives. Suffrage describes not only {{the legal right to}} vote, but also the practical <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> question will be put to a vote. The utility of suffrage is reduced when important questions are decided unilaterally by elected or non-elected representatives.|$|E
25|$|The Marshall Court heard thirty-one {{criminal}} cases under the certificate of division procedure authorized by § 6 of the Judiciary Act of 1802. However, the Court had {{held that the}} sufficiency of the evidence could not be certified—whether on a motion {{for a new trial}} or a motion for a directed verdict. In United States v. Briggs (Briggs I) (1847), the Court further limited its jurisdiction to hear criminal certificates of division by holding that the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> demurrer to an indictment should be sustained was to general to be certified.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Roman Law in the Common Law of England {{is found in}} 1237–1238, in which a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> palatinate can be partitioned among co-heirs. The justices could find no precedent for such a thing in English law, nor in the Magna Carta, nor in Roman Law (in iure scripto), therefore, they adjoined (delayed) their decision. In Bracton's time, it had been determined that the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was deemed to be a subject of the King of England while in England: Ricardus Rex Alemanniae (Rex Romanorum semper augustus) was impleaded for novel disseisin.|$|E

50|$|The continents of Northern Crown are {{primarily}} modelled after {{those found in}} the real world as understood by European explorers and cartographers of the time.

There is no direct evidence of voyaging out in dugouts to harpoon whales that could kill the voyagers in an instant. However, {{one of the two}} main types of pottery used was the blubber lamp, a small, oval deep dish in which you ignited a chunk of blubber or even oil with a wick. The widespread use of this lamp implies a widespread industry to obtain blubber; i.e., professional whale and seal hunting.|$|E
25|$|There {{are more}} extreme {{examples}} showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only {{model is the}} real numbers if the continuum hypothesis holds and which has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold (cf. Shapiro 2000, p.105). This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates that the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1841 {{with his}} Criticism of the Gospel History of the Synoptics, Bauer argued that Jesus was {{primarily}} a literary figure, but left open the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> historical Jesus existed at all. Then in his Criticism of the Pauline Epistles (1850–1852) and in A Critique of the Gospels and a History of their Origin (1850–1851), Bauer argued that Jesus had not existed. Bauer's work was heavily criticized at the time, as in 1839 he was removed from his position at the University of Bonn and his work {{did not have much}} impact on future myth theorists.|$|E

25|$|The {{resulting}} upheavals {{from his}} son Akhenaten's reforming zeal would shake these old certainties to their very foundations and bring forth the central <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> pharaoh was {{more powerful than the}} existing domestic order as represented by the Amun priests and their numerous temple estates. Akhenaten even moved the capital away from the city of Thebes in an effort to break the influence of that powerful temple and assert his own preferred choice of deities, the Aten. Akhenaten moved the Egyptian capital to the site known today as Amarna (though originally known as Akhetaten, 'Horizon of Aten'), and eventually suppressed the worship of Amun.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{and other}} {{scholars}} {{disagree on the}} <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> specifically fascist type of economic policy {{can be said to}} exist. Baker argues that there is an identifiable economic system in fascism that is distinct from those advocated by other ideologies, comprising essential characteristics that fascist nations shared. Payne, Paxton, Sternhell, et al. argue that while fascist economies share some similarities, there is no distinctive form of fascist economic organization. Feldman and Mason argue that fascism is distinguished by an absence of coherent economic ideology and an absence of serious economic thinking. They state that the decisions taken by fascist leaders cannot be explained within a logical economic framework.|$|E
25|$|While it is {{possible}} to assume that quantum mechanical predictions are due to nonlocal, hidden variables, and in fact David Bohm invented such a formulation, this resolution is not satisfactory to the vast majority of physicists. The <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> random outcome is predetermined by a nonlocal theory can be philosophical, and it can be potentially intractable. If the hidden variables are not constrained, they could just be a list of random digits that are used to produce the measurement outcomes. To make it sensible, the assumption of nonlocal hidden variables is sometimes augmented by a second assumption—that the size of the observable universe puts a limit on the computations that these variables can do. A nonlocal theory of this sort predicts that a quantum computer would encounter fundamental obstacles when attempting to factor numbers of approximately 10,000 digits or more; a potentially achievable task in quantum mechanics.|$|E

5000|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} lower courts had offered {{different}} {{opinions on the}} <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> invention could be [...] "on sale" [...] {{within the meaning of}} the statute before it had actually reduced to practice.

25|$|Another {{distinction}} is the unavailability {{of a jury}} in equity: the judge is the trier of fact. In the American legal system, the right of jury trial in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment in Suits at common law, cases that traditionally would have been handled by the law courts. The <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> case should be determined by a jury depends largely {{on the type of}} relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an injunction, declaratory judgment, specific performance, modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.|$|E
25|$|A graph {{property}} is the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> graph {{belongs to a}} given family of graphs; the answer must remain invariant under any relabeling of the vertices. In this context, the question to be determined is how many pairs of vertices must be tested for adjacency, in the worst case, before the property of interest can be determined to be true or false for a given implicit graph. Rivest and Vuillemin proved that any deterministic algorithm for any nontrivial graph property must test a quadratic number of pairs of vertices. The full Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture is that any deterministic algorithm for a monotonic graph property (one that remains true if more edges are added to a graph with the property) must in some cases test every possible pair of vertices. Several cases of the conjecture have been proven to be true—for instance, it {{is known to be}} true for graphs with a prime number of vertices—but the full conjecture remains open. Variants of the problem for randomized algorithms and quantum algorithms have also been studied.|$|E
25|$|The treaty {{introduces}} an exit clause {{for members}} wanting {{to withdraw from}} the Union. This formalises the procedure by stating that a member state must inform the European Council before it can terminate its membership, and a withdrawal agreement would then be negotiated between the Union and that State, with the Treaties ceasing to be applicable to that State from the date of the agreement or, failing that, within two years of the notification unless the State and the Council both agree to extend this period. There have been several instances where a territory has ceased {{to be part of the}} Community, e.g. Greenland in 1985, though so far no member state has ever left. Before the Lisbon Treaty came into force, the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>a</b> member state had a legal right to leave the union was unclear. Following the referendum of 23 June 2016, the British Prime Minister announced the government's intention of making the notification according to (Article 50) by the end of March 2017.|$|E
50|$|However, at {{a higher}} level, {{scientific}} formalism also involves consideration of the axioms themselves. These {{can be viewed as}} <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> ontology. For example, one can, at the lower level of formalism, define a property called 'existence'. However, at the higher level, the <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> <b>an</b> electron exists in the same sense that a bacterium exists still needs to be resolved.|$|R
50|$|However, {{a smaller}} {{aperiodic}} set, of six non-Wang tiles, {{was discovered by}} Raphael M. Robinson in 1971.
