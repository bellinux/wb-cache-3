5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the <b>quadrat</b> and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the unpredictability of the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

5000|$|In this method, the {{transect}} line is {{laid out}} across the area to be surveyed and a <b>quadrat</b> {{is placed on the}} first marked point on the line. These marked points should be a set amount of space apart. The plants and/or animals inside the <b>quadrat</b> are then identified and their abundance estimated. Animals can be counted within the <b>quadrat,</b> or collected, while it is usual to estimate the percentage cover of plant species. Cover is the area of the <b>quadrat</b> occupied by the above-ground parts of a species when viewed from above. The canopies of the plants inside the <b>quadrat</b> will often overlap each other, so the total percentage cover of plants in a single <b>quadrat</b> will frequently add up to more than 100%.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As part of {{a larger}} survey of {{biodiversity}} in gardens in Sheffield, UK, we examined the composition and diversity of the flora in two 1 -m 2 <b>quadrats</b> in each of 60 gardens, and compared this with floristic data from semi-natural habitats in central England and derelict urban land in Birmingham, UK. Garden <b>quadrats</b> contained {{more than twice as many}} taxa as those from any other habitat type. Ca. 33 % of garden plants were natives and 67 % aliens, mainly from Europe and Asia. A higher proportion of garden aliens originated from Asia and New Zealand than in the UK alien flora as a whole; 18 of the 20 most frequent plants in garden <b>quadrats</b> were natives, mostly common weeds. Garden <b>quadrats</b> showed no evidence of ‘nestedness’, i. e. a tendency for scarce species to be confined to the highest diversity <b>quadrats.</b> Conversely, species in all semi-natural and derelict land data sets were significantly nested. Compared to a range of semi-natural habitats, species richness of garden <b>quadrats</b> was intermediate, and strikingly similar to the richness of derelict land <b>quadrats.</b> Although species accumulation curves for all other habitats showed signs of saturation at 120 <b>quadrats,</b> gardens did not. Correlations between Sørensen similarity index and physical distance were insignificant for all habitat types, i. e. there was little evidence that physical distance played any part in structuring the composition of the <b>quadrats</b> in any of the data sets. However, garden <b>quadrats</b> were much less similar to each other than <b>quadrats</b> from semi-natural habitats or derelict land...|$|R
30|$|Though {{there were}} {{differences}} between years in each taxon’s cover and distribution, the landscape generally contained high-quality, diverse crust communities. We found fruticose-foliose morphological group lichens such as Cladonia spp., Trapeliopsis spp., Diploschistes muscorum, and Aspicilia spp. in most <b>quadrats</b> in both years (Table  1). These groups tend {{to be found in}} undisturbed areas (Hilty et al. 2004; Ponzetti et al. 2007; Dettweiler-Robinson et al. 2013). Lichens such as Rhizocarpon diploschistidina, which parasitizes Diploschistes muscorum, indicate even longer undisturbed time (Ponzetti, personal observation); this species occurred in at least a quarter of our <b>quadrats</b> (Table  1). In addition, Texosporium sancti-jacobi, a Washington state threatened species (Washington Natural Heritage Program 2010) was found on two <b>quadrats</b> in 2010 (Table  1). Either this species dispersed to and established on these <b>quadrats</b> between the two measurements, or it was present but not identifiable on these <b>quadrats</b> in 1999 and subsequently developed identifiable traits. Together, these taxa indicate that these <b>quadrats</b> currently have a relatively high-quality crust.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Awash National Park (ANP), East Shewa Zone of Oromia National Regional Sate, Ethiopia, aimed at determining the impact of parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus L.) on herbaceous diversity. A transect belt of 13. 5 km * 0. 10 km of parthenium weed infested land was identified for the determination of the impact. Four <b>quadrats</b> were purposively laid every 250 m interval two for infested and two for non-infested each {{from both sides of the}} road and a total of 216 <b>quadrats</b> of 2 m x 2 m (4 m 2) were considered. A total of 91 species were identified from which five of them were out of the <b>quadrats.</b> All species were categorized into 21 families, from which Poaceae and Fabaceae shared about 40 %. The species in the non-infested <b>quadrats</b> were found to be more diverse and even when compared to those of the infested <b>quadrats.</b> Infested <b>quadrats</b> were found to be more abundant and dominant. Tetrapogon tenellus was found the dominant specie in the non-infested <b>quadrats</b> while Parthenium hysterophorus was found dominant in the infested followed by T. tenellus. There was no statistically significant difference between the total stand crop biomass of the infested and non-infested.

5000|$|A <b>quadrat</b> is a plot used {{in ecology}} and {{geography}} to isolate a standard unit of area for {{study of the}} distribution of an item over a large area. While originally square, modern quadrats can be rectangular, circular, irregular, etc.,. [...] The <b>quadrat</b> is suitable for sampling plants, slow-moving animals (such as millipedes and insects), and some aquatic organisms. [...] When an ecologist wants to know how many organisms there are in a particular habitat, it would not be feasible to count them all. Instead, they would be forced to count a smaller representative part of the population, called a sample. Sampling of plants or animals that do not move much (such as snails), can be done using a sampling square called a <b>quadrat.</b> A suitable size of a <b>quadrat</b> depends {{on the size of the}} organisms being sampled. For example, to count plants growing on a school field, one could use a <b>quadrat</b> with sides 0.5 or 1 metre in length. Choice of <b>quadrat</b> size depends to a large extent on the type of survey being conducted. For instance, it would be difficult to gain any meaningful results using a 0.5m2 <b>quadrat</b> in a study of a woodland canopy.|$|E

Although B. tectorum cover was recorded by cover class, we converted these data to presence/absence because they were strongly right-skewed, with over half of all <b>quadrats</b> containing no B. tectorum in 1999.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{livestock}} grazing on desert vegetation in Khirthar National Park, Pakistan, was investigated by comparing dry and wet season plant species composition, richness, cover, and a grazing index for <b>quadrats</b> outside ("open") and inside ("exclosed") native mammal breeding enclosures that had excluded livestock for 6 years. A total of 93 plant species {{were recorded in}} the dry season, 88 species in exclosed <b>quadrats</b> and 50 in open <b>quadrats.</b> While only 5 species were unique to open <b>quadrats,</b> 43 species were found only in the exclosed <b>quadrats.</b> Species richness was higher in the exclosures {{because of the presence}} of more grass and herb species, while grazing was higher in the open. After rain, species richness and cover were significantly higher than in the dry season because of the growth of summer ephemeral herbs and grasses, but richness was no longer different between the exclosure and open treatments. Although some herbaceous species may have been adversely affected by livestock grazing, overall species richness suggests strong ecosystem resilience to grazing, with levels no different after seasonal rains regardless of grazing level. Many grass and herb species absent from open sites during the dry season reappeared after rain, which suggests that livestock grazing may eliminate them as the dry season proceeds, but that a soil seed or bud bank persists...|$|R

30|$|At {{all five}} sites, we {{established}} {{five to ten}} transects that were either 5 m or 10 m apart, depending upon {{size and shape of}} the burn unit. We collected plant community and fire severity data in 1 m 2 <b>quadrats</b> placed every 10 m along each transect. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, there were 50 <b>quadrats</b> per burn unit; at Mima Mounds, Scatter Creek, and West Rocky, there were 100 <b>quadrats</b> per burn unit. At Glacial Heritage and Tenalquot, where ignition pattern treatments were applied, there were 21 to 29 <b>quadrats</b> per ignition pattern treatment (sample size was dependent upon where ignition lines met within the burn unit), so sample size between ignition patterns and sites varied slightly. Due {{to the fact that we}} could not replicate ignition pattern treatments within each burn, ignition pattern data are pseudo-replicated within a site (Hurlbert 1984, but see Oksanen 2003 for a rebuttal). Despite this design challenge, we still believe that these data provide a unique opportunity to evaluate fire behavior, severity, and effects associated with fire ignition patterns.|$|R

40|$|A {{geographical}} region, containing {{an unknown}} number of species, is partitioned into N <b>quadrats.</b> The range of a species is defined to be the number of <b>quadrats</b> in which the species is present. A random sample of n <b>quadrats</b> is drawn without replacement, and the species list is determined for each of the selected <b>quadrats.</b> Two estimators of S are proposed. The inclusion probabilities in the Horvitz-Thompson estimator involve the unknown species ranges but these ranges can be estimated to yield an "estimated" Horvitz-Thompson estimator. This estimator is biased because of the use of estimated inclusion probabilities. For the other estimator, it is shown that the expected number of species in the sample having a specified sample range r is a linear combination over R of the number S R of species in the population with population range R. Letting r vary yields a system of linear equations that can be solved to obtain estimates for the S R and for S. These estimators for SR and S are shown to be unbiased when the sample size n is sufficiently large...|$|R

The DCA axis 1 arranged all the <b>quadrats</b> in order of grazing intensity, and the floristic composition changed dramatically in a lopsided stepwise-pattern along this axis. The composition ratio for five groups clustered by TWINSPAN according to plant functional types (toxicity or palatability, and life-form) and family varied {{to a greater or lesser}} extent. Background environmental factors such as soil moisture or landform did not effect much on the pattern of the floristic composition at this site.
