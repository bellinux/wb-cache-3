5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the <b>Quaternary</b> (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the <b>Quaternary</b> caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation of populations must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by <b>Quaternary</b> deposits. Before the <b>Quaternary</b> glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} planation surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the <b>Quaternary</b> glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Monte Burney is {{a volcano}} in {{southern}} Chile, {{part of its}} Austral Volcanic Zone which consists of six volcanoes with activity during the <b>Quaternary.</b> This volcanism {{is linked to the}} subduction of the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate and the Scotia Plate.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 100 <b>Quaternary</b> (Pleistocene- or Holocene-age) {{independent}} volcanoes {{exist in}} the country, in addition to 60volcanic complexes and caldera systems. Of the 200 historically active volcanoes in the Andean Range, 36 are found in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Southern Bedfordshire {{is part of}} the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. North and mid Bedfordshire are undulating claylands {{with broad}} river valleys of the River Great Ouse and its tributaries, and the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge.

5|$|The 15.3 to 7 mya old Campanario Formation forms {{much of the}} {{basement}} in the Laguna del Maule area. This geological formation contains andesitic-dacitic ignimbrites and tuffs with later dacitic dykes that were emplaced 3.6–2.0 mya. This formation is affected by various faults that extend in north-south direction. An older unit, of Jurassic-Cretaceous age, crops out northwest of the volcanic field. Other formations include an Oligocene-Miocene lacustrine formation named Cura-Mallín, and another intermediary formation named Trapa-Trapa. Trapa-Trapa is of volcanic origin and between 19 and 10 million years old. Remnants of <b>Quaternary</b> ignimbrites and Pliocene, early <b>Quaternary</b> volcanic centres, are also found around the field.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the volcano}} was formed in the <b>Quaternary,</b> with {{activity}} commencing in the Miocene. Five million years ago, the first latiandesites were erupted. The minor eruptive centres of Pumaranra and Antapuna are K-Ar dated at 1.3 ± 0.11 and 1.02 ± 0.11 million years old. Much of the volcano was constructed by lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of species}} from {{ecological}} communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the <b>Quaternary</b> extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided {{with the appearance of}} humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the woolly mammoth, into extinction.|$|E
5|$|The oldest fossils {{that fall}} {{within the range of}} the modern coyote date to 0.74–0.85 Ma (million years) in Hamilton Cave, West Virginia; 0.73 Ma in Irvington, California; 0.35–0.48 Ma in Porcupine Cave, Colorado and in Cumberland Cave, Pennsylvania. Modern coyotes arose 1,000 years after the <b>Quaternary</b> {{extinction}} event. Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts, Pleistocene coyotes (C.l. orcutti) were larger and more robust, likely in response to larger competitors and prey. Pleistocene coyotes were likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants, as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat, showing fewer grinding surfaces suited for processing vegetation. Their reduction in size occurred within 1000 years of the <b>Quaternary</b> extinction event, when their large prey died out. Furthermore, Pleistocene coyotes were unable to exploit the big-game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf (C.dirus), as it was rapidly filled by gray wolves, which likely actively killed off the large coyotes, with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph.|$|E
5|$|The {{raised beach}} of wave-cut {{platforms}} {{has been created}} by changes in sea level of the Bristol Channel since the <b>Quaternary</b> period. The arrangement of volcanic and sedimentary rocks, including the Black Rock Limestone, illustrates the events of 350 million years ago. The strata have been tilted and compressed during the variscan orogeny.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in {{the region}} of Carpathia and Pannonia has been ongoing since 20 million years ago but has {{decreased}} during the <b>Quaternary.</b> No eruptions have occurred in the Holocene. The last volcanism occurred at Ciomadul in the last glacial age. Sparse basaltic volcanism has also occurred in the area, forming monogenetic volcanic fields.|$|E
5|$|Cerro Azul {{is part of}} the South Volcanic Zone, {{which runs}} through central and western Chile and extends south to Argentina. This range {{includes}} at least nine caldera complexes, more than 70of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that have been active in the <b>Quaternary,</b> and hundreds of minor eruptive centres. The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically active region in Chile, and produces around one eruption per year. Its largest historical eruption was at Quizapu Crater, located {{on the north side of}} Cerro Azul's summit (see below), and its most active volcanoes are Llaima and Villarrica.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Quaternary</b> Period (2.6million {{years ago}} up to today), {{deposits}} of windblown sand and alluvium covered {{much of the}} Chinle and Bidahochi. Older dunes {{range in age from}} 500,000years at higher elevations {{in the northern part of}} the park to about 10,000years in sandy drainage areas such as Lithodendron Wash. Stabilized by grasses and other vegetation, young dunes of about 1,000years old are found throughout the park.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the <b>Quaternary</b> period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain Range, was volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Jack Souther {{produced}} {{a synthesis of}} volcanism in the Canadian Cordillera and delineated several Neogene to <b>Quaternary</b> volcanic belts throughout British Columbia. One of these was the linear Anahim Volcanic Belt, which included the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field at its eastern end. However, its origin {{had not yet been}} understood. In 1979, two volcano tectonic models had been proposed by Jack Souther, Mary Bevier and Richard Armstrong. This included a hotspot and a propagating crack controlled by stress fields related to large-scale plate tectonics of western North America.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1881 and the fall of 1882, {{geologist}} Israel Russell studied the area as a side-trip during his field research of Lake Lahontan, a now dry lake that covered much of nearby Nevada during the last glacial period. His <b>Quaternary</b> History of the Mono Valley (1889), which included a topographic survey by Willard D. Johnson, was the first thorough scientific description of Mono Lake and its volcanic features.|$|E
5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, {{which extends}} through the {{countries}} of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina and includes six or more <b>Quaternary</b> caldera or ignimbrite systems, about 44 stratovolcanoes, and over 18 smaller centres. One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest volcano. This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost volcano of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such volcano to the south is Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° southern latitude.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock geology of {{the parish}} {{comprises}} rocks formed in the Santonian and Campanian ages of the Cretaceous period and the Eocene age of the Palaeogene period. In places these are overlain by younger <b>Quaternary</b> drift material: river terrace and head deposits, clay-with-flints, and alluvium—the last found only in the valley floors of the larger watercourses. On Puddletown Heath (now mostly covered by Puddletown Forest) are more than 370 solution hollows or sinkholes; these constitute the largest concentration of hollows on the heathlands in the area.|$|E
5|$|The geology of {{the town}} {{comprises}} bedrock formed in the Coniacian, Santonian and Campanian ages of the Late Cretaceous epoch, overlain in places by more recent <b>Quaternary</b> drift deposits. The bedrock is chalk of various formations. The drift deposits comprise a cap of clay-with-flints on the western edge {{of the town}} around Poundbury, alluvium in the river's floodplain, and several narrow ribbons of poorly stratified head deposits, found particularly around the town's northeastern and southwestern boundaries but also elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the <b>Quaternary</b> Period, approximately 15,000 years ago. These wild horses probably moved to the mountains to escape global warming that accompanied {{the end of the last}} glacial period.|$|E
5|$|The ichthyofauna of {{the park}} is among the richest in Europe with 41 {{freshwater}} and brackish water species of fish, as well as 70 marine fish species. There are nine Ponto-Caspian and five boreal relict species. The Ponto-Caspian dates from the ancient Sarmatian Sea. The boreal dates from the epoch of <b>Quaternary</b> cooling. There are several species restricted to the Black Sea basin (vyrezub, mushroom goby, bighead goby, toad goby, tubenose goby, western tubenose goby and racer goby). The round goby and estuarine perch {{are found in the}} Caspian and Black Sea basins.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{section of}} Darby Creek {{is within the}} Piedmont Uplands physiographic province, while the southern section {{is part of the}} Atlantic Coastal Plain province. The Piedmont Uplands section has generally old, hard upland rocks that eroded from the Appalachian Mountains. The rocks from the northern portion of the watershed date to the Precambrian Era and Lower Paleozoic Era. The rocks from the southern portion of the watershed are newer, dating from the Tertiary and <b>Quaternary</b> Periods. Atlantic Coastal Plain rock is generally softer than Piedmont Uplands rock and was deposited in the area about 1.6 million years ago through glacial erosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{underlying}} geology of the North Norfolk {{coast is}} Cretaceous chalk, exposed at Hunstanton cliffs {{just to the}} west of the SSSI, but buried by soft <b>Quaternary</b> glacial debris for the entire length of the SSSI coast. Unlike the soft, rapidly eroding cliffs further east, the coast of the SSSI has shown a less consistent pattern, with a net accretion of beach material between 1880 and 1950. However, this coastline is threatened by climate change, with sea level rising an estimated 1–2mm per year for the last 100 years, increasing the risk of flooding and coastal erosion.|$|E
5|$|The valley {{includes}} several Sites of Special Scientific Interest including Westhay Moor, Shapwick Heath and Shapwick Moor. Much {{of the area}} {{has been at the}} centre of peat extraction on the Somerset Levels. Large areas of peat were laid down on the Somerset Levels, particularly in the River Brue Valley, during the <b>Quaternary</b> period after the ice sheets melted. The extraction of peat from the Moors is known to have taken place during Roman times, and has been carried out since the Levels were first drained. Peat extraction on the Somerset Moors continues today, although much reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} of Strandzha evolved {{before the}} formation of the Bosphorus Strait when the whole southern Black Sea coast was linked and represents the westernmost extension of the Euxine-Colchic ecoregion. Because of the proximity of three seas, the Black Sea, the Marmara Sea and the Aegean Sea, Strandzha remained unaffected by the <b>Quaternary</b> glaciation and retained its mild and relatively humid climate. Under those conditions the region has preserved relict species from the Neogene.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{appears to}} be part of a north-south {{trending}} group of rhyolitic, silicic <b>Quaternary</b> volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, Laguna del Maule, and Volcán Domuyo) that veers off the north-northeast direction of the rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold-and-thrust movement of the nearby Malargüe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate.|$|E
