However, what ought to be concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions wrong, is the interpretation of the concepts wrong, is there a big difference between the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and how we could know that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E

2500|$|Lavoisier's {{chemical}} research between 1772 and 1778 {{was largely}} concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he {{read to the}} academy his famous paper entitled Réflexions sur le phlogistique (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current phlogiston theory of combustion. That year Lavoisier also {{began a series of}} experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendish's inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed hydrogen (Greek for [...] "water-former"), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways {{within the framework of the}} phlogiston theory. In cooperation with mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The <b>quantitative</b> <b>results</b> were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).|$|E

40|$|Background and aim: Quantification of {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) DNAemia {{is essential}} in clinical management of post-transplant infection. We evaluated the performances of two quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Materials and Methods : 114 serial whole blood samples collected from 14 actively infected transplant recipients were processed by Abbott RealTime CMV PCR kit (Abbott Molecular) and CMV ELITe MGB™ kit (ELITech Group). The Quality Control for Molecular Diagnostics human CMV panels was also tested. Results : Sixteen (14 %) samples resulted negative and 59 (51. 7 %) positive with a <b>quantitative</b> <b>result</b> for both assays. In the 59 samples, the coefficient of correlation was 0. 856. Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of < 0. 11 log 10 copies/mL (standard deviation= 0. 38 log 10 copies/mL). The assays gave CMV-DNA loads differing by 1 log 10 DNA copies/mL in 57 samples (96. 6 %) and by < 0. 5 log 10 DNA copies/mL in 48 samples (81. 3 %). Eleven (9. 6 %) samples were positive with a <b>quantitative</b> <b>result</b> with Abbott and negative with ELITech. Sixteen (14 %) positive samples with a <b>quantitative</b> <b>result</b> for Abbott resulted positive but below the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) for ELITech. Twelve (10. 5 %) samples resulted negative with ELITech and positive but below the LLQ with Abbott. No samples were positive with ELITech and negative with Abbott. Conclusions : The assays showed a good correlation between CMVDNA levels detected and variation in CMV-DNA < 0. 5 log 10 was observed {{in the majority of}} the samples. The viral load kinetic profiles of the assays were overlapping in all patients, but Abbott showed higher sensitivity in samples containing lower amount of DNA.
