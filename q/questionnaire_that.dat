5|$|Péron did {{not report}} seeing any emus on the island himself, which might explain why he {{described}} them as being the size of mainland birds. Instead, most {{of what is known}} about the King Island emu today stems from a 33-point <b>questionnaire</b> <b>that</b> he used to interview a local English sealer, Daniel Cooper, about the bird. In accordance with a request by the authorities for the expedition to bring back useful plants and animals, Péron asked if the emus could be bred and fattened in captivity, and received a variety of cooking recipes. Péron's questionnaire remained unpublished until 1899, and very little was therefore known about the bird in life until then.|$|E

25|$|The {{method used}} in Hereditary Genius has been {{described}} as the first example of historiometry. To bolster these results, and to attempt to make a distinction between 'nature' and 'nurture' (he was the first to apply this phrase to the topic), he devised a <b>questionnaire</b> <b>that</b> he sent out to 190 Fellows of the Royal Society. He tabulated characteristics of their families, such as birth order and the occupation and race of their parents. He attempted to discover whether their interest in science was 'innate' or due to the encouragements of others. The studies were published as a book, English men of science: their nature and nurture, in 1874. In the end, it promoted the nature versus nurture question, though it did not settle it, and provided some fascinating data on the sociology of scientists of the time.|$|E

25|$|Livesley et al. concluded, in {{agreement}} with other studies, that narcissism as measured by a standardized test was a common inherited trait. Additionally, in similar agreement with those other studies, {{it was found that}} there exists a continuum between normal and disordered personality. The study subjects were 175 volunteer twin pairs (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a <b>questionnaire</b> <b>that</b> assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the heritability of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of genetic and environmental causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the concordance of this trait in the identical twins was significantly influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have heritability coefficients of greater than 0.5: callousness, identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.|$|E

People disappeared without a trace with none told of their whereabouts or fate. For each prisoner, the SD had to fill in a <b>questionnaire</b> <b>that</b> listed personal information, country of origin, and {{the details of their}} crimes against the Reich.

2500|$|The Epworth Sleepiness Scale {{is a brief}} <b>questionnaire</b> <b>that</b> is {{administered}} to determine {{the likelihood of the}} presence of a sleep disorder, including narcolepsy.

The following day the patient will have multiple tests where they will be told to nap after a full nights sleep (usually eight hours). Observations are made of the time taken to reach various stages of sleep (sleep onset latency). This test measures the degree of daytime sleepiness and also detects how soon REM sleep begins. Again, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly and enter REM sleep early. Occasionally, a multiple sleep latency test can result in a false-negative for a narcoleptic.|$|E

2500|$|Two {{studies have}} tested the {{possibility}} that cisgender women can also experience autogynephilia. Veale and colleagues (2008) found that an online sample of cisgender women commonly endorsed items on adapted versions of Blanchard's autogynephilia scales.

A <b>questionnaire</b> <b>that</b> included the ASW was distributed {{to a sample of}} 51 professional women employed at an urban hospital; 29 completed questionnaires were returned for analysis. By the common definition of ever having erotic arousal to the thought or image of oneself as a woman, 93% of the respondents would be classified as autogynephilic. Using a more rigorous definition of [...] "frequent" [...] arousal to multiple items, 28% would be classified as autogynephilic.
