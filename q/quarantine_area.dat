During his time as Director the enclosures in the zoo had been advanced and basic hospital facilities, a <b>quarantine</b> <b>area,</b> better equipment, and service areas had been created.

He supplied scholarships to orphans born in that city, built part {{of the road to}} Calafat and sponsored the adjoining railway line; he also erected Jitianu memorial bridge, was ktitor of Holy Trinity Orthodox Church, and donated the plot on which Carol I National College was built. On his Oltenian estates, at Pătulele, Știrbei employed horticulturist Friedrich Grunow, who reforested the area with black locust, which reputedly stopped desertification. From 1888, Știrbei also sought appointment as curator of Așezămintele Brâncovenești, a charity set up by his aunt, Zoe Brâncoveanu, having donated his estate in Cervenia for its use. He shared this position with his cousin Georges. Together, the cousins also managed Brâncovenesc Hospital, setting up a <b>quarantine</b> <b>area</b> for the cholera outbreak of 1893.|$|E

When they experience strong negative emotions, they cry blood and become violent. As a result, Dana and Ramin investigate several murders in the weeks following [...] "Revival Day". Meanwhile, some people outside the <b>quarantine</b> <b>area</b> believe the government is covering up a religious miracle. Others believe they can absorb the revivers' immortality by ingesting their flesh, leading to an active smuggling business that moves body parts of revivers and other recently dead individuals.|$|E

EastonWith {{the present}} threat of bioterrorist attacks and new natural disease strains developing, {{efficient}} and effective countermeasures must be in place {{in case of an}} epidemic outbreak. The best strategy is to stop the attack or natural phenomenon before it happens, but governments and individual citizens must have measures in place to limit the spread of a biological threat or infectious disease if it is ever introduced into society. The objective of this research is to know, before an outbreak, the best <b>quarantine</b> <b>areas.</b> <b>Quarantines</b> force similar individuals together and can be mathematically modeled as clustering people into distinct groups. In order to effectively determine the clustering solution to use as a quarantine plan, this research developed a simulation core that is highly adaptable to different disease types and different contact networks. The input needed for the simulation core is the characteristics of the disease as well as the contact network of the area to be modeled. Clustering is a mathematical problem that groups entities based on their similarities while keeping dissimilar entities in separate groups. Clustering has been widely used by civilian and military researchers to provide quality solutions to numerous problems. This research builds a mathematical model to find clusters from a community’s contact network. These clusters are then the preplanned <b>quarantine</b> <b>areas.</b> To find quality clusters a Clustering Heuristic using Integer Programming (CHIP) is developed. CHIP is a large neighborhood, hill-climbing heuristic and some computational results verify that it quickly generates good clustering solutions. CHIP is an effective heuristic to group people into clusters to be used as <b>quarantine</b> <b>areas</b> prior {{to the development of a}} disease or biological attack. Through a small computational study, CHIP is shown to produce clustering solutions that are about 25 % better than the commonly used K-means clustering heuristic. CHIP provides an effective tool to combat the spread of an infectious disease or a biological terroristic attack and serves as a potential deterrent to possible terrorist attacks due to the fact that it would limit their destructive power. CHIP leads to the next level of preparation that could save countless lives in the event of an epidemic...|$|R

Quarantine refers to separating those who may have been exposed to a disease until they either show signs of the disease or are no longer at risk.
