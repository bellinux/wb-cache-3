25|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. <b>Quingestrone</b> (progesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether) is among the only examples that {{do not belong to}} any of these groups. Another major group of progestins, the 19-nortestosterone derivatives, exemplified by norethisterone (norethindrone) and levonorgestrel, are not derived from progesterone but rather from testosterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quingestrone,</b> {{also known}} as {{progesterone}} 3-cyclopentyl enol ether (PCPE) or as 3-cyclopentyloxypregna-3,5-dien-20-one, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone. It is specifically the C3 cyclopentyl enol ether of progesterone. <b>Quingestrone</b> {{is closely related to}} pentagestrone acetate (17α-acetoxyprogesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether).|$|E
50|$|<b>Quingestrone</b> was {{introduced}} in Italy in 1962.|$|E
50|$|Relative to progesterone, <b>quingestrone</b> shows {{improved}} pharmacokinetics, including higher potency, oral activity, and {{a longer}} terminal half-life and hence duration of action. This {{is considered to}} be due to its higher lipophilicity, being stored into and slowly released from fat. <b>Quingestrone</b> also shows slower metabolism and more stable blood levels, with a longer time to peak concentrations and a less intense peak compared to progesterone. The bioavailability of <b>quingestrone</b> is highest when it is given as a sesame seed oil solution (compared to an oil suspension (~2-fold less) or micronization (~7-fold less)).|$|E

5000|$|Along {{with the}} retroprogesterone {{derivative}} dydrogesterone, <b>quingestrone</b> {{is described as}} a [...] "true" [...] progesterone derivative or progestogen due to its close similarity to natural progesterone. Similarly to progesterone, dydrogesterone, and hydroxyprogesterone caproate, <b>quingestrone</b> is a pure progestogen and lacks any androgenic effects. As such, it poses no risk of androgenic side effects or virilizing teratogenic effects on female fetuses. Accordingly, the drug was studied in the clinical prevention of miscarriage during pregnancy; however, insufficient efficacy was observed at the dosage assessed (100 mg/day orally). <b>Quingestrone</b> is said to influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis similarly to progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate, producing adrenal suppression at sufficiently high doses, and this suggests that it possesses weak glucocorticoid activity similarly to progesterone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quingestrone</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to act as a}} prodrug of progesterone via slow hydrolysis in the body. Indeed, it produces similar metabolites (e.g., pregnanediols and allopregnanediols) as progesterone, although with differing ratios, and notably is the only progestin that is known to produce pregnanediol as a metabolite. Subsequent research has cast doubt on the notion that <b>quingestrone</b> is a prodrug of progesterone however, and indicates that it instead is directly metabolized into pregnanediols without intermediate conversion into progesterone.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{cannot be}} esterified, {{progesterone}} possesses a ketone {{group at the}} C3 position, and for this reason, {{it is possible to}} etherify it; that is, progesterone ethers are chemically possible. <b>Quingestrone</b> (Enol-Luteovis) is a progesterone ether (specifically, the 3-cyclopentyl ether of progesterone) that has been marketed in Italy as an oral contraceptive. <b>Quingestrone</b> is a variant of progesterone with improved pharmacokinetics, including higher potency, oral activity, greater lipophilicity, and a longer half-life. Two other progestogens, pentagestrone (never marketed) and pentagestrone acetate (Gestovis, Gestovister), are the 3-cyclopentyl enol ethers of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Quingestrone</b> (brand name Enol-Luteovis; former {{developmental}} {{code name}} W-3399), {{is a pure}} progestogen closely related to progesterone which was developed by Vister and marketed in Italy as an oral contraceptive (in combination with ethinylestradiol or mestranol).|$|E
50|$|A {{large number}} of progestins (synthetic progestogens) have been derived from progesterone. They can be {{categorized}} into several structural groups, including derivatives of retroprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-methylprogesterone, and 19-norprogesterone, with a respective example from each group including dydrogesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, medrogestone, and promegestone. <b>Quingestrone</b> is a rare example that {{does not belong to}} any of these groups.|$|E
50|$|Pentagestrone acetate (brand names Gestovis, Gestovister), {{also known}} as 17α-acetoxyprogesterone 3-cyclopentyl enol ether, is a steroidal {{progestin}} of the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone group that was described in the literature in 1960 and introduced by Vister in Italy in 1961. It is the 3-cyclopentyl enol ether of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone acetate. Pentagestrone acetate, along with <b>quingestrone</b> (the 3-cyclopentyl enol ether of progesterone), {{is said to have}} very similar properties to those of dydrogesterone, a pure progestogen and close analogue of progesterone.|$|E
