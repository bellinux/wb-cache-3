5|$|Although {{the royal}} forest of Selwood no longer exists, the nearby {{countryside}} is still richly wooded, for example on the Longleat, Maiden Bradley and Stourhead estates. To {{the west of}} the town, {{on the edge of the}} Mendip Hills, there are large active limestone <b>quarries,</b> such as Whatley Quarry and Merehead Quarry, along with disused <b>quarries.</b> The working <b>quarries</b> are served by a dedicated railway line which branches off the main line at Frome, passes through the town centre and out through the Welshmill and Spring Gardens areas in the north-west quadrant of the town.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of Egypt, in Lower Nubia, Nyuserre {{exploited}} the gneiss <b>quarries</b> of Gebel el-Asr near Aswan, which provided material for buildings and statues, as shown by a fragmentary stone stela inscribed with Nyuserre's Horus name that was discovered in a settlement adjacent to the <b>quarries.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent <b>quarries</b> to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the <b>quarries</b> until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the <b>quarries</b> for other purposes, including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock <b>quarries.</b> The slag tipping {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E

5|$|There are {{two main}} rock types on the Mendips: the Devonian {{sandstones}} visible around Blackdown and Downhead and the Carboniferous Limestones, which dominate the hills and surround the older rock formations. There are nine active <b>quarries</b> {{and a host of}} disused sites, several of which have been designated as geological Sites of Special Scientific Interest by English Nature. Because of the effect quarrying has on the environment and local communities, a campaign has been started to halt the creation of any new <b>quarries</b> and to restrict the activities and expansion of the existing ones.|$|E
5|$|A {{small amount}} of {{quarrying}} activity {{takes place in the}} city, with 46 active mines and <b>quarries</b> in Gyeongju. Most are engaged in the extraction of kaolin, fluorspar and Agalmatolite and Kaolin is exported.|$|E

50|$|Coombefield <b>Quarry</b> is {{an active}} stone <b>quarry</b> located on the Isle of Portland, Dorset, England. It is {{situated}} near the island's southernmost village Southwell. The large <b>quarry</b> has been worked over many years, and has two voids known as Coombefield North and Coombefield South. The <b>quarry</b> today incorporates the former Suckthumb <b>Quarry,</b> which is situated at the northwest part of the <b>quarry,</b> and is now filled in. The <b>quarry</b> is owned by Portland Stone Firms Ltd, along with Broadcroft and Perryfield <b>Quarry.</b> The firm is the largest landholder on the island.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{sand and}} ragstone were {{extracted}} from this <b>quarry,</b> with some material {{being used to}} build Aylesford station in 1856. The railway ran to the <b>quarry</b> where horse-drawn carts delivered rocks to wagons. <b>Quarrying</b> began at Basted <b>Quarry,</b> moved north through Isles <b>Quarry</b> East, crossed Thong Lan and travelled south as Isles <b>Quarry</b> West, landfilled in the 50s with mixed waste. <b>Quarrying</b> continued south across Mill Lane to become Stangate <b>Quarry.</b> Once the ragstone had been exhausted, the quarry—then known as the ARC (Amalgamated Roadstone Corporation) Stangate Landfill Site—became a landfill site for London waste.|$|R
5|$|As part {{of their}} , the Germans began {{repatriating}} Flemish prisoners of war in August 1940. By February 1941, 105,833 Flemish soldiers had been repatriated. Gradually, more prisoners were released, but 67,000 Belgian soldiers were still in captivity by 1945. Many prisoners of war were forced to work in <b>quarries</b> or in agriculture and around 2,000 died in captivity.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the highest bidder. Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como <b>quarries</b> yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational <b>quarries</b> than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Cope and Marsh {{used their}} {{personal}} wealth to fund expeditions each summer, then spent the winter publishing their discoveries. Small armies of fossil hunters in mule-drawn wagons or on trains were soon sending literally tons of fossils back east. The paleontological digs lasted fifteen years, from 1877 to 1892. The workers for both Cope and Marsh suffered hardships {{related to the}} weather, as well as sabotage and obstruction by the other scientist's workers. Reed was locked out of the Como train station by Carlin, {{and was forced to}} haul the bones down the bluff and crate the specimens on the train platform in the bitter cold. Cope directed Carlin to set up his own quarry in Como Bluff, while Marsh sent Reed to spy on his former friend. As Reed's Quarry #4 dried up, Marsh ordered Reed to clear out the bone fragments from the other <b>quarries.</b> Reed reported he had destroyed all the remaining bones to keep them away from Cope. Concerned that strangers were encroaching on Reed's <b>quarries,</b> Marsh sent Lakes to Como to assist in excavations, and in June 1879 visited Como himself. Cope likewise toured his own <b>quarries</b> in August. Although Marsh's men continued to open new <b>quarries</b> and discover more fossils, relations between Lakes and Reed soured, with each offering his resignation in August. Marsh attempted to placate the two by sending each to opposite ends of the <b>quarries,</b> but after being forced to abandon one bone quarry in a freezing blizzard, Lakes submitted his resignation and returned to teaching in 1880. The departure of Lakes did not ease tensions among Marsh's men; Lake's replacement, a railroad man named Kennedy, felt {{he did not have to}} report to Reed, and the fighting between the two caused Marsh's other workers to quit. Marsh tried separating Kennedy and Reed, and sent Williston's brother Frank to Como in an effort to keep the peace. Frank Williston ended up leaving Marsh's employ and taking up residence with Carlin. Cope's own digging in Como began faltering, and Carlin's replacements soon quit work altogether.|$|E
5|$|Dolomite, {{sandstone}} and quartzite rock {{have been}} extensively mined in the park. Though traces of silver, copper and gold are present, {{there have been}} no economic finds. The park is scattered with many quarries; the largest within the park is an open-cut in the northwest corner. It was in operation until 1982 supplying stone for buildings, including Adelaide's war memorial and St Peter's Cathedral. Tea Tree Gully Freestone from some <b>quarries</b> has been used for the facades and ornamental dressing of many of Adelaide’s Victorian public buildings. Adelaide Town Hall, the General Post Office and Supreme Court Buildings in Adelaide were all built entirely of this stone. The <b>quarries</b> supplied dressing stock for ornamentation on buildings, including St Peter's Cathedral, St Francis Xavier's Cathedral, Flinders Street Baptist Church and the University of Adelaide's Mitchell Building.|$|E
