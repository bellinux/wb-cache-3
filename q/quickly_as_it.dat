5|$|Further west, Typhoon Sudal {{intensified}} <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{moved through}} the Caroline Islands and later Yap state. On Ulithi, a wind gust of 132km/h (82mph) was reported, and 6.34inches of rainfall occurred in a 24‑hour period. High waves of over 5m (18ft) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built homes. On nearby Faraulep and Fais islands, similar meteorological conditions and damages were reported. The small Ngulu Atoll received gale force winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's water storage tanks. Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind gusts of 141km/h (87mph).|$|E
5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived nuclide, polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Ivy (Fiji Meteorological Service designation: 05F, Joint Typhoon Warning Center designation: 13P) was a {{tropical}} cyclone that affected about 25% {{of the population}} of Vanuatu in February 2004. It was first classified as {{a tropical}} disturbance on February21 between Vanuatu and Fiji. The system tracked northwestward, gradually organizing and intensifying. After attaining tropical storm status on February23, Ivy strengthened more <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> turned southwestward toward Vanuatu. It attained peak winds of 165km/h (105mph) while moving over Vanuatu, making it an intense Category4 cyclone on the Australian Region Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. By the time it passed through Vanuatu, Ivy had turned southeastward, and it gradually weakened while accelerating. After becoming extratropical on February28, it passed just east of New Zealand and eventually dissipated on March2.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression was forecast to strengthen slowly to reach peak winds of 45mph (75km/h). Within {{three hours of}} forming, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto. A small cyclone, the storm continued to organize <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> turned north-northeastward, while radar imagery suggested {{the formation of an}} eye by early on September 13. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, Humberto was upgraded to a hurricane at 0515UTC on September 13, while located about 15miles (20km) off the coast of Texas. The hurricane made landfall a few miles to the east of High Island at around 0700UTC. A well-defined eye was maintained with strong convection around it, and Hurricane Hunters reported sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) about two hours after landfall. However, post-storm analysis later determined that the winds were a bit stronger—about 90mph (150km/h).|$|E
5|$|Black {{believes}} Prine is not {{driven by}} malice; he and Watts use {{the resources of}} the Millennium Group to find his home, discovering the dense writings across his floors. They learn that Prine believes a third world war is imminent, and took the children as he believes one of them is destined to bring peace during this time, wishing to protect this child when he learns which one it is destined to be. Black seeks aid from another Group member, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke), who is able to observe Prine's behavioural tells for clues when interviewing him. This, coupled with analysis of soil from his clothing, points to the children being held in an aluminium quarry. The investigators rush to the quarry, where Prine's accomplice engages them in a firefight. However, the advancing tornado forces them to take cover; it kills Prine and lifts the roof from the entombing bunker. It subsides as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> arrived, and the children emerge safely from the wreckage; Black senses that Cayce's daughter may be the prophesied peacemaker. It turns out that the tornado destroyed the school where the children would have been if they weren't abducted, and that Prine had saved their lives.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Giri was {{classified}} a very severe cyclonic storm, warnings were issued for the coastline of Myanmar. Relative to the storm's intensity, preparations were minimal; however, {{this was because}} forecasters did not anticipate Giri to strengthen as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> did. The greatest fear of the residents was {{the aftermath of the}} storm. There were concerns that the cyclone could cause devastation similar to that of Cyclone Nargis in May 2008 which killed an estimated 140,000 people in the Irrawaddy Delta. The chief of the Myanmar Climate Change Watch, a branch within the Myanmar Meteorology and Hydrology Department, urged people to move to higher grounds and into sturdy buildings as a storm surge up to 3.6m (12ft) was anticipated. Warnings of the storm were constantly broadcast through television, radio and newspapers. In Sittwe, the capital of Rakhine State, authorities used loudspeakers to warn residents about Cyclone Giri. According to the military junta, an estimated 53,000 are believed to have evacuated Kyaukphyu before the arrival of the storm.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Vamei {{weakened}} <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> {{crossed the}} extreme southern {{portion of the}} Malay Peninsula, and late on December 27 the JMA downgraded it to tropical depression status before the cyclone emerged into the Straits of Malacca. The JTWC initially maintained it as a minimal tropical storm, though the agency downgraded the storm to depression status as the center again approached land. Early on December 28, Vamei moved ashore along northeastern Sumatra, and at 0600UTC the JMA classified the storm as dissipated. However, convection persisted near the circulation over land, {{believed to have been}} caused by the process known as upper-level diffluence. On December 29, what was originally believed to be a separate system reached the southeastern Bay of Bengal. In a post-season re-evaluation, the JTWC classified the system as a continuation of Vamei, based on analysis of satellite imagery that indicated the circulation of Vamei crossed Sumatra without dissipating. Convection re-developed, and late on December 30 the JTWC classified the cyclone as a tropical storm about 390km (245mi) west-southwest of the northwestern tip of Sumatra; initially, due to being treated as a separate system, it was classified as Tropical Cyclone05B. Vamei quickly developed good outflow and organization, though increased wind shear on December 31 rapidly weakened the storm; by late that day, the center was exposed from the deep convection, and Vamei quickly dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The next day, American forces {{advanced}} to Kirkuk during Operation Option North, hoping to control oil fields and military airfields {{in and around}} the city. Controlling the oil fields had been a specific operational goal of the Task Force because they were viewed as the most valuable strategic asset in northern Iraq. Between 30 March and 2 April, the 173d Airborne Brigade, along with the Special Forces detachment and the Kurdish forces, engaged and destroyed the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 38th Iraqi Infantry divisions as well as a force loyal to Ansar al-Islam. The brigade used field artillery assets, as well as coordinated airstrikes to attack Iraqi Republican Guard units defending the city. Within a week these units began to fall apart due to desertions. On 10 April the brigade was able to move into the city, securing it after a short urban battle. The entire battle for Kirkuk cost the brigade only nine casualties. During the operation, some of the troops discovered at least two caches of Iraqi gold, totaling more than 2,000 bars. The unit then took part in Operation Peninsula Strike, quelling Ba'ath party resistance and other insurgent groups. These operations, though successful, would have been more effective if the 4th Infantry Division's four heavy brigades were able to enter Iraq through Turkey as originally planned. 4th ID had to relocate their forces from Turkey to Kuwait and were subsequently slowed down in Baghdad. VCorps was not able to surround Baghdad as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>it</b> had hoped {{because of a lack of}} available forces in the north. The resulting wear and tear of 4th ID's M1 Abrams and M2 Bradleys made them an ineffective unit in tight urban areas such as Jar Salah. Because their heavily armored tanks required so much maintenance, the 173d incorporated much of 4th ID's area of operation into their own. The 173d secured these areas with company sized detachments, often patrolling the 4th ID's sectors with two unarmored M998 cargo Humvees at any given time.|$|E
