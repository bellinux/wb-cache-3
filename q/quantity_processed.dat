40|$|Farms {{that deliver}} {{production}} to processing, storage and marketing cooperatives are doubly {{exposed to the}} economic risk deriving from climatic and environmental adversities: besides the direct loss due to reduced output, with unfavourable climatic conditions they also suffer an indirect loss due to {{the effect on the}} price of the lower <b>quantity</b> <b>processed</b> by the cooperative. When farm production falls short of the processing capacity of the cooperative, in fact, there occurs an increase in the average fixed operating cost and, ceteris paribus, a reduction in the price paid to the members. However, cooperatives for the processing, storage and marketing of agricultural products may also perform an active role in mitigating the members’ production risk. By means of the area yield insurance contract, cooperatives are able to mitigate the systemic component of their members’ production risk, thereby increasing efficiency. The aim {{of this paper is to}} set out the model of the area yield insurance contract and to explain the possible contribution of the processing, storage and marketing cooperative to removing information asymmetry. Cooperatives usually comprise a great deal of information about the members’ production: quantities produced, crop areas and varieties cultivated, production quality, price levels. This valuable stock of information relative to the productions of the members over the years can be managed by the cooperative without significant transaction costs in order to remedy certain weaknesses in the area crop insurance contract. When processing, storage and marketing cooperatives form a territorial system, the area yield insurance contract can be enhanced with a two-stage specification so as to benefit from both the information possessed by the cooperatives and from the organizational role of the consortium...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to estimate the economic analysis of locust bean processing and marketing in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria. Primary data was used and purposive sampling technique was adopted to select the respondents used for the study. A total number of 60 respondents were interviewed. The data collected were analyzed using inferential statistical tool such as regression analysis. Budgetary analysis technique was also used to analyze the profitability of locust bean processing and marketing in the study area. Majority of the processors and marketers are making profits; 68. 3 % operate above breakeven point while 26. 7 % operate at breakeven point and the rest 5 % was below the breakeven point, this indicates that they neither profit nor lost. The regression analysis result shows that <b>quantity</b> <b>processed,</b> family size and years of experience in processing are significant at 1 %, 5 % and 10 % respectively while education level and stall rent is negative and significant at 1 % and 5 % respectively. F- Test also explained that independent variables are jointly significant at 1 % probability level with an adjusted R 2 of 78. 9 %. The overall rate of return on investment indicates that average rate of return is 0. 5 (50 %), which is positive. It is therefore concluded that profit made by the processors and marketers can be improved on by increasing the quantity of locust bean being processed through adoption of newly discovered method of processing and improved method of preservation, packaging and marketing of the product to international standard by reducing the odour of the product without the loss of essential nutrients and palability in order to generate foreign exchange.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{continuous}} time price and <b>quantity</b> adjustment <b>process</b> is considered for an economy facing price rigidities. In {{the short run}} prices {{are assumed to be}} completely fixed and the markets are cleared by quantity adjustments until a fixed price equilibrium is reached where every market is typically characterized by either supply rationing or demand rationing. Next prices are assumed to move upwards in case of demand rationing on a market and downwards when supply rationing occurs. Markets are kept in equilibrium by infinitesimal quantity adjustments such that at every moment in time a fixed price equilibrium results. Using only standard assumptions on the primitive concepts of the economy it is shown that the price and <b>quantity</b> adjustment <b>process</b> indeed converges to a fixed price equilibrium for the initially given prices. Moreover, in the long run, when prices are allowed to change, the process is shown to reach a Walrasian equilibrium. A simplicial algorithm is developed to approximate the price and <b>quantity</b> adjustment <b>process</b> arbitrarily close. It is shown that the path of price systems and rationing schemes generated by the algorithm converges to the path of the adjustment process.

Classical hydrology is a descriptive science with the water balance equation as almost the only means of quantifying computations. Hydrodynamics have now to some extent been introduced when water <b>quantity</b> <b>processes</b> are described. In the research on water quality, the water balance is accounted for but hydrodynamical and hydrochemical processes are not yet coupled. From the perspective of society there are three main hydrological problems - water quantity problems in semi-arid regions, environmental problems, especially acidification and dispersion of pesticides, and problems related to "nature energy". These problems should not in the first place be tackled by the use of new theories, but rather by synthesis and analysis of already existing data and theories, to enable formulation of quantifying descriptions of complex problems. “Complete abstract not presented...|$|R

(The present upper limit for the branching ratio for {mu} {r_arrow} e{gamma} is 4. 9 x 10 {sup {minus} 11 }.) The minimal standard model of electroweak interactions, which is enormously successful, builds in lepton number conservation. However, the decay {mu} {r_arrow} e{gamma} is expected in many extensions to the standard model, in particular in supersymmetry models. The experimental signature for {mu} {r_arrow} e{gamma} from decays at rest is the observation of a positron and photon, each of 52. 8 MeV, that are back-to-back, in time coincidence, and originate from a common spatial point. The MEGA detector consists of two spectrometers designed to measure the kinematic characteristics of positrons and photons to search for events with this signature. The primary difficulty in the analysis of these data has been the development of reconstruction algorithms that balance efficiency and resolution. Also, many calibrations and corrections are needed to get optimum resolutions. Most surviving candidate events are accidentals. Results of analysis are given...|$|R

Moreover, to assess age-related changes, two groups of children (5 - and 7 -year-olds) were compared. In a newly designed haptic task, children compared two arrays of dots by touching them simultaneously using both hands, without seeing them, and for limited duration to prevent counting. Using Panamath, a frequently used visual ANS task, we verified that our population exhibited the typical pattern of approximation with visual arrays: Older children outperformed younger children, and an increased ratio between the two quantities to be compared led to more accurate responses. Performance in the haptic task revealed that children, in both age-groups, were able to haptically compare two quantities above chance level, with improved performance in older compared with younger children. Moreover, our results revealed a ratio effect, a well-known signature of the ANS. These findings suggest that haptic numerical discrimination in children is dictated by the ANS, and that ANS acuity measured with a haptic task improves with age, as commonly observed with the visual task...|$|R
40|$|Using an {{interference}} paradigm, we show {{across three}} experiments that adults' order judgments of numbers, sizes, or combined area of dots in pairs of arrays occur spontaneously and automatically, but at different speeds {{and levels of}} accuracy. Experiment 1 used circles whose sizes varied between but not within arrays. Variation in circle size interfered with judgments of which array had more circles. Experiment 2 used displays in which circle size varied within and between arrays. Between-array differences {{in the amount of}} “circle stuff” (area occupied by circles) interfered with judgments of number. Experiment 3 examined whether variation in number also interferes with judgments of area. Interference between discrete and continuous stimulus dimensions occurred in both directions, although it was stronger from the continuous to the discrete than vice versa. These results bear on interpretations of studies with infants and preschoolers wherein subjects respond on the basis of continuous quantity rather than discrete quantity. In light of our results with adults, these findings do not license the conclusion that young children cannot represent discrete quantity. Absent data on attentional hierarchies and speed of processing, it is premature to conclude that infant and child <b>quantity</b> <b>processes</b> are fundamentally different from that of adults...|$|R
