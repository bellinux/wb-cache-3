25|$|A {{unique to}} Mexico was the vehicle called the VAM Lerma, {{which was based}} on the Concord's 4-door chassis with the Spirit's front and rear {{liftback}} body parts and unique rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also new was a variable-ratio power {{steering}} unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> on coupes and convertibles)for improved side impact protection {{as was the case}} with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 a {{production}} car was modified and dubbed the Gremlin XP prototype. It has a larger glass hatchback and additional side quarter windows. A pronounced crease started from the mid-body section and wraps {{over the roof}} while the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> feature bulges around the wheel well openings. The rear panel has a recessed and blacked out area with four lights. The design of the concept car improved visibility around the Gremlin's original wide C-pillar.|$|E

50|$|The Chrysler CL models {{featured}} new grilles, a new {{nose cone}} and new bonnet, and, (on sedans), new rear panels including boot lid, lower <b>panel</b> and <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> A panel van body style {{was added to}} the range in April 1977.|$|R
25|$|The XG was {{essentially}} an update of the XF. It gained the EB II's 4.0-l OHC inline six-cylinder engine, {{with either a}} five-speed manual or four-speed auto transmissions (floor or column shift), meaning Ford could retire the old engine and transmission options. It also gained interior updates from the EB including the instrument cluster, centre console (in two-seater models), steering wheel, and seats. Exterior changes were minimal, and included an EB-style grill, black window trims (as opposed to chrome on XF's) EB style door 'rubbing' strips, and indicator lights on the front <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Gallardo LP 560-4 Macau GP is {{a limited}} (3 units) version of the Gallardo LP 560-4 Coupé for the Taiwan market, commemorating Hanss Lin (#38) of the Taiwan-based Gama Racing Team taking 2nd place in the Macau race of the 2013 Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia series. Changes include Gallardo Super Trofeo parts (front/rear bumpers, {{adjustable}} tail wing and chassis diffuser, front skirt, detachable carbon fibre engine cover), orange body colour, hexagon '63' decal, red/white/green racing stripes running from the hood to roof, along rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels,</b> across the width of tail wing.|$|E
25|$|The body of each car {{is based}} on its {{corresponding}} production car. However, due to the regulations governing {{the dimensions of the}} cars to ensure parity, the race cars are lowered and shortened or lengthened to meet the regulations. As of 2017, only the Ford FG X Falcon, Holden VF Commodore, Mercedes-Benz E63 AMG W212, Nissan Altima L33 and Volvo S60 are eligible to compete. To save costs, the front guards, passenger-side front door, rear doors and rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> are made from composite materials. The tail lamps are carried over from the road car, while the windscreen is replaced by a polycarbonate unit.|$|E
50|$|The Carriage Roof option (still only {{available}} in white canvas-embossed vinyl; but now standard on Bill Blass Designer Series) received new interior rear <b>quarter</b> trim <b>panel</b> inserts (a blanked off, color-keyed padded vinyl insert filler panel covering {{the area where}} the deleted opera windows were - with round (non-switch-operated) reading/courtesy lights in the center of these panels on each side; thus effectively replacing 1978's rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> vanity mirrors). These new interior <b>quarter</b> trim <b>panel</b> inserts would also appear on the Collector's Series, (in color-keyed vinyl, or cloth - depending on the seat trim color) as the exterior landau roof design also eliminated the opera windows on this model. Here, though, the reading/courtesy lights in these <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> inserts had control switches above the rear seat quarter armrests, to allow them to operate as customary door-jamb activated interior courtesy lights, as well as rear seat passengers being able to switch them on and off independently as true reading lamps.|$|R
50|$|A four-speed manual {{remained}} standard equipment, with a three-speed {{automatic transmission}} optional.A 2+2 model {{built on a}} 11.9 in longer wheelbase was introduced, with larger opening <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> windows and a slightly notched roofline.|$|R
5000|$|The No. 1 Chip Ganassi Racing Chevrolet {{team was}} penalized for modifying the right rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> wheel opening after {{qualifying}} inspection. The penalty is a P2 penalty that violates {{the following sections}} of the 2015 NASCAR rules: ...|$|R
25|$|The Mk III was {{the first}} attempt to improve the basic Spitfire design and {{introduced}} several features which were used on later marks. Powered by a Rolls-Royce RM 2SM, later known as the Merlin XX, developing 1,390hp (1,036kW) due to its two-speed supercharger, the wingspan was reduced to 30ft 6 in (9.3 m) and the area reduced to 220 square feet (20.4 sq m) while the overall length was increased to 30ft 4 in (9.2 m). The strengthened main undercarriage was raked forward two inches, increasing ground stability and had flaps to fully enclose the wheels when retracted. The tailwheel was also made fully retractable. The windscreen was redesigned, with a built-in, internal laminated glass, bulletproof panel and optically flat, laminated glass <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} Imperial models in this generation. The C-14 was the {{standard}} eight and looked {{much like the}} Chrysler Royal C-18 with a longer hood and cowl. The C-15 was the Imperial Custom and the Town Sedan Limousine, with blind rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b> This model was available by special order. The third model, C-17, was the designation for the Airflow model. They had a concealed crank for raising the windshield and the hood was hinged at the cowl and opened from the front; side hood panels were released by catches on the inside. An Imperial Custom convertible sedan {{was used as an}} official car at the Indy 500. The car pictured is James G Martin's (retired airline mechanic) 1939 C-24 7 passenger limousine, believed by him and his son Tim to be the only 1939 production 7-passenger limo still on the road.|$|E
25|$|The truck did not {{run again}} until 2004 when the Morgan-Dollar team debuted a special program called the Chevrolet Silverado All-Stars program, which was a unique program {{showcasing}} popular music stars and Chevrolet's Nextel Cup drivers. Michael Waltrip was the debut driver for this special program and drove the No. 47 truck to a fifth-place finish at the Infineon 200 at Lowe's Motor Speedway. Waltrip's truck carried a paint scheme featuring Sheryl Crow. For {{the remainder of the}} 2004 season, a series of rotating drivers raced the truck, with Tony Stewart, Robby Gordon and Bobby Labonte posting top-five finishes in the truck. The truck featured Sara Evans (Stewart), George Thorogood (Robby Gordon), Big and Rich (Ron Hornaday), Josh Turner (Labonte), Joe Nichols (Jason Leffler), Acxiom (Kyle Busch and J. J. Yeley), and Chevrolet Silverado (Labonte) as sponsors on the truck {{for the remainder of the}} season. Acxiom and Chevrolet Silverado split primary sponsorship on all of the trucks, except at Michigan International Speedway and Indianapolis Raceway Park (where Acxiom was on both the hood and <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> with drivers Yeley and Busch, respectively).|$|E
50|$|The SV-1 had a rear {{fuel filler}} {{similar to the}} early coupes. Toyota changed all Celicas to side fuel fillers in mid 1972, so all {{production}} liftbacks had fuel fillers on the left rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> with a cover flap.|$|R
50|$|In 1991 {{the rear}} indicators, tail lights and brake lights were {{relocated}} to the bumper {{from the body}} to meet Australian Design Rules, however they stayed the same in European versions. In 1992 another set of indicators {{were placed on the}} front <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The No. 12 car {{is driven}} by Harrison Burton. The car is the same number that Burton drove for HScott Motorsports in 2016. For 2017, Burton uses an unorthodox paint scheme by placing the car number on the <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> {{rather than on the}} door.|$|R
2500|$|Chapron {{also created}} five {{convertibles}} (SM Mylord) and seven sedans (SM Opéra). Original copies of these rare models are very valuable - the last MyLord sale recorded was for €548,320 in February 2014. Some SM owners {{have made their}} own copies of the SM convertible in particular. [...] Unlike the DS, the factory never authorized a convertible model, as Citroën felt the roof was integral {{to the structure of}} the SM. On the SM, the roof and rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> were welded on.|$|E
2500|$|The {{separate}} high-beam headlamps in the grille {{added more}} character, while a thin, chrome front bumper sat below a mesh grille with the classic [...] "Shelby G.T.350" [...] logo in place (except {{for the very}} early cars). The small hood scoop was there to deliver fresh air to the engine. Shelby also included new, horizontal taillights (sourced from a '67 Cougar in 1967 and a '65 Thunderbird in 1968) and an integrated Kamm-type rear spoiler. Functional rear brake-cooling scoops adorned the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The first-generation Toronado lasted {{with the}} usual annual facelifts through 1970. Other than the brakes, the major changes were the {{replacement}} of the original [...] V8 with the new [...] in 1968 that was rated at [...] in standard form or [...] with the W-34 option, revised rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> (with small fins to disguise the slope of the rear body in side view) in 1969, and the disappearance of hidden headlights and the introduction of squared wheel arch bulges in 1970. An ignition lock became standard in 1969.|$|E
50|$|In 1992-1993 other color options {{included}} Summit White and Victory Red, {{with multiple}} interior colour options. The rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> and tailgate decals also changed in 1992 {{to a more}} 'stylized' 'SS' and the Chevrolet sticker on the tailgate became much smaller and located on the corner area.|$|R
5000|$|From 1976, {{anti-rust}} improvements included {{galvanized steel}} fenders and rocker panels; [...] "four layer" [...] fender protection with zinc coated and primed inner fenders; wheel-well protective mastic; zinc-rich pre-prime coating on inner doors; expandable sealer between rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> and wheel housing panel; and corrosion-resistant grill and headlamp housings.|$|R
5|$|The current {{color scheme}} was {{selected}} in 1974 by then athletic director and former head coach Bobby Dodd. The original Wreck decor featured a wooden GT shield {{on both the}} driver and passenger-side doors. This shield was removed during Dodd's revitalization of the old Model A. Dodd chose an old gold paint from a Lincoln car paint catalogue as the base for the new color scheme. He also placed a slightly stretched GT emblem on the door, a Tech helmet on the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel,</b> and a 1952 version of the Yellow Jacket on the front <b>quarter</b> <b>panel.</b> According to Tech lore, Bobby Dodd was so enamored with the Lincoln gold that he changed the football helmet and uniform color to match the new Ramblin' Wreck paint scheme.|$|R
2500|$|In 1957, the {{historic}} Hudson name came {{only in a}} Hornet version in [...] "Super" [...] and [...] "Custom" [...] series, and available as a four-door sedan or a two-door [...] "Hollywood" [...] hardtop. For the second year the V-Line styling featured an enormous egg-crate grille, creases and chrome strips on the sides, and five tri-tone schemes for the Custom models. There was more ornamentation to the cars, including fender [...] "finettes" [...] atop the rounded rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> for 1957, as well as very unusual twin-fin trim on top of both front fenders.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the entry}} into {{production}} of the [...] "unibody" [...] Citroën Traction Avant in 1934 using Budd technology, Budd worked in 1940 with Nash Motors on the development and production of North America's first mass-produced unibody passenger vehicle, the Nash 600. In the mid-1980s, Budd's Plastics Division introduced sheet moulding compound, a reinforced plastic in sheet form, suitable for stamping out body panels {{in much the same}} way, and as quickly, as sheet metal equivalents are made. Pontiac Fiero has some exterior SMC body parts manufactured by Budd Plastics - such as the <b>quarter</b> <b>panels,</b> roof skin, headlamp covers, and trunk decklid.|$|E
2500|$|The Valiant A-body {{platform}} utilized [...] "unit-body" [...] or [...] "unibody" [...] construction (not {{used by the}} Chrysler Corporation {{since the}} Airflow models of the 1930s) rather than [...] "body-on-frame" [...] construction. Instead of a bolted-in forestructure used in other unibody designs, the Valiant incorporated a welded-in front understructure and stressed front sheet metal. The fenders, <b>quarter</b> <b>panels,</b> floor and roof contributed to the stiffness of the body shell. A unit wheelbase comparison showed the Valiant to be 95% stiffer in torsion and 50% stiffer in beam than a 1959 Plymouth with separate body-on-frame construction. Dynamic testing showed that high structural resonant frequencies were attained, indicating greater damping and reduced body shake.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} mould design method mainly {{relies on}} the experience, it needs repeated debugging and processing which prolongs the mould development time and increases the mould manufacturing cost. The modern advanced mold design uses the finite element analysis software to do numerical simulation on the forming process of the die and optimizes {{the parameters of the}} mould which is very helpful for improving the precision of mould design. Take the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> of car as an example, using the DYNAFORM finite element software to do simulation on blank forming process to control the springback after unloading on the shallow and deep parts and design the mould of rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> based on optimization results, so as to improve the accuracy of the mold and reduce the mold development time and the mould cost.  </p...|$|R

5000|$|The No. 2 {{team was}} penalized for a rules infraction {{committed}} {{when it was}} discovered that the right and left rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> wheel openings were modified after qualifying inspection on March 6. This infraction is a P2 level penalty and violates the following Sections in the 2015 NASCAR rule book: ...|$|R
2500|$|Automotive {{trends in}} the early middle 1960s had all the US {{automakers}} looking at making compact sporty cars. The Valiant was a natural choice of basis for Chrysler's efforts in this direction. Ford's Mustang gave this type of vehicle its common [...] "pony car" [...] moniker, but in fact Chrysler beat Ford to market by two weeks with the April 1, 1964 release of the Barracuda fastback. The Barracuda used the Valiant's [...] wheelbase and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and bumpers; all other sheet metal and glass was new. This hybrid design approach significantly reduced the development and tooling cost and time for the new model. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was as similar to the Valiant as the Mustang {{was different from the}} Falcon, and its introduction was, at first, barely noticed by most buyers.|$|E
2500|$|The entire B-body lineup for the 1968 {{model year}} was {{redesigned}} and the Charger was further differentiated from the Dodge Coronet models. The first generation's efforts to look somewhat posh were abandoned {{in favor of}} designer Richard Sias' double-diamond coke bottle profile, with curves around the front fenders and rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels.</b> Front and rear end sheet metal was designed by Harvey J. Winn. The rear end featured a [...] "kick up" [...] spoiler appearance, inspired by Group 7 racing vehicles. The fastback roof was gone, in favor of [...] a [...] "flying buttress" [...] {{similar to that of}} the 1966-67 Pontiac GTO. The Charger retained its full-width hidden headlight grille, but a vacuum operated cover replaced the electric motor rotating headlights. The previous full-width taillights were replaced with dual circular units at the direction of Styling Vice President, Elwood P. Engel. Dual scallops were added to the doors and hood.|$|E
2500|$|Chrysler {{made many}} {{attempts}} at improving the aerodynamics of the 500 by adding noses {{rumored to be}} up to [...] long. The Charger Daytona finally received an [...] nose. The full size Charger Daytona was tested with an [...] nose at the Lockheed-Martin Georgia facility. The test was a success and the project was greenlighted. The nose piece was only part of the innovation. The Charger Daytona also received a [...] tall wing in rear. This wing was bolted through the rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panels</b> and into the rear subframe. Although proven to be less effective than shorter wing designs, the engineer responsible {{for the development of the}} wing, John Pointer, chose the tall design so the wing would be in [...] "clean air" [...] to help increase the car's overall speed. That the tall wing prevents interference with operation of the trunk lid can be considered a fortunate coincidence. The tall wing also helped out in another unintended way, by giving the car directional stability due to its deeply splinted sides.|$|E
5000|$|... 2005 Nextel Open- Brian Vickers {{employed}} a more frowned-upon {{version of the}} bump-and-run in 2005 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. While battling with Mike Bliss {{for the right to}} transfer in to the All-Star race, Vickers hooked the right rear <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> of Bliss' car, sending Bliss spinning and earning a spot in the All-Star race.|$|R

50|$|An {{after-market}} accessory on pick up {{trucks are}} fender flares, which blocks mud and stones and/or covers rust. They are sometimes used by manufacturers on models that have wider tires than basic models. Using this method, the manufacturer {{can provide the}} needed tire coverage without producing a different fender, bed side, or <b>quarter</b> <b>panel</b> for {{what may be a}} low-production model.|$|R
