Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem too loud. Complicating this is that many broadcasters use (<b>quasi-)peak</b> meters and peak-levelling. Unfortunately the peak level reading does not correlate well with the perceived loudness. It basically should only be used to prevent overmodulation.|$|E
25|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a <b>quasi-peak</b> detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Quasi-peak</b> {{detectors}} play {{an important}} role in electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing of electronic equipment, where allowed levels of electromagnetic interference (EMI), also called radio frequency interference (RFI), are given with reference to measurement by a specified <b>quasi-peak</b> detector. This was originally done because the <b>quasi-peak</b> detector was believed to better indicate the subjective annoyance level experienced by a listener hearing impulsive interference to an AM radio station. Over time standards incorporating <b>quasi-peak</b> detectors as the measurement device were extended to frequencies up to 1 GHz, although there may not be any justification beyond previous practice for using the <b>quasi-peak</b> detector to measure interference to signals other than AM radio. The <b>quasi-peak</b> detector parameters to be used for EMC testing vary with frequency [...] Both CISPR and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) limit EMI at frequencies above 1 GHz with reference to an average-power detector, rather than <b>quasi-peak</b> detector.|$|E
50|$|A <b>quasi-peak</b> {{detector}} {{is a type}} {{of electronic}} detector or rectifier. <b>Quasi-peak</b> detectors for specific purposes have usually been standardized with mathematically precisely defined dynamic characteristics of attack time, integration time, and decay time or fall-back time.|$|E
50|$|In {{audio quality}} measurement, <b>quasi-peak</b> {{rectifiers}} are specified in several standards. For example ITU-R 468 noise weighting uses a special rectifier incorporating two cascaded charging time constants. The PPM or peak programme meter {{used to measure}} programme levels is actually a <b>quasi-peak</b> reading meter, again with precisely defined dynamics. Flutter measurement also involves a standardised <b>quasi-peak</b> reading meter. In every case the dynamics are chosen to reflect the sensitivity of human hearing to brief sounds, ignoring those so brief {{that we do not}} perceive them, and weighting those of intermediate duration according to audibility.|$|E

50|$|The CISPR <b>quasi-peak</b> {{detector}} {{is used in}} EMC {{testing and}} is defined in Publication 16 of the International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The CISPR <b>quasi-peak</b> detector is a peak detector with an attack time of 1 ms, a decay time of 500 ms and an IF filter setting of 100 kHz.|$|E
50|$|Subjectively valid methods came to {{prominence}} in consumer audio in the UK and Europe in the 1970s, when {{the introduction of}} compact cassette tape, dbx and Dolby noise reduction techniques revealed the unsatisfactory nature of many basic engineering measurements. The specification of weighted CCIR-468 <b>quasi-peak</b> noise, and weighted <b>quasi-peak</b> wow and flutter became particularly widely used and {{attempts were made to}} find more valid methods for distortion measurement.|$|E
50|$|Experiments in the BBC led to BBC Research Department Report EL-17, The Assessment of Noise in Audio Frequency Circuits, {{in which}} {{experiments}} on numerous test subjects were reported, {{using a variety}} of noises ranging from clicks to tone-bursts to pink noise. Subjects were asked to compare these with a 1 kHz tone, and final scores were then compared with measured noise levels using various combinations of weighting filter and <b>quasi-peak</b> detector then in existence (such as those defined in a now discontinued German DIN standard). This led to the CCIR-468 standard which defined a new weighting curve and <b>quasi-peak</b> rectifier.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to realise that the 468 specification covers both weighted and 'unweighted' (using a 22 Hz to 22 kHz 18 dB/octave bandpass filter) measurement and that both use a very special <b>quasi-peak</b> rectifier with carefully devised dynamics (A-weighting uses RMS detection for no particular reason). Rather than having a simple 'integration time' this detector requires implementation with two cascaded 'peak followers' each with different attack time-constants carefully chosen to control the response to both single and repeating tone-bursts of various durations. This ensures that measurements on impulsive noise take proper account of our reduced hearing sensitivity to short bursts. This <b>quasi-peak</b> measurement is also called psophometric weighting.|$|E
50|$|Conceptually, a <b>quasi-peak</b> {{detector}} for EMC testing {{works like}} a peak detector followed by a lossy integrator.A voltage impulse entering a narrow-band receiver produces a short-duration burst oscillating at the receiver center frequency. The peak detector is a rectifier followed by a low-pass filter to extract a baseband signal consisting of the slowly (relative to the receiver center frequency) time-varying amplitude of the impulsive oscillation. The following lossy integrator has a rapid rise time and longer fall time, so the measured output for a sequence of impulses is higher when the pulse repetition rate is higher. The <b>quasi-peak</b> detector is calibrated to produce the same output level as a peak-power detector when the input is a continuous wave tone.|$|E
50|$|The PPM was {{originally}} developed, independently in both Germany and the United Kingdom, {{for use in}} AM radio broadcasting networks in the 1930s. These were <b>quasi-peak</b> meters with some features in common but otherwise substantially different. They are superior to earlier types of meter that were not good for monitoring peak audio levels.|$|E
5000|$|While not {{intended}} for this application, the 468 curve {{has also been}} used (offset to place the 0 dB point at 2 kHz rather than 1 kHz) as [...] "M weighting" [...] in standards such as ISO 21727 intended to gauge loudness or annoyance of cinema soundtracks. This application of the weighting curve {{does not include the}} <b>quasi-peak</b> detector specified in the ITU standard.|$|E

50|$|ITU-R 468 (originally {{defined in}} CCIR {{recommendation}} 468-4; {{sometimes referred to}} as CCIR-1k) is a standard relating to noise measurement, widely used when measuring noise in audio systems. The standard, now referred to as ITU-R BS.468-4, defines a weighting filter curve, together with a <b>quasi-peak</b> rectifier having special characteristics as defined by specified tone-burst tests. It is currently maintained by the International Telecommunications Union who took it over from the CCIR.|$|E
50|$|The ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} curve, originally proposed in CCIR recommendation 468, but later adopted by numerous standards bodies (IEC, BSI, JIS, ITU) {{was based on}} the research, and incorporates a special <b>Quasi-peak</b> detector to account for our reduced sensitivity to short bursts and clicks. It is widely used by Broadcasters and audio professionals when they measure noise on broadcast paths and audio equipment, so they can subjectively compare equipment types with different noise spectra and characteristics.|$|E
50|$|While most audio {{engineers}} {{are familiar with}} the A-weighting curve, which was based on the 40 phon equal-loudness contour derived initially by Fletcher and Munson (1933) the later CCIR-468 weighting curve, now supported as an ITU standard is less well known outside of the UK and Europe. Originally incorporated into an ANSI standard for sound level meters, A-weighting was intended for measurement of the audibility of sounds by themselves. It was never specifically intended for the measurement of the more random (near-white or pink) noise in electronic equipment, though has been used for this purpose by most microphone manufacturers since the 1970s. The human ear responds quite differently to clicks and bursts of random noise, and it is this difference that gave rise to the 468-weighting, which together with <b>quasi-peak</b> measurement (rather than the rms measurement used with A-weighting) became widely used by broadcasters throughout Britain, Europe, and former British Commonwealth countries, where engineers were heavily influenced by BBC test methods. Telephone companies worldwide have also used methods similar to 468 weighting with <b>quasi-peak</b> measurement to describe objectionable interference induced in one telephone circuit by switching transients in another.|$|E
5000|$|IEC 60268-18 is {{a partial}} {{standard}} for a PPM {{designed for use}} with digital audio in both professional and consumer use, using [...] "incremental dot or bar type displays or numerical displays". Such a display shows level relative to 0 dBFS. The integration time can have any value less than 5 ms − thus both true-peak and <b>quasi-peak</b> meters can comply, and different meters may indicate very different levels despite compliance with the standard. The return time has the same value as a Type I meter: 1.7±0.3 seconds for a 20 dB fall.|$|E
5000|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} with <b>quasi-peak</b> detection {{is widely used}} in Europe, especially in telecommunications, and in broadcasting particularly after it {{was adopted by the}} Dolby corporation who realised its superior validity for their purposes. Its advantages over A-weighting seem to be less well appreciated in the USA and in consumer electronics, where the use of A-weighting predominates—probably because A-weighting produces a 9 to 12 dB [...] "better" [...] specification, see specsmanship. It is commonly used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.|$|E
50|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a <b>quasi-peak</b> detector. This method, formerly known as CCIR weighting, is preferred by the telecommunications industry, broadcasters, and some equipment manufacturers as it reflects more accurately the audibility of pops and short bursts of random noise as opposed to pure tones. Psophometric weighting is used in telephony and telecommunications where narrow-band circuits are common.Hearing weighting curves are also used for sound in water.|$|E
50|$|Because <b>quasi-peak</b> PPMs {{indicate}} neither loudness nor true peaks {{but something}} between the two, {{it is important}} to allow sufficient headroom when using them in the control of digital audio levels. The EBU convention (R68) provides for this by defining Alignment Level as −18 dBFS. Thus a peak to the Permitted Maximum Level as indicated on a quasi-PPM corresponds to −9 or −10 dBFS. This 9-10 dB margin allows for operator error, the true peak typically being several dB higher than the PPM indication, and that subsequent signal processing (e.g., sample rate conversion) may increase the amplitude.|$|E
50|$|ITU-R 468 noise {{weighting}} was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness {{of all types}} of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI/) and, , is maintained by the ITU. Noise measurements using this weighting typically also use a <b>quasi-peak</b> detector law rather than slow averaging. This also helps to quantify the audibility of bursty noise, ticks and pops that might go undetected with a slow rms measurement.|$|E
50|$|When {{measurements}} {{started to}} be used in reviews of consumer equipment in the late 1960s it became apparent that they did not always correlate with what was heard. In particular, the introduction of Dolby B noise-reduction on cassette recorders was found to make them sound a full 10dB less noisy, yet they did not measure 10dB better. Various new methods were then devised, including one which used a harsher weighting filter and a <b>quasi-peak</b> rectifier, defined as part of the German DIN45 500 ‘Hi Fi’ standard. This standard, no longer in use, attempted to lay down minimum performance requirements in all areas for ‘High Fidelity’ reproduction.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of FM radio, which also generates predominantly high-frequency hiss, also showed up the unsatisfactory nature of A-weighting, and the BBC Research Department undertook {{a research project}} to determine which of several weighting filter and rectifier characteristics gave results that were most {{in line with the}} judgment of panel of listeners, using a wide variety of different types of noise. BBC Research Department Report EL-17 formed the basis of what became known as CCIR recommendation 468, which specified both a new weighting curve and a <b>quasi-peak</b> rectifier. This became the standard of choice for broadcasters worldwide, and it was also adopted by Dolby, for measurements on its noise-reduction systems which were rapidly becoming the standard in cinema sound, as well as in recording studios and the home.|$|E
50|$|Measurements {{based on}} psychoacoustics, {{such as the}} {{measurement}} of noise, often use a weighting filter. It is well established that human hearing is more sensitive to some frequencies than others, as demonstrated by equal-loudness contours, {{but it is not}} well appreciated that these contours vary {{depending on the type of}} sound. The measured curves for pure tones, for instance, are different from those for random noise. The ear also responds less well to short bursts, below 100 to 200 ms, than to continuous sounds such that a <b>quasi-peak</b> detector has been found to give the most representative results when noise contains click or bursts, as is often the case for noise in digital systems. For these reasons, a set of subjectively valid measurement techniques have been devised and incorporated into BS, IEC, EBU and ITU standards. These methods of audio quality measurement are used by broadcast engineers throughout most of the world, as well as by some audio professionals, though the older A-weighting standard for continuous tones is still commonly used by others.|$|E

A novel voltage space-vector RPWM technique with a limited pool of switching frequencies was employed. Experiments with an induction motor supplied from a voltage-source inverter, performed in a certified shielded chamber, were focused on the electromagnetic noise conducted to mains. In comparison with the deterministic modulation case, significant reduction of the noise, especially with regard to the <b>quasi-peak</b> values, is shown, demonstrating an important advantage of random modulation...|$|E

In the latter case, we are able to achieve a 3. 8 dB improvement in EMI reduction with respect to the triangular modulation when using the peak detector, which increases to 6. 9 dB when switching to the <b>quasi-peak</b> detector.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{provides}} a comprehensive guideline {{for the design}} of a single-phase PFC targeting for minimal volume, as it is highly relevant for ultracompact integrated systems. It is shown, how different operation modes (continuous, boundary, and discontinuous conduction mode) may influence the design and consequently the achieved power density. Furthermore, the effect of interleaving of several boost stages is analyzed as a measure for compactness increase. Finally, the selection of the appropriate switching frequency in order to achieve an overall optimized sys-tem is discussed. In this way, the design of the crucial components is carried out, namely, the boost inductor, including a volume optimization through a thermal connection to the heat sink; the output capacitor considering the rms current stress; and the input filter, which is designed for compliance with high-frequency electromagnetic compatibility standards, taking into account the <b>quasi-peak</b> detection measurement of the test receiver equipment.

40|$|Abstract—For a {{three-phase}} buck-type pulsewidth modulation {{rectifier input}} {{stage of a}} high-power telecommunications power supply module, a differential-mode (DM) electromagnetic com-patibility (EMC) filter is designed for compliance to CISPR 22 Class B in the frequency range of 150 kHz– 30 MHz. The design {{is based on a}} harmonic analysis of the rectifier input current and a mathematical model of the measurement procedure including the line impedance stabilization network (LISN) and the test receiver. Guidelines for a successful filter design are given, and components for a 5 -kW rectifier prototype are selected. Furthermore, formulas for the estimation of the <b>quasi-peak</b> detector output based on the LISN output voltage spectrum are provided. The damping of filter resonances is optimized for a given attenuation in order to facilitate a higher stability margin for system control. Further-more, the dependence of the filter input and output impedances and the attenuation characteristic on the inner mains impedance are discussed. As experimentally verified by using a three-phase common-/Differential-Mode separator, this procedure allows ac-curate prediction of the converter DM conducted emission levels and therefore could be employed in the design process of the rectifier system to ensure compliance to relevant EMC standards.

40|$|An {{atmospheric}} {{radio noise}} burst represents the radiation received from one complete lightning flash at the frequency to which a receiver is tuned and within the receiver bandwidth. At tropical latitudes, the principal source of interference in the frequency range from 0. 1 to 10 MHz is the burst form of {{atmospheric radio noise}}. The structure of a burst shows several approximately rectangular pulses of random amplitude, duration and frequency of recurrence. The influence of the noise on data communication can only be examined when {{the value of the}} number of pulses crossing a certain amplitude threshold per unit time of the noise burst is known. A pulse rate counter designed for this purpose has been used at Bangalore (12 ° 58 ′N, 77 ° 35 ′E) to investigate the pulse characteristics of noise bursts at 3 MHz with a receiver bandwidth of 3. 3 kHz/ 6 d B. The results show that the number of pulses lying in the amplitude range between peak and <b>quasi-peak</b> values of the noise bursts and the burst duration corresponding to these pulses follow log normal distributions. The pulse rates deduced therefrom show certain correlation between the number of pulses and the duration of the noise burst. The results are discussed with a view to furnish necessary information for data communication...|$|E
