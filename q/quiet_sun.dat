25|$|The solar regions {{which are}} not part of active regions and coronal holes are {{commonly}} identified as the <b>quiet</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{equatorial}} region has a faster rotation speed than the polar zones. The {{result of the}} Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the solar cycle, while they almost disappear during each minimum. Therefore, the <b>quiet</b> <b>Sun</b> always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is less active during the maximum of the solar cycle. Approaching the minimum of the solar cycle (also named butterfly cycle), {{the extension of the}} <b>quiet</b> <b>Sun</b> increases until it covers the whole disk surface excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are the coronal holes.|$|E
25|$|Ring-diagram analysis, first {{introduced}} by F. Hill, {{is used to}} infer the speed and direction of horizontal flows below the solar surface by observing the Doppler shifts of ambient acoustic waves from power spectra of solar oscillations computed over patches of the solar surface (typically 15° × 15°). Thus ring analysis is a generalization of global helioseismology applied to local areas on the Sun (as opposed to half of the Sun). For example, sound speed and adiabatic index can be compared within magnetically active and inactive (<b>quiet</b> <b>Sun)</b> regions.|$|E
40|$|This work {{provides}} {{additional evidence}} on the involvement of exotic particles like axions and/or other WISPs, following recent measurements during the <b>quietest</b> <b>Sun</b> and flaring Sun. Thus, SPHINX mission observed a minimum basal soft X-rays emission in the extreme solar minimum in 2009. The same scenario (with ~ 17 meV axions) fits also the dynamical behaviour of white-light solar flares, like the measured spectral components in the visible and in soft X-rays, and, the timing between them. Solar chameleons remain a viable candidate, since they may preferentially convert to photons in outer space. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures.

5000|$|During 2008-2009 NASA {{scientists}} {{noted that}} the Sun is undergoing a [...] "deep solar minimum," [...] stating: [...] "There were no sunspots observed on 266 of 2008's 366 days (73%). Prompted by these numbers, some observers suggested that the solar cycle had hit bottom in 2008. Sunspot counts for 2009 dropped even lower. As of September 14, 2009 there were no sunspots on 206 of the year's 257 days (80%). It adds up to one inescapable conclusion: [...] "We're experiencing a very deep solar minimum," [...] says solar physicist Dean Pesnell of the Goddard Space Flight Center. [...] "This is the <b>quietest</b> <b>sun</b> we've seen in almost a century," [...] agrees sunspot expert David Hathaway of the National Space Science and Technology Center NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between strong and extreme geomagnetic storms and solar cycle characteristics. The analysis uses an extensive geomagnetic index AA data set spanning over 150 yr. complemented by the Kakioka magnetometer recordings. We apply Pearson correlation statistics and estimate {{the significance of the}} correlation with a bootstrapping technique. We show that the correlation between the storm occurrence and the strength of the solar cycle decreases from a clear positive correlation with increasing storm magnitude toward a negligible relationship. Hence, the <b>quieter</b> <b>Sun</b> can also launch superstorms that may lead to significant societal and economic impact. Our results show that while weaker storms occur most frequently in the declining phase, the stronger storms have the tendency to occur near solar maximum. Our analysis suggests that the most extreme solar eruptions do not have a direct connection between the solar large-scale dynamo-generated magnetic field, but are rather associated with smaller-scale dynamo and resulting turbulent magnetic fields. The phase distributions of sunspots and storms becoming increasingly in phase with increasing storm strength, on the other hand, may indicate that the extreme storms are related to the toroidal component of the solar large-scale field...|$|R

2500|$|Helioseismic holography, {{introduced}} in detail by Lindsey and Braun {{for the purpose}} of far-side (magnetic) imaging, a special case of phase-sensitive holography. The idea is to use the wavefield on the visible disk to learn about active regions {{on the far side of}} the Sun. The basic idea in helioseismic holography is that the wavefield, e.g., the line-of-sight Doppler velocity observed at the solar surface, can be used to make an estimate of the wavefield at any location in the solar interior at any instant in time. In this sense, holography is much like seismic migration, a technique in geophysics that has been in use since the 1940s. As another example, this technique has been used to give a seismic image of a solar flare. Acoustic holography, applied to MDI data, is ideal for the detection of sources and sinks of acoustic waves on the Sun. Braun and Fan [...] discovered a region of lower acoustic emission in the 3 – 4 mHz frequency band which extends far beyond the sunspots (the ‘acoustic moat’). Acoustic moats extend beyond magnetic regions into the <b>quiet</b> <b>Sun.</b> In addition, Braun and Lindsey [...] discovered high-frequency emission (‘acoustic glories’) surrounding active regions.|$|E

But a steady stream of lead poured into our position all the time. There were no more disastrous ricochets, however; and our men in the trench, no longer firing, lay low and escaped damage. Only four were wounded, and only one of them very badly.|$|E

60|$|In {{that still}} {{air of the}} Florentine winter, time seems to share the arrest of the natural forces, the repose of the elements. The pale blue sky is {{frequently}} overcast, and it rains two days out of five; sometimes, under extraordinary provocation from the north a snow-storm whirls along under the low grey dome, and whitens the brown roofs, where a growth of spindling weeds and grass clothes the tiles the whole year round, and shows its delicate green above the gathered flakes. But {{for the most part}} the winds are laid, and the sole change is from <b>quiet</b> <b>sun</b> to quiet shower. This at least is the impression which remains in the senses of the sojourning stranger, whose days slip away with so little difference one from another that they seem really not to have passed, but, like the grass that keeps the hillsides fresh round Florence all the winter long, to be waiting some decisive change of season before they begin.|$|E

Oh, I ought to have gone to church! The bustle of the rising congregation reaches my ears. They are standing up to pray. Could I bring my heart into unison with those who are praying in yonder church and lift it heavenward with a fervor of supplication, but no distinct request, would not that be the safest kind of prayer?--"Lord, look down upon me in mercy!"

The difference between the peacefulness of inferior nature and the wilful hostilities of mankind was very apparent at this place.
