Various types of quantity-ultracentrifuges have been devised {{for this kind of}} service, most of them embodying an adaptation of the principle of Henriot and Huguenard (1925) according to which the rotating member is supported and driven by compressed air. Such centrifuges have been applied most extensively to the purification of viruses (Stanley, 1938), although results have been reported which indicate that they may be useful in the separation of substances of smaller unit size, such as antibodies (Wyckoff, 1936; Heidelberger and Pedersen, 1937; Gratia and Goreczky, 1938) and hormones (Severinghaus, Levin and Chiles, 1938). The scope of these centrifuges is in fact limited only by the structural strength of their rotors.

The presently reported <b>quantity</b> is <b>head</b> movement rms mm averaged over runs and subjects. This quantity was 0. 73 ±. 030 mm for patients at the acute stage, 0. 60 ± 0. 28 mm for patients at the chronic stage and 0. 42 ± 0. 08 mm for age-matched controls. Acute patients moved more than age-matched controls (P =. 003); the following comparisons were not significantly different: chronic patients vs. age-matched controls; and patients in the two stages of recovery. Critically, rms movement was not correlated with inter-regional FC measures (see the following figure for two examples). Hence, {{it is unlikely that}} patient vs. control movement differences account for the present main FC results. Further, a significant pIPS FC – performance correlation persisted after regressing out both rms movement and lesion size using partial correlation.

40|$|Background: Relationships between {{sitting height}} (SH) and leg length (LL) in adults {{are almost always}} studied in terms of ratios such as the Cormic Index (CI), SH/stature, rather than as primary variables. They are {{affected}} by genetics and childhood nutrition. Aim: To characterize these relationships and test whether the CI is ideal as an index of relative LL. Subjects and methods: Regression and reduced major axis (RMA) equations were calculated for 1653 {{men and women of}} European descent. For other population groups the RMA parameters were calculated from published {{means and standard deviations of}} SH and LL. Results: Linear and ‘allometric’ (power) equations fit the data equally well. For people of European origin the RMA equations for men and women do not differ significantly. Corresponding equations for other populations differ in line with published CIs. Conclusions: The linear equations suggest that LL tends to vary in proportion to SH minus a <b>quantity</b> similar to <b>head</b> height. A new index of relative LL may therefore be preferable to the CI for some research purposes to reflect this, but there is otherwise no strong reason to abandon the use of the CI...|$|R

A Power tunnel of 720 m long and diameter of 50 feet is taken off from the reservoir to the valve house at the start of Penstock. From the reservoir the water is carried to valve house through power tunnel and from valve house to the water Turbine through pipes of large diameter 6. 10 m made of steel or reinforced concrete, called the Penstock. The shaft from the turbine goes up into the 3 -phase Alternator of capacity 122000 KVA, which produces the power. The water after having done its useful work in the turbine is discharged to the tail race which may lead it to the river. The Srisailam Power plant has the capacity of 7 × 110 MW.

40|$|A silent {{revolution}} {{is taking place}} on Burkina Faso's Central Plateau. Thousands of planting pockets or zai, stone lines, permeable stone dams and straw mulch are transforming crop production as farmers see the benefits of using traditional farming techniques. Researchers from the Club du Sahel have found that in years of low rainfall farmers are getting significant increases in yields, sometimes in excess of 80 %, from fields that have stone lines, which control rainfall runoff. Some of this increase {{can be attributed to}} more water soaking into the soil but farmers are also applying extra nutrients. However, it is also apparent that soil structure is improved through the action of termites and other soil organisms that are attracted to the improved environment of the treated fields. Farmers are getting even better yields when they dig small pockets, or zai, over the land treated with stone lines. Zai can vary in size, but are usually {{about the size of a}} dinner plate; they are as deep as they are wide and are placed some 80 cm apart. The pockets collect rainfall runoff, and farmers add a handful of compost to them before planting sorghum. Land with stone lines and zai can yield up to 1000 kg / hectare of sorghum in a normal rainfall year. In one area, trees are being established successfully by planting seeds straight into the zai instead of growing seedlings in a nursery and then transplanting them. Another technique for water conservation is the use of permeable stone dams, built across gullies, that hold back soil and water that would normally be lost. In Rissiam, over 100 such dams have been built, providing excellent growing conditions in the former gullies behind the dams. Farmers are also getting good results by using straw or cut grass as a mulch. It was a traditional practice that went out Of fashion, but is now becoming popular again. These soil and water conservation activities are not only increasing yields: farmers are seeing trees that were dying now being revived and wells which had dried up having water in them once again. Compost making has increased considerably and many farmers now see advantages to enclosing small livestock, both to provide a source of manure and to stop them damaging stone lines as they graze. A constraint now is the lack of transport to move the compost out to the fields, as carrying large <b>quantities</b> by <b>head</b> load is impossible. These techniques are spreading extensively from farmer to farmer as they adapt, experiment and innovate to suit their needs and abilities.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that local leech (Hirudinea sp) contain a {{substance}} with anticoagulant properties and the isolation of this was first in 1984 (Weinberg 1994). In this study the purification of the blood-thinning agent hirudin, protein profiling and quantification from different parts of leech body are reported. The result shows the sample from leech head gave the highest result in protein concentration with a value of 69. 33 ug/ml compared with the sample from the whole body and headless leech which was 36. 67 ug/ml and 26. 67 ug/ml, respectively. Sample from leech head was subsequently used for purication by gel permeation chromatography on Sephadex G- 75. Fractions which contain significant amounts of protein with absorbance value of more than 0. 2 at 595 nm were tested for their anti-coagulant activity on rabbit blood. The result shows that Peak III (fraction number = 23, optical density = 0. 256, protein concenntration = 82. 00 ug/ml) took the longest time for blood to clot (123. 33 min) and did not contract but 380 minutes later when compared with Peaks II (fraction number = 21, optical density = 0. 293,protein concentration = 94. 33 ug/ml) and V (fraction number = 36, optical density = 0. 214,protein concentration = 68. 00 ug/ml) where clotting was relatively earlier and occurred within 13. 33 and 23. 33 minutes and showed conctraction much sooner at 24. 33 and 41. 67 minutes later, respectively.

40|$|The {{groundwater}} inflow into a mine {{during its}} life and after ceasing operations {{is one of}} the most important concerns of the mining industry. This paper presents a hydrogeological assessment of the Irankuh Zn-Pb mine at 20 km south of Esfahan and 1 km northeast of Abnil in west-Central Iran. During mine excavation, the upper impervious bed of a confined aquifer was broken and water at high-pressure flowed into an open pit mine associated with the Kolahdarvazeh deposit. The inflow rates were 6. 7 and 1. 4 m 3 /s at the maximum and minimum quantities, respectively. Permeability, storage coefficient, thickness and initial head of the fully saturated confined aquifer were 3. 5 [*]x[*] 10 − 4 m/s, 0. 2, 30 m and 60 m, respectively. The hydraulic heads as a function of time were monitored at four observation wells in the vicinity of the pit over 19 weeks and at an observation well near a test well over 21 h. In addition, by measuring the rate of pumping out from the pit sump, at a constant head (usually equal to height of the pit floor), the real inflow rates to the pit were monitored. The main innovations of this work were to make comparison between numerical modelling using a finite element software called SEEP/W and actual data related to inflow and extend the applicability of the numerical model. This model was further used to estimate the hydraulic heads at the observation wells around the pit over 19 weeks during mining operations. Data from a pump-out test and observation wells were used for model calibration and verification. In order to evaluate the model efficiency, the modelling results of inflow <b>quantity</b> and hydraulic <b>heads</b> were compared to those from analytical solutions, as well as the field data. The mean percent error in relation to field data for the inflow quantity was 0. 108. It varied between 1. 16 and 1. 46 for hydraulic head predictions, which are much lower values than the mean percent errors resulted from the analytical solutions (from 1. 8 to 5. 3 for inflow and from 2. 16 to 3. 5 for hydraulic head predictions). The analytical solutions underestimated the inflow compared to the numerical model for the time period of 2 - 19 weeks. The results presented in this paper can be used for developing an effective dewatering program...|$|R
