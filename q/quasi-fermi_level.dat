As for the second, the difference between the <b>quasi-Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> at the junction, he says that we can estimate the current flowing through the diode from this difference. He points out that the current at the p terminal is all holes, whereas at the n terminal it is all electrons, and the sum of these two is the constant total current. So the total current is equal to the decrease in hole current {{from one side of the}} diode to the other. This decrease is due to an excess of recombination of electron-hole pairs over generation of electron-hole pairs. The rate of recombination is equal to the rate of generation when at equilibrium, that is, when the two <b>quasi-Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> are equal. But when the <b>quasi-Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> are not equal, then the recombination rate is [...] times the rate of generation. We then assume that most of the excess recombination (or decrease in hole current) takes place in a layer going by one hole diffusion length (Lp) into the n material and one electron diffusion length (Ln) into the p material, and that the difference between the <b>quasi-Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> is constant in this layer at VJ.

40|$|H–Si(111) {{surfaces}} {{have been}} reacted with liquid methanol (CH_ 3 OH) {{in the absence}} or presence {{of a series of}} oxidants and/or illumination. Oxidant-activated methoxylation of H–Si(111) surfaces was observed in the dark after exposure to CH_ 3 OH solutions that contained the one-electron oxidants acetylferrocenium, ferrocenium, or 1, 1 ’-dimethylferrocenium. The oxidant-activated reactivity toward CH_ 3 OH of intrinsic and n-type H–Si(111) surfaces increased upon exposure to ambient light. The results suggest that oxidant-activated methoxylation requires that two conditions be met: (1) the position of the <b>quasi-Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> must energetically favor oxidation of the H–Si(111) surface and (2) the position of the <b>quasi-Fermi</b> <b>levels</b> must energetically favor reduction of an oxidant in solution. Consistently, illuminated n-type H–Si(111) surfaces underwent methoxylation under applied external bias more rapidly and at more negative potentials than p-type H–Si(111) surfaces. The results under potentiostatic control indicate that only conditions that favor oxidation of the H–Si(111) surface need be met, with charge balance at the surface maintained by current flow {{at the back of the}} electrode.
