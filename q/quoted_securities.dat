40|$|Abstract: This paper examine empirically {{variables}} {{that can be}} significantly correlated with inter-temporal changes of measures of the individual’s securities, for example: trading volumes, number of transactions, return, volatility, arrival of new information etc. Before a study of a sample of 40 <b>quoted</b> <b>securities</b> in Tunisian financial market, on the period of February 07, 2011 until January 31, 2013, results appear conclusive. First, as expected, depth has negative correlation with all spread measures. Besides, we observe perfect positive correlations between spread measures. This shows the validity of these liquidity measures on the Tunisian stock market. Furthermore, {{the results suggest that}} volume, return and arrival of new information contribute to explain significantly the inter-temporal changes of various measures of the securities liquidity. Finally, we can consider, probably, the arrival of new information as a common factor for the different liquidity measures for all stocks in our sample...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{economic}} reforms that began in 2003 in Nigeria, earning Nigeria a BB- credit rating, which led to US$ 18 bn debt write-off and created pension funds which have several billions of Naira to be invested in Nigerian securities, investors confidence was ignited and lifted in Nigeria Stock Market. The banking sector reforms which necessitated recapitalization also fuelled a boom in the equity market. Most Nigerian bank stocks increased in value many folds, despite billions of Naira of new shares being issued, with some stocks more than quadrupling in value {{in less than a year}} between 2004 and 2007. Companies kept the free float of offers which were greatly matched by demand. The capital market thus became the haven for profit taking. From an all time high of N 13. 5 trillion market capitalization in March 2008 the stock prices experienced a free-for-all downward movement to generate less than N 4. 6 trillion market capitalization by the second week of January 2009 and N 6. 53 trillion as at last trading day of 2011. With this downward movement regime, more than 60 % of slightly above 300 <b>quoted</b> <b>securities</b> were on constant offer (supply exceeding demand) on a continuous basis. Consequently many of the quoted stocks lack liquidity as their holders are trapped, not being able to convert them to cash to meet their domestic and other investment needs. Fresh investors became cautious of jumping into a vehicle that does not seem to have a brake should they wish to disembark. With exploratory research, the study discovered that the downturn was caused mainl...|$|E

40|$|Background: The main {{topic of}} the master thesis is Valuation of Securities on Inactive Markets. <b>Securities</b> <b>quoted</b> on {{inactive}} market have been investigated to present how their fair value can be efficiently measured. <b>Securities</b> <b>quoted</b> on inactive market can have limited or unreliable inputs and the valuation process can become time and money consuming. Financial professional face similar problems while valuing financial assets on inactive markets. Relevance of the topic: The master thesis might be {{of particular interest to}} investment and asset management companies which can get an opportunity to share their experiences and gain from the knowledge exchange. Method: One asset management company and three audit companies have been contacted for collecting information from different perspectives. asset management company has practical experience on conducting valuation of inactively traded securities and audit companies suggest how valuation should be done. Results have been collected through surveys and interviews to all selected companies. Then the qualitative approach has been applied on the collected results. Main findings: Even though most of the answers to the questionnaire were different, as the companies followed generally accepted international standards, their view on the valuation of inactively traded securities was relatively common. Companies admitted that the main problems in the valuation of <b>securities</b> <b>quoted</b> on inactive market are the limited access to market quotes, high spreads on the market, unreliable market information, limited access to financial data of the valued companies and considerable amount of inactively traded securities. Valuation based on multiples is most commonly used by the companies. Sometimes the combination of methods for example price of recent transaction, DCF and net assets can be applied and {{it is up to the}} investment manager to decide what methods to use. Summary of recommendations offered by the interviewed companies concerning valuation of inactively traded securities is presented at the end of the master thesis...|$|R
