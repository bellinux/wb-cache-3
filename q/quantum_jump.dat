5|$|Rodimus, {{being given}} {{half of the}} Matrix, decides to lead {{a search for the}} fabled Knights of Cybertron in the hope that they can help restore order to Cybertron. Taking to the stars on board the ship called the Lost Light, Rodimus is joined by Ultra Magnus and Drift as his second-and-third-in-commands, Ratchet, Chromedome, Rewind, Swerve, Brainstorm, Rung, Whirl and a {{reformed}} Cyclonus, among several others. Following an unexpected <b>quantum</b> <b>jump</b> upon launch, the Lost Light is hurled off into the depths of space, where the crew is joined by Skids and contends with a stowaway Sparkeater. A visit to Delphi by Ratchet to help cure a plague introduces the threat of the Decepticon Justice Division, who then feature in a Decepticon-dedicated story menacing a band of misfit Decepticons, and also brings the facility's surviving patients and staff onto the ship—including Fortress Maximus, whose post-traumatic stress causes him to snap and nearly kill Rung. Hoping to cure Rung's damaged brain, Rewind gathers a small group together to recount a shared story from their past about Orion Pax foiling a Senate plot to discredit the burgeoning Decepticon movement in the days of Functionism. Chromedome is manipulated by Drift into carrying out a plan laid out by Prowl: using his mnemosurgery skills to tap the memories and learn the secrets of mass-murdering Decepticon Overlord, secretly hidden on board the Lost Light. Unfortunately, Chromedome accidentally allows Overlord to escape, and Rewind has to sacrifice himself to jettison the monster from the ship before the section of the ship is blown up. Drift admits to responsibility for Overlord's actions, resulting in his exile, even though Rodimus later reveals he {{was a part of the}} plot as well. Ultra Magnus is also fatally wounded in the battle, but when his body disappears from the ship's Medibay, the crew track it to Luna 1, where they discover and foil a twisted plot by Chief Justice Tyrest to wipe out all those Transformers he sees as tainted by original sin.|$|E

40|$|In a {{fundamental}} test of quantum mechanics, we have observed 228 ~ 000 <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> {{of a single}} trapped and laser cooled $^{ 88 }$Sr$^+$ ion. This represents a statistical increase of two orders of magnitude over previous similar analyses of <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps.</b> Compared to other searches for non-randomness in quantum mechanical processes, using <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> simplifies the interpretation of data by eliminated multi-particle effects and providing near-unit detection efficiency of transitions. We measure the fractional reduction in the entropy of information to be $< 6. 5 ~ 10 ^{- 4 }$ when the value of any interval between <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> is known. We also find {{that the number of}} runs of successively increasing or decreasing interval times agrees with the theoretically expected values. Furthermore, we analyze 238 ~ 000 <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> from two simultaneously confined ions and find that the number of apparently coincidental transitions is as expected.

50|$|The <b>quantum</b> <b>jump</b> {{method is}} an {{approach}} {{which is much}} like the master-equation treatment except that it operates on the wave function rather than using a density matrix approach.

The calculated system state {{as a function of}} time is known as a quantum trajectory, and the desired density matrix as a function of time may be calculated by averaging over many simulated trajectories. For a Hilbert space of dimension N, the number of wave function components is equal to N while the number of density matrix components is equal to N2. Consequently, for certain problems the <b>quantum</b> <b>jump</b> method offers a performance advantage over direct master-equation approaches.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A Hilbert space path {{integral}} for the dissipative {{dynamics of}} matter in thermal radiation fields {{is derived from}} the Hamiltonian of quantum electrodynamics. This path integral represents the conditional transition probability of a stochastic Markov process as a sum over sample trajectories in Hilbert space. The realizations of the process are piecewise deterministic paths broken by instantaneous <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps.</b> It is shown that the operators which define the possible <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> form a continuous family parametrized by the polarization vector of the emitted or absorbed photons. The stochastic process is shown to be representation-independent and to be invariant with respect to space rotations. The precise physical interpretation of the stochastic process is given. In particular, the expansion of the density matrix in terms of <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> is derived for finite temperatures from the Hilbert space path integral. 1...|$|R

He mainly uses this ability to traverse interstellar distances in a manner similar to hyperspace travel. The effect is essentially a form of teleportation, which Quasar refers to as a <b>Quantum</b> <b>Jump.</b> A <b>Quantum</b> <b>Jump</b> has a destructive side effect on the local environment, violently upheaving gravity and tearing holes in the atmosphere (on Earth, it would damage the ozone layer), so Quasar initially refrained from using it except when in space or in dire circumstances.

40|$|It is {{problematic}} {{to interpret the}} <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> of an atom interacting with thermal light in terms of counts at detectors monitoring the atom's inputs and outputs. As an alternative, we develop an interpretation based on a self-consistency argument. We include one mode of the thermal field in the system Hamiltonian and describe its interaction with the atom by an entangled quantum state while assuming that the other modes induce <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> in the usual fashion. In the weak-coupling limit, the photon number expectation of the selected mode is also seen to execute <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps,</b> although more generally, for stronger coupling, Rabi oscillations are observed; the equilibrium photon number distribution is a Bose-Einstein distribution.

40|$|The {{apparent}} {{dichotomy between}} <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> {{on the one}} hand, and continuous time evolution according to wave equations on the other hand, provided a challenge to Bohr's proposal of <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> in atoms. Furthermore, Schroedinger's time-dependent equation also seemed to require a modification of the explanation for the origin of line spectra due to the apparent possibility of superpositions of energy eigenstates for different energy levels. Indeed, Schroedinger himself proposed a quantum beat mechanism for the generation of discrete line spectra from superpositions of eigenstates with different energies. However, these issues between old quantum theory and Schroedinger's wave mechanics were correctly resolved only after the development and full implementation of photon quantization. The second quantized scattering matrix formalism reconciles <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> with continuous time evolution through the identification of <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> with transitions between different sectors of Fock space. The continuous evolution of quantum states is then recognized as a sum over continually evolving jump amplitudes between different sectors in Fock space. In today's terminology, this suggests that linear combinations of scattering matrix elements are epistemic sums over ontic states. Insights from {{the resolution of the}} dichotomy between <b>quantum</b> <b>jumps</b> and continuous time evolution therefore hold important lessons for modern research both on interpretations of quantum mechanics and on the foundations of quantum computing. They demonstrate that discussions of interpretations of quantum theory necessarily need to take into account field quantization. They also demonstrate the limitations of the role of wave equations in quantum theory, and caution us that superpositions of quantum states for the formation of qubits may be more limited than usually expected.
