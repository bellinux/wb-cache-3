40|$|Understanding the {{problems}} faced by rural extension in Uruguay {{as well as the}} conceptions used by the development agents to conduct their practices constitutes a contribution to both, the Uruguayan rural development policies and the wider space of the MERCOSUR. A quali-quantitative research was conducted, during which 32 Uruguayan extensionists replied to a <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>Replies</b> underwent content and statistic analysis. Results suggest that the Uruguayan rural extensionists posses a complex conception of their practice, which articulates productive and social dimensions and relates to a critical and participatory way of understanding rural extension. Nevertheless, a diffusionist conception of rural extension is also present in some cases. Finally, problems related to group dynamics are highlighted. </p...|$|E

The model based on a "bottom-up" approach in order to reproduce customers' daily behaviour concerning elcctricity usage, has been applied for validation to reproduce load diagrams of a sample residential area where field measurements of power demand arid a combined mail survey had been previously conducted. Since the residential electric load was almost exclusively of the discretionary, weather-independent type, the survey ques tionnairc regarded mainly thc lifestyle of customers, thus evidencing the need for probabilistic processing of the data collected by the survey. To this end customers' presence at home and appliance usage have been considered as normal distributions around a incan value as ensued from the survey data. In the paper, a sensitivity analysis is performed on standard deviation values of the above distributions, which allows quite good matching of recorded data with simulation risults.

Satisfactory replies were received for 97 per cent (8, 410), and 96 per cent of these (8, 087) were examined by a team of school medical officers. A history of wheezing was obtained in 16 · 2 per cent; 1 · 8 percent had had wheezing alone, while the majority (14 - 4 per cent) gave a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Productive cough alone was reported in a further 32 · 5 per cent The parents reported that 17 · 1 per cent of seven-year-old children had {{more than two or three}} colds a year, 5 - 7 per cent had 2 ̆ 7 hay fever’, and 6 - 8 per cent had both. There was a close association between upper and lower respiratory symptoms, the prevalence of upper respiratory symptoms ranging from 15 - 5 per cent in those with no lower respiratory symptoms to 60 · 4 per cent in those with a history of both wheezing and productive cough. Despite considerable overlap, “colds” tended to be associated with productive cough and 2 ̆ 7 hay fever 2 ̆ 7 with wheezing. According to the <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies,</b> lower respiratory symptoms were commoner (48 · 6 percent) than upper respiratory symptoms (29 · 6 percent). Episodes of productive cough were longer in duration, less frequent and started later in life than episodes of wheezing. Those with a history of both wheezing and productive cough resembled those with wheezing alone more closely than those with productive cough alone, but tended to be more severely affected than those with wheezing alone. Eczema and other indices of atopy were associated with a history of wheezing, and also, after elimination of the effect of wheezing, with hay fever. In this respect those with productive cough alone and those with colds alone did not differ significantly from those without symptoms.

The research utilises this function of the VR program in architectural design studios. The main objective is to investigate how and to what extend students would benefit from applying this new potential of the VR function. The hypothesis was that the function potential would assist students to have more understanding of the structural system selected, which would be simultaneously beneficial on the architectural design level. The students used the VR programme during the design process in the stage of proposing and exploring the structural system. The used application focuses on providing the students with an effective tool to select and visualise a structural system and its construction process. A questionnaire was designed and distributed to the students to record their remarks and opinions of using the VR function.

In a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial we enrolled 123 children, 72 boys, mean age 8. 78 yr (+/- 2. 33 s. d.), with intermittent or mild persistent asthma. Participants were randomly assigned to an education group, who received Aironet at baseline and 2 months later (60 children), or to a control group who did not (63 children). Follow-up lasted 12 months and included out-patient clinic visits and spirometry at 2, 4 and 12 months. At baseline and at 12 months follow-up, parents were questioned about their knowledge of asthma, and their children's asthmatic attacks, use of systemic corticosteroids, family physician or hospital emergency room visits, hospitalizations and asthma-related school absences. <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> at 12 -month follow-up reported significantly fewer asthma attacks in patients who received the program than in those who did not (1. 65 +/- 1. 21 vs. 2. 34 +/- 1. 73; p or = 3 asthma attacks at baseline, parents' knowledge improved significantly more in the educational group than in the control group. The out-patient educational program Aironet reduces the number of asthma attacks in children with intermittent or mild persistent asthma and improves knowledge of the disease...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 45 - 49) The {{purpose of}} this study was to determine the status of commercial music programs in the public two-year colleges of California during the 1974 - 1975 academic year. It was designed to collect and document the current commercial music course offerings of the various colleges. The data for the study was derived from <b>questionnaire</b> <b>replies</b> from fifty-two California public two-year college music department chairmen or their representatives, information extracted from current 1974 - 75 college catalogues, class schedules, music department bulletins, personal interviews, plus material discovered through extensive research in numerous public and university libraries. The compiled data was analyzed, presented, and discussed in text and tabular form. The following conclusions were formulated: (1) The greatest number of public two-year colleges offering commercial music programs and courses in commercial music are located, almost exclusively, in the southern section of the state of California, (2) the most popular commercial music course continues to be, historically, the Stage or Dance Band, (3) new courses such as Music Notation and Copying, Arranging, Studio or Recording Band, Commercial Music Technique, and Jazz Theory and Improvisation are finding their way into the curriculum, (4) further investigation of course content in the area of commercial music is recommended for greater uniformity and possible standardization, and (5) reflecting rising student demand, more courses in commercial music will gradually find their way into the curriculums of most California public two-year college...|$|E
40|$|The {{attitudes of}} {{principals}} toward ability grouping {{in the public}} schools of South Carolina were studied, emphasizing the degree to which principals feel that ability grouping contributes to the quality of education. Also examined were differences in attitudes of elementary school and secondary school principals (black and white, male and female, and experienced and inexperienced), and the contribution of the majority population of the school toward principal attitude. All principals in South Carolina public schools were asked to complete a <b>questionnaire,</b> and 514 <b>replied.</b> Data were analyzed by measures of central tendency, Pearson product-moment correlation,sand chi square. Results indicate that principal attitudes cannot be construed as supporting ability grouping, and that there were no expressed differences for elementary school and secondary school principals. Years of experience, gender, race, an...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between occupational exposures and spontaneous abortion in female veterinarians. Methods: The Health Risks of Australian Veterinarians project (HRAV) was conducted as a questionnaire-based survey of all graduates from Australian veterinary schools during the 40 -year period 1960 - 2000. Of 5, 748 eligible veterinarians who were sent the <b>questionnaires,</b> 2, 800 <b>replied</b> including 1, 197 females (42. 8 %). The response rate was 59 % of women veterinarians eligible to participate. The pregnancy of women was defined as the unit of analysis. We restricted analyses to pregnancies of those women who reported being employed when the pregnancy began and were working only in clinical practice. Of 1, 355 pregnancies in total in the file, 940 pregnancies were eligible for the final analysis. Self-reported occupational exposures to anesthetic gases, x-rays, pesticides and long working hours in relation to spontaneous abortion were examined...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{sampling}} and sample treatment {{as well as}} the analytical methodology for determination of dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs in food have been discussed and evaluated at 2 workshops with participation from all Nordic countries. It was found that in general the EU regulation and guidelines for {{sampling and}} sample treatment appears to fit their purpose although {{there is a need for}} better procedures for the sampling of lots containing fishes of different size or weight. Information on the equipment and analytical methods used by the Nordic dioxin laboratories to measure dioxin and dioxin-like PCB in foodstuffs were compiled through a <b>questionnaire.</b> Together the <b>replies</b> are giving an overview of the analytical capacity in the Nordic countries and they demonstrate that the analytical methodology used by the Nordic dioxin laboratories is in good agreement with the EU guidelines and other international standards and recommendations...|$|R
