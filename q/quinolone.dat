Enrofloxacin, a <b>quinolone</b> antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops× M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, erythromycin, furazolidone, and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this nanomaterial is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of <b>quinolone</b> antibiotics into the cell.|$|E
25|$|Although not {{formally}} a <b>quinolone,</b> nalidixic acid {{is considered the}} first <b>quinolone</b> drug. It was introduced in 1962 for treatment of urinary tract infections in humans. Nalidixic acid was discovered by George Lesher and coworkers in a distillate during an attempt at chloroquine synthesis. Nalidixic acid is thus {{considered to be the}} predecessor of all members of the <b>quinolone</b> family, including the second, third and fourth generations commonly known as fluoroquinolones. Since the introduction of nalidixic acid in 1962, more than 10,000 analogs have been synthesized, but only a handful have found their way into clinical practice. The first generation also included other <b>quinolone</b> drugs, such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin, which were introduced in the 1970s. They proved to be only marginal improvements over nalidixic acid.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of penetration of <b>quinolones</b> through the bacterial outer membrane was studied with lipopolysaccharide-deficient and porin-deficient mutants.

The results also showed that <b>quinolones</b> with a low relative hydrophobicity appeared to permeate through OmpF porin, whereas <b>quinolones</b> with a low relative hydrophobicity appeared to permeate through OmpF porin, whereas <b>quinolones</b> with a high relative hydrophobicity appeared to permeate through both OmpF porin and phospholipid bilayers...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTFollowing {{the first}} {{outbreaks}} of legionnaire's disease, erythromycin {{emerged as the}} treatment of choice without the foundation of rigorous clinical trials. The number of therapeutic failures with erythromycin, {{as well as the}} side-effects and drug interactions, led to the consideration of other drugs such as the new macrolides and <b>quinolones</b> for the treatment of legionnaire's disease in the 1990 s. In this article, 19 studies in in-vitro intracellular models and seven animal studies that compared macrolides to <b>quinolones</b> were reviewed. <b>Quinolones</b> were found to have greater activity in intracellular models and improved efficacy in animal models compared with macrolides. No randomised trials comparing the clinical efficacy of the new macrolides and new <b>quinolones</b> have ever been performed. Three observational studies totalling 458 patients with legionnaire's disease have compared the clinical efficacy of macrolides (not including azithromycin) and <b>quinolones</b> (mainly levofloxacin). The results suggested that <b>quinolones</b> may produce a superior clinical response compared with the macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin) with regard to defervescence, complications, and length of hospital stay. Little data exist for direct comparison of <b>quinolones</b> and azithromycin...|$|R
40|$|<b>Quinolones</b> are {{a family}} of {{antibiotics}} of great importance {{in the management of}} several community and nosocomial diseases. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} the qualities of the old and new <b>quinolones.</b> <b>Quinolones,</b> as anti-infectious agents, are effective and safe and few times occurs adverse events. After 1962, when the first quinolon, nalidix acid, appeared, new generations of <b>quinolones</b> (fourth generation) have appeared in the market. However, we should know strictly its indications, most infectious diseases are the agents of elections, but in another cases, are drugs of second line.

40|$|The {{effect of}} subinhibitory {{concentrations}} of ciprofloxacin, lomeftoxacin, norfioxacin, ofioxacin, and sparfloxacin on urease activity and on cell surface hydrophobicity of urea-splitting bacteria was examined. <b>Quinolones</b> at 0. 5 MICs demonstrated variable effects on bacterialurease activity.

40|$|The present review {{provides}} an updated {{critical analysis of}} the use of <b>quinolones</b> in osteomyelitis and orthopaedic prosthetic infections. Only papers published in peer-reviewed journals and related to the following areas were selected: experimental osteomyelitis, penetration of <b>quinolones</b> into human bone, and clinical use in comparative and noncomparative studies. Local drug carriers impregnated with <b>quinolones</b> allow high local antibiotic concentrations to be achieved in experimental systems. Considerable clinical experience has been gained mostly with ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. Cumulated results in clinical trials show clinical success rates of more than 90 % in osteomyelitis caused by Enterobacteriaceae. The combination of <b>quinolones</b> and rifampicin for the treatment of staphylococcal osteomyelitis as well as orthopaedic prosthetic infections appears very promising in clinical studies with a small number of patients. However, further comparative studies using <b>quinolones</b> as single agents or in combination (versus standard parenteral therapy) remain necessary in osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In particular, studies with the newer <b>quinolones</b> should be strongly encouraged in acute or chronic osteomyelitis and in more complicated situations such as diabetic osteomyelitis or foreign-body infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{antibacterial}} {{activities and}} target inhibition of 15 <b>quinolones</b> against grlA and gyrA mutant strains were studied.

The antibacterial activities of most <b>quinolones</b> against both mutant strains were lower than those against the wild-type strain. The ratios of MICs for the gyrA mutant strain to those for the grlA mutant strain (MIC ratio) varied from 0. 125 to 4. The ratios of 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of <b>quinolones</b> against topoisomerase IV to those against DNA gyrase (IC 50 ratios) also varied, from 0. 177 to 5. 52.

40|$|<b>Quinolones</b> and {{coumarins}} were potent eliminators of chloroplasts from Euglena gracilis. There was {{a remarkable}} similarity between antichloroplastic and antibacterial activities of DNA gyrase inhibitors. <b>Quinolones</b> produced 100 % chloroplast-free cells in concentrations which do not affect cell viability. Optimal conditions were exponential growth, continuous illumination, and neutral or slightly alkaline pH. Coumarins were more toxic than <b>quinolones.</b> Among the <b>quinolones,</b> ofloxacin was the most potent in eliminating chloroplasts. Among the coumarins, coumermycin A 1 was the most potent. New <b>quinolones</b> and coumermycin A 1 were able to induce the complete inability of originally green cells to form green colonies after 24 h of drug exposure, while clorobiocin and novobiocin required several days of exposure. Darkness, heat shock (42 degrees C, 10 min), or simultaneous treatment with chloramphenicol or rifampin decreased the potency of DNA gyrase inhibitors for producing chloroplast-free cells. Remarkably, in cells in which division was blocked by three different methods (resting medium, hyperthermic conditions [37 degrees C], or addition of cycloheximide), new <b>quinolones</b> and coumermycin A 1 nevertheless eliminated chloroplasts. The antichloroplastic activity of DNA gyrase inhibitors is additional data suggesting an evolutionary relationship between chloroplasts and eubacteria...|$|R
