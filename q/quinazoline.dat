2500|$|Metolazone is a <b>quinazoline,</b> a {{derivative}} of the similar diuretic quinethazone, {{as well as}} a sulfonamide. It is related to analogs of 1,2,4-benzothiadizine-1,1-dioxide (benzothiadiazine). These drugs are called benzothiadiazides, or thiazides for short. Chemically, metolazone is not a substituted benzothiadiazine, and therefore is not technically a thiazide. However, since metolazone, as well as other drugs like indapamide, act on the same target as thiazides and behave in a similar pharmacologic fashion, they are considered [...] "thiazide-like diuretics". Therefore, they are often included in the thiazide diuretics despite not being thiazides themselves.|$|E

The aim of this present thesis was the syntheses and optimization of substituted 4 -(indol- 3 -yl) <b>quinazolines,</b> {{a new class of}} EGFR-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitors. The structures of the compounds represent a more fundamental change in the pharmacophore compared with the 4 -anilinoquinazolines. Searching for cross-coupling processes, an interesting pathway was discovered, including hetarylations with help of Grignard compounds. In the main step prepared indolyl-magnesium compounds were converted with 4 -chloroquinazolines to give 4 -(indol- 3 -yl) <b>quinazolines.</b> The synthetic pathways are suitable to guarantee the desired halogen substitution pattern in the molecules. The synthesized compounds were tested for their In-vitro EGFR-tyrosine-kinase-inhibition and their cytotoxity at the MCF- 7 -cell line.

Furthermore 4 -(indol- 3 -yl) <b>quinazolines</b> show strong fluorescences in the ultraviolet light, comparable with quinine-sulphate. The results of the EGFR-tyrosine-kinase-inhibition, cytotoxity and fluorescence give this new substance-class a very interesting option in diagnostic fields and in treatment of EGFR-dependent tumors.
