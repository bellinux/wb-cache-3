5|$|Rhodotus is a genus in {{the fungus}} family Physalacriaceae. It is a {{monotypic}} genus {{and consists of}} the single mushroom species Rhodotus palmatus, known in the vernacular as the netted rhodotus, the rosy veincap, or the wrinkled peach. This uncommon species has a circumboreal distribution, and has been collected in eastern North America, northern Africa, Europe, and Asia; declining populations in Europe have led to its appearance in {{over half of the}} European fungal Red Lists of threatened species. Typically found growing on the stumps and logs of rotting hardwoods, mature specimens may usually be identified by the pinkish color and the distinctive ridged and veined surface of their rubbery caps; variations in the color and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> received during development lead to variations in the size, shape, and cap color of fruit bodies.|$|E

25|$|Image {{intensifier}} tubes (IITs) are optoelectronic {{devices that}} allow many devices, such as night vision devices and medical imaging devices, to function. They convert low levels <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from various wavelengths into visible <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{at a single}} wavelength.|$|R
50|$|Spectroradiometers are devices {{designed}} to measure the spectral power distribution of a source. From the spectral power distribution, the radiometric, photometric, and colorimetric <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> can be determined in order to measure, characterize, and calibrate light sources for various applications.|$|R
25|$|For a given <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> an {{incandescent}} light bulb produces more heat (and thus consumes more power) than a fluorescent lamp. In buildings where air conditioning is used, incandescent lamps' heat output increases load on the air conditioning system. While heat from lights will {{reduce the need for}} running a building's heating system, in general a heating system can provide the same amount of heat at a lower cost than {{incandescent light}}s.|$|E
500|$|The spores of U.craterium have a {{rapid and}} high {{percentage}} of germination. Germination requires only 1.5hours, {{a relatively short time}} compared to another inoperculate species in the same family, Sarcoscypha coccinea, which requires 48hours. Furthermore, germination is possible under a wide temperature range, from [...] to , and wide soil pH range; the quality and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> does not affect germination, although prolonged exposure to light does reduce germination efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{of an image}} intensifier tube is measured in microamperes per lumen (µA/lm). It defines how many electrons are produced per <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> that falls on the photocathode. This measurement should be made at a specific color temperature, such as [...] "at a colour temperature of 2854K". The color temperature at which this test is made tends to vary slightly between manufacturers. Additional measurements at specific wavelengths are usually also specified, especially for Gen2 devices, such as at 800nm and 850nm (infrared).|$|E
5000|$|Unstained {{biological}} structures appear mostly transparent under Bright-field microscopy as most cellular structures do not attenuate appreciable <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Nevertheless, {{the variation}} in the materials that constitutes these structures also corresponds to {{a variation in the}} refractive index.

40|$|In a {{room with}} only natural light from single large window, the {{impression}} of modeling of the human face at that window varies with relationship between {{the positions of the}} window, the model and the observer. An experiment was carried out to investigate the modelling of a mannequin doll's face at an actual window. It was found that the angle of the visual line from the observer to the window and the orientation of the model's face systematically affected the modeling score. However, the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from inside the room and outside the window did not significantly affect the evaluation, because the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>light</b> from these two directions was almost constant for this experiment. A multiple regression model with variables relating to the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and the position of the observer relative to the model satisfactorily explained the perceived modelling...|$|R

2500|$|Before the 2008 flyby to re-orient for {{the comet}} 103P/Hartley encounter, the {{spacecraft}} used High Resolution Instrument, {{the larger of}} its two telescopes, to perform photometric observations of previously discovered transiting extrasolar planets from January to August 2008. The goal of photometric observations is to measure the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light,</b> not necessarily resolve an image. An aberration in the primary mirror of the HRI [...] allowed the HRI to spread the light from observations over more pixels without saturating the CCD, effectively obtaining better data. A total of 198,434 images were exposed. EPOCh's goals were to study the physical properties of giant planets and search for rings, moons and planets as small as three Earth masses. It also looked at Earth {{as though it were}} an extrasolar planet to provide data that could characterize Earth-type planets for future missions, and it imaged the Earth over 24 hours to capture the Moon passing in front on 2008-05-29.|$|E

50|$|The Kl 35 was {{designed}} in 1934 {{under the auspices}} of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM). Dipl. Ing. Friedrich Fecher had overall responsibility for the construction. The so-called Gemischtbauweise construction was used: steel for fuselage, wood for wings and tail units and only small <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> alloy for linings were used. This became a preferred building method with the RLM around this time, because from considerations of strategic material availability.|$|R
5000|$|Focus: The solid {{package of}} the LED can be {{designed}} to focus its light. Incandescent and fluorescent sources often require an external reflector to collect light and direct it in a usable manner. For larger LED packages total internal reflection (TIR) lenses are often used to the same effect. However, when large <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are needed many light sources are usually deployed, which are difficult to focus or collimate towards the same target.|$|R
60|$|From a {{luminous}} centre, Light issues by irradiation; and the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> received upon any given plane, {{supposed to be}} shifting its position {{so as to be}} now nearer the centre and now farther from it, will be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the plane from the luminous body, are increased; and will be increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished.|$|R

60|$|Obs. 23. Comparing the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> {{reflected}} {{from the}} several Rings, I {{found that it}} was most copious from the first or inmost, and in the exterior Rings became gradually less and less. Also the whiteness of the first Ring was stronger than that reflected from those parts of the thin Medium or Plate which were without the Rings; as I could manifestly perceive by viewing at a distance the Rings made by the two Object-glasses; or by comparing two Bubbles of Water blown at distant Times, in the first of which the Whiteness appear'd, which succeeded all the Colours, and in the other, the Whiteness which preceded them all.|$|E

60|$|To {{obtain an}} {{infinite}} variety of purposes {{by a few}} plain principles, is the characteristic of nature.

It is the same with actions. A battle is all motion, a hero all glare: while such images are before us, we can attend to nothing else. Solon and Lycurgus would make no figure in the same scene with the king of Prussia; and we are at present so lost in the military scramble on the continent next us, in which, it must be confessed, we are deeply interested, that we have scarce time to throw a glance towards America, where we have also much at stake, and where, if anywhere, our account must be made up at last.|$|E

60|$|This appears {{by several}} Considerations. First, Because when Light {{goes out of}} Glass into Air, as obliquely as it can {{possibly}} do. If its Incidence be made still more oblique, it becomes totally reflected. For {{the power of the}} Glass after it has refracted the Light as obliquely as is possible, if the Incidence be still made more oblique, becomes too strong to let any of its Rays go through, and by consequence causes total Reflexions. Secondly, Because Light is alternately reflected and transmitted by thin Plates of Glass for many Successions, accordingly as the thickness of the Plate increases in an arithmetical Progression. For here the thickness of the Glass determines whether that Power by which Glass acts upon Light shall cause it to be reflected, or suffer it to be transmitted. And, Thirdly, because those Surfaces of transparent Bodies which have the greatest refracting power, reflect the greatest <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>Light,</b> as was shewn in the first Proposition.|$|E

"Gradually, {{however, the}} Catholic party about the emperor gained the upper hand; then various acts in {{breach of the}} {{conditions}} granted to the Protestants were committed, and public spirit on both sides became much embittered. On the 23d of May, 1618, the Estates of Bohemia met at Prague, and the Protestant nobles, headed by Count Thurn, came there armed, and demanded from the Imperial councillors {{an account of the}} high handed proceedings. A violent quarrel ensued, and finally the Protestant deputies seized the councillors Martinitz and Slavata, and their secretary, and hurled them from the window into the dry ditch, fifty feet below. Fortunately for the councillors the ditch contained a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> rubbish, and they and their secretary escaped without serious damage. The incident, however, was the commencement of war. Bohemia was almost independent of Austria, administering its own internal affairs. The Estates invested Count Thurn with the command of the army. The Protestant Union supported Bohemia in its action. Mathias, who was himself a tolerant and well meaning man, tried to allay the storm; but, failing to do so, marched an army into Bohemia.|$|E
60|$|The younger sister, {{the unfortunate}} Joan, the destined bride of the Duke of Orleans, {{advanced}} timidly {{by the side}} of her sister, conscious of a total want of those external qualities which women are most desirous of possessing, or being thought to possess.
