40|$|SUMMARY <b>Quinoxyfen</b> is a {{protectant}} fungicide {{which controls}} powdery mildew diseases by interfering with germination and/or appressorium formation. Mutants of barley powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, which {{are resistant to}} <b>quinoxyfen</b> produce fewer conidia, which germinate and form appressoria more promiscuously than do the prolific numbers of wild-type spores. This suggests that resistance bypasses host recognition signals. RT-PCR profiles of signal transduction genes, recorded during wild-type germling morphogenesis, reveals that <b>quinoxyfen</b> alters the accumulation of Protein Kinase C (pkc), pkc-like and catalytic subunit of Protein Kinase A (cpka) transcripts. Differential display-reverse transcription PCR identified a gene transcript in wild-type conidia that was absent, or much less abundant, in conidia from quinoxyfen-resistant mutants. This mRNA was not detectable 24 h after wild-type conidia were inoculated on to barley. It encodes a GTPase activating protein (GAP), which may interact with a small molecular weight Ras-type GTP binding protein. In the presence of <b>quinoxyfen,</b> the gap mRNA remains throughout germling morphogenesis. The involvement of GAP in resistance suggests that <b>quinoxyfen</b> inhibits mildew infection by disrupting early cell signalling events...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Quinoxyfen</b> is {{a potent}} and {{effective}} fungicide, hitherto considered to control powdery mildew disease by perturbing signal transduction during early germling differentiation. The aim {{of this paper is}} to understand the mode of action of <b>quinoxyfen</b> by comparing the perception of host-derived signals and signal relay in a wild-type Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei EM Marchal (Bgh) (WT/IM 82) and a quinoxyfen-resistant field isolate (QR/ 2 B 11). RESULTS: QR/ 2 B 11 germinates more promiscuously on host-like and artificial surfaces than the quinoxyfen-sensitive WT/IM 82. The pivotal role of host cuticle deprivation in the formation of hooked appressorial germ tubes (hAGTs) in WT/IM 82 and a dramatic drop in germling differentiation in the presence of the mildewicide are demonstrated. QR/ 2 B 11 strain shows a dependence on host cuticle-like features for hAGT formation but no significant difference between germling differentiation in the presence or absence of <b>quinoxyfen.</b> PKC-inhibitor Ro 318220 induces morphological changes similar to those seen in quinoxyfen-treated germlings. PKC 1 transcript accumulation is equivalently upregulated by <b>quinoxyfen</b> in QR/ 2 B 11 and WT/IM 82 strains, but Bgh cutinase CUT 1 transcript is 8 times more abundant in QR/ 2 B 11 conidia than in WT/IM 82 conidia. <b>Quinoxyfen</b> inhibits serine esterase activity in WT/IM 82, but not in QR/ 2 B 11. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data suggest that <b>quinoxyfen</b> interferes with the perception of host-derived signals required for full germling differentiation, and that QR/ 2 B 11 bypasses the need for such signals. Moreover, <b>quinoxyfen</b> appears to target serine esterase activity, with a downstream perturbation in signal transduction; this represents the first demonstrable biochemical difference between the quinoxyfen-resistant and -sensitive isolates...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>Quinoxyfen,</b> a new {{pesticide}} against powdery mildew, on the fermentation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been evaluated. When vines (Montepulciano d’Abruzzo, Trebbiano and Sangiovese) {{were treated with}} doses recommended by the producer (30 mL/hL of a suspension concentrate 250 g/L), <b>Quinoxyfen</b> was detected up to the concentration of 0. 014 mg/L in the must. The S. cerevisiae growth parameters, μmax and lag phase, were not affected by this residual level during fermentation. However, in must fortified with <b>Quinoxyfen</b> to obtain the concentrations of 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 mg/L, {{a decrease in the}} lag phase was observed. The fermentation kinetics did not show any significant differences between the different treatments and control musts. Moreover, the production of volatiles during fermentation, determined with solid phase microextraction – capillary gas chromatography (SPME-GC), was not affected by the residual level of <b>Quinoxyfen.</b> Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the samples could be clustered according to the different yeast strains, regardless of the pesticide treatment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Quinoxyfen</b> {{is a new}} {{fungicide}} {{that belongs}} {{to the family of}} the quinolines, recently introduced to control powdery mildew (Uncinula necator). In this paper the fate of <b>quinoxyfen</b> residues from vine to wine and in their processing products was studied. After the last of four applications at the recommended rate, 0. 38 mg/kg of residue was found on the grapes, which is under the legal limit fixed in Italy (0. 5 mg/kg). The degradation rate was according to a pseudo-first-order kinetics (r = 0. 964) and the half-life was 7. 24 days. Vinification was carried out with and without maceration. During the vinifications without maceration < 50 % of the residues passed from the grapes to the musts. Separation of the lees (8 %) from the must by centrifugation caused no detectable residues in centrifuged must. At the end of fermentation with and without maceration no <b>quinoxyfen</b> residues were determinable in the wine. No effect on the alcoholic or malolactic fermentation was observed even in the presence of higher <b>quinoxyfen</b> concentrations than those found in the grapes at harvest time. During fermentation, the yeasts partially degraded the pesticides and completly adsorbed them. Bacteria, on the other hand, do not have any degradative effect on the pesticides. The raisins obtained by sun-drying did not contain any residues, whereas those obtained by oven-drying show the same amount of residues as in the fresh grapes. During the sun-drying process the fruit weight decreased by a factor of 4; the decrease in the oven-drying was equivalent. Samples of dregs and liquid lees, fortified with high levels of <b>quinoxyfen,</b> were double-distilled. The first dregs distillate, with an alcohol content of 32. 1 %, did not show any residues, whereas the first lees distillate, with an alcohol content of 34. 5 %, showed 7 % of the initial residues. After the second lees distillation, the obtained product showed an alcoholic content of 81. 2 % and no residues of <b>quinoxyfen</b> (< 0. 01 mg/kg) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Quinoxyfen</b> is a {{fungicide}} of the phenoxyquinoline class used {{to control}} powdery mildew, Uncinula necator (Schw.) Burr. Owing to its high persistence and strong sorption in soil, it could represent a risk for soil organisms if they are exposed at ecologically relevant concentrations. The objective {{of this paper is}} to predict the bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of <b>quinoxyfen</b> in earthworms, selected as a representative soil organism, and to assess the uncertainty in the estimation of this parameter. Three fields in each of four vineyards in southern and northern Italy were sampled over two successive years. Results: The measured BCFs varied over time, possibly owing to seasonal changes and the consequent changes in behaviour and ecology of earthworms. <b>Quinoxyfen</b> did not accumulate in soil, as the mean soil concentrations at the end of the 2 year monitoring period ranged from 9. 16 to 16. 0 μg kg - 1 dw for the Verona province and from 23. 9 to 37. 5 μg kg - 1 dw for the Taranto province, with up to eight applications per season. To assess the uncertainty of the BCF in earthworms, a probabilistic approach was used, firstly by building with weighted bootstrapping techniques a generic probabilistic density function (PDF) accounting for variability and incompleteness of knowledge. The generic PDF was then used to derive prior distribution functions, which, by application of Bayes' theorem, were updated with the new measurements and a posterior distribution was finally created. Conclusion: The study is a good example of probabilistic risk assessment. The means of mean and SD posterior estimates of log BCFworm (2. 06, 0. 91) are the 'best estimate values'. Further risk assessment of <b>quinoxyfen</b> and other phenoxyquinoline fungicides and realistic representative scenarios for modelling exercises required for future authorization and post-authorization requirements can now use this value as input. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|E

These {{pathogens}} rapidly colonize green tissues via asexual reproduction and can negatively affect host physiology. We conducted a field experiment {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of organic and synthetic fungicides (registered and experimental products) for control of powdery mildew in pumpkin cv. Sorcerer. Following six weeks of fungicide applications, disease incidence (percentage of infected leaves within a plot) and disease severity (colony density on the leaf surface) was generally lowest in plants treated with synthetic materials (<b>quinoxyfen,</b> penthiopyrad, triflumizole, and mixed programs of triflumizole/quinoxyfen, myclobutanil/quinoxyfen/ trifloxystrobin, and myclobutanil/penthiopyrad/ trifloxystrobin). ‘Soft-chemistry’ materials such as paraffinic oil, tea tree oil, hydrogen peroxide, and the biocontrol agent, Strepyomyces lydicus WYEC 108, were less effective at managing disease when used alone. However, tea tree oil and S. lydicus substantially reduced disease incidence and severity when used in a program with <b>quinoxyfen,</b> suggesting that good disease management can be maintained while significantly reducing use of synthetic fungicides...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew occurs {{annually}} on melons in Arizona. Podosphaera xanthii (Sphaerotheca fuliginea) is the plant pathogenic fungus that causes powdery mildew on cucurbits, such as cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, cucumber and squash. Development of powdery mildew on melons is favored by moderate temperatures and relative humidity, succulent plant growth and reduced light intensity {{brought about by}} a dense plant canopy. Existing products {{as well as some}} materials under development were evaluated and compared for efficacy in management of powdery mildew on cantaloupe in a field trial conducted during the spring of 2004 at the Yuma Valley Agricultural Center. A high level of disease had developed by the time this trial was terminated (June 10). Among treatments, the degree of powdery mildew suppression ranged from modest to essentially complete control. All treatments significantly reduced the severity of powdery mildew compared to untreated plants. Relative performance of treatments on the top of leaves differed from that on the underside of leaves. The better treatments among all tested fungicides included Bravo Ultrex, Cabrio, Cabrio alternated with Procure, Flint alternated with Bravo, Microthiol Disperss, Procure, Procure alternated with <b>Quinoxyfen,</b> <b>Quinoxyfen,</b> <b>Quinoxyfen</b> alternated with Topsin M, Rally, Topsin M+Microthiol Disperss, and Topsin M alternated with Cabrio.

40|$|Calculation of {{pesticide}} volatilization from plants {{as an integral}} component {{of pesticide}} fate models is of utmost importance, especially as part of PEC(predicted environmental concentrations) models used in the registration procedures for pesticides. A mechanistic approach using a laminar air-boundary layer concept to predict volatilization from plant surfaces was compared to data obtained in a wind-tunnel study after simultaneous application of parathion-methyl, fenpropimorph, and <b>quinoxyfen</b> to winter wheat. Parathion-methyl was shown to have the highest volatilization during the wind-tunnel study of 10 days (29. 2 %). Volatilization of <b>quinoxyfen</b> was about 15. 0 %, revealing a higher volatilization tendency than fenpropimorph (6. 0 %), which is attributed to enhanced penetration of fenpropimorph counteracting volatilization. Predictions of the boundary-layer approach were markedly influenced by the selected values for the equivalent thickness of the boundary layer and rate coefficients, thus indicating that future improvements of the approach will require {{a deeper understanding of}} the kinetics of the underlying processes, e. g. phototransformation and penetration. The boundary-layer volatilization module was included in the European registration model PELMO, enabling simultaneous calculation of volatilization from plants and soil.

Availability of original observations enabled individual participant data meta-analysis. Differences in control of powdery mildew on leaves and cones were apparent among fungicide FRAC groups when individual products were evaluated {{over the course of a}} growing season. FRAC groups 13, 3, and U 13 provided the most efficacious control of powdery mildew on leaves. Percent disease control on cones was influenced by midseason foliar disease and fungicide mode-of-action. FRAC 13 provided significantly better disease control on cones than all other groups except U 13, 3, and premixes of 7 with 11. Disease control on leaves was similar when a rotational program of fungicides was used, independent of the modes of action, but improved on cones if FRAC groups 13 and 3 were both included compared with programs consisting of FRAC groups 11 and 3, 11 and 5, or 3 and 5. Disease control on cones was improved from 32 to 52 %, on average, when the fungicide <b>quinoxyfen</b> (FRAC 13) was applied at least once during the early stages of cone development, defined in this analysis as 20 July to 10 August, as compared with all other treatments. Efficacy of disease control on cones by <b>quinoxyfen</b> was moderated by and interacted with the incidence of leaves with powdery mildew. Disease control on cones was further improved if two applications of <b>quinoxyfen</b> were made during this period. Collectively, these findings suggest that disease control during juvenile stages of cone development largely influences the success of fungicide programs and point to the critical importance of focusing management efforts during this stage of development, independent of what actual management strategy is employed...|$|E

40|$|Powdery mildew is an {{important}} disease in commerciall members of the cucumber family. The specific pathogen that infects cucurbits in California is Podosphaera fusca (synonyms: P. xanthii, Sphaerotheca fulginea and S. fusca), (Janousek et al. 2009, McGrath and Thomas 1996, Pérez-García et al. 2009). Over-wintering chasmothecia produce ascospores that then develop into whitish colonies on leaves, leaf petioles, and stems (McGrath and Thomas 1996, Glawe 2008). Wind or insect vectors disperse asexually-produced conidia and thus spread the disease (Blancard et al. 1994). Favorable conditions for disease epidemics include temperatures between 20 - 27 °C and lower-intensity light (McGrath and Thomas 1996). Disease outbreaks in the Central Valley of California tend to occur during late summer and autumn months, but coastal areas may be continuously threatened (Davey et al. 2008). Infections {{have the potential to}} reduce the yield and quality of fruit and can lead to early plant senescence (Blancard et al. 1994, McGrath and Thomas 1996). Disease management in cucurbits usually involves foliar applications of synthetic fungicides and/or use of disease resistant cultivars (McGrath and Thomas 1996). Fungicides such as azoxystrobin, myclobutanil, <b>quinoxyfen,</b> trifloxystrobin, triflumizole, and micronized sulfur can be used to treat plants (Davis et al. 2008). Sulfur has the advantage of little or no risk of selecting for resistant mildew strains (Blancard et al. 1994). Previous work in our lab has shown that <b>quinoxyfen,</b> triflumizole, and penthiopyrad are highly effective at managing powdery mildew in disease susceptible varieties (Janousek et al. 2007, 2009).

40|$|Powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera aphanis) {{and leaf}} blotch (caused by Gnomoniopsis fructicola) are {{important}} diseases of strawberry in nursery and fruit production regions of Australia. Myclobutanil, trifloxystrobin and penthiopyrad are registered {{for control of}} powdery mildew in Australia, but are not restricted to either nursery or fruit production. Due to the specific mode of action of these fungicides against P. aphanis, their repeated use over the successive stages of strawberry runner and then fruit production may {{increase the risk of}} fungicide resistance in the pathogen. Currently, there is no fungicide registered for control of G. fructicola in strawberry in Australia. A series of field trials in Queensland and Victorian strawberry nurseries over two seasons (2013 / 14 to 2014 / 15) evaluated the efficacy of 19 fungicide and biorational products, applied alone or as part of a program (in combination with other products), against powdery mildew and leaf blotch. Our aim was to manage the risk of fungicide resistance by developing disease control programs specifically for use in the strawberry runner nurseries with different activity groups to the fungicides used in strawberry fruit production. Treatments were applied weekly using a knapsack sprayer starting December/January for approximately 16 weeks until prior to harvest of runners in March/April. Runners were randomly selected and rated for the incidence of powdery mildew and leaf blotch prior to harvest. Where single fungicide treatments were applied (2013 / 14), the field trial results identified bupirimate, cyflufenamid, <b>quinoxyfen,</b> proquinazid, azoxystrobin + difenoconazole, as equally or more effective in controlling powdery mildew as the industry standard program of sulphur, myclobutanil and trifloxystrobin.

40|$|Simulation of {{pesticide}} volatilization from plant and soil surfaces {{as an integral}} component {{of pesticide}} fate models is of utmost importance, especially {{as part of the}} PEC (Predicted Environmental Concentrations) models used in the registration procedures for pesticides. Experimentally determined volatilization rates at different scales were compared to model predictions to improve recent approaches included in European registration models. To assess the influence of crucial factors affecting volatilization under well-defined conditions, a laboratory chamber was set-up and validated. Aerodynamic conditions were adjusted to fulfill the requirements of the German guideline on assessing pesticide volatilization for registration purposes. Determination of soil moisture profiles of the upper soil layer illustrated that a defined water content in the soil up to a depth of 4 cm could be achieved by water-saturation of the air. Cumulative volatilization of 14 C-parathion-methyl ranged from 2. 4 % under dry conditions to 32. 9 % under moist conditions revealing a clear dependence of volatilization on the water content in the top layer. At the semi-field scale, volatilization rates were determined in a wind-tunnel study after soil surface application of pesticides to gleyic cambisol. The following descending order of cumulative volatilization was observed: chlorpyrifos > parathion-methyl > terbuthylazine > fenpropimorph. Parameterization of the models PEARL (Pesticide Emission Assessment at Regional and Local Scales) and PELMO (Pesticide Leaching Model) was performed to mirror the experimental boundary conditions. Model predictions deviated markedly from measured volatilization fluxes and showed limitations of current volatilization models, such as the uppermost compartment thickness having an enormous influence on predicted volatilization losses. Moreover, the impact of soil moisture on volatilization from soil was not reflected by the model calculations. Improvements of PELMO, including the temperature-dependence of water-air partitioning, the reduction of the compartment size of the top layer and the introduction of a moisture-dependent sorption coefficient, contributed to a more realistic reflection of experimental findings, especially at the initial stage of the studies. Studies on volatilization from plants included a field study and a wind-tunnel study after simultaneous application of parathion-methyl, fenpropimorph and <b>quinoxyfen</b> to winter wheat. Par hion-methyl was shown to have the highest volatilization during the wind-tunnel study of 10 days (29. 2 %). Volatilization of <b>quinoxyfen</b> was about 15. 0 %, indicating a higher volatilization tendency in comparison with fenpropimorph (6. 0 %), which may be attributed to enhanced penetration of fenpropimorph counteracting the volatilization process. A mechanistic approach using a laminar air-boundary layer concept for the consideration of volatilization from plant surfaces was adjusted and calibrated {{on the basis of a}} series of wind-tunnel studies. Calibration of the thickness of the air-boundary layer and the rate coefficients of phototransformation and penetration into the leaves allowed the implementation of this description in PELMO and enabled the simultaneous estimation of volatilization from plants and soil. The need to determine critical factors affecting volatilization, especially phase partitioning coefficients, resulted in the development and validation of a novel chamber system for measurements of the temperature dependence of the soil-air partitioning of fenpropimorph.

Several other treatments resulted in a low mean disease severity rating (1 to 5 mildew colonies per leaf), including Quinoxyfen+Actigard, Rally+Actigard, Flint alternated with Bravo, Microthiol Disperss, Bravo, <b>Quinoxyfen,</b> Rally, Flint alternated with Bravo, Flint+Reason+Bond, Topsin M, Quadris+Latron B- 1956, Flint+Actigard, Flint, Topsin+Trilogy, Kaligreen+No Foam A, Quadris+Latron B- 1956 alternated with Actigard, Quadris+Latron B- 1956 +Actigard, and Pristine. Multiple applications of a single compound are included in these trials to gather information on the relative efficacy of each separate chemistry over a multi-year period. Among tested products, several are registered for use in Arizona for control of powdery mildew on melons. The use of a mixture or rotation among efficacious chemistries with different modes of action will help to inhibit the development of insensitivity by the pathogen to {{one or more of these}} active ingredients...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado, Qualidade em Análises, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2016 Water is a {{fundamental}} resource for human life, {{as well as for}} other organisms. Pesticides {{are one of the most}} critical group of components that can contaminate rivers and lakes, affecting the quality of water. EPAL, as the public water company of Lisbon, is responsible for monitoring the water quality, analyzing microbiological, inorganic and organic parameters in water, according to the established water legislation. However, new compounds are always being added to the legislation whenever it is revised. It is necessary to develop new analytical methods to cover the monitoring of these new added compounds. That is the case of some of the compounds of this study. Therefore, an analytical method was developed, optimized and validated for the analysis of organic components (pesticides) in different water matrices by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The list of pesticides studied is composed by: biphenyl, dicofol, chlorpyrifos, aclonifen, <b>quinoxyfen,</b> cybutryne and the isomers of cypermethrine (alpha-cypermethrine, beta-cypermethrine, theta-cypermethrine and zeta-cypermethrine). In order to concentrate and extract the pesticides from the water sample, two different extractions techniques - liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) - were tested. The results showed that LLE gave successful recovery values, while the extraction using SPE showed many problems. Different tests were carried out in order to solve the problems and to optimize the extraction procedure, such as matrix effect, salting-out or sodium thiosulfate tests. The method was validated, studying the working range, linearity, selectivity, precision, trueness and, LOD and LOQ. Uncertainty of the method was estimated following two different models, bottom-up and top down approach. Then, these results were compared with the limits set by the legislation for drinking and surface water, concluding that the method is effective for the analysis of these pesticides in drinking water and for some of them is also effective for their analysis in surface water, within the limits established by the legislation...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Grapevine trunk {{diseases}} {{are responsible for}} reduced wine and table grape production world-wide. Trunk disease infections are caused by xylem-inhabiting pathogens which include species of Botryosphaeriaceae, Diatrypaceae, Hymenochaetales and Diaporthales, as well as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp. Winter pruning wounds are regarded as the main infection-sites for trunk disease pathogens. However, the role of sucker wounds as portals of trunk disease infections has been minimally investigated. Knowledge of the potential role of grapevine trunk pathogen infections that occur through sucker wounds is important for better wound protection strategies. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the role of grapevine sucker wounds as portals of entry for trunk disease pathogens and to assess the use of Trichoderma spp. for sucker wound protection. The susceptibility of sucker wounds to different trunk disease pathogens was assessed from natural as well as artificial infections. In addition the duration of sucker wound susceptibility in the field was also ascertained. Sucker wounds were sampled from three wine and two table grape vineyards during 2011 and 2012 in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Thereafter, fungal isolations were made from 161 sucker wounds and the cultures were identified based on cultural and morphological characteristics as well as the internal transcribed spacer regions and 5. 8 S ribosomal RNA gene. Sixty-two percent of the wounds were naturally infected by at least one of the trunk pathogens. Phomopsis (Po.) viticola (46 %; 18 %), Diplodia (D.) seriata (30 %; 9 %) and Phaeomoniella (Ph.) chlamydospora (27 %; 5 %) were the most predominant trunk disease pathogens isolated from sucker wounds of field wine and table grape cultivars, respectively. Lower incidences of Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (18 %), Eutypella sp. (3 %), Cryptovalsa ampelina (2 %), Diplodia sp. (1 %) and Neofusicoccum australe (1 %) were obtained, however, only from wine grapes. Sucker wounds on 1 -year-old potted grapevine plants of Chardonnay cultivar were inoculated with spore suspensions of Eutypa lata, N. parvum, Pa. aleophilum, Ph. chlamydospora and Po. viticola in the glasshouse. After 4 months all the inoculated pathogens could be re-isolated at the following incidences: N. parvum (85 %), Ph. chlamydospora (75 %), Po. viticola (65 %), Pa. aleophilum (55 %) and E. lata (45 %). Sucker wound susceptibility was further ascertained under field conditions on 12 -year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines by artificial inoculation of the same pathogen species. After 5 months three pathogens could be re-isolated at the following incidences: Po. viticola (65 %), N. parvum (32. 5 %) and Ph. chlamydospora (7. 5 %). The duration of susceptibility of field sucker wounds to Ph. chlamydospora was assessed for a period of 4 weeks. The wounds remained susceptible for 4 weeks with a decline in susceptibility after one week. This study showed that sucker wounds are susceptible to the major trunk disease pathogens and thus could play an important role in grapevine trunk disease epidemiology. In the second part of this thesis a possible management strategy to prevent infections of sucker wounds was investigated. The use of Trichoderma (T.) harzianum against two trunk pathogens on sucker wounds was tested in the field. Additionally the sensitivity of T. harzianum and T. atroviride was tested in vitro against 16 fungicides that are used to control powdery mildew, downy mildew, Botrytis rot and Phomopsis cane and leaf spot. In October 2012, sucker wounds were made on 1 -year-old wood of Cabernet Sauvignon and spray-treated with Eco- 77 ® immediately after desuckering, and then inoculated with spore suspensions of either Ph. chlamydospora or Po. viticola after 24 hours. After 5 months, isolations were made from the sucker wounds to evaluate the efficacy of the Trichoderma treatment. Trichoderma harzianum reduced the incidence of Ph. chlamydospora by 66. 65 %. Although the incidence of Po. viticola was reduced by 15. 37 %, it was not significantly different from the control treatment. The inhibition of mycelial growth and conidial germination of T. harzianum and T. atroviride were screened against 16 fungicides. The fungicides were applied at 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1 and 2 times the recommended dosages. Systemic fungicides boscalid, metrafenone and trifloxystrobin, as well as contact fungicides <b>quinoxyfen</b> and meptyldinocap were least toxic to Trichoderma spp. isolates. For the conidial germination assay, boscalid, trifloxystrobin, penconazole and metrafenone (systemic) plus <b>quinoxyfen</b> and folpet (contact) were compatible with Trichoderma spp. These fungicides were regarded as being compatible with Trichoderma spp. isolates because they gave mean percentage inhibitions of less than 50 % at all the tested dosages. Spiroxamine and pyrimethanil gave the highest mean percentage inhibitions for both mycelial inhibition and conidial germination. The findings of this study showed that T. harzianum can protect sucker wounds against Ph. chlamydospora in the field. Furthermore, some fungicides applied for the control of powdery mildew and Phomopsis cane and leaf spot can be alternatively or simultaneously applied with T. harzianum and T. atroviride, however, this will have to be verified with field trials. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Wingerd stamsiektes is wêreldwyd verantwoordelik vir verminderde wyn- en tafeldruif produksie. Stamsiektes word veroorsaak deur patogene wat in die xileem voorkom, insluitend verskeie spesies in die Botryosphaeriaceae, Diatrypaceae, Hymenochaetales en Diaporthales, asook Phaeomoniella chlamydospora en Phaeoacremonium spp. Winter snoeiwonde word beskou as die hoof bron van infeksies vir stamsiekte patogene. Die rol van suierwonde as poorte van infeksie vir stamsiektes is nog nie goed bestudeer nie. Kennis van die potensiële rol van wingerd stamsiekte patogeen infeksies wat deur suierwonde plaasvind is belangrik vir die formulasie van beter wondbeskerming strategieë. Die mikpunt van hierdie studie was om die rol van suierwonde as ingangsportale vir wingerd stamsiekte patogene te bepaal en om die gebruik van Trichoderma spp. vir suierwond beskerming te evalueer. Die vatbaarheid van suierwonde vir verskillende stamsiekte patogene is geëvalueer vanuit natuurlike, sowel as kunsmatige infeksies. Die duur van suierwond vatbaarheid in die veld is ook bepaal. Suierwonde is versamel vanuit drie wyn- en twee tafeldruif wingerde gedurende 2011 en 2012 in die Wes Kaap provinsie van Suid Afrika. Hierna is swam isolasies gemaak vanuit 161 suierwonde en die kulture is geïdentifiseer volgens kultuur en morfologiese kenmerke, sowel as die interne transkribeerde spasieerders en 5. 8 S ribosomale RNA geen. Twee-en-sestig persent van die wonde was geïnfekteer deur ten minste een van die stamsiekte patogene. Phomopsis (Po.) viticola (46 %; 18 %), Diplodia (D.) seriata (30 %; 9 %) en Phaeomoniella (Ph.) chlamydospora (27 %; 5 %) was die mees algemene stamsiekte patogene wat, respektiewelik, vanuit die wyn- en tafeldruif kultivars verky is. Laer hoeveelhede Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (18 %), Eutypella sp. (3 %), Cryptovalsa ampelina (2 %), Diplodia sp. (1 %) en Neofusicoccum australe (1 %) is verkry, en slegs vanaf wyndruiwe. Suierwonde op 1 -jaar oue Chardonnay wingerdplante in potte is in die glashuis geïnokuleer met spoorsuspensies van Eutypa lata, N. parvum, Pa. aleophilum, Ph. chlamydospora en Po. viticola. Na 4 maande kon al die geïnokuleerde patogene her-isoleer word teen die volgende hoeveelhede: N. parvum (85 %), Ph. chlamydospora (75 %), Po. viticola (65 %), Pa. aleophilum (55 %) en E. lata (45 %). Suierwond vatbaarheid is verder geëvalueer onder veld kondisies op 12 -jaar oue Cabernet Sauvignon plante deur kunsmatige inokulasie van die selfde patogeen spesies. Na 5 maande kon drie patogene her-isoleer word teen die volgende hoeveelhede: Po. viticola (65 %), N. parvum (32. 5 %) en Ph. chlamydospora (7. 5 %). Die duur van vatbaarheid van suierwonde teen Ph. chlamydospora in die veld is geevalueer oor ‘n periode van 4 weke. Die wonde het vatbaar gebly vir 4 weke met ‘n afname in vatbaarheid na ‘n week. Hierdie studie demonstreer dat suierwonde vatbaar is vir die hoof wingerd stamsiektes en dus ‘n belangrike rol in die epidemiologie van wingerd stamsiektes kan speel. In die tweede deel van hierdie tesis is ‘n moontlike bestuurs-strategie ondersoek om infeksie van suierwonde te verhoed. Die gebruik van Trichoderma (T.) harzianum teen twee stampatogene op suierwonde is getoets in die veld. Verder is die in vitro sensitiwiteit van T. harzianum en T. atroviride getoets teen 16 fungisiedes wat gebruik word in die beheer van poeieragtige meeldou, donsskimmel, Botrytis vrot en Phomopsis streepvlek. Gedurende Oktober 2012 is suierwonde gemaak op 1 -jaar oue hout van Cabernet Sauvignon en onmiddelik behandel met Eco- 77 ® na suiering. Wonde is dan geïnokuleer met spoorsuspensies van óf Ph. chlamydospora óf Po. viticola na 24 uur. Na 5 maande is isolasies gemaak vanaf suierwonde om die doeltreffendheid van van die Trichoderma behandeling te evalueer. Trichoderma harzianum het die voorkoms van Ph. chlamydospora met 66. 65 % verminder. Alhoewel die voorkoms van Po. viticola verminder is met 15. 37 %, was dit nie ‘n beduidende verskil in vergelyking met die kontrole behandeling nie. Die inhibisie van miselium groei en konidia ontkieming van T. harzianum en T. atroviride is getoets teen 16 fungisiedes. Die fungisiedes is aangewend teen 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1 en 2 keer die aanbevole dosisse. Sistemiese fungisiedes boscalid, metrafenone en trifloxystrobin, sowel as kontak fungisiedes <b>quinoxyfen</b> en meptyldinocap was die minste toksies teen Trichoderma spp. Gedurende die konidia ontkiemingstoets was boscalid, trifloxystrobin, penconazole en metrafenone (sistemies) en <b>quinoxyfen</b> en folpet (kontak) versoenbaar met Trichoderma spp. Die fungisiedes is beskou as bruikbaar met Trichoderma spp. isolate omdat hulle gemiddelde persentasie inhibisies van minder as 50 % teen al die getoetste dosisse gelewer het. Spiroxamine en pyrimethanil het die hoogste gemiddelde persentasie inhibisie gelewer vir beide die miselium inhibisie en konidia ontkieming. Die bevindings van hierdie studie het gewys dat T. harzianum suierwonde kan beskerm teen Ph. chlamydospora in die veld. Verder sou sommige fungisiedes wat aangewend word vir die bestuur van poeieragtige meeldou en streepvlek moontlik alternatiewelik of gelyktydig met T. harzianum en T. atroviride aangewend word, alhowel dit met veldproewe bevestig moet word...|$|E
40|$|Powdery mildew is an economically-important {{pathogen}} {{of grapes}} worldwide. This report details {{the findings of}} our annual powdery mildew fungicide trials on grapevine cultivar Chardonnay (Vitis vinifera). The trials were conducted at Herzog Ranch, near Courtland, California in 2009. Treatments were placed in five adjacent trials in the vineyard. Spraying commenced in mid April, shortly after a heavy rainfall event that likely promoted the release of powdery mildew (Uncinula necator) ascospores from overwintering chasmothecia. Spraying was completed in mid July and treatments were evaluated for disease incidence and severity on 21 July 2009, at about the beginning of veraison. Trial I consisted of IR- 4 -funded biofungicide research that focused on two products: caprylic acid (a novel control agent in current development) and Actinovate (a registered product containing the bacterium Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 106). Trials II-V included various fungicide products (either currently registered or {{in various stages of}} product development) including strobilurins, demethylase inhibitors, oils, and other materials. Spray frequencies varied from weekly applications to 21 day intervals. Temperatures were mild during much of the 2009 growing season, providing optimal conditions for the asexual reproduction and dispersal of powdery mildew. Risk index data was high from about mid-May {{through the rest of the}} evaluation period and the pathogen quickly colonized leaves. Disease pressure was higher than in similar trials conducted in 2007 or 2008. By mid-June, heavy to severe mildew was evident on untreated clusters. Treatment performances varied widely. Biological fungicides generally reduced disease severity, but were more effective when used in a combination program with synthetic materials. As a stand-alone product, caprylic acid was most effective when applied weekly at a concentration of 0. 3 % (v/v). At a concentration of 0. 5 % it consistently showed phytotoxic effects on berries. A few organic materials performed well, lowering disease severity to < 10 %: paraffinic oil + Foliar Supreme (sulfur + nutrient cocktail) and two types of fertilizers alternated with trifloxystrobin. Among synthetic products, difenoconzaole + cyprodinil, flutriafol, fluopyram, fluopyram + tebuconazole, <b>quinoxyfen</b> + alcohol ethoxylate (an adjuvant), various GWN 4617 treatments, picoxystrobin, penthiopyrad, boscalid + pyraclostrobin alternated with triflumizole, and metrafenone gave good to excellent control of disease severity on fruit. These trials easily separate highly effective materials from those which give only moderate control of powdery mildew, however long-term assessment of treatment efficacy is best evaluated with experiments conducted at multiple locations, across several growing seasons, and on multiple grape cultivars...|$|E
40|$|Until {{recently}} strawberries {{grown in}} the United Kingdom were grown in open fields, the plants and fruit {{were exposed to the}} British weather. This resulted in a short 6 week harvest period where the fruit was often damaged by rain and infected by Botrytis cinerea. Strawberry growers started to use polythene tunnels to extend the cropping season, protect the fruit from rain damage and reduce the incidence of infection by B. cinerea. However the conditions produced by the polythene tunnels were ideal for the growth and development of Podosphaera aphanis (strawberry powdery mildew). Growers are now under pressure from the retailers {{to reduce the amount of}} fungicides that they use to control P. aphanis. The symptoms related to P. aphanis infection have been identified (leaf cupping, visible mycelium and red blotches) and a progression has been established: From the symptom progression two new s~ring methods for the identification of P. aphanis infections were developed wmch have greater relevance to current cultivation methods than the previous method. The source of initial inoculum for newly planted and established sites was identified. The inoculum was planted into new sites on the plants coming from the propagators and overwintering on plants within established sites. This was contrary to what the growers believed. They were basing their early season tunnel management on keeping the perceived air borne infection out of their tunnels. A rule based prediction system has been developed that has the potential to reduce the number of fungicide applications applied by the growers. The prediction system ensures that fungicide applications are not applied too close together. Potassium Bicarbonate has been shown to provide comparable control of P. aphanis to that achieved with Systhane (Myclobutanil). Significantly better control of P. aphanis was achieved using a new (at the time) product, Fortress (<b>Quinoxyfen).</b> There were significant differences in the resistance ?????????to infection by P. aphanis displayed by different cultivars of strawberry. Elsanta, the cultivar favoured by the retailers was not one of the most resistant. Control of inoculum. already present on plants as they are being planted could be achieved by dipping the plant in Systhane. Growers are under considerable pressure from the retailers to reduce the amount of fungicides used to control P. aphanis. Growers could achieve this by implementing the recommendations made in this report...|$|E
40|$|This report {{collects}} {{information on}} chemical analytical methods {{for the analysis}} of the new proposed priority substances (PS) of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and some existing PS for which the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) have been changed under the first review of the PS list. First, analytical “standard” methods (ISO, CEN, US EPA) were searched. Then, the EU Member States (MS) were asked via the Chemical Monitoring and Emerging Pollutants (CMEP) expert group to provide validated “in-house methods” used as a national reference and to report their limits of detection (LODs) or quantification (LOQs). Finally, published literature articles were searched to get an overview of today’s analytical performance. Compliance monitoring for the WFD requires the achievement of a LOQ equal or below a value of 30 % of the relevant EQS. The achieved method limits of quantification (LOQs) are therefore compared with 30 % of the EQS, which is 0. 3 × EQS. Very low annual average AA-EQS values in the picogram-per-liter (pg/l) concentration range have been set for several of the new proposed PS: For Cypermethrin 80 pg/l (8 pg/l for coastal salt waters), for Dichlorvos 60 pg/l in coastal waters, for Dicofol 32 pg/l in coastal waters, for 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol 35 pg/l (7 pg/l in coastal waters), for 17 -beta-estradiol 80 pg/l in coastal waters, and for Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide 0. 2 pg/l (10 fg/l in coastal waters). Dicofol and Heptachlor/-Heptachlorepoxide, for which biota EQS have been set (biota EQS: 33 µg/kg, and 6. 7 ng/kg, respectively), however, are intended to be analysed in biota. Moreover, a very challenging water EQS has been set for the already existing PS Brominated Diphenylethers (BDEs) (49 femtogram-per-liter (fg/l), and 2. 4 fg/l in coastal waters). However, it is intended that BDEs be analysed in biota (EQS: 8. 5 ng/kg). In addition, the water EQS for Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been lowered to 0. 17 ng/l, and a biota EQS of 2 - 10 µg/kg added, which is more easy to reach. In general, {{it is very difficult to}} reach with currently available analytical instruments LOQs in the low pg/l concentration range. A possibility could be the use of gas chromatography (GC) with high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). This technique, however, is not generally available in normal water monitoring laboratories. Also in the field of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), instruments with improved sensitivity have become available in the last years. Moreover, lower LOQs can be achieved by extracting higher volumes of water (10 - 1000 liters). These large-volume techniques, however, are very work and time intensive, and very costly, and are therefore not useful for routine WFD compliance monitoring (analysis of one sample per month). The most challenging substances proposed as new PS are: Cypermethrin (EQS: 80 pg/l, and 8 pg/l for coastal salt waters), Dichlorvos (EQS: 60 pg/l in coastal waters), 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EQS: 35 pg/l, and 7 pg/l in coastal waters), and 17 -beta-estradiol (EQS: 0. 4 ng/l, and 80 pg/l in coastal waters). Dicofol, Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, Heptachlor/Heptachlorepoxide, Hexabromo-cyclododecane (HBCDD), Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and the BDEs are intended to be analysed in biota. Minor analytical problems could be encountered for the following substances: Aclonifen (EQS: 0. 12 µg/l, and 12 ng/l for coastal salt waters), Bifenox (EQS: 12 ng/l, and 1. 2 ng/l for coastal waters), Cybutryne (=Irgarol) (EQS: 2. 5 ng/l), Diclofenac (EQS: 0. 10 µg/l, and 10 ng/l for coastal waters), <b>Quinoxyfen</b> (EQS: 0. 15 µg/l, and 15 ng/l for coastal waters), and Terbutryn (EQS: 65 ng/l, and 6. 5 ng/l for coastal waters).
