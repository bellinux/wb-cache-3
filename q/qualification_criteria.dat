Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from {{a cross between a}} Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee that judges stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The <b>qualification</b> <b>criteria</b> involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E

40|$|The {{state of}} Nevada passed {{legislation}} in 2009 that abolished deficiency judgments for purchase mortgage loans made after October 1, 2009, and collateralized by primary single-family homes. In this paper, we study how {{this change in}} the law affected equilibrium mortgage lending. Using unique mortgage loan-level application data and a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the <b>qualification</b> <b>criterion,</b> we find that the law change led to a decline in equilibrium loan sizes of about 1 to 2 percent. There exists some evidence that mortgage approval rates also decreased for the affected loan applications. These results suggest that making the deficiency judgment law more default friendly in Nevada generated material cost on borrowers at the time of mortgage origination...|$|R

40|$|This {{publication}} {{describes the}} implementation {{and integration of}} a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL- 3) unit within a drug discovery environment into a public multi-tenant and multi-user complex of buildings. The manuscript {{is intended to be}} used as guidance for any owners/users willing to build a laboratory unit of this type, including all steps from design to registration and certification. The goal of integrating a BSL- 3 laboratory, according to international standards, with a drug development unit and an animal facility for infection studies, in a mixed multi-user and multi-tenant building, under circumstances where biosafety legislation is still under development, can lead to a complex situation with conflicting demands and expectations of the involved parties and the public. To solve the potential conflicts, an innovative approach was chosen to optimize the design of the laboratory (basing the safety concept on user requirements and <b>qualifications</b> <b>criteria,</b> and developing technical solutions in compliance with a consensus of the most relevant international biosafety regulations). We describe here the BSL- 3 unit set-up, built for the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), whic...|$|R

25|$|Also {{significant}} in the UK are the two regional tournaments – Northern Cup and Southern Cup. Having being originally devised as independently organised tournaments by Keele University Quidditch Club and Southampton Quidditch Club respectively in March and November 2014, the inaugural tournaments were won by Bangor Broken Broomsticks and Radcliffe Chimeras. The tournaments were then taken over by QuidditchUK, to ensure consistency between the two, as the tournaments are now used as <b>qualification</b> <b>criteria</b> for the European Quidditch Cup. The second Northern Cup {{took place on the}} 31st October-1 November 2015, and was won by Nottingham Nightmares, who defeated Durhamstrang in the final. The second Southern Cup took place on the 14-15 November and was won by the Radcliffe Chimeras, who defeated Warwick Quidditch Club in the final. The following year, the Velociraptors won Northern and Warwick Quidditch Club Southern. The top three teams from each regional tournament (from Northern: the Velociraptors, Durhamstrang, and Tornadoes Quidditch Club and from Southern: Warwick Quidditch Club, Werewolves of London, and Brizzlebears) qualified for the European Quidditch Cup which will take place on the 25-26 March 2017.|$|E

You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new <b>qualification</b> <b>criteria</b> as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

40|$|Before new {{equipment}} for handling of EUV reticles can be used, {{it should be}} shown that the apparatus is qualified for operating at a sufficiently clean level. TNO developed a qualification procedure that is separated into two parts: reticle handling and transport qualification and the qualification of the equipment. A statistical method was developed to include {{the results of the}} handling and transport qualification into the <b>qualification</b> <b>criterion</b> for the equipment. As a result we are able to calculate the minimum required experimental effort to prove that the particle contamination levels of the equipment are within the requirements. The qualification procedure was applied to the TNO EUV reticle load port module of the HamaTech MaskTrack Pro cleaning tool. A Particle per Reticle Pass (PRP) between 0. 005 and 0. 076 for particles ≥ 80 nm was measured for the reticle load port module including handling and transport contribution. However, a high number of particles were found in the transport test. As a result a much higher number of repeat cycles (more than a factor 6) were required to reduce the confidence interval. Therefore, elimination of the transport step is absolutely required for a good qualification procedure. This can be obtained by placing the inspection tool close to the equipment to be qualified. In this way, the required experimental effort can be reduced significantly, saving both machine time and costs. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) ...|$|R
40|$|The purpose o f {{the paper}} is to offer a closer view on the Italian {{agricultural}} enterprise to the Polish reader. This attempt is well justified because contrary to Polish law, which does not even distinguish an agricultural enterprise as a separate category, the Italian regulation in the above aspect presents the highest level o f development, {{has a long tradition}} and it is built up with deepened theoretical thoughts. The deliberations are proceeded by an analysis o f the conditions and principles of agricultural activity as a business activity (an enterprise) arising from articles 2082 and 2135 o f the Italian civil code as well as from various doctrinaire stances on this issue. Furthermore, the reasons and results o f the distinguished agricultural enterprise category are discussed, i. e. factors which determine a particular weakness of the agricultural activity and a special privileged legal status o f such an enterprise that makes it so distinct from other sectors o f the economy. The main deliberations are focused on the so-called primary agricultural activities of an agricultural enterprise which, according to article 2135 o f the Italian civil code, are soil cultivation, forestry and animal husbandry. Within that scope, a thorough analysis is being provided of the <b>qualification</b> <b>criterion</b> o f such activities and their character.
