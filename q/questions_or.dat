Together, the diaries and the fanforum display delayeddialogs {{in which the}} artists and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings. Fripp's public writing of his diary has {{challenged}} his readers to become more active listeners and intelligent participants in performances of music.|$|E
5|$|Members {{who wish}} to ask general or themed <b>{{questions}},</b> <b>or</b> questions of the First Minister, must lodge them with parliamentary clerks beforehand and selections are made by the Presiding Officer. Written questions may also be submitted by members to ministers. Written questions and answers are published in the Official Report.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between the Assembly and the Council and the competencies of each were {{for the most part}} not explicitly defined. Each body could deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the League or affecting peace in the world. Particular <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> tasks might be referred to either.|$|E

5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> solves {{problems}} about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943, Landis agreed {{after some}} persuasion that black sportswriter Sam Lacy {{should make a}} case for {{integration}} of organized baseball before the owners' annual meeting. Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure due to his affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis's suggestion, did not ask him any <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> begin any discussion with him.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{hired an}} {{experienced}} trial lawyer, Thomas Fitch, as defense counsel. Wyatt {{testified that he}} drew his gun only after Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury went for their pistols. He detailed the Earps' previous troubles with the Clantons and McLaurys and explained that they intended to disarm the cowboys. He said they fired in self defense. Fitch managed to produce testimony from prosecution witnesses during cross-examination that was contradictory, or appeared to dodge his <b>questions,</b> <b>or</b> in which they {{said they could not}} remember.|$|E
5000|$|There is a catch, though. Sam {{is allowed}} to ask three {{questions}} {{in regard to the}} Devil's powers, and then pose either a <b>question</b> <b>or</b> a task; if the demon cannot answer said <b>question</b> <b>or</b> perform said task, Sam's soul is spared. Sam asks, [...] "Really?", which the demon counts as a question.|$|R

5|$|Geneforges {{dialogue}} is delivered through on-screen text. Encounters with intelligent creations or humans {{result in the}} player being given a series of pre-determined <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> responses. Conversation options and the outcome of those conversations change according to the player's previous interactions. as well as which quests have been completed; which items the player has; which group the player belongs to and the player's leadership skill. The player can collect items from defeated enemies and the game environments to improve their own equipment. Non-player characters can trade with the player, buying most items regardless of type. The shopkeeper has a fixed amount of gold {{at the start of}} the game which does not replenish itself. It is possible for the player to drain all shopkeepers of their gold reserves, making it impossible to sell further items.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind {{begins with}} the player's character, having been imprisoned, {{arriving}} in Morrowind by boat {{in order to be}} pardoned. This is a common introductory segment throughout the main installments of the series. A tutorial depicting the prisoner's release moves the player through the process of character creation. The player is successively asked questions by a fellow prisoner, an officer, and a bureaucrat as the player is registered as a free citizen; choosing, in the process, the player character's name, race, gender, class, and birthsign. These affect the player's starting attributes, skills, and abilities. The player then determines their class in one of three ways; Picking from a class list, randomly generating a class via <b>questions,</b> <b>or</b> creating a custom class themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{reality is}} that even though most {{organizational}} work processes are largely designed around documentation, much remains unrecorded, especially that to do with decision-making. The record often reflects the desire to gloss over disagreements and serious <b>questions,</b> <b>or</b> the desire to sell or excuse.|$|E

However, he was greatly supported throughout {{by a member of}} the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study showed}} that emotionally arousing stories {{generally}} predicted better memory recall than stories which were less so. Subjects who read or listened to these arousing stories were less able to remember the details in response to multiple choice <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> in free recall when they {{had been given a}} dose of propranolol prior to the story exposure.|$|E
25|$|Camp Nelson National Cemetery is {{overseen by}} one {{cemetery}} director. The director and one administrative assistant {{work in the}} office, communicating with families and funeral homes to schedule funeral services and burials, coordinate with various agencies for the annual ceremonies, maintain records, and to answer <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> address concerns made by the general public. The staff includes six full-time cemetery caretakers, though the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) hires temporary workers almost every summer to augment the staff by about fifty percent. These caretakers prepare graves with a backhoe or hand held tools (pick and shovel), take custody of and transport a casket to its grave, lower the casket into the grave, seal it within a burial vault, and fill in the grave. Caretakers also receive delivered headstones, set and align them {{at the head of}} the appropriate graves, and maintain the grounds; duties include cutting the grass, pruning trees, clearing the roads of leaves in the autumn and snow in the winter, preparing the funeral shelter for services, disposing of litter, and interacting with the public to answer <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> find graves.|$|E

25|$|Khrushchev {{read from}} a {{prepared}} report and no stenographic {{record of the}} closed session was kept. No <b>questions</b> <b>or</b> debate followed Khrushchev's presentation and delegates left the hall {{in a state of}} acute disorientation. That same evening the delegates of foreign Communist parties were called to the Kremlin and given the opportunity to read the prepared text of the Khrushchev speech, which was treated as a top secret state document.|$|E
25|$|Businesses {{across the}} {{province}} also {{stepped forward to}} help. Among them, ATB Financial offered to defer mortgage and loan payments for affected residents, while a Calgary-based rental company offered 50 rental suites in Edmonton to displaced residents free of charge for three months.

25|$|Administering the Test: HTP {{is given}} to persons above {{the age of three}} and takes {{approximately}} 150 minutes to complete based on the person's level of mental functioning. During the first phase, the test-taker is asked to draw the house, tree, and person and the test-giver asks questions each picture. There are 60 questions originally designed by Buck but art therapists and trained test administrators can also design their own <b>questions,</b> <b>or</b> ask follow up questions. This phase is done with a crayon.|$|E
