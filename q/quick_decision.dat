5|$|Discussions between ESRO and Norwegian {{authorities}} continued, with ESRO {{pressing for}} a <b>quick</b> <b>decision,</b> while Norway was stalling the negotiations. This {{was carried out}} to allow time to develop solid counter-policy against the Soviet Union {{as well as to}} gain support for the installation to be located at Kongsfjorden outside Ny-Ålesund. On the other hand, ESRO threatened to instead build the installation in northern Sweden and northern Canada and abandon the Svalbard plans. An agreement was reached between ESRO, Norwegian authorities and NTNF was on 14 December 1964. It established both the location and that NTNF would be Norway's party. The agreement allowed the station to be located in Ny-Ålesund in exchange for Norwegian authorities building and operating the facility. While ESRO accepted NTNF as the Norwegian party, they wanted to receive a guarantee from the Norwegian authorities. However, to minimize Soviet criticism, the ministry was not interested in giving direct guarantees and asked that ESRO solely negotiate with NTNF.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{known as}} the Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he {{believed}} was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes {{had run out of}} ammunition and made the <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British pilot became a King's Messenger after the war, and {{died at the age of}} 90 in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Thomas enjoyed Fabian's {{performance}} in the episode, arguing {{that it was an}} example of the actor's scene stealer quality that led Thomas to initially cast him after his appearance in an episode of his earlier series Cupid. The scene in which Keith boards the ship on which Hank is located was difficult to film because there were limited daylight filming hours. The crew thought it was important for the audience to see the waves and the ocean. However, they were unable to finish filming the scene within the course of one day, so the crew made a <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> to place a makeshift blue screen as part of the background for the interior of the boat. It was intended that the blue screen be edited in post-production in order to represent the ocean, but upon learning that this change would cost millions of dollars, the crew decided to forgo the alteration and instead pass off the blue screen as a tarpaulin.|$|E

50|$|Dysfunctional impulsivity {{is a type}} of impulsivity that is {{associated}} with a tendency to make <b>quick</b> <b>decisions</b> when this type of decision-making is non-optimal. This differs from functional impulsivity which is a tendency to make <b>quick</b> <b>decisions</b> where this is optimal. As dysfunctional impulsivity is often associated with a failure to consider the consequences of one’s behavior, it can often lead to life difficulties.|$|R
50|$|Functional impulsivity is a {{tendency}} to make <b>quick</b> <b>decisions</b> when it is optimal and beneficial. This impulsivity is in contrast with dysfunctional impulsivity, which is {{a tendency}} to make <b>quick</b> <b>decisions</b> when it is not optimal. Although both types can be associated with inaccurate results, functional impulsivity is often considered a point of pride because it can help individuals take full advantage of opportunities.|$|R

On 7 February 1921, {{the first and only}} Qantas board meeting in Winton was held in the Winton Club, three days after the pilots landed, on 10 February. A <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> was made to move Qantas headquarters to Longreach, which would be more central to operations, with easier access to passengers and spare parts.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1930s George Halas and University of Chicago {{football}} coach Clark Shaughnessy collaborated on a revolutionary {{approach to the}} offense and the quarterback position. The result was the T-formation offense and the first evolution of the modern quarterback. A complex scheme that required an athletic player with <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> skills led Halas to recruit Columbia University quarterback Sid Luckman. He turned the position into an engine for a high powered and time-consuming scoring machine.|$|E

25|$|The Dickman Impulsivity Inventory {{was first}} {{developed}} in 1990 by Scott J. Dickman. This scale {{is based on}} Dickman's proposal {{that there are two}} types of impulsivity that are significantly different from one another. This includes functional impulsivity which is characterized by <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> making when it is optimal, a trait that is often considered to be a source of pride. The scale also includes dysfunctional impulsivity which is characterized by making quick decisions when it is not optimal. This type of impulsivity is most often associated with life difficulties including substance abuse problems and other negative outcomes.|$|E

Approval from South American governments for Eastern's one-year lease of Braniff's routes would not be required according to United States officials. Braniff International lauded the CAB's <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> as the carrier had stated that because of its tenuous cash position {{that it might have}} to shut the routes down if an agreement was not approved. Braniff ceased operations on May 12–13, 1982, and Eastern took over the routes earlier than the planned June 1, 1982, commencement of service date.|$|E

It is the board's desire that you accept." [...] Middleton was pressed to make a <b>quick</b> <b>decision,</b> and feeling confident that he could fulfill the job with no misgivings, he accepted the position.

500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the hijacking of Flight 615 as well as on a number of later occasions, concerns were voiced that the event might have been staged or at least tolerated by the West German government in order to [...] "get rid of three murderers, which had become a security burden" [...] (as Amnon Rubinstein wrote in Israeli newspaper Haaretz under the headline [...] "Bonn's Disgrace" [...] shortly after the prisoner release). Arguments frequently brought forth to back such allegations are the [...] "suspiciously" [...] low passenger number (there were only 13 male passengers on board the hijacked Boeing 727-100, an aircraft type with a seating capacity of 130–150), the [...] "surprisingly" [...] <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> to have the prisoners released, as well as purported contacts of the West German Federal Intelligence Service to the Palestine Liberation Organization.|$|E
500|$|Landis held {{hearings}} in late January 1915, and newspapers expected a <b>quick</b> <b>decision,</b> certainly before spring training began in March. During the hearings, Landis admonished the parties, [...] "Both sides {{must understand that}} any blows at the thing called baseball would be regarded by this court as a blow to a national institution". When the National League's chief counsel, future Senator George Wharton Pepper referred to the activities of baseball players on the field as [...] "labor", Landis interrupted him: [...] "As a result of 30years of observation, I am shocked because you call playing baseball 'labor.'" [...] Landis reserved judgment, and the parties waited for his ruling. Spring training passed, as did the entire regular season and the World Series. In December 1915, still with no word from Landis, the parties reached a settlement, and the Federal League disbanded. [...] Landis made no public statement as to the reasons for his failure to rule, though he told close friends {{that he had been}} certain the parties would reach a settlement sooner or later. Most observers thought that Landis waited because {{he did not want to}} rule against the two established leagues and their contracts.|$|E

500|$|Many of {{the central}} plot {{elements}} existed before designer Brian Mitsoda's involvement: the prince, the anarchs being upset, aspects of the Gehenna storyline, and Jack and the sarcophagus as a major subplot. The designers broadly tied the overarching story into each hub and level. Each designer controlled their assigned section of the game, and working with a small team enabled <b>quick</b> <b>decision</b> making and ease in keeping plot elements consistent. Mitsoda became the primary writer {{for many of the}} characters and their quests, dialog, and side content in the game, such as emails, which helped retain a consistent narrative. He was given freedom with respect to the script, with no restrictions on language or content, and could rewrite characters when he thought his initial draft weak. Although the story was developed by Troika, it is inspired by White Wolf's Time of Judgment novels about a vampire apocalypse. Bloodlines story was accepted as canonical by White Wolf, with the game serving as a prequel to Time of Judgment and including characters from the White Wolf game, such as Jack. Discussing character design, Mitsoda said he tried to disguise the need for characters who simply point a player in an appropriate direction: ...|$|E
