5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} <b>quantifiable</b> increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E

25|$|When {{measuring}} behavior, {{there are}} both dimensions {{of behavior and}} <b>quantifiable</b> measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the <b>quantifiable</b> measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus.|$|E
25|$|Management theorist Henry Mintzberg {{is highly}} {{critical}} of Taylor's methods. Mintzberg states that an obsession with efficiency allows measureable benefits to overshadow less <b>quantifiable</b> social benefits completely, and social values get left behind.|$|E
25|$|Nominal damages {{consist of}} a small cash amount where the court concludes that the {{defendant}} is in breach but the plaintiff has suffered no <b>quantifiable</b> pecuniary loss, and may be sought to obtain a legal record of who was at fault.|$|E
25|$|Since ontological hermeneutics {{does not}} {{aim to be}} a scientific, manualized {{approach}} to therapy, it is currently not capable of <b>quantifiable</b> research to test its efficacy or effectiveness. However, proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that scientific and manualized approaches are de-contextualizing, totalizing, reductionistic, and even oppressive.|$|E
25|$|Damages from a {{trespass}} claim {{are limited}} to the actual harm sustained by the plaintiff (which can include economic loss consequent on the trespass - e.g. loss of profit on a damaged chattel). In cases of dispossession, the plaintiff is always entitled to damages if they can prove the dispossession occurred, even if no <b>quantifiable</b> harm can be proven.|$|E
25|$|In {{determining}} {{premiums and}} premium rate structures, insurers consider <b>quantifiable</b> factors, including location, credit scores, gender, occupation, marital status, and education level. However, {{the use of}} such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully discriminatory, and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes {{about the ways in which}} insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.|$|E
25|$|Uncertainty in {{economics}} is an unknown prospect of gain or loss, whether <b>quantifiable</b> as risk or not. Without it, household behaviour would be unaffected by uncertain employment and income prospects, financial and capital markets would reduce to exchange {{of a single}} instrument in each market period, {{and there would be}} no communications industry. Given its different forms, there are various ways of representing uncertainty and modelling economic agents' responses to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} in colored hearing {{dates back to}} Greek antiquity, when philosophers asked if the color (chroia, {{what we now call}} timbre) of music was a <b>quantifiable</b> quality. Isaac Newton proposed that musical tones and color tones shared common frequencies, as did Goethe in his book Theory of Colours. There is a long history of building color organs such as the clavier à lumières on which to perform colored music in concert halls.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on which}} theory of utility is used, the {{interpretation}} of marginal utility can be meaningful or not. Economists have commonly described utility {{as if it were}} <b>quantifiable,</b> that is, as if different levels of utility could be compared along a numerical scale. This has affected the development and reception of theories of marginal utility. Quantitative concepts of utility allow familiar arithmetic operations, and further assumptions of continuity and differentiability greatly increase tractability.|$|E
25|$|As for {{the less}} <b>quantifiable</b> differences—mainly {{to do with the}} content, and of which there are quite a lot—Marlovians suggest that they are quite predictable, given that under their {{scenario}} Marlowe would have undergone a significant transformation of his life—with new locations, new experiences, new learning, new interests, new friends and acquaintances, possibly a new political agenda, new paymasters, new performance spaces, new actors, and maybe (not all agree on this) a new collaborator, Shakespeare himself.|$|E
25|$|The city of Zürich {{is among}} the world-leaders in {{protecting}} the climate by following a manifold approach. In November 2008 the people of Zürich voted in a public referendum to write into law the <b>quantifiable</b> and fixed deadline of one tonne of CO2 per person per annum by 2050. This forces any decision of the executive to support this goal, even if the costs are higher in all dimensions. Some examples are the new disinfection section of the public city hospital in Triemli (Minergie-P quality – passive house), the continued optimisation and creation of public transportation, enlargement of the bicycle-only network, research and projects for renewable energy and enclosure of speed-ways.|$|E
25|$|Biofeedback {{is a form}} of {{alternative}} medicine that involves measuring a subject's <b>quantifiable</b> bodily functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, skin temperature, sweat gland activity, and muscle tension, conveying the information to the patient in real-time. This raises the patient's awareness and conscious control of his or her unconscious physiological activities. Neal Miller is generally considered the father of modern-day biofeedback. Miller theorized the basic principles of biofeedback by applying his theory that classical and operant conditioning were both the result of a common learning principle in 1961. Miller hypothesized that any measurable physiological behavior within the human body would respond in some way to voluntary control.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin Graham is {{regarded}} {{by many to}} be the father of value investing. Along with David Dodd, he wrote Security Analysis, first published in 1934. The most lasting contribution of this book to the field of security analysis was to emphasize the <b>quantifiable</b> aspects of security analysis (such as the evaluations of earnings and book value) while minimizing the importance of more qualitative factors such as the quality of a company's management. Graham later wrote The Intelligent Investor, a book that brought value investing to individual investors. Aside from Buffett, many of Graham's other students, such as William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn, Walter Schloss, and Charles Brandes went on to become successful investors in their own right.|$|E
25|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} {{cell proliferation}} {{may arise from}} miR-21 interaction with MAP2K3, a tumor repressor gene. Optimal treatment for cancer involves accurately identifying patients for risk-stratified therapy. Those with a rapid response to initial treatment may benefit from truncated treatment regimens, showing the value of accurate disease response measures. Cell-free miRNA are highly stable in blood, are overexpressed in cancer and are <b>quantifiable</b> within the diagnostic laboratory. In classical Hodgkin lymphoma, plasma miR-21, miR-494, and miR-1973 are promising disease response biomarkers. Circulating miRNAs {{have the potential to}} assist clinical decision making and aid interpretation of positron emission tomography combined with computerized tomography. They can be performed at each consultation to assess disease response and detect relapse.|$|E
25|$|The {{trespass}} to chattels tort punishes {{anyone who}} substantially {{interferes with the}} use of another's personal property, or chattels. Plaintiffs must show that the offender had intentional physical contact with the chattel and that the contact caused some substantial interference or damage. The courts that imported this common law doctrine into the digital world reasoned that electrical signals traveling across networks and through proprietary servers may constitute the contact necessary to support a trespass claim. Applying this common law action to computer networks, plaintiffs must first prove that they received some type of electronic communication (typically bulk e-mail or spam) that the defendant intentionally sent to interfere with the plaintiff's interest in his or her property and second that this communication caused a <b>quantifiable</b> harm to their tangible property, such as impaired functioning of the computer, network or server.|$|E
25|$|Experiments on {{negative}} priming {{consist of}} two main components: prime and probe. Prime trial tries to mimic real life experiences of distractor stimuli in target selection {{but with more}} repetition to get <b>quantifiable</b> negative priming data. It comprises the initial presentation and the repetitive trials of the target and the distractor stimuli. It is set up such that a set of distractor stimuli are constantly ignored {{in the process of}} target selection. In the previous example provided, prime refers to the repeated perception of the blue pen as the distractor. Probe trial in an experiment refers to the actual testing for negative priming effects. In this trial, the repeated distractor of the prime trial is presented as the target. The reaction time of the response for the probe target (prime distractor) is measured to quantify the negative priming effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} {{amount of}} <b>quantifiable</b> research that mindfulness {{has on the}} brain and body {{is one of the}} major reasons why corporate mindfulness programs has become more prominent in the modern day business world. Studies conducted by Yale University found that mindfulness meditation is associated with lower levels of activity in the default mode network (DMN), which is part of the brain network that is responsible for self-related thinking and mind wandering. Volume changes in key areas of the brain are also found as a result of meditation. In 2011, a team at Harvard found that mindfulness can actually change the structure of the brain after conducting an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) on participants. The research found an increase in cortical thickness in the hippocampus, which controls learning, memory and emotion regulation. The research also found decreases in brain cell volume in the Amygdala, which is responsible for fear, anxiety and stress. These changes were also aligned with the participant's self-reports of their stress levels.|$|E
25|$|Some {{critical}} psychiatrists {{criticize the}} practice of defining {{one and the same}} belief as normal in one culture and pathological in another culture for cultural essentialism. They argue that since cultural influences are mixed, including not only parents and teachers but also peers, friends, books and the internet, and the same cultural influence can have different effects depending on earlier cultural influences, the assumption that culture can be boiled down to a few traceable, distinguishable and statistically <b>quantifiable</b> factors and that everything that does not fall in those factors must be biological, is not a justified assumption. Other critical psychiatrists argue that just because a person's belief is unshaken by one influence does not prove that it would remain unshaken by another. For example, a person whose beliefs are not changed by verbal correction from a psychiatrist, which is how delusion is usually diagnosed, may still change his or her mind when observing empirical evidence, only that psychiatry rarely if ever present patients with such situations.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} two fractal curves {{described}} above show a type of self-similarity that is exact with a repeating unit of detail that is readily visualized. This sort of structure can be extended to other spaces (e.g., a fractal that extends the Koch curve into 3-d space has a theoretical D=2.5849). However, such neatly countable complexity is only {{one example of the}} self-similarity and detail that are present in fractals. The example of the coast line of Britain, for instance, exhibits self-similarity of an approximate pattern with approximate scaling. Overall, fractals show several types and degrees of self-similarity and detail that may not be easily visualized. These include, as examples, strange attractors for which the detail has been described as in essence, smooth portions piling up, the Julia set, which can be seen to be complex swirls upon swirls, and heart rates, which are patterns of rough spikes repeated and scaled in time. Fractal complexity may not always be resolvable into easily grasped units of detail and scale without complex analytic methods but it is still <b>quantifiable</b> through fractal dimensions.|$|E

500|$|Augustin Cournot and Léon Walras {{built the}} tools of the {{discipline}} axiomatically around utility, arguing that individuals sought to maximize their utility across choices in a way that could be described mathematically. [...] At the time, it was thought that utility was <b>quantifiable,</b> in units known as utils. [...] Cournot, Walras and Francis Ysidro Edgeworth are considered the precursors to modern mathematical economics.|$|E
500|$|Hite's {{conclusions}} are more based on respondents' comments than <b>quantifiable</b> data. She found it [...] "striking" [...] {{that many women}} who had no lesbian experiences indicated {{they were interested in}} sex with women, particularly because the question was not asked. Hite found the two most significant differences between respondents' experience with men and women were the focus on clitoral stimulation, and more emotional involvement and orgasmic responses. Since Hite performed her study during the popularity of feminism in the 1970s, she also acknowledged that women may have chosen the political identity of a lesbian.|$|E
500|$|The simple {{definition}} that sustainability {{is something that}} improves [...] "the quality of human life while living within the carrying capacity of supporting eco-systems", though vague, conveys the idea of sustainability having <b>quantifiable</b> limits. But sustainability is also a call to action, a task in progress or [...] "journey" [...] and therefore a political process, so some definitions set out common goals and values. The Earth Charter speaks of [...] "a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace". This suggested a more complex figure of sustainability, which included {{the importance of the}} domain of 'politics'.|$|E
500|$|Thereafter, the {{hurricane}} began curving northward as {{it continued to}} intensify, reaching {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category3hurricane– a major hurricane– by September11. Two days later, the storm strengthened further into a Category4hurricane. As no reasonably <b>quantifiable</b> strengthening occurred afterwards, this also marked the storm's official peak intensity as maximum sustained winds were analyzed at [...] However, aircraft reconnaissance estimated wind speeds of at least [...] at roughly the same time frame. The storm's northward recurvature caused it to track just west of Bermuda late on September13. Afterwards, a weakening trend began as {{the hurricane}} tracked northeastward into more northerly latitudes. By September15, the storm had been downgraded to minimal hurricane intensity. After passing south of Cape Race later that day, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and continued to track northward until it was last noted by 1800UTC the next day near Greenland. During the storm's twelve-day trek, the hurricane tracked approximately , roughly equidistant to the distance between New York City and London.|$|E
500|$|A {{factor of}} great {{conflict}} all over Eora is the recent scientific discovery that souls are not mere metaphysical abstractions, but <b>quantifiable,</b> measurable objects {{that can be}} transferred, stored, or molded. Souls are the basis of magic, as accessing their power is what allows certain people to use it. Souls leave the body upon death, and go through a largely unknown process before reincarnating into a newborn body. Every soul does, however, have embedded memories from their previous lives, and through certain processes a person's soul can be [...] "Awakened," [...] meaning they gain awareness of these past lives. There are also {{people in the world}} who have the supernatural ability to perceive people's souls, which allows them to access past memories, among other things; these individuals are called [...] "Watchers." [...] Though the study of souls, called animancy, is still a young field of science, the implications for society at large has been vast, led to rapid advances in technology, and caused several rifts and clashes in the different religious communities, which has marked the era as a time of great turmoil.|$|E
