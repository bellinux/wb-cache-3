But that brought no relief to Gorman, whose remorse increased daily, insomuch that he became, if not <b>quite,</b> <b>very</b> nearly, insane, and his fear of being caught {{was so great that}} he never ventured near the quarter of London in which Boone dwelt. He therefore remained in ignorance of the failure of his murderous attempt. What would he not have given to have known the truth! to have had the dreadful word removed from the light which shone upon it brighter and brighter every day until it was made red-hot, as it were, and became within him as a consuming fire! Preferring darkness to light more than ever, Gorman kept in secret places during the day, and only ventured out, with other human vultures, at night. The wretched man feared the darkness, too, although he sought it, and what between the darkness that he feared yet courted, and the light that he feared and fled from, and the light within that he feared but could not fly from, {{he became one of the}} most miserable of all the outcasts in London.|$|E

50|$|Baretha is {{situated}} 30 km West of Katihar and 12 km west of Korha. It is culturally a rich village. Place where Mahatma Ganghi visited and stayed during different movement during the freedom struggle. Jawaharlal Nehru {{and many more}} prominent freedom fighter visited this place. Thus this place carries within itself the glorious past. Farming and business is {{the main source of}} living. People here have more economical senses and thus focus more on cash crop like Banana Plantation, Sun Flower Seed, Maize, etc.. Trading in all kind of stuffs like cloths, wheat, rice and others are primary. Though this village is a small one but it is <b>quite</b> <b>very</b> advanced. Literacy rate is also good, having high tech High School and other middle and primary schools. The business and farming in Baretha is being done by every section of the society. The place itself is worth visiting as it full of natural beauty and pleasant climate all around the year. In winter places are full with the migrant birds from around the globe. There are many spiritual places attached with the sentiments of the people. The nearest sub urban area is Falka which stations the block office and the police station. The area is connected to NH-31 and the nearest railway station is Katihar and Bagdogra being the nearest airport (190 km). But to maintain the current status of the area the government should focus on this area. And in near future this village will come out as model village of India with the help of social economic approach from all section of the society.|$|E

When he goes to search for accommodation, he runs into a friend, Jagdish, who takes him to a rooming house and lets him share one room with himself, Kavi Viyogi, and Bhimsen. The landlady has very strict rules for all her tenants to wit: No one is allowed to romance on her property. On a rainy day when Pritam goes to buy milk, he runs into a {{beautiful}} girl, Meena Sharma, and their umbrellas get entangled, and when freed get interchanged. He goes to look for her house and finds she lives with her maternal uncle, a music maestro of sorts, and Pritam enrolls himself in his class. Pritam and Meena continue meeting and fall in love with each other. When Meena's sister is about to get married, she travels to Poona and that's when Pritam finds out that her train had an accident and she has been listed as one of the dead. Heart-broken and devastated he is severely depressed, until his co-workers decide that he should go for a picnic and this does cheer him considerably. In this cheerful state he returns home and decides to carry on with life without Meena. It is then Meena returns, <b>quite</b> <b>very</b> much alive, and finds that Pritam is not in a state of mourning but is enjoying life to the fullest. She decides to teach him a lesson that he will never forget. Watch what happens when the lesson commences and what impact this has on our care-free friend - who is currently wooing a dancer by the name of Edna Wong.|$|E

40|$|Pneumocystis jiroveci {{pneumonia}} (PJP) {{is one of}} {{the major}} infections in patients with impaired immunity. The entity is common in HIV-seropositive individuals but <b>quite</b> <b>very</b> rare in HIV-seronegative individuals especially children. We report here a case of 16 -week-old HIV-seronegative infant with chief complaint of chronic cough of one month of evolution. Sweat chloride test for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was positive. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated on culture. Empirical antibiotic regimen comprising ceftriaxone and azithromycin was initiated that was switched to meropenem as per antimicrobial susceptibility report, but the patient did not improve. Subsequently, an immunofluorescence staining of BAL fluid was performed and P. jiroveci cysts were detected. Following a laboratory confirmation of Pneumocystis pneumonia, cotrimoxazole was added and the clinical condition of the patient significantly improved. This is an unusual case wherein unsuspected PJP occurred and since signs and symptoms of the patient persisted even after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy for Pseudomonas infection and resolved only after treatment for PJP was started, it suggests a causative role of P. jiroveci rather than colonization/contamination...|$|E
40|$|The year 1948 {{marked the}} start of {{university}} education in the University College, Ibadan, Nigeria. High demand for university education {{and the need to}} produce the much-needed high-level manpower for the newly independent nation, made the federal and regional governments to found additional four new universities in the 1960 ’s bringing the number to five. The federal and state governments established more universities in the 1970 ’s and subsequent decades in answer to further request for university education. Private universities started to appear since late 1990 ’s. As of now, there are 117 universities owned by the federal government, state governments and private individuals and corporate bodies. In the first four decades (1948 – 1988), the quality of the nation’s university education was <b>quite</b> <b>very</b> good. Afterwards, the university education system derailed, so to speak, as a result of myriads of problems prominent ones being inadequate financing and erosion of university autonomy. To get the system back on track once again, the government must display genuine interest towards it by funding it appropriately and allowing it to enjoy considerable autonomy...|$|E

40|$|A {{lead angle}} {{constrained}} optimal mid course guidance in this paper, {{which is quite}} important for missions with missiles with limited sen sor capability to detect and monitor the target. This guidance law not only achieves the minimum control effort, but also generates the desired optimal terminal angl es (in both pitch and yaw planes) {{that can lead to}} proper trajectory shaping to assure the desired lead angle during the midcourse. If both plane terminal lead angles are free, then this guidance will generate the desired terminal lead angles suc h that control effort can be minimized. If total lead angle is specified, then this guid ance law solves the constraint optimal problem to find the lead angles in both plane optimally. In a case where both lead angles are specified, this guidance law will achieves this with minimum control effort. For all the three cases close form solutions for the lateral acceleration command has been obtained. Simulation results for all three cases are <b>quite</b> <b>very</b> promising.

40|$|Purpose / Context - The aim of {{this study}} is to clarify an {{estimation}} method of humidification for infection control in residences. In Japan indoor humidity is very low in winter especially in recent insulated houses without unvented stoves. Dwellers know that it is necessary to keep humidity ade-quate for infection control, but most of them don’t know the moderate humidity or the effect of venti-lation for infection control. In this study, the state of influenza infection control was evaluated using the measurement results on indoor air in the rooms of six Japanese facilities for the elderly. The temperature is kept better in these residences than that in common Japanese houses. But the humid-ity is <b>quite</b> <b>very</b> low in winter. The energy saving is thought to be one of the causes of this state. Methodology / Approach - Under the assumption that influenza virus generate at a constant rate, the concentrations of survived influenza viruses in indoor air were calculated using an equation, which is given on the basis of the survival tests on influenza virus by G. J. Harper. The equation gives the concentration of influenza viruses using the ventilation rates and absolute humidity. Then an index on virus reduction which integrates ventilation effect and humidity effect was proposed. Results - The energy consumption of ventilation and humidification for infection control is calculated using this index. The results show that it is effective to control ventilation rate for both of infection control and saving energy in many rooms in these facilities. Key Findings / Implications - Effective strategies for infection control in residences are discussed using the index of influenza infection control. Originality - The index of influenza infection control is proposed in this study. This index is useful to estimate indoor air quality. The index is expected to be used for the design of building performances and air conditioning systems...|$|E
