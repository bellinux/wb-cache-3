Insufficient stabilization of austenite phases and intermetallic formations due to unfavourable thermal cycle leads to drastic reduction in the ductility and toughness of duplex stainless steel in particularly at low temperature. In this work, an attempt {{has been made to}} analyze the microstructure in the DSS weld, heat affected zone and base metal with respect to their impact toughness. DSS weld joints were fabricated using gas tungsten arc welding process with controlled welding parameters. Ferrite austenite ratio in the weld zone, heat affected zone and base metal was assessed by <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallographic</b> image <b>analysis.</b> The impact test results were correlated with the fractured surface and the microstructure of the tested specimens. The effect of heat treatment on the microstructural changes in the weld and base metal were also investigated with respect to impact toughness. Austenite phases were nucleated in the high temperature heat affected zone during heat treatment of weldment at 1050 °C for 1 hour and it leads to enhancement in the impact toughness of the DSS weldment. But, drastic reduction in the impact toughness was observed in the base metal after heat treatment at 850 °C and 1050 °C due to the formation of sigma phase at 850 °C and the coarser ferrite and austenite grains and partially dissolved sigma phase in the microstructure of 1050 °C heat treated samples...|$|R

The goal is to obtain after extrusion the semi-products of AlCuMg alloys a fine-grain structure which one hand increases strength properties and plasticity, {{and on the other}} hand is possible to use it at selected cases for subsequent deformations under conditions of „super-plastic state“. Design/methodology/approach: The experiments were aimed the verification of functionality of the proposed equipment, determination of deformation resistance, deformability and change of structure at extrusion of the alloy AlCu 4 Mg 2. Deformation forces were measured at extrusion. The average grain size in cross direction was determined by <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallographic</b> methods. TEM <b>analysis</b> of the structure of AlCu 4 Mg 2 were also made. Findings: The structural analysis of AlCu 4 Mg 2 alloy made by TEM has demonstrated a perfect suitability of the ECAP die design. The process results in a very fine grain structure (100 - 200 nm) throughout the sample overall volume, at which the starting average grain size was 150 !m. Practical implications: Aluminium alloys of super fine granularity structure are basic intermediate products realised by ECAP technologies. The state of super fine granularity facilitates forming of material in the so-called ‘superplastic state’. The achievement of the desired structure depends primarily on the tool geometry, number of passages through the die, magnitude and speed of deformation, process temperature, and lubrication mode. Originality/value: It has been demonstrated that the extrusion technology is suitable for attaining of grain nano-structure in the material investigated in order to determine the number of extrusion cycles needed and the appropriate canal angle with corresponding internal and external bend radii.

Sulfide inclusion in steel surface was removed by molten salt electrolysis in molten CaCl 2 at 850 under the stationary voltage.

40|$|The {{potential}} for land-based turbine buckets material rejuvenation presents a significant commercial and scientific interest. Ni-based superalloy GTD 111 is used {{at a number}} of GE-manufactured power generation turbines. The outstanding creep resistance features of Ni-based superalloys can be attributed to a large extent, to the gamma prime ([gamma]') precipitates found within the FCC [gamma]-matrix. Service-induced material degradation mainly involves coarsening and shape transformation of [gamma]'-phase precipitates; therefore, any bucket repair attempt should primarily address the restoration of [gamma]' precipitates to the original configuration. In the present study a <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallographic</b> <b>analysis</b> of GTD 111 alloy under different conditions was performed. Several micrographs were taken and analysed using image analysis software. Gamma prime precipitate size was measured and compared between the different alloy conditions, leading to useful conclusions concerning material degradation as a result of high-temperature service exposure. In addition, microstructural transformations observed as a result of different heat treatments, formed the basis for investigation of procedures that can potentially restore the alloy microstructure in the original condition. High temperature solution and aging heat treatments sequence is considered as potentially sufficient for restoring the GTD 111 microstructure. Finally, the measurements were examined for correlation with existing [gamma]' particle coarsening theory, by calculating and evaluating the metal service temperature during service.

40|$|The {{quality of}} the working rollers used for rolling rails is {{determined}} by the chemical and structural compositions of the material of the rollers and the production technology. It is necessary to cast rollers with significantly improved utility properties, i. e., mainly a high wear resistance and optimal mechanical and structural properties. It is, therefore, necessary to find and ensure the optimal relationships between the matrix structure and the resulting values of the mechanical properties of the rollers in order to maximize their life time. The requirements introduced here cannot be ensured without a knowledge of the kinetics of the solidification. Therefore, numerical and experimental investigations of the temperature field of the solidifying roller were conducted. The kinetics of the solidification has a measurable and non-negligible influence on the chemical and structural heterogeneity of the investigated type of ductile cast-iron. Linking to the results of the model of the temperature field of the cast rollers, an original methodology was developed for the measurement of chemical micro-heterogeneity. The structure of this cast-iron is created by a large amount of the transition form of graphite and a small amount of globular graphite, and also the lamellar graphite and cementite, whereas the structure of the metal matrix is perlitic. The volume amounts of the structural components were determined using a <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallographic</b> <b>analysis,</b> according to which the places for the analysis of the element composition using X-ray energy-dispersive spectral micro-analysis were selected.
