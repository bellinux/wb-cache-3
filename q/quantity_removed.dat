This medium, called R-MnO 2, was tested for As(V) retention and for As(III) simultaneous oxidation and removal.

Four in-ground bait stations containing timber billets were placed around each of twenty mounds. Once sufficient numbers of in-ground stations were infested by termites, mounds were {{assigned to one of}} four groups (one, two, three or four 120 g bait canisters or 120 to 480 g bait in total per mound) and bait canisters installed. One mound, nominally assigned treatment with two canisters ultimately had no termite interception in any of the four in-ground stations and not treated. Eighteen of the remaining 19 colonies were eliminated by 12 weeks after bait placement, irrespective of bait <b>quantity</b> <b>removed</b> (range 43 to 480 g). Measures of colony decline—mound repair capability and internal core temperature—did not accurately reflect the colony decline, as untreated colonies showed a similar pattern of decline in both repair capability and internal mound core temperature.

40|$|The ideal invariants {{present in}} the {{formalism}} of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), i. e. global quantities that are conserved {{in the absence of}} sources and dissipative effects, {{play an important role in}} various theoretical and numerical studies of MHD turbulence. The fluxes of these ideal invariants represent separate channels that transfer the information across different scales in a turbulent system. Once a statistically stationary state of turbulence is reached, the amount of any ideal invariant quantity introduced in the system by a forcing mechanism equals the amount of the same <b>quantity</b> <b>removed</b> by the dissipative effects from the system. For highly developed turbulence, these two mechanisms act predominantly at different scales that are largely separated. Since the ideal invariant quantities cascade between scales, a constant flux is generated with great implication on the state of the system. Numerically, controlling the ideal invariant fluxes levels for a turbulent MHD system is important for the analysis of fundamental MHD turbulence properties. We propose a forcing mechanism that controls the three ideal invariants of MHD turbulence: the total energy, the cross-helicity and the magnetic helicity. This forcing is implemented in the freely available TURBO solver, that is also briefly presented. Comment: 10 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the interaction of CrIII and CdII ions in solution with the local landfill clay of Jebel Chakir (Ghorbel-Abid et al., 2009) located in the northwest of Tunis (Tunisia, North Africa). The adsorption properties of natural clay and the Na-purified clay in a chromium and cadmium rich aqueous solution have been studied by batch technique. The amount of adsorbed heavy metals ions, Qe, was determined for the adsorption systems as a function of the contact time, the pH, and the metal ion concentration. The results show that the uptake of CrIII by the purified clay is very fast. The <b>quantity</b> <b>removed</b> from the solution reached a maximum value 15 min after mixing, for the purified clay, and 1 h for the natural clay, although the latter removes greater quantities of CrIII ions compared to the Na-purified clay. However, the uptake of CdII reached its maximum value approximately 2 h after mixing, for the purified clay, and 3. 5 h for the natural clay, although the removed quantities of CdII ions are comparable in both the Na-purified and natural clay. The experimental data points have been fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich models. The competitive adsorption isotherms of CrIII and CdII ions in similar conditions have been studied by the batch technique. The amount of adsorbed ions, Qe was determined. The results show that the presence of CdII has an important effect on the uptake of CrIII...|$|E

Studies were performed under various conditions such as presence of different cations (Pb, Cd, Na), zeolite grain size, solution temperature. The results obtained indicate that the size of the zeolite does not affect the actual metal uptake at the equilibrium point, but the metal removal is greatly affected when the contact of the solid/liquid phases is short, a very essential parameter for the waste water treatment. For a short contact time the metal <b>quantities</b> <b>removed</b> using small grain size is nearly doubled. The same pattern is followed at higher temperatures, though a slight increase is observed for both zeolite grain sizes and both metals, lead and cadmium.

Approximately 14 metric tons of F. guineensis were harvested during this period and one forest was identified as having supplied 40 % of the F. guineensis harvested. The amount of harvesting increased significantly in this forest from 1986, but the harvesting intensity (i. e. weight of F. guineensis harvested per hectare of forest per annum) was relatively low, suggesting more intensive harvesting could be sustained.

Strongly chelating (0. 20 M and 0. 02 M citrate) and weakly chelating (0. 02 M acetate) solutions buffered at pH 3. 5, 4. 5 and 5. 5, were leached for varying periods of time up to 6 monhts, through B 2 horizon. Craigieburn silt loam. X-Ray diffraction of the leached soil clay fraction showed that the period of leaching was too short to cause a clay transformation from the initial 2 : 1 – 2 : 2 Al-intergrade into a 2 : 1 layer silicate. However, X-Ray and electron microscopy studies showed removal of some surface coatings and interlayer hydroxy Al. Analyses leachates showed that the citrate (chelating) buffers were more effective at removing Al and Fe from the solid phases than acetate (non-chelating) buffers. <b>Quantities</b> <b>removed</b> and rates of solution of Al and Fe increase with decreasing pH. Rapid initial loss of Al and Fe probably involved disordered gels and surface coatings. Increasing the citrate concentration above a certain limit did not increase the ability of the solution to remove Al and Fe.
