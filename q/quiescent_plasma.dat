40|$|Most {{plasma etching}} {{processes}} require negative sub-strate biasing to ensure directional ion bombardment. The electrodes of an rf-driven plasma etch reactor, for example, acquire a negative self-bias voltage due to partial rectification of the applied rf electric field by the plasma sheath surrounding the platens (1 - 3). In many cases, however, {{it may be}} desirable to apply an additional separately controllable substrate bias or to establish a substrate bias in a <b>quiescent</b> <b>plasma</b> in which self-bias is negligible. This note shows that the negative d-c substrate bias resulting from the applica-tion of an external alternating voltage to a substrate can be accurately predicted by a simple calculation. The result is confirmed by bias measurements in a <b>quiescent</b> <b>plasma.</b> Figure la shows a substrate immersed in plasma and driven by an externally applied alternating voltage Vrf cos ot. The capacitor prevents the extraction of net current from the plasma. The Langmuir current-volt-age characteristic (4) in Fig. lb shows that the ther-mal currents of the electrons and the heavier less mobile ions are unequal. With no applied rf signal, the substrate potential will therefore settle at a negative value (VF), the floating potential (4), relative to the ambient plasma potential (Vp). At the floating po-tential, the random electron and ion thermal currents falling to the substrate surface just cancel. When the alternating voltage (Vrr cos or) is applied, a more neg-ative steady bias voltage (Vd. ~.) is established (Fig. 1) at which the time-average lectron and ion current components again cancel; that is "- 0 [I] where the brackets denote time-averaging.

This paper reviews experimental results obtained with a symmetrical (vacuum) launching spectrum with k|| = 14 m(superscript ''- 1 '') at a frequency of 30 MHz. We describe results obtained when HHFW power is applied to helium and deuterium plasmas, during the plasma-current flattop period of the discharge. Application of 1. 8 -MW HHFW pulse to MHD <b>quiescent</b> <b>plasmas</b> resulted in strong electron heating, during which the central electron temperature T(subscript ''eo'') more than doubled from approximately 0. 5 keV to 1. 15 keV. In deuterium plasmas, HHFW heating was found less efficient, with a central electron temperature increase of the order of 40 % during a 1. 8 -MW HHFW pulse, from approximately 400 eV to approximately 550 eV. (At HHFW power of 2. 4 MW, central electron temperature increased by 60 %, reaching 0. 625 keV.) HHFW heating in presence of MHD activity is also discussed. A short neutral-beam pulse was applied to permit charge-exchange recombination spectroscopy (CHERS) measurement of the impurity ion temperature T(subscript ''i''). Preliminary CHERS analysis show that ion temperature approximately equals electron temperature during HHFW heating.

40|$|An {{electron}} density bubble driven in a rarefied uniform plasma by a slowly evolving laser pulse goes through periods of adiabatically slow expansions and contractions.

In regimes relevant to experiments with hundred terawatt- to petawatt-class lasers, bubble dynamics and, hence, the self-injection process are governed {{primarily by the}} driver evolution. Collective transverse fields of the trapped electron bunch reduce the accelerating gradient and slow down phase space rotation. Bubble expansion followed by stabilization and contraction suppresses the low-energy background and creates a collimated quasi-monoenergetic electron bunch long before dephasing.

A large {{prominence}} {{was observed}} on September 24, 2013, {{for three hours}} (12 : 12 UT - 15 : 12 UT) with the newly launched (June 2013) Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), THEMIS (Tenerife), the Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT), the Solar Dynamic Observatory Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA), and the Multichannel Subtractive Double Pass spectrograph (MSDP) in the Meudon Solar Tower. Aims. The aim of this work is to study {{the dynamics of the}} prominence fine structures in multiple wavelengths to understand their formation. Methods. The spectrographs IRIS and MSDP provided line profiles with a high cadence in Mg II and in Halpha lines. Results. The magnetic field is found to be globally horizontal with a relatively weak field strength (8 - 15 Gauss). The Ca II movie reveals turbulent-like motion that is not organized in specific parts of the prominence. On the other hand, the Mg II line profiles show multiple peaks well separated in wavelength. Each peak corresponds to a Gaussian profile, and not to a reversed profile as was expected by the present non-LTE radiative transfer modeling. Conclusions. Turbulent fields on top of the macroscopic horizontal component of the magnetic field supporting the prominence give rise to the complex dynamics of the plasma. The plasma with the high velocities (70 km/s to 100 km/s if we take into account the transverse velocities) may correspond to condensation of plasma along more or less horizontal threads of the arch-shape structure visible in 304 A. The steady flows (5 km/s) would correspond to a more <b>quiescent</b> <b>plasma</b> (cool and prominence-corona transition region) of the prominence packed into dips in horizontal magnetic field lines. The very weak secondary peaks in the Mg II profiles may reflect the turbulent nature of parts of the prominence. Comment: 15 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|Received date; {{accepted}} date Aims. We aim {{to understand}} the formation of dense cores by magnetosonic waves in regions where the thermal to magnetic pressure ratio is small. Because of the low-ionisation fraction in molecular clouds, neutral and charged particles are weakly coupled. Ambipolar diffusion then plays an important rÃ´le in the formation process. Methods. A <b>quiescent,</b> uniform <b>plasma</b> is perturbed by a fast-mode wave. Using 2 D numerical simulations, we follow {{the evolution of the}} fast-mode wave. The simulations are done with a multifluid, adaptive mesh refinement MHD code. Results. Initial perturbations with wavelengths that are 2 orders of magnitude larger than the dissipation length are strongly affected by the ion-neutral drift. Only in situations where there are large variations in the magnetic field corresponding to a highly turbulent gas can fast-mode waves generate dense cores. This means that, in most cores, no substructure can be produced. However, Core D of TMC- 1 is an exception to this case. Due to its atypically high ionisation fraction, waves with wavelengths up to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the dissipation length can be present. Such waves are only weakly affected by ambipolar diffusion and can produce dense substructure without large wave-amplitudes. Our results also explain the observed transition from AlfvÃ©nic turbulent motion at large scales to subsonic motions at the level of dense cores...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Within the ITPA Topical Group on Energetic Particles, we have {{investigated}} the impact that various mechanisms breaking the tokamak axisymmetry can have on the fusion alpha particle confinement in ITER {{as well as on}} the wall power loads due to these alphas. In addition to the well known TF ripple, the 3 D effect due to ferromagnetic materials (in ferritic inserts, FI, and test blanket modules, TBM) and ELM mitigation coils are included in these mechanisms. ITER Scenario- 4 was chosen since, due to its lower plasma current, it is more vulnerable for various off-normal features. First, the validity of using a 2 D equilibrium was investigated: a 3 D equilibrium was reconstructed using the VMEC code, and it was verified that no 3 D equilibrium reconstruction is needed but it is sufficient to add the vacuum field perturbations onto an axisymmetric equilibrium. Then the alpha particle confinement was studied using three independent codes, ASCOT, DELTA 5 D, and F 3 D OFMC, all of which assume MHD <b>quiescent</b> background <b>plasma</b> and no anomalous diffusion. All the codes gave a loss power fraction of about 0. 2 %. The distribution of the peak power load was found to depend on the first wall shape. We also made the first attempt to accommodate the effect of fast ion related MHD on the wall loads in ITER using the HMGC and ASCOT codes. The power flux to the wall was found to increase due to th...|$|R
