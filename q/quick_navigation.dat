5|$|The game {{world is}} divided into two halves: North and South Kyrat. Players start in South Kyrat and are free to explore it almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat {{over the course of the}} story. The map is {{progressively}} opened by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and allowing the Golden Path to expand. These towers help players reveal new areas and mark new locations of interest on the map. The world is scattered with outposts controlled by Pagan Min, which can be infiltrated by players. Four larger outposts, or fortresses, can also be found, and feature stronger defenses and more difficult combinations of enemies. If players successfully liberate these outposts, they will serve as fast-travel points, allowing <b>quick</b> <b>navigation</b> through the game's world. Additional missions and quests also become available. There are many side-missions that can be completed, including hostage rescues, bomb disposal quests, and hunting missions. The collected animals' parts can then be used for crafting new pouches and belts.|$|E
25|$|The Visual Studio code editor also {{supports}} setting bookmarks in code for <b>quick</b> <b>navigation.</b> Other navigational aids include collapsing code blocks and incremental search, {{in addition to}} normal text search and regex search. The code editor also includes a multi-item clipboard and a task list. The code editor supports code snippets, which are saved templates for repetitive code and can be inserted into code and customized for the project being worked on. A management tool for code snippets is built in as well. These tools are surfaced as floating windows which can be set to automatically hide when unused or docked {{to the side of}} the screen. The Visual Studio code editor {{also supports}} code refactoring including parameter reordering, variable and method renaming, interface extraction and encapsulation of class members inside properties, among others.|$|E
25|$|Windows Explorer's task {{panel has}} been removed, {{integrating}} the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane {{on the left}} contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated Search Folders. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change {{the layout of the}} Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as author or subject) to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the Details Pane that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The Navigation Pane contains a list of most common folders (the Favorites) for <b>quick</b> <b>navigation.</b> It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as virtual ones. By default it contains links to folders such as Documents and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The Preview Pane can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the Windows Imaging Component is installed. Also, if an application installs Preview handlers (like Office 2007 does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.|$|E

While the book was small, it was easy for readers and myself to {{navigate}} and edit certain parts but as the book grew in volume, editing chapters grew difficult and tiresome. Therefore, I designed a customized website to help solve this issue and also facilitate easier and <b>quicker</b> <b>navigation,</b> benefitting both readers and myself. The website has features that allow quick chapter uploads, easy edits and deletions, possesses reader comment functionality and permits markdown usage in chapters by implementing a visual editor.

40|$|Considering the {{accessibility}} of online educational applications, it is natural to assume that instructors incorporate them into their practice. However, lack of resource-awareness and time prevent instructors from learning about practical apps. To overcome these barriers, an online instructional module that succinctly shares useful {{information on how to}} use the Kahoot!, Blendspace, and PowToon apps was developed. These apps were selected because they offer instructors relief from the time-consuming task of creating entirely new deliverables by providing ready-made products that instructors can use. The purpose of this usability study was to assess the ease of use, learnability, and user satisfaction of the module before use with its target audience. Online resources such as PowToon and YouTube were used to develop content while the ARCS Model of Motivation and Gagne’s Nine Events of Learning guided design and content organization. The testing sessions, which were recorded using Google Hangouts on Air and Screencast-O-Matic 2, exposed navigation, structural, and language issues as participants engaged in specific tasks. At the end of each session, participants completed a survey that provided additional insight and recommendations for improvement. Two rounds of usability testing were done; each round uncovered problem areas that were corrected to facilitate <b>quicker</b> <b>navigation</b> of the site. Revisions to the module resulted in a more intuitive and fluid experience. These positive gains lend support for the effectiveness of usability testing in meeting design objectives...|$|R

50|$|Engineers John Rennie, Thomas Telford and John Ainslie were {{employed}} to design the canal, survey a route, and estimate the costs. The original design was in three parts. The first section would be a contour canal of about 11 mi in length. Following the land, a contour canal is entirely level and requires no locks or lifts making <b>navigation</b> <b>quick</b> and easy. Contour canals require only a small water supply since no water is lost to locks, but this method of construction would make the canal longer than it need have been. The second section would see a series of 8 locks lift the level up to a summit near Johnstone. The third and last section would use 13 locks to bring the canal down to sea level at Ardrossan Harbour. When complete the canal have been just shy of 33 mi long. The dimensions of the cutting were to be 30 ft broad {{at the top and}} at bottom, 18 ft. The depth was to be 4 feet 6 inches.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} intuitiveness, 3 D mobile maps have {{recently}} {{emerged as an}} alternative to 2 D mobile maps. However, designing interactions for navigation in a 3 D environment using a mobile device is non-trivial. Challenges are posed by the severe limitations of the mobile user interface and of the capacities of the mobile user. This chapter analyses the problem of degrees of freedom: how to make <b>navigation</b> <b>quicker</b> and more intuitive by the means of restricting and guiding movement, yet enabling unrestricted access to all reasonable points-of-interests. Insights from empirical studies of mobile map interaction are presented, {{in the form of a}} model of interactive search, to draw requirements for interaction design. Then, the design of controls, landmarks, cameras, interest fields, routes, paths etc. are analysed and several higher-level navigation metaphors are discussed. We propose ways to support spatial updating, rapid alignment of physical and virtual spaces, and overcoming the keyhole problem. A working prototype system is used to illustrate different solutions alongside with alternative designs, weighing their pros and cons...|$|R
