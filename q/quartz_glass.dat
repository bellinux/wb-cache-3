5|$|ARCHER is {{a daytime}} {{non-invasive}} technology, which works by analyzing an object’s reflected light. It cannot detect objects at night, underwater, under dense cover, underground, under snow or inside buildings. The system uses a special camera facing down through a <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> portal {{in the belly}} of the aircraft, which is typically flown at a standard mission altitude of 2500feet (800meters) and 100 knots (50meters/second) ground speed.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to <b>quartz</b> <b>glass,</b> so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both tungsten and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

2500|$|A shortwave UV lamp can be {{made using}} a {{fluorescent}} lamp tube with no phosphor coating. These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UVC band at 253.7nm and 185nm due to the mercury within the lamp, {{as well as some}} visible light. From 85% to 90% of the UV produced by these lamps is at 253.7nm, whereas only 5–10% is at 185nm. The fused <b>quartz</b> <b>glass</b> tube passes the 253nm radiation but blocks the 185nm wavelength. Such tubes have two or three times the UVC power of a regular fluorescent lamp tube. These low-pressure lamps have a typical efficiency of approximately 30–40%, meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp, they will produce approximately 30–40 watts of total UV output.

30|$|Materials {{in general}} can be {{classified}} into three categories based on their interaction with microwaves: (1) materials that reflect microwaves, which are bulk metals and alloys, e.g. copper; (2) materials that are transparent to microwaves, such as fused <b>quartz,</b> <b>glasses</b> made of borosilicate, ceramics, Teflon, etc.; and (3) materials that absorb microwaves which constitute the most important class of materials for microwave synthesis, e.g. aqueous solutions, polar solvent, etc. Dissipation factor (often called the loss tangent, tan δ), a ratio of the dielectric loss (loss factor) to the dielectric constant, is used to predict material’s behavior in a microwave field. The microwave absorption ability of a material is directly proportional to its dissipation factor [34].|$|R
