In this procedure, a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> is first dissolved at a pH where it exists predominantly in its ionized form and then a precipitate of the neutral (un-ionized) species is formed by changing the pH.

The advantage of this method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is quite small. However, the performance of the method may be affected by the formation supersaturated solutions.|$|E

Then, a {{graduated}} tube filled with water is inverted over the side tube dipping in a trough filled with water. A small <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> is weighed exactly in a small stoppered bottle and is dropped in the Victor Meyer's tube and sealed immediately.The bottle falls on the asbestos pad and its contents suddenly change into vapour, blows out the stopper and displaces an equal volume of air in graduated tube. The volume of air displaced is measured by taking the graduated tube out, closing its mouth with thumb and dipping in a jar filled with water. When water levels {{inside and outside the}} tube is equal, the volume of air displaced is noted. The atmospheric pressure and laboratory temperature are noted.|$|E
50|$|However, {{when this}} effect has been {{corrected}} for, {{by dividing the}} heat capacity by the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> in a body, the resulting specific heat capacity {{is a function of}} the structure of the substance itself. In particular, it depends on the number of degrees of freedom that are available to the particles in the substance; each independent degree of freedom allows the particles to store thermal energy. The translational kinetic energy of substance particles which manifests as temperature change is only one of the many possible degrees of freedom, and thus the larger the number of degrees of freedom available to the particles of a substance other than translational kinetic energy, the larger will be the specific heat capacity for the substance. For example, rotational kinetic energy of gas molecules stores heat energy in a way that increases heat capacity, since this energy does not contribute to temperature.|$|E

Two hundred nanomoles of 10 substances that have a wide range of chemical structures were topically applied for 30 min and the total body distribution was measured after 96 h. The <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> present in the stratum corneum reservoir after 30 -min application was measured by liquid scintillation counting after tape-stripping the treated area. A linear relationship exists between the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> in this reservoir x(nmol · cm- 2) and the total amount of radioactivity distributed in the body and excreta y(nmol · cm- 2) after 96 h.

In response, I outline a realist approach to the ontology of substance intolerance, including hypersensitivity conditions. I defend a view of these conditions as a subtype of disease. Specifically, a substance intolerance is a disease whose pathological process(es) are realized upon exposure to a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> of a particular type, and this quantity would normally not cause {{the realization of the}} pathological process(es).

40|$|The {{behavior}} of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in soil {{is determined by}} several factors including adsorption, mobility and degradation. Adsorption, directly or indirectly, influences the other factors. Adsorption process is generally evaluated by using adsorption isotherms representing {{the relationship between the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> adsorbed per unit weight and concentration of the substance in solution at equilibrium. They allow determination of the adsorption constant, which is directly proportional to the adsorption of PCBs in soil. PCBs are very insoluble in water, so they tend to accumulate in the lipids. This is the reason why polychlorinated biphenyls are more strongly adsorbed in soils with higher organic matter content. To obtain the adsorption isotherm were used standard solutions of PCB 101 with initial concentrations: 0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1 and 2 g/ml. The adsorption constants were in order: 3072 ml/g for chernozem, 2943 mg/l for chromic luvisol, 998 mg/l for aluviosol and 1443 mg/l for anthrosol.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of ‘legal highs’ or ‘new psychoactive substances’ (NPS) on the Irish market is reflective of their appearance in many countries, with some notable exceptions. The official {{response to the}} situation is examined here by looking at Irish controlled drugs legislation and drug enforcement policies as enacted {{in recent years and}} their effects on academic research on NPS. The philosophy and practice of outright bans of scheduled substances has not been effective in delivering the stated aims of illicit drug control, namely harm reduction. With these legislative changes, we have witnessed the removal of the ‘legitimate’ sale and open marketing of a number of NPS to the general public in commercial retail premises. However, as legislation was enacted, suppliers and vendors rapidly changed the contents of their legal high products from now controlled to non-controlled substances. We have found that it is administratively challenging to perform scientific research on controlled substances at academic institutions. It is desirable to gather analytical, pharmacological, and toxicological data on these substances as they emerge on the market but due to the restrictive nature of licensing requirements, once a substance or generic class of substances is controlled, this becomes more difficult. The facts that any <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance,</b> no matter how small, is controlled, the nomenclature used to describe compounds is not consistent within the enacted legislation and the use of catch-all classes of compounds with the intention of controlling many similar molecular structures, all create problematic issues for academic researchers...|$|E

We also confirmed that this method is appropriate for analysis of ionic and also organic substances, however for practical use of analysis drinking water sources further technological development of this method is needed.

Maternal health and wellbeing through pregnancy and antenatal bonding also {{play a key role}} in determining bonding postnatally, but the extent to which these relationships may be disrupted by poor mental health or substance use is unclear. This study aimed to examine the extent to which mother-fetal bonding, substance use and mental health through pregnancy predicted postnatal mother-infant bonding at 8  weeks. Participants were 372 women recruited from three metropolitan hospitals in Australia. Data was collected during trimesters one, two and three of pregnancy and 8  weeks postnatal using the Maternal Antenatal Attachment Scale (MAAS), Maternal Postnatal Attachment Scale (MPAS), the Edinburgh Antenatal and Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Depression and Anxiety Scales (DASS- 21), frequency and <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use (caffeine, alcohol and tobacco) as well as a range of demographic and postnatal information. Higher antenatal bonding predicted higher postnatal bonding at all pregnancy time-points in a fully adjusted regression model.

This study extends previous work on the mother's felt bond to her developing child by drawing on a large sample of women and documenting the pattern of this bond at three time points in pregnancy and at 8  weeks postnatally. Utilising multiple antenatal waves allowed precision in isolating the relationships in pregnancy and at key intervention points.

MethodsWe searched 7 electronic databases and bibliographies of previous studies to identify eligible randomized trials. Two independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risks of bias. We performed random effects meta-analyses. We assessed quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. ResultsWe included 41 studies with 5, 227 participants. No significant differences were observed between acupuncture and comparators (passive controls, sham acupuncture, treatment as usual, and active interventions) at post-intervention for relapse (SMD − 0. 12; 95 %CI − 0. 46 to 0. 22; 10 RCTs), frequency of substance use (SMD − 0. 27; − 2. 67 to 2. 13; 2 RCTs), <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> use (SMD 0. 01; − 0. 40 to 0. 43; 3 RCTs), and treatment dropout (OR 0. 82; 0. 63 to 1. 09; 22 RCTs). We identified {{a significant difference in}} favor of acupuncture versus comparators for withdrawal/craving at post-intervention (SMD − 0. 57, − 0. 93 to − 0. 20; 20 RCTs), but we identified evidence of publication bias. We also identified a significant difference in favor of acupuncture versus comparators for anxiety at post-intervention (SMD − 0. 74, − 1. 15 to − 0. 33; 6 RCTs). Results for withdrawal/craving and anxiety symptoms were not significant at longer follow-up. Safety data (12 RCTs) suggests little risk of serious adverse events, though participants may experience slight bleeding or pain at needle insertion sites. ConclusionsAvailable evidence suggests no consistent differences between acupuncture and comparators for substance use. Results in favor of acupuncture for withdrawal/craving and anxiety symptoms are limited by low quality bodies of evidence...|$|E
40|$|A {{literature}} {{survey showed that}} metals may be estimated both by column chromatography and by many methods employing paper chromatography, including removal of the metal from the paper, direct comparison, measurement of spot size. Radioactivity methods, and particularly by photometric estimation directly on paper. Photometric estimations on paper present many practical advantages, but require careful standardisation of conditions. Factors affecting the production of reproducible chromatograms and the principles of photometric estimation on paper are discussed. The object of the experimental work was to study spectrophotometric methods of estimation directly on paper. A method of ensuring complete and reproducible development of copper and nickel by rubeanic acid is described. The lack of uniformity of paper by transmitted light is shown {{to be much more}} apparent than by reflected light and this suggests that very small scanning areas should not be used in transmission work. It is shown that, even when slits as large as 15 sq. mm. are used in the estimation of non-chromatographed spots, results based on reflection are more precise than those based on transmission. Rendering the paper transparent appeared to present some advantages both in reflection and in transmission work, but measurements on dry paper were found to be more suitable for routine use. Chromtograms run on narrow strips were scanned by transmission and estimated both by a minimum transmittance method and by a method involving interrogation of the total <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> in the spot. Chromatograms run on broad rectangular sheets were estimated by a minimum reflectance method. This method was used in preference to the transmission methods of analysis. The recommended method of estimating 0. 25 to 2. 5 μg of copper to an accuracy ± 5 % in the presence of relatively large quantities of nickel, mercuric mercury, cadmium, and bismuth, involves separation by descending chromatography using butanol 3 N HCl, development in rubeanic acid, cutting out the spots, measuring the reflectance at their centre at 660 m...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the calculation of}} harmful substance deposition (air pollution) from the point source (Slanèo, et al., 2001) using equation (1). The point source shall be understood as e. g. chimneys of factory, heat plant, incinerator, boiler plant, local heating plant, etc. The theoretical calculation of concentration (1), or deposition (8) {{is based on the}} study of transfer and dispersion of pollution in air (Slanèo, et al., 2000 a). The movement of pollution in air consists of a movement of the air itself and a relative movement of pollution particles and air, while the movement of harmful substance in the smoke trail is under the influence of turbulent diffusion, convection and gravitation. Molecular diffusion is not important in this process. When calculating concentrations (1) and deposition (8) of air pollution on a particular place near the source, it is assumed that the air speed is constant, the direction of wind does not change with the height and the source of air pollution is time-constant. The change in the wind speed with the height depends on the stability class of atmosphere (temperature gradient) (Slanèo, et al., 2000 a) and it is calculated using equation (10). The theoretical calculation of concentration and or deposition of harmful substance from the point source (1) and (8) shall be applied if the harmful substance particles, which leave the source, have the same density (composition), shape (spherical) and size. The experimental observations of dust deposition showed the significance of 0. 1 - 20 µm particles. The application of equation (1) to calculate the concentration is conditioned, in addition to the recognition of source parameters and meteorological conditions, by the recognition of the particle sedimentation speed, which changes with the size of particle radius (2). For a practical calculation of deposition it is therefore necessary to know the differential distribution function f(r) of particle radii, which can be {{made on the basis of}} the granulometric analysis of particles emitted by the source and to determine the mean sedimentation speed of particles (3), or eventually to use one of the mean particle radius types (4), (5), (6) in formula (2). If we know the parameters of the harmful substance source and meteorological conditions, then, using equation (8), it is possible to determine the harmful substance deposition using one of equations (3), (4), (5),(6). Equation (8) re{{presents the}} <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance,</b> which falls down per 1 second on 1 m 2 of surface. In practice the deposition is calculated for a period of 30 days. Providing the meteorological conditions (temperature gradient, direction and speed of wind) and source parameters (H,w,d,G), of which the value of uH, or h can be determined, remain unchanged, the deposition will be calculated using equation (8) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} ‘social supply’ {{has emerged as}} a term used both in the UK, and internationally, to {{describe}} drug distribution that is non-commercially motivated and almost exclusively found between friends and acquaintances. Social suppliers have increasingly been presented as actors who are qualitatively different to drug dealers (proper), in relation to their motivation and their activity. As a result, they have increasingly become identified as a group who should be distinguished as such legally (Police Foundation, 2000; Release, 2009). While social supply behaviours can be identified in wider research literature relating to recreational drug use, there is a relative gap in regard to in-depth accounts of social supply activity, and in regard to a social supply definition. In a similar way, heroin and crack cocaine user-dealers - a group who are also perhaps not best understood as profit motivated suppliers - have received insufficient academic attention, with the majority of research references failing to go beyond typologies that recognise them simply as suppliers who also use. With research indicating that social supply permeates a meaningful section of adolescent and adult drug markets, along with evidence to suggest that drug supply embodies one of limited options for addicted drug users to fund their habit, this thesis explores how far we can understand these behaviours as drug dealing (proper). Using qualitative in-depth interviews and case studies, this interpretivist research design develops existing ideas, as well as highlighting emergent social supply and user-dealing themes. Findings from this research indicate that social supply behaviours are usefully understood through a theoretical application of ‘normalisation’ (Parker et al., 1998) and ‘drift’ (Matza, 1964) and are wider in scope than those currently recognised by the literature base. The research findings also indicate the importance of the notion of ‘economies of scale’ - an incentive for drug users to obtain a larger <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> for a cheaper price. Notions of reciprocity also feature, with group obligation providing a rationale for involvement in social supply. The findings are also suggestive of the idea that user-dealing - understood through the theoretical gaze of Bourdieu’s ‘Theory of Practice’ (1990) - is characterised by limited distribution, minimal profit and explicated as a less harmful option than other crimes undertaken to fund drug dependence. This thesis concludes with the proposal that a conceptual shift towards ‘minimally commercial supply’ offers a more realistic and inclusive means of conceptualising both social supply and user-dealing activity. Possible ways forward therefore include the implementation of this term as a distinct offence that focuses on intent, thereby presenting a more proportionate approach than current policy responses for these groups allow.
