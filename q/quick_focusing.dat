40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the utility of}} magnified narrow-band imaging (NBI) endoscopy for diagnosing and treating minute pharyngeal neoplasia. METHODS: Magnified NBI gastrointestinal examinations were performed by the first author. A magnification hood {{was attached to the}} tip of the endoscope for <b>quick</b> <b>focusing.</b> Most of the examinations were performed under sedation. Magnified NBI examinations were performed for all of the pharyngeal lesions that had noticeable brownish areas under unmagnified NBI observation, and an intrapapillary capillary loop (IPCL) classification was made. A total of 93 consecutive pharyngeal lesions were diagnosed as IPCL type IV and were suspected to represent dysplasia. Sixty-two lesions of approximately 1 mm in diameter were biopsied in the clinic, and 17 lesions with larger diameters were resected by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) at the Hiroshima University Hospital. In addition to the histological diagnoses, the lesion diameters were microscopically measured in 45 of the 62 biopsies. Thirty-four of the 62 biopsied patients received endoscopic follow up. RESULTS: Minute pharyngeal lesions were diagnosed in 93 of approximately 3000 patients receiving magnified NBI examinations at the clinic. Of the 93 patients with IPCL type IV lesions, 80 were men, and 13 were women. Fifty-six were drinkers, and 57 were smokers. Two had esophageal cancer. Twenty-one lesions were located on the posterior hypopharyngeal wall, and 72 lesions were located on the posterior oropharyngeal wall. All 93 lesions were flat and showed similar findings in the magnified and unmagnified NBI examinations. Although almost all of the IPCL type IV lesions showed faint redness when examined under white light, it was difficult to diagnose the lesions using only this technique because the contrast was weaker than that achieved in the NBI examinations. Of the 93 lesions, only 3 had diameters greater than 2. 1 mm. Sixty-two lesions of approximately 1 mm were biopsied in the clinic, whereas 17 larger lesions were treated by ESD at the Hiroshima University Hospital. Of the 79 pharyngeal lesions that were biopsied or resected by ESD, 5 were histologically diagnosed as high-grade dysplasia, 39 were diagnosed as low-grade dysplasia, and 39 were determined to be non-dysplastic lesions. There were no cancerous lesions. Histologically, abnormal cell size variations and increased nuclear size were observed in all of the high-grade dysplasia lesions, while the incidence of these findings in the low-grade dysplasia lesions was low. Of the 62 biopsied lesions, 45 were microscopically measurable. The measured diameters ranged from 0. 1 to 2. 0 mm. The dysplasia ratios increased with the diameters. A follow-up endoscopic examination of the 34 biopsied patients found the rate of complete resection by biopsy to be 79 %. The largest lesion in which complete resection was expected was a low-grade dysplasia of 1. 9 mm in diameter. CONCLUSION: Minute pharyngeal lesions suspected to be dysplasia that are identified by NBI magnifying endoscopy should be biopsied to determine the diagnosis and further treatment...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new autofocusing method for {{microbiological}} specimens, such as cells. The proposed focusing method used a <b>quick</b> <b>focus</b> estimation named “depth from diffraction”, {{based on a}} diffraction pattern in a defocused image of a biological specimen. Since this method can estimate the focal position of the specimen from only a single defocused image, it can easily realize high-speed autofocusing. To demonstrate the proposed method, continuous focusing was applied to focus tracking of a swimming paramecium, in combination with two-dimensional tracking. This allowed three-dimensional tracking of the paramecium for 75 s to be successfully demonstrated. I...|$|R

5000|$|Instead {{of meeting}} the Blitzkrieg head-on, Boyd {{suggested}} {{what he called the}} [...] "counter-blitz", where small groups of equally mobile forces would pick away at the lines of thrust and then {{move on to the next}} in a series of hit-and-run attacks. There was no necessity to retain any sort of front line, and the attacks deliberately moved from point to point in order to avoid being bogged down or getting trapped. The idea was not to force the blitz to lose its ability to maneuver, but instead upset its ability to understand where it should be maneuvering to—the attacker would have no idea which of these counteroffensives represented a real threat, and would have to respond to all of them. The key idea was to [...] "Smash blitz offensive by inconspicuously using fast-tempo/fluidity-of-action and cohesion of counter-blitz combat teams as basis for shifting of forces and <b>quick</b> <b>focus</b> of air and ground effort to throttle momentum, shatter cohesion, and envelop blitz in order to destroy adversary's capacity to resist." [...] The battle was less about the weapons than it was about the ability to command them; it was believed that the US's devolved command structure would be able to react to changes on the battlefield more quickly than their Soviet counterparts, overwhelming the Soviets ability to maintain cohesion as their higher-echelon commanders became overwhelmed with reports from so many small actions.|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Many {{contemporary}} {{approaches to}} talent management are unaffordable. This paper seeks to summarise some key {{findings of a}} five-year investigation into quicker and more affordable routes to creating high performance organisations. It aims to suggest a practical and much more cost-effective way of quickly achieving multiple corporate objectives and measurable benefits for both people and organisations is often being overlooked. Design/methodology/approach – A programme of critical success factor, “issue” and other surveys was complemented with a five-year evaluation of more recent case studies to understand early adoptions of performance support and to assess their results and implications. The applications examined were discussed with the relevant technical architect and the results obtained corroborated with commissioner/user performance data and/or documented assessments/reactions. Findings – Recruiting exceptional people – even if affordable – can create a host of problems {{if they are not}} properly managed, which is often the case. Paying for talented people may make little sense for organisations that cannot harness or capture and share what they do differently. Talent needs to be relevant to what an organisation is seeking to do and critical success factors for excelling in key roles, and what top performers do differently in these areas captured and shared. Research limitations/implications – Evaluations of performance management need to consider all the objectives that are beneficially impacted. Practical implications – One can avoid certain general, expensive, time consuming and disruptive corporate programmes in an area such as talent management and adopt <b>quick,</b> <b>focused,</b> cost effective alternatives that generate large returns on investment, and quickly deliver multiple benefits for people and organisations. Performance support can enable average performers wherever they may be to excel at difficult jobs. Social implications – A wider range of people can be helped to do difficult jobs. Originality/value – The paper summarises the main findings of an investigation that has identified deficiencies of contemporary approaches to talent management, identifies an approach which if strategically adopted can enable relevant talent in terms of how to excel at key roles to be developed as and when required, and sets out the benefits of Talent Management 2, of which performance support is a central element...|$|R

The present study investigated {{to the best of our}} knowledge for the first time in what way speaking modifies the patterns of fixations and gaze movements while looking at paintings. Ninety nine university students looked at four paintings selected to cover different art historical typologies for periods of 15 minutes each while gaze movement data were recorded. After 10 minutes, the participants of the experimental group were asked open questions about the painting. Speaking dramatically reduced the duration of fixations and painting area covered by fixations while at the same time increasing the frequencies of fixations, gaze length and the amount of repeated transitions between fixation clusters. These results suggest that the production of texts as well-organised sequences of information, structures the gazes of art beholders by making them <b>quicker,</b> more <b>focused</b> and better connected...|$|R
