40|$|This study {{analyzes}} early Cather {{family history}} in Virginia, the subsequent move of the Cathers to Nebraska, {{and the impact}} of the Cather family on Willa Cather and some of her novels. Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 s move from Virginia to Nebraska, and her family 2 ̆ 7 s subsequent years {{have been the subject of}} numerous biographies, articles, and scholarly papers. The arrival of Cather 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aunt</b> and uncle, Franc and George Cather, and the years they spent pioneering before the coming of Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 s family have received much less notice by scholars. Willa Cather has been credited with writing about the Nebraska she knew as she grew from childhood to young womanhood in the state. A bounty of Cather family documents make clear that the author drew not only from her own experiences but also from the stories she must have heard about the burgeoning country from her Uncle George and Aunt Franc. The iconic West in Cather 2 ̆ 7 s fiction owed much to the lives of George and Franc Cather and the friends and family who followed them to Nebraska. ^ The first half of the study focuses on the beginnings of the Cather family in Virginia, tracing the family from Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s colonial days, through the Civil War, and finally, through the period of Reconstruction. It also looks at why the Cathers ultimately left Virginia and what opportunities they hoped to find in the West. The study then moves to the lives of the first Nebraska Cathers, George and Franc—Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aunt</b> and uncle—and their first ten years on the Great Plains. A detailed interpretation about their daily lives, their concerns, their achievements and the difficulties they encountered help illuminate the future writing career of Willa Cather. The study ends with an analysis of Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 s immediate family, their early experiences, and how their relationship with Nebraska differed from that of earlier Cathers. ...|$|R

40|$|A rare {{familial}} cancer syndrome involving childhood {{brain tumors}} (CBT), breast cancer, sarcomas {{and an array}} of other tumors has been described (Li and Fraumeni 1969, 1975, 1982, 1987). A survey of CBT identified through the Connnecticut Tumor Registry in 1984 revealed a high frequency of CBT, leukemia and other childhood cancer in siblings of CBT patients (Farwell and Flannery, 1984). Other syndromes such as neurofibromatosis and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome have also been associated with CBT; however, no systematic family studies have been conducted {{to determine the extent to}} which cancer aggregates in family members of CBT patients. This family study was designed to determine the frequency of cancer aggregation overall or at specific sites, to determine the frequency of known or potentially hereditary syndromes in families of CBT patients, and to determine a genetic model to characterize familial cancer syndromes and to identify specific kindreds to which such a model(s) might apply. This study includes 244 confirmed CBT patients referred to the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between the years 1944 and 1983, diagnosed under the age of 15 years and resident in the U. S. or Canada. Family histories were obtained on the proband 2 ̆ 7 s first (parents, siblings and offspring) and second degree (proband 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>aunts,</b> uncles and grandparents) relatives following sequential sampling scheme rules. To determine if cancer aggregates in families, we compared the cancer experience in the population to that expected in the general population using Connecticut Tumor Registry calendar year, age, race and sex-specific rates.

40|$|Joy Kogawa is a {{well known}} Japanese-Canadian poet and novelist. Her award-winning autobiographical novel, Obasan (1981),[1] {{examines}} the personal wartime internment experience of the author through the fictionalized persona of Naomi Nakane and her Aunt Emily Kato. Obasan, the title character, is Naomi 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> other <b>aunt,</b> the one who raises her when World War II destroys the family. Emily is a political activist, the voice of protest and conscience in the novel, while the narrator, Naomi, has to work through her own silence and that of all Japanese-Canadians.

3000|$|To {{probe the}} role of social ties on {{political}} talk a little deeper, we also test whether the density and type of relationship type has a direct effect on non-migrant political interest. The survey includes a question asking respondents to select the kinds of kinship ties they maintain in the U.S. including spouse, parent (s), children, sibling (s), uncle (<b>s)</b> and/or <b>aunt</b> (<b>s),</b> grandparent (s), cousin (s), niece (s) and/or nephew (s). We created two dichotomous variables from this question. First, we estimate the independent effect of relationship type in a variable that takes the value of one if the social tie was “close” (spouse, child, sibling) and zero if the social tie involved a “distant” relative. Relationship type {{had no effect on}} any non-migrant political awareness indicators. Second, we estimate if the density of social ties plays {{a significant role in the}} political talk of non-migrants with their political discussion partners. Recall that we estimate the treatment effect of having “any” or “no” migrant relatives in the U.S. in the initial political talk model. DR estimates show that having two or more kinship ties in the U.S. does have a positive and significant effect on political talk in the pre-election and post-election panel waves. Mexican non-migrant voters are 5 % more likely to discuss politics if they had more than two migrant social ties in the first wave and 6 % more likely in the last wave. Neither the relationship type nor number of ties treatment variables had independent effects on any other dependent variable (political interest or perceived efficacy of elections). 14 [...]...|$|R

40|$|Although much {{information}} {{is known about}} how Emily Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 s paternal family affected her life and poetry, very little is understood concerning the influences of her matrilineal relatives [...] the Norcrosses. In fact, {{most of what we}} do know about the Norcrossses has been blurred by scholarly misinterpretation, maligned by sexist derision, and obscured by a paucity of biographical detail. Yet, by her own profession, Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Aunt</b> Lavinia Norcross and Cousins Louisa and Frances were among the most significant figures in her life. Along with her Norcross grandparents, Cousin Emily, and Uncle Joel, these formidable individuals helped create a familial environment in which Dickinson felt encouraged to seek self-expression, to act independently, and [...] above all [...] to think. This biographical study examines the lives of these central individuals in Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 s life in order to consider {{the ways in which the}} Norcross family legacy nurtured the poet. By so doing, the research provides a broader cultural context for identifying the social forces which helped shape the world in which Dickinson lived. ^ Chapter I focuses on the influence of the poet 2 ̆ 7 s grandparents, Joel and Betsey Fay Norcross, and their important role in the founding of Monson Academy and support of women 2 ̆ 7 s education. Chapter II examines the life of Cousin Emily Lavinia Norcross, specifically her year with Dickinson at Mount Holyoke Female Seminary and the model she later provided as an independent woman devoted to a profession. Chapter III considers the effect of gregarious Joel Warren Norcross. Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 s pivotal 1850 letter to him, in many ways, marks the beginning of her adult writing career. Chapter IV studies the lives of Aunt Lavinia and Uncle Loring Norcross, with close attention to the prototypic model of sisterhood Aunt Lavinia and the poet 2 ̆ 7 s mother represented. Chapter V investigates the early influence of Loo and Fanny Norcross, especially their significant months with Dickinson in Cambridgeport where she was treated for a mysterious eye ailment. Lastly, Chapter VI discusses the Norcross cousins 2 ̆ 7 involvement in the heady literary life of Concord, Massachusetts and offers a new theory as to the possible fate of Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 s long correspondence to them. ...|$|R
40|$|May Swenson Poetry Award Volume 4, with foreward by Maxine Kumin. Although {{the poems}} in this {{collection}} are not narrative, they do present a narrative, gradually unspooling {{the tale of the}} poet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> rebel <b>aunt,</b> who left the family 2 ̆ 2 to marry a Chinaman 2 ̆ 2 in the 1930 s. It 2 ̆ 7 s an old story, full of poignancy, mystery, family pride, and doubt. When the aunt returns to die, the poet, now grown, discovers in herself the need to reclaim the connections that her family had severed. She travels to China several times—to learn. Gradually, through wide-eyed insightful poems, we see the poet rebuild with her Chinese cousins a sense of generation, family, and humanity—bridging over all that that divides us.

40|$|Where 2 ̆ 7 s Charley?, {{a musical}} spoof {{of a classic}} English farce, is a hilarious parody of Victorian social lunacy. The only {{collaboration}} between Broadway veterans George Abbott and Frank Loessor, Where 2 ̆ 7 s Charley? is a captivating and very funny romp. Set in 1902 in Oxford University, Two Oxford chums, Jack and Charley, have invited two lovely young ladies to their college rooms for lunch. Charley has arranged for Donna Lucia, his Brazilian aunt, to act as chaperone, as required by Victorian morality. When Donna Lucia fails to arrive, the quick thinking lads hatch a plot to impersonate her.

40|$|Women Gathered on Flat Rooftops and Thumbprints in Black Coffee is a {{creative}} dissertation that examines {{the lives of}} Arab women living in Jordan and Arab immigrants living in the United States. The first portion of the dissertation, Women Gathered on Flat Rooftops is {{an excerpt from the}} early portion of the novel by the same name. These first 53 pages provide the background of the characters and highlights aspects that are culturally specific to the women of the stories. For example, issues of arranged marriages, funeral practices, women 2 ̆ 7 s custody rights are all illustrated through these early stories. The early portion of the novel provides the situation as well as the structure of the overall story. While the situations that the women in this portion of the novel experience are specific to contemporary Amman, Jordan, the fundamental concerns of women addressed in this novel are cross-cultural. ^ The second portion of the dissertation, Thumbprints in Black Coffee is comprised of poems that reveal the Arab-American immigrant experience. Most of the poems included in this section tell the story of various members of the author 2 ̆ 7 s own family and demonstrate how Arab-Americans are torn between two worlds.

40|$|Baby Book is a 12 -minute {{work for}} soprano and orchestra. It sets three poems from Chloe Yelena Miller 2 ̆ 7 s {{collection}} of the same name. It will later be expanded into a six-movement work. The cycle explores miscarriage, pregnancy, and motherhood. I. Great Aunt Dora II. Objects III. Children 2 ̆ 7 s Pool Game Great Aunt Dora is a real person; she is the poet 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> own great <b>aunt,</b> a dearly beloved family matriarch. This poem is a conversation between {{the mother and the}} growing child inside her. Great Aunt Dora passed away before she could meet the child. Thus, the conversation is bittersweet, but full of fondness and reminiscence. It is a beautiful vignette that unites these generations. 2 ̆ 2 Great Aunt Dora 2 ̆ 2 has the appeal of a familiar lullaby, with enough interest in the rhythm, harmony, and orchestral color to lend a novel sound. 2 ̆ 2 Objects 2 ̆ 2 is at its heart a lament. A mother grieves her child and struggles with having no tangible means of recognizing her loss as with other deaths, which further isolates her. Several musical devices unify this movement. The chords of C minor and A♭ Major 7 are used frequently and create a sense of harmonic ambiguity. A variation of the latter, A♭-D-E♭-G, creates an even more striking, dissonant chord which colors the most dramatic, painful moments of the work. A prominent motive, here and throughout the cycle, is heard on the text 2 ̆ 2 There 2 ̆ 7 s nothing to wear, carry [...] . 2 ̆ 2 and is recalled both in powerful and quiet moments, a reminder of this profound loss. 2 ̆ 2 Children 2 ̆ 7 s Pool Game 2 ̆ 2 emerges directly from 2 ̆ 2 Objects. 2 ̆ 2 The title implies lighthearted amusement. Indeed, after the opening quote from 2 ̆ 2 Objects, 2 ̆ 2 the musical material transforms into something more playful, yet somehow disquieting. The true intention of this movement reveals itself only at its end, and it resonates in a much deeper place in our hearts. The composer hopes this cycle will foster dialogue about miscarriage as part of the healing process and will recognize and celebrate women through these shared experiences...|$|R
40|$|The Kurt Roberg Collection {{focuses on}} the {{immigration}} and wartime experiences of Kurt Roberg {{and other members of}} the Roberg and Marx families, in addition to documentation on the genealogy of the families. The collection contains considerable correspondence, official and other documents, photographs and genealogical research. Kurt Walter Roberg was born in Celle, Germany on May 16, 1924, the younger son of the merchant Victor Roberg originally of Lemförde, Germany and Selma (called Frieda, née Marx) of Baiertal, Germany. His older brother was Hans Werner (later Harry) Roberg. Victor Roberg had moved to Celle in 1906 and it was there that Kurt Roberg grew up, attending the Städtische Oberrealschule (later the Hermann-Billung-Schule) until November 1938. After his father Victor was arrested during Kristallnacht, Kurt went to live with his uncle Wilhelm Marx in Rotterdam while changing his schooling, studying motor and automobile repairs. His parents and brother emigrated from Holland to New York in April 1940. During the German invasion of Holland in May 1940, Kurt narrowly escaped the bombardment of Rotterdam. In March 1941 he left for New York, via Berlin and Lisbon, arriving in June. In October 1942 Kurt’s father Victor Roberg died. On August 18, 1943 Kurt Roberg was called to active duty in the U. S. Army, three months after his brother Harry had begun his military training at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. At Camp Adair, Oregon and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri Kurt Roberg trained as a radio and telegraph operator in the 884 th Field Artillery Battalion, 70 th Infantry Division. In November 1944 he was transferred to Fort Ord CA. The following month he became an American citizen, and served in the Pacific Theatre of War. From February 1945 until March 1946 he was stationed in New Caledonia, then the Philippines, primarily on the island of Leyte. His brother Harry served as part of the 531 st Engineer Shore Regiment, which participated in the Battle of Normandy as support for the landing of vehicles and supplies on Utah beach and the disassembling of mines. Wilhelm Marx survived the war and the Nazi occupation of Holland in hiding in Rotterdam, but several other family members were lost. His sister, Babette Marx, was deported from Baiertal in October 1940 to Camp de Gurs and died in Auschwitz in 1942. Kurt Roberg's aunt Sophie Roberg and her son Heinz of Diepholz disappeared in Poland while her other son, Günther Roberg, immigrated to Palestine on the S. <b>S.</b> Patria. Another <b>aunt,</b> Marta Roberg of Lemförde, died during a deportation to Poland in the spring of 1942. After the war Kurt Roberg entered the photographic wholesale business, where he worked at Service Photo Suppliers, later for many years at the Joshua Meier Corporation until his retirement in 1989. In June 1957 he married Constance Altman, who died in 1989. They had a daughter, Inez, and a son Paul. After his retirement he turned to writing, photography and traveling, including authoring an autobiography (Zwischen Ziegeninsel und Stadtgraben, 2005; and A Visa or Your Life, 2009).
