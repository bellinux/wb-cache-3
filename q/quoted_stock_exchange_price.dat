40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{models for}} accurate prediction of price changes on electronic <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> by utilizing autoregressive and logistic methods. Prices on these electronic <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> also called ECNs, are solely determined by where orders {{have been placed}} into the order book, unlike traditional <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges</b> where <b>prices</b> are determined by an expert market maker. Identifying the significant variables and formulating the models will provide critical insight into the dynamics of prices on ECNs. Whereas previous research has relied on simulated data to test market strategies, this analysis will utilize actual ECN data. The models recognize patterns of asymmetry and movement of the shares in the order book to formulate accurate probabilities for possible future price changes. On traditional <b>stock</b> <b>exchanges,</b> <b>price</b> changes could only occur as quickly as human beings could enact them. On ECNs, computerized systems place orders on behalf of traders based on their preferences, resulting in price changes that reflect trader activity almost instantaneously. The quickness of this automation on ECNs forces the re-evaluation of commonly held beliefs about stock price dynamics. Previous strategies developed for trading on ECNs have relied mainly on price fluctuations to gain profits. This thesis uses the formulated models to design profitable strategies that use accurate prediction rather than price variability...|$|R

Empirical research does not provide conclusive support for either positions. The authors examine the Tokyo <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>price</b> limit system to test these hypotheses.

There have been periods when the Zimbabwe <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> (ZSE) move drastically up and down, but without any apparent economic news or stimulus, therefore it has become hard to predict share prices or to explain changes in stock prices using fundamental news. This research examines movement of returns to a portfolio of stocks after public news about them is released. It also examines why other stocks move to high returns without identifiable public news. The intention of the methodology in this research was to measure {{the extent to which}} individuals and corporates regard the operations and reaction of the Zimbabwe <b>Stock</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>prices.</b> Considering that there is limited comprehension of the <b>stock</b> <b>exchange</b> by the general masses, a sample was drawn from only a few knowledgeable individuals.
