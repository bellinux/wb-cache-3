50|$|Macadamia trees, {{or their}} nuts, had many {{different}} names during this period: in New South Wales {{they were called}} Bush Nuts or Mullimbimby Nuts; further north they were called <b>Queensland</b> <b>Nuts</b> or Bauple Nuts (or Bopple and Popple); and in all areas they were known as Australia Nut, Poplar and Nut Oak. Aboriginal groups {{in each of the}} localities where the nuts were found wild had named them: boombera was common in New South Wales, the Pine River groups called them burrawang; and in most of Queensland they were called kendel or kindal kindal.|$|R
50|$|The park’s {{main purpose}} {{is to protect the}} area’s {{exceptional}} scientific values. Mount Bauple shares its name with the bauple or bopple nut, the local name for the nut from the commercial <b>Queensland</b> <b>nut</b> tree Macadamia integrifolia. While this plant is cultivated extensively in Queensland and overseas, its natural distribution is extremely limited, and its status in the wild is listed as vulnerable. The commercial value of the species adds considerably to the importance of protecting the wild population.|$|E
50|$|Common {{names of}} the trees are, Australian nut and <b>Queensland</b> <b>nut.</b> Species are “smooth shelled macadamia” called Macadamia integrifolia and “rough shelled macadamia” called Macadamia tetraphylla. Macadamia ternifolia is also the name used for M. integrifolia. Macadamia integrifolia is native to Australia where it grows in rain forests and close to streams. Macadamia tetraphylla is native to Southeastern Queensland and Northeastern New South Wales. The oil content ranges from 65% to 75% and sugar content ranges from 6% to 8%. These factors result in {{variable}} colors and texture when the nuts are roasted under the same conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Macadamia is a genus of four {{species of}} trees {{indigenous}} to Australia and constituting {{part of the}} plant family Proteaceae. They are native to north eastern New South Wales and central and south eastern Queensland. The tree is commercially important for its fruit, the macadamia nuts [...] (or simply [...] "macadamia"). Other names include <b>Queensland</b> <b>nut,</b> bush nut, maroochi nut, bauple nut, and Hawaii nut. In Australian Aboriginal languages, the fruit is known by names such as bauple, gyndl, jindilli, and boombera. Previously, more species with disjunct distributions were named as members of this genus Macadamia. Genetics and morphological studies more recently published in 2008 show they have separated from the genus Macadamia, correlating less closely than thought from earlier morphological studies. The species previously named in the Macadamia genus may still be referred to overall by the descriptive, non-scientific name of macadamia; their disjunct distributions and current scientific names are: ...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} insect {{pollination}} of macadamia, Macadamia integrifolia Maiden & Betche (Proteaceae) was undertaken in southern <b>Queensland.</b> Both initial <b>nut</b> set and final nut set increased with increasing insect visitation. Pollination was not limiting yield at this site, however, as racemes exposed to 6 h of bee visitation per day had similar final nut set to racemes constantly exposed (10 h of bee visitation). Honey bees and Trigona spp. bees visited the racemes in approximately equal numbers at the site. Approximately 50 bee visits were made per {{day to the}} racemes exposed for 6 h. Individual flowers remained attractive to insects for approximately 3 days. Hence approximately 150 visits per raceme are required to ensure adequate pollination. The flowers on a raceme opened {{over a period of}} approximately 7 days with peak opening at around day 2. Flowers opened during the day, peaking in the early afternoon...|$|R
