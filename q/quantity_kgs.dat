40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an integrated study of nanocatalysts for heterogenous catalytic and electrochemical processes using pure ruthenium (Ru) with mixed-phase and platinum-based nanomaterials synthesized by continuous-flow chemistry. There are three major {{challenges to the}} application of nanomaterials in heterogenous catalytic reactions and electrocatalytic processes in acidic solution. These challenges are the following: (i) controlling the size, shape and crystallography of nanoparticles to give the best catalytic properties, (ii) scaling these nanoparticles up to a commercial <b>quantity</b> (<b>kg</b> per day) and (iii) making stable nanoparticles {{that can be used}} catalytically without degrading in acidic electrolytes. Some crucial limitations of these nanostructured materials in energy conversion and storage applications were overcome by continuous-flow chemistry. By using a continuous-flow reactor, the creation of scalable nanoparticle systems was achieved and their functionality was modified to control the nanoparticles’ physical and chemical characteristics. The nanoparticles were also tested for long-term stability, to make sure these nanoparticles were feasible under realistic working conditions. These nanoparticles are (1) shape- and crystallography-controlled ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles, (2) size-controlled platinum-metal (Pt-M= nickel (Ni) & copper (Cu)) nanooctahedra (while maintaining morphology) and (3) core-shell platinum@ruthenium (Pt@Ru) nanoparticles where an ultrathin ruthenium shell was templated onto the platinum core. Thus, a complete experimental validation of the formation of a scalable amount of these nanoparticles and their catalytic activity and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid medium, hydrolysis of ammonia borane (AB) along with plausible explanations were provided...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The four casein {{proteins}} in goat milk are encoded by four closely linked casein loci (CSN 1 S 1, CSN 2, CSN 1 S 2 and CSN 3) within 250 kb on caprine chromosome 6. A deletion in exon 12 of CSN 1 S 1, so far reported only in Norwegian goats, {{has been found}} at high frequency (0. 73). Such a high frequency is difficult to explain because the national breeding goal selects against the variant's effect. Methods In this study, 575 goats were genotyped for 38 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) located within the four casein genes. Milk production records of these goats {{were obtained from the}} Norwegian Dairy Goat Control. Test-day mixed models with additive and dominance fixed effects of single SNP were fitted in a model including polygenic effects. Results Significant additive effects of single SNP within CSN 1 S 1 and CSN 3 were found for fat % and protein %, milk yield and milk taste. The allele with the deletion showed additive and dominance effects on protein % and fat %, and overdominance effects on milk <b>quantity</b> (<b>kg)</b> and lactose %. At its current frequency, the observed dominance (overdominance) effects of the deletion allele reduced its substitution effect (and additive genetic variance available for selection) in the population substantially. Conclusions The selection pressure of conventional breeding on the allele with the deletion is limited due to the observed dominance (overdominance) effects. Inclusion of molecular information in the national breeding scheme will reduce the frequency of this deletion in the population. </p...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a large scale ’adiabatic’, namely non-radiative and non-dissipative, cosmological smooth {{particle}} hydrodynamic simulation we compare the entropy profiles of the gas and the dark matter (DM) in galaxy clusters. The <b>quantity</b> <b>Kg</b> = Tgρ − 2 / 3 g provides a measure for the entropy of the intra-cluster gas. By analogy with the thermodynamic variables of the gas the velocity dispersion of the DM is associated with a formal temperature and thereby KDM = σ 2 DMρ− 2 / 3 DM is defined. This DM entropy is related to the DM phase space density by KDM ∝ Q − 2 / 3 DM. In accord with other studies the DM phase space density follows a power law behaviour, QDM ∝ r− 1. 82, which corresponds to KDM ∝ r 1. 21. The simulated intra-cluster gas has a flat entropy core within (0. 8 ± 0. 4) Rs, where Rs is the NFW scale radius. The outer profile follows the DM behaviour, Kg ∝ r 1. 21, in close agreement with X-ray observations. Upon scaling the DM and gas densities by their mean cosmological values we find that outside the entropy core a constant ratio of Kg/KDM = 0. 71 ± 0. 18 prevails. By extending the definition of the gas temperature to include also the bulk kinetic energy the ratio of the DM and gas extended entropy is found to be unity for r � 0. 8 Rs. The constant ratio of the gas thermal entropy to that of the DM implies that observations of the intra-cluster gas can provide an almost direct probe of the DM.

The control group which was represented by 20 heifer which had been reared in stable in years 2010 - 2011 the number 20 Holstein cows. The evaluation of parameters was set on the first standardized lactation in the range of 240 to 305 days. Into observation of reproductive indicators was included the age of the first calving (days), insemination interval (days) and servis period (days). From the productive indicators there was the <b>quantity</b> of milk (<b>kg),</b> the content of fat in the milk (%), quantity of fat in the milk (kg), and the content of proteins...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine the allocation of the costs of the farm asparagus, and how the performance of asparagus farming in Pelaga village, Petang District, Badung Regency in terms of BEP analysis and DOL. Costs necessary for the asparagus farming is quite high, Rp. 28. 310, 00 for a year. Results of the BEP analysis showed that farming asparagus is able to provide benefits to farmers, where the selling price per kg of asparagus in the market (Rp. 28. 310. 00) greater than the BEP selling price (Rp. 17. 625, 00) and the price per kg in the market is stable because there was no change to the current price. In terms of quantity, the quantity sold farmers still higher (1. 420 kg / year) of the BEP <b>quantity</b> (381 <b>kg</b> / year) with an average land area of ?? 15 acres. DOL analysis value of 1, 37 shows that farm profits will continue to grow in line with increased production in which every 10 % increase in production will drive the gain of 13, 7 %. Asparagus farming is very promising views of BEP analysis and DOL, but in the field there are many farmers experiencing farm constraints, government assistance and mertanadi koperasi particularly needed to assist both in terms of production facilities and technical farming and land development asparagus very well done to make a point higher profits for farmers...|$|R
40|$|Brewer’s {{spent grain}} {{is the major}} {{by-product}} in beer production. It is produced in large <b>quantities</b> (20 <b>kg</b> per 100 liters of produced beer) throughout the year at a low cost or no cost, and due to its high protein and carbohydrates content {{it can be used}} as a raw material in biotechnology. Biotechnological processes based on renewable agro-industrial by-products have ecological (zero CO 2 emission, eco-friendly by-products) and economical (cheap raw materials and reduction of storage costs) advantages. The use of brewer’s spent grain is still limited, being basically used as animal feed. Researchers are trying to improve the application of brewer’s spent grain by finding alternative uses apart from the current general use as an animal feed. Its possible applications are in human nutrition, as a raw material in biotechnology, energy production, charcoal production, paper manufacture, as a brick component, and adsorbent. In biotechnology brewer’s spent grain could be used as a substrate for cultivation of microorganisms and enzyme production, additive of yeast carrier in beer fermentation, raw material in production of lactic acid, bioethanol, biogas, phenolic acids, xylitol, and pullulan. Some possible applications for brewer’s spent grain are described in this article including pre-treatment conditions (different procedures for polysaccharides, hemicelluloses, and cellulose hydrolysis), working microorganisms, fermentation parameters and obtained yields. The chemical composition of brewer’s spent grain varies according to barley variety, harvesting time, malting and mashing conditions, and a quality and type of unmalted raw material used in beer production. Brewer’s spent grain is lignocellulosic material rich in protein and fibre, which account for approximately 20 and 70 % of its composition, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is a three-year study (carried out during 2007, 2008 and 2009) of the {{morphological}} characteristics variability in three genotypes NS-Džin (Forage Sorghum), Zora (Sudan grass) and Siloking (interspecies hybrid) depending on the amount of nitrogen used for plant nutrition. For the height and mass analysis of fresh stems and leaves as well as leaf mass and leaf portion in the total biomass, samples were taken from the first swath when the effect of the used nitrogen amounts was the greatest. The results have shown that there are significant variations in the tested properties between the genotypes. The Siloking genotype had the highest total biomass during all three years. The largest leaf mass was found in the NS-Džin genotype, while the Zora genotype had the highest leaf portion in the three-year average. The effect of nitrogen use depended on the weather conditions, as well as the layout of the rainfall, so that the optimal <b>quantity</b> was 105 <b>kg</b> ha- 1 during the first and the second year, and 150 kg ha - 1 during the third year...|$|R
