Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent <b>quantum</b> <b>dot.</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{controversy}} on the <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> dephasing mechanisms (between {{pure and}} inelastic) is re-examined by isolating the <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> from their substrate {{by using the}} appropriate limits of the ionization energy theory and the quantum adiabatic theorem. When the phonons in the <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> are isolated adiabatically from the phonons in the substrate, the elastic or pure dephasing becomes the dominant mechanism. On the other hand, for the case where the phonons from the substrate are non-adiabatically coupled to the <b>quantum</b> <b>dots,</b> the inelastic dephasing process takes over. This switch-over is due to different elemental composition in <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> as compared to its substrate. We also provide unambiguous analyses as to understand why GaAs/AlGaAs <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> may only have pure dephasing while InAs/GaAs <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> give rise to the inelastic dephasing as the dominant mechanism.

25|$|Other {{emerging}} PV technologies include organic, dye-sensitized, quantum-dot, and Perovskite photovoltaics. OPVs {{fall into}} the thin-film category of manufacturing, and typically operate around the 12% efficiency range which {{is lower than the}} 12–21% typically seen by silicon based PVs. Because organic photovoltaics require very high purity and are relatively reactive they must be encapsulated which vastly increases cost of manufacturing and meaning that they are not feasible for large scale up.

However these dye-sensitized photovoltaics present storage problems because the liquid electrolyte is toxic and can potentially permeate the plastics used in the cell. <b>Quantum</b> <b>dot</b> solar cells are <b>quantum</b> <b>dot</b> sensitized DSSCs and are solution processed meaning they are potentially scalable, but currently they peak at 12% efficiency.

Silver <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> are created in both a one-phase and two-phase synthesis in chloroform or toluene, and are passivated by dodecanethiol.

The synthesized <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> were studied by FESEM, HRTEM, X-ray diffraction, UVâvisible spectroscopy, photoluminescence and FTIR spectroscopy. The X-ray diffraction pattern of synthesized <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> shows the amorphous nature.

On the basis of optical absorbance by UVâvisible spectroscopy, a direct band gap has been detected. FTIR spectra suggest that the as-grown Si <b>quantum</b> <b>dots</b> are partially oxidized which is due exposure of samples to air after taking out the samples from the chamber. PL spectra show a broad peak at 444 Â nm, which may be attributed to the configuration of amorphous Si <b>quantum</b> <b>dots.</b> A slight shift in the peak position has been observed with increase in working pressure from 5 Â Torr to 10 Â Torr.
