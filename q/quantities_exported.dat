The food balance sheet shows the food items for human consumption, along with how it is produced, used, imported/exported, and how it benefits the society (per capita supply). The total quantity produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred {{since the beginning of}} the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the <b>quantities</b> <b>exported,</b> fed to livestock + used for seed, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per capita supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking in it. Data on per capita food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products also in terms of dietary energy value, protein and fat content.|$|E

40|$|Estimates {{of factors}} {{influencing}} Cameroon's exports of cocoa, coffee and cotton are derived {{in a system}} of equations using the Engle-Granger and Johansen co-integration and error-correction representation procedures. Two co-integrating vectors involving cocoa and coffee exports as endogenous variables are identified in the system while tests for exogeneity of cotton exports are consistent with the independence of cotton from the other two commodities. These findings are corroborated by estimates of a restricted error-correction model which lead to acceptance of the hypothesis that cocoa and coffee exports are indeed determined endogenously to the system and not linked to cotton exports. Statistical significance of the error-correction terms for cocoa and coffee validates the existence of an equilibrium relationship among the variables in each of these co-integrating vectors. The combined short-run dynamic effect of lagged quantities of cocoa and coffee, export/domestic price ratio and GDP jointly explain changes in exports of cocoa whereas lagged <b>quantities</b> <b>exported</b> do not seem to have a significant short-run dynamic effect on changes in coffee exports...|$|E

The authors studied the current market structure {{through the use of}} a double-logarithmic gravity equation. The gravity model provided the foundation for a quantitative forecasting model which projected future trade quantities under different Brexit scenarios. The model was based on a sample representing 98 per cent of Germany’s total <b>export</b> <b>quantity</b> of passenger cars. Diagnostic tests suggest that the model was robust and efficient in estimating trade quantities. Findings. All Brexit scenarios were estimated to negatively impact the <b>export</b> <b>quantities</b> of passenger cars from Germany to the UK. Lower tariffs were projected to benefit <b>export</b> <b>quantities</b> of passenger cars from Germany, nevertheless, a weaker economy in the UK due to the Brexit is estimated to reduce demand for passenger cars and offset the benefits of trading with low tariffs.

40|$|Attempts {{are being}} made to export {{potatoes}} from India since 1970 s but the <b>quantities</b> <b>exported</b> have been negligible and variable {{in spite of the}} fact that Indian potatoes are technically excellent and moderately export competitive. With the liberalization of Indian economy and establishment of WTO it was expected that the WTO regime would increase the price level in the international market due to implementation of proposed heavy cut in agricultural subsidies by the developed countries and hence the export of potatoes from India may get a boost. Under this backdrop, the study has ascertained the effect of establishment of WTO on export of potatoes from India. The study has indicated a declining export competitiveness of Indian potatoes in the post-WTO era, which requires immediate attention of policymakers as well as researchers in India to improve the export competitiveness by increasing the productivity and decreasing the cost of production. A need has been emphasized on giving some export incentives and easing some of the major infrastructural bottlenecks. Frozen-potatoes export from India had depicted competitiveness in the post-WTO era which can be encouraged to capture the fast expanding market of the product.

To optimize it, one must first know the quantity of nitrogen that can be provided by the soil: nitrogen <b>quantities</b> <b>exported</b> by O witnesses constitue a good estimate of that parameter and usually lie in the range 80 to 110 kg per ha per year. It must also {{be kept in mind}} that fertilization advice is given for a determined production level, and on a probabilistic basis for example, the application of 100 units of nitrogen will result in a yield of 10 tons of dry matter per ha with a 73 % probability for phleum, and only with a 42 % probability for english rye-grass. From {{the point of view of}} environment conservation, it can be shown that the input of nitrogen fertilizers considered as optimal by the agronomists represent a rather low level of risk.

We used autovial microcolumns incubated for a period ranging between 0 and 156 days. Our results showed that {{a large proportion of}} radioactivity remained extractable by methanol up to 64 days of incubation, amounting from 44. 5 to 80. 2 % of initial radioactivity. Mineralisation of 14 C-phenanthrene began tardily, after the decrease of mineralisation of the soil organic matter. Throughout incubation, mineralisation remained slow and weak, of co-metabolic type, and only 2 % of the quantity applied was mineralised over a period of 156 days. The amount of radioactivity leached varied considerably during incubation. Under {{the effect of}} water percolation of 64 mm, the <b>quantities</b> <b>exported</b> in equivalent 14 C-phenanthrene went from 0. 90 to 0. 48 ng/g of soil between 0 and 35 days, then increased up to 1. 5 ng/g at 100 days. The radioactivity present in pore water displayed the same dynamic and the same variations. For pore water, this radioactivity represented, in equivalent phenanthrene, 0. 09 ng/g of soil up to 46 days, then increased rapidly to reach 0. 5 ng/g at 65 days. In both cases (leachates and pore water), enrichment in radioactivity due to the presence of a high proportion of polar compounds reached 89 %. Lastly, the formation of non-extractable residues progressed very slowly up to 45 days (5. 9 to 13 % of the amount applied), after which there was a marked increase, i. e. to 20. 7, 32. 2 and 35. 8 % at 52, 64 and 156 days, respectively. These increases in radioactivity in different compartments of soil are correlated with mineralisation of phenanthrene due to preliminary production of degradation products. Thus, the capacity of a soil to degrade and mineralise phenanthrene plays a determining role in the distribution of its residues between the soil solution and the solid matrix. Overall, our results suggest that in agricultural soils contaminated by strongly adsorbed organic compounds, water pollution and sequestration are primarily controlled by degradation...|$|E
40|$|This {{historical}} {{episode is}} one of a profound transformation of this trade sector that between the end of the 17 th century and the middle of the following one, namely the emergence and strengthening of the position of the British merchants in detriment to the competitive position of the merchants of other nationalities, including the Portuguese. During this period, England, the first import market for wine, a market undergoing substantial changes, dissociating itself from the traditional European wine of the previous century: the German and Italian wine, and associating itself with the Iberian Peninsular wines such as the Sherry (Jerez) and Port (vinho do Porto). Of course, the French wines retain a central place in the present story but this will not be our focus here. If the gravity center of consumption is dislocated to England, the production regions are also reorganized. The Iberian Peninsula is the rising side of the trade, directly competing with the French wines. Behind this change, there lies {{the emergence of a new}} population of wine merchants, especially in the case of the Port wine that I study in the present research. If the overall transformation of the sector, on an aggregated level has already been done, there is still a need of a research based on more detailed information. In this respect, I will insist above all on the transformation and evolution of the population of Port shipper from 1700 to 1833, basing my argument on historical documents from the Portuguese and English customs and other regulatory entities in Portugal. I will present the evolution of the population of wine merchants based on quantitative data (<b>quantities</b> <b>exported)</b> and qualitative data on Port shippers. I will focus the constitution and evolution of the core British merchants that will obtain and maintain the dominance on the sector. The second point of my research is the mechanism of transformation and renewal of the population of Port merchants of either group: British and non-British (as it is often referred to in the historical records). The perspective I will adopt is straightforwardly evolutionary. In the first section I present the issue I will tackle: the evolution of trade and the population of Port shippers from roughly 1700 to 1833. In the second section, I will develop some basic theoretical concepts from evolutionary theory in order to adapt them to the present study. In the third part, I analyze the evolution of the population of wine merchants on quantitative data of exports, other economic and institutional indicators (market trends, regulation policy, market structure, etc.). I will finish with the presentation of a summary table that will compare the situation at the beginning of the period and the outcome of the evolutionary transformation of the sector at the end of the 1830 s. ...|$|E
