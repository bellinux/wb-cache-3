Grasping the wealth of experimental results requires understanding the medium modification of quarkonia and disentangling hot and cold-matter effects.

Large elliptic flow, consistent with calculations from ideal hydrodynamics, was a key to the concept of strongly interacting <b>Quark</b> <b>Gluon</b> <b>Plasma,</b> a new form of matter discovered at RHIC. The idea of the constituent quark scaling, proposed by Voloshin, and its observation at RHIC is widely regarded as a proof for a deconfinement phase transition.

50|$|He {{has made}} {{significant}} contribution to the discovery of the <b>Quark</b> <b>Gluon</b> <b>Plasma</b> (QGP) in the laboratory. This state of matter existed in the first few microsecond old Universe. In such matter, quarks and gluons are de-confined and move freely in volumes much larger than nucleonic scales. In order to achieve such matter in the laboratory, temperatures of the order of 1012 degrees Kelvin need to be created. The quark-gluon plasma allows for studying transport properties like viscosity, thermal conductivity, opacity and diffusion co-efficient of QCD matter. Dr. Mohanty has several significant papers on signatures that experimentally confirm the existence of QGP, related to observation of strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, jet quenching effect, and partonic collectivity.|$|E

5000|$|Quarkonia {{are bound}} states of heavy flavour quarks (charm or bottom) and their antiquarks. Two types of quarkonia have been {{extensively}} studied: charmonia, which {{consist of a}} charm quark and an anti-charm, and bottomonia made of a bottom and an anti-bottom quark. Charm and anticharm quarks {{in the presence of}} the <b>Quark</b> <b>Gluon</b> <b>Plasma,</b> in which there are many free colour charges, are not able to see each other any more and therefore they cannot form bound states. The [...] "melting" [...] of quarkonia into the QGP manifests itself in the suppression of the quarkonium yields compared to the production without the presence of the QGP. The search for quarkonia suppression as a QGP signature started 25 years ago. The first ALICE results for charm hadrons in PbPb collisions at a centre-of-mass energy √sNN = 2.76 TeV indicate strong in-medium energy loss for charm and strange quarks that is an indication of the formation of the hot medium of QGP.|$|E
5000|$|This is only {{possible}} {{due to a}} new process, the gluon fusion, as shown by Rafelski and Müller in 1981. The top section of the figure shows gluon fusion in form of Feynman diagrams: gluons are the wavy lines; strange quarks are the solid lines; time runs from left to right. The bottom section is the process where the heavier quark pair arises from the lighter pair of quarks shown as dashed lines. The gluon fusion process occurs almost ten {{times faster than the}} quark based strangeness process, and allows achievement of the high thermal yield where the quark based process would fail to do so during the duration of the [...] "micro-bang". The gluon collisions here are occurring within the thermal matter phase and are thus different from the high energy processes that can ensue {{in the early stages of}} the collisions when the nuclei crash into each other.
