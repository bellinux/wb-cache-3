5000|$|The Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) is a Crown {{corporation}} that retails and distributes alcoholic beverages throughout {{the province of}} Ontario, Canada.

Such sales had been banned outright in 1916; thus, the creation of the LCBO marked an easing of the province's temperance regime (see Prohibition in Canada).|$|R

5000|$|It is a {{prohibition}} or dry county, though Harrodsburg and Pleasant Hill allow {{the sale of}} alcohol by the drink. In Kentucky this {{is referred to as}} being a [...] "moist" [...] county; wet counties sell package <b>liquor,</b> <b>wine</b> and beer, dry counties sells no alcoholic beverages (legally), while [...] "moist" [...] counties serve only by the drink, primarily in restaurants. Boyle County (Danville) immediately to the south along US Hwy 127, is wet, with two large liquor outlet stores, plus several smaller, privately owned ones.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the county}} being a dry county, {{alcoholic}} drink sales {{have long been}} allowed in restaurants seating at least 100 diners and deriving at least 70% of their total sales from food. Beer, wine and spirits {{can be purchased at}} licensed liquor stores, drug stores and grocery outlets, beer can be purchased at most convenience stores [...] The locals classify this as a [...] "damp" [...] or [...] "moist" [...] county.

5000|$|In {{the more}} narrow sense, taxes {{denominated}} as [...] "excise" [...] taxes are usually taxes on events, {{such as the}} purchase of a quantity of a particular item like gasoline, diesel fuel, beer, <b>liquor,</b> <b>wine,</b> cigarettes, airline tickets, tires, trucks, etc. These taxes are usually included in the price of the item—not listed separately like sales taxes usually are. To minimize tax accounting complications, the excise tax is usually imposed on quantities like gallons of fuel, gallons of wine or drinking alcohol, packets of cigarettes, etc. and are usually paid initially by the manufacturer or retailer.|$|R
2500|$|Despite (or {{perhaps because}} of) the {{traditional}} importance of appellations for wine, {{there has been}} little harmonisation of national provisions within the European Union. Member States delimit the specified areas of production and determine the rules and appellations which apply: the European Commission restricts itself to publishing the information provided by the Member States. Appellations are usually the geographical name of the area in which the wine is produced, although there are some historical exceptions: muscadet and blanquette in France, cava and manzanilla in Spain and vinho verde in Portugal. The appellations are not necessarily unique: Cava may refer either to a quality sparkling <b>wine</b> <b>psr</b> produced in Spain or to a Greek table wine which has been aged (as a transliteration of [...] "Κάβα").|$|R
2500|$|European Union rules {{governing}} {{the production of}} wine ("the product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, whether or not crushed, or of grape must") are considerably longer than Community trade mark law: the main text, the Regulation on the common organisation {{of the market in}} wine (No1493/1999), runs to over 46,000 words. To be considered as a [...] "quality wine", the wine must come from a specified region and be associated with a [...] "geographical indication" [...] or appellation: indeed, the technical term used in the Regulation is quality <b>wine</b> <b>psr,</b> with the [...] "psr" [...] standing for [...] "produced in a specified region". Wines which do not meet this requirement may only be marketed as table wine.|$|R
