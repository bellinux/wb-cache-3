50|$|Quenching: Carbon steel with {{at least}} 0.4 wt% C is heated to {{normalizing}} temperatures and then rapidly cooled (quenched) in water, brine, or oil to the critical temperature. The critical temperature {{is dependent on the}} carbon content, but as a general rule is lower as the carbon content increases. This results in a martensitic structure; a form of steel that possesses a super-saturated carbon content in a deformed body-centered cubic (BCC) crystalline structure, properly termed body-centered tetragonal (BCT), with much internal stress. Thus <b>quenched</b> <b>steel</b> is extremely hard but brittle, usually too brittle for practical purposes. These internal stresses may cause stress cracks on the surface. <b>Quenched</b> <b>steel</b> is approximately three to four (with more carbon) fold harder than normalized steel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A gas {{quenching}} process {{to deal with}} steel slag and its characteristics of the new technology was briefly introduced. The grinding characteristics, mineral phases of gas <b>quenching</b> <b>steel</b> slag and the potential economic benefits of using it as cement mixing material was studied by compared to heat-stew steel slag.

50|$|Tempering: This is {{the most}} common heat {{treatment}} encountered, because the final properties can be precisely determined by the temperature and time of the tempering. Tempering involves reheating <b>quenched</b> <b>steel</b> to a temperature below the eutectoid temperature then cooling. The elevated temperature allows very small amounts of spheroidite to form, which restores ductility, but reduces hardness. Actual temperatures and times are carefully chosen for each composition.|$|E
50|$|Except in {{rare cases}} where maximum {{rigidity}} and hardness are needed, such as the untempered steel used for files, <b>quenched</b> <b>steel</b> is almost always tempered to some degree. However, steel is sometimes annealed through a process called normalizing, leaving the steel only partially softened. Tempering is sometimes used on normalized steels to further soften it, increasing the malleability and machinability for easier metalworking. Tempering may also be used on welded steel, to relieve some of the stresses and excess hardness created in the heat affected zone around the weld.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{examples of}} <b>quenched</b> <b>steel</b> {{may come from}} ancient Mesopotamia, with a relatively secure example of a fourth-century BCE quench-hardened chisel from Al Mina in Turkey. Book 9, lines 389-94 of Homer’s Odyssey is widely cited as an early, possibly the first, written reference to quenching:as when a man {{who works as a}} blacksmith plunges a screaming great axe blade or adze into cold water, treating it for temper, since this is the way steel is made strong, even so Cyclops' eye sizzled about the beam of the olive.However, it is not beyond doubt that the passage describes deliberate quench-hardening, rather than simply cooling. Likewise, there is a prospect that the Mahabharata refers to the oil-quenching of iron arrowheads, but the evidence is problematic.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{computer}} simulation of mechanical properties of <b>quenched</b> and tempered <b>steel</b> was investigated. The established method of {{computer simulation}} was applied in prediction of mechanical properties of workpiece with complex form. Design/methodology/approach: The method of computer simulation of mechanical properties of <b>quenched</b> and tempered <b>steel</b> {{was established by}} theoretical analysis of relevant properties which have influence on hardness of <b>quenched</b> and tempered <b>steel,</b> and by regression analysis based on experimental results. Findings: The new method of prediction of mechanical properties of <b>quenched</b> and tempered <b>steel</b> was established. Proposed method of computer simulation of mechanical properties of <b>quenched</b> and tempered <b>steel</b> is based on predicted steel hardness. Hardness distribution of quenched and tempered workpiece of complex form was predicted by computer simulation of <b>steel</b> <b>quenching</b> using a finite volume method. It was found out that mechanical properties of <b>quenched</b> and tempered <b>steel</b> can be successfully predicted by proposed method. Research limitations/implications: The investigation was done on carbon and low alloyed steel. The further experimental investigations are needed for final verification of established model. Practical implications: The established method could be applied in industrial practice. Originality/value: As-quenched hardness distribution is predicted by involving the results of simple Jominy-test in numerical modelling of <b>steel</b> <b>quenching.</b> Estimation of hardness distribution is based on time, relevant for structure transforma- tion, i. e., time of cooling from 800 to 500 °C (t 8 / 5).

50|$|Steel {{that has}} been arc welded, gas welded, or welded in any other manner besides forge welded, is {{affected}} in a localized area by {{the heat from the}} welding process. This localized area, called the heat-affected zone (HAZ), consists of steel that varies considerably in hardness, from normalized steel to steel nearly as hard as <b>quenched</b> <b>steel</b> near the edge of this heat-affected zone. Thermal contraction from the uneven heating, solidification and cooling creates internal stresses in the metal, both within and surrounding the weld. Tempering is sometimes used in place of stress relieving (even heating and cooling of the entire object to just below the A1 temperature) to both reduce the internal stresses and to decrease the brittleness around the weld. Localized tempering is often used on welds when the construction is too large, intricate, or otherwise too inconvenient to heat the entire object evenly. Tempering temperatures for this purpose are generally around 205 C and 343 C.|$|E
50|$|Very few metals {{react to}} heat {{treatment}} in the same manner, or to the same extent, that carbon steel does, and carbon steel heat treating behavior can vary radically depending on alloying elements. Steel can be softened to a very malleable state through annealing, {{or it can be}} hardened to a state nearly as rigid and brittle as glass by quenching. However, in its hardened state, steel is usually far too brittle, lacking the structural integrity to be useful for most applications. Tempering is a method used to decrease the hardness, thereby increasing the ductility of the <b>quenched</b> <b>steel,</b> to impart some springiness and malleability to the metal. This allows the metal to bend before breaking. Depending on how much temper is imparted to the steel, it may bend elastically (the steel returns to its original shape once the load is removed), or it may bend plastically (the steel does not return to its original shape, resulting in permanent deformation), before fracturing. Tempering is used to precisely balance the mechanical properties of the metal, such as shear strength, yield strength, hardness, ductility and tensile strength, to achieve any number of a combination of properties, making the steel useful {{for a wide variety of}} applications. Tools such as hammers and wrenches require good resistance to abrasion, impact resistance, and resistance to deformation. Springs do not require as much rigidity, but must deform elastically before breaking. Automotive parts tend to be a little less rigid, but need to deform plastically before breaking.|$|E

The work of Campbell and Fink, however, shows that this continuous linear relationship is not correct. Rather, it was shown that the body-centered-cubic (BCC) structure is the stable structure from 0 to 0. 6 wt%C with the c/a ratio equal to unity. An abrupt change in the c/a ratio to 1. 02 occurs at 0. 6 wt%C. The BCT structure forms, and the c/a ratio increases with further increase in carbon content.
