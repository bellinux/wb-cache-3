The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, variable rate suspension springs, <b>quick</b> <b>ratio</b> steering box, heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch turbo-hydramatic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel carburators, and finned aluminum valve covers on the 425 nail head engine.

25|$|In 1970, the GSX {{option was}} {{available}} in only two colors, Saturn Yellow and Apollo White (in 1971 and 1972 6 other colors were available for the GSX). Came with only full black interior. All GSXs had the distinctive full body length black stripe that crossed over the standard equipment rear spoiler and was outlined in red pin stripes.

In the European market, however, the [...] "Sportline" [...] option was available for all body styles except the E 500/500 E, all of which came standard with the Sportline package and every option. The package included sport seating (sedans, not coupés), wider wheels (7" [...] rather than 6.5") with wider profile tyres (205/60 x 15 rather than 195/65 x 15), <b>quick</b> <b>ratio</b> steering and a smaller diameter steering wheel, [...] "Sportline" [...] badges on the front wing moldings and gear knob, a slightly lowered ride height and a specially tuned suspension including shorter, stiffer springs, struts, anti-roll bars, and bushings.|$|E
2500|$|New {{refinements}} {{appeared on}} the 1965 redesign. The Corsa came standard with an instrument panel featuring a [...] speedometer with resettable trip odometer, a 6,000rpm tachometer, cylinder head temperature gauge, analog clock with a sweeping second hand, a manifold vacuum/pressure gauge and fuel gauge. A much better heater system, larger brakes borrowed from the Chevelle, a stronger differential ring gear, a Delcotron alternator (replacing the generator), and significant chassis refinements were made. Out back, a new fully articulated rear suspension virtually eliminated {{the danger of the}} previous generation's swing axles, and was based on the contemporary Corvette Sting Ray (Corvair used coil springs while the Sting Ray uses a transverse leaf). [...] AM/FM stereo radio, in-dash All Weather Air Conditioning, telescopically adjustable steering column, and a Special Purpose Chassis Equipment ("Z17") handling package, consisting of a special performance suspension and <b>quick</b> <b>ratio</b> steering box, were significant new options for 1965.

40|$|The results {{presented}} in this paper show that integrative financial and operating measures of liquidity provide investors and creditors with additional information beyond that provided by static measures of short-term liquidity such as the current and <b>quick</b> <b>ratios.</b> Analyzing a sample of restaurant firms over the period 1994 - 2003, our analysis of these dynamic measures of liquidity provide a drastically different view of short-term solvency than those produced from the static measures. Specifically, the static measures of liquidity imply that restaurant companies are not liquid However, restaurant companies, when evaluated under this integrative framework, were shown to be more liquid based on their financial and operating liquidity than their current and <b>quick</b> <b>ratios</b> implied. Thus, financial analysts, creditors and managers should evaluate both dynamic liquidity measures as well as static measures in their evaluation of the risk associated with covering their short-term obligations when evaluating the short-term financial liquidity and short-term credit worthiness of firms. In addition, careful attention should be paid to both financial and operating measures of liquidity to establish what changes, if any, have occurred in a company’s liquidity position over time. This is an important finding for managers and investors in all industries since short-term illiquidity implies a high risk of default if the banks refuse to refinance {{all or part of the}} debt. This in turn may impact the cost of short-term financing and may result in an impact on their overall financing costs and required returns from equity investors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} hedging {{policies}} {{of oil and}} gas firms for the year 2003. My study shows that firm characteristics are significant determinants of the decision to hedge. Leverage and liquidity were found to be characteristics that have a direct correlation with the decision to hedge. Firms with higher leverage <b>ratios</b> and lower <b>quick</b> <b>ratios</b> hedge more extensively. The significance of these characteristics shows that a need for risk management and mitigation arises when a firm is not financially independent and it relies on external sources of capital. Both these characteristics are also directly related to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s ability to take advantage of and finance investment opportunities...|$|R
50|$|Note that {{inventory}} {{is excluded}} from the sum of assets in the <b>quick</b> <b>ratio,</b> but included in the current ratio. Ratios are tests of viability for business entities but do not give a complete picture of the business' health. If a business has large amounts in accounts receivable which are due for payment after a long period (say 120 days), and essential business expenses and accounts payable due for immediate payment, the <b>quick</b> <b>ratio</b> may look healthy when the business is actually about {{to run out of}} cash.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the liquidity of Polish non-financial companies {{listed on the}} Warsaw Stock Exchange, dividing them into two groups: companies with the intangible to fixed assets ratio higher than the median, deemed to be innovative businesses, and companies with the intangible to fixed assets ratio lower than the median, deemed to be traditional businesses. Our results show that liquidity management is different in these two groups when analyzing the cash conversion cycle, the current and <b>quick</b> <b>ratios,</b> and liquid assets.

40|$|Female Chief Executive Officers lead 2. 4 % {{of the top}} 1000 {{companies}} in the United States (Fortune). Why does such a large gender gap exist? There are many possible reasons. However, since a public company’s goal is to increase its value and maximize its profits, the only acceptable excuse for the continued gender gap is if women CEOs are not as efficient and effective as male CEOs. Financial ratios provide a comparison measurement of efficiency and effectiveness when compared to industry standard ratios commonly computed. This study uses current and <b>quick</b> <b>ratios,</b> inventory turnover ratios, debt to equity ratio, return on assets, asset turnover, net profit margin ratios and price per earning ratios. Data was collected from the financial statements of 118 female-led public companies and ratios were computed and compared to industry averages obtained through Risk Management Association as well as Dunn and Bradstreet and Thompson/Reuter. To account for economic trends, three years of data were collected. The {{results of this study}} indicate that female CEOs’ companies vary from the industry median. The largest variance occurred in liquidity and leverage related ratios. Some correlation between these variances and a negative net profit margin variance was identified...|$|R
