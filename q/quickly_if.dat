5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} flies with deep, slow wingbeats, {{giving it}} a wavelike movement. It can also glide for extended periods with its wings held downwards. Flocks generally fly at height, descending to treetops to feed or roost. Birds can be agile, manoeuvring <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> startled or disturbed. In contrast, they waddle awkwardly on the ground.|$|E
5|$|From early on, {{children}} also assume that language {{is designed for}} communication. Infants treat communication as a cooperative process. Specifically, infants observe the principles of conventionality and contrast. According to conventionality, infants believe that for a particular meaning that they wish to convey, there is a term {{that everyone in the}} community would expect to be used. According to contrast, infants act according to the notion that differences in form mark differences in meaning. Children's attention to conventionality and contrast is demonstrated in their language use, even before the age of 2 years; they direct their early words towards adult targets, repair mispronunciations <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> possible, ask for words to relate to the world around them, and maintain contrast in their own word use.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, astronomers {{began to}} find {{objects in the}} same region of space as Pluto (now known as the Kuiper belt), and some even farther away. Many of these shared several of Pluto's key orbital characteristics, and Pluto started being seen as the largest member of {{a new class of}} objects, plutinos. This led some astronomers to stop {{referring}} to Pluto as a planet. Several terms, including subplanet and planetoid, started to be used for the bodies now known as dwarf planets. By 2005, three trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto (Quaoar, Sedna, and Eris) had been reported. It became clear that either they would also have to be classified as planets, or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers were also confident that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> Pluto were to remain a planet.|$|E

5|$|Despite the storm's {{intensification}} and well-organized satellite appearance, {{the circulation}} failed {{to become better}} defined. In their first discussion on Iris, the NHC mentioned {{the potential for the}} system to degenerate into a tropical wave if it maintained its fast forward speed. One forecaster noted that the center was fragile and that the cyclone could dissipate <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> it encountered stronger wind shear to its south. Although its overall appearance did not change significantly, the Hurricane Hunters reported a closed eye with a diameter 23mi (37km) and a stadium effect (eyewall curvature) on October6. Later that day, Iris reached hurricane strength just southwest of the southern tip of the Dominican Republic, and the NHC remarked that land interaction with the Greater Antilles was the only factor impeding further development. After Iris reached winds of 85mph (140km/h) early on October7, its intensity remained steady for about 24hours. During that time, the satellite appearance became slightly ragged as its outflow became restricted, possibly due to an upper-level low. By late on October7, the area of hurricaneforce winds associated with Iris extended only 25mi (35km) from its 16mi (22km) wide eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by rubbing his body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged {{to blend in with}} its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and {{there is some evidence that}} extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E

25|$|Plasma {{cells are}} {{short-lived}} cells (2–3 days) that secrete antibodies. These antibodies bind to antigens, making them easier targets for phagocytes, and trigger the complement cascade. About 10% of plasma cells survive to become long-lived antigen-specific memory B cells. Already primed to produce specific antibodies, these cells {{can be called}} upon to respond <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> the same pathogen re-infects the host, while the host experiences few, if any, symptoms.|$|E
25|$|DMT is {{commonly}} handled and stored as a fumarate, as other DMT acid salts are extremely hygroscopic {{and will not}} readily crystallize. Its freebase form, although less stable than DMT fumarate, is favored by recreational users choosing to vaporize the chemical as it has a lower boiling point. In contrast to DMT's base, its salts are water-soluble. DMT in solution degrades relatively <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> not stored protected from air, light, and heat in a freezer.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{causes of}} {{congenital}} anomalies include inheritance of abnormal genes {{from the mother}} or the father, {{as well as new}} mutations in one of the germ cells that gave rise to the fetus. Male germ cells mutate at a much faster rate than female germ cells, and as the father ages, the DNA of the germ cells mutates <b>quickly.</b> <b>If</b> an egg is fertilized with sperm that has damaged DNA, {{there is a possibility that}} the fetus could develop abnormally.|$|E
25|$|Green pepper, like black, is {{made from}} the unripe drupes. Dried green peppercorns are treated {{in a way that}} retains the green colour, such as {{treatment}} with sulphur dioxide, canning or freeze-drying. Pickled peppercorns, also green, are unripe drupes preserved in brine or vinegar. Fresh, unpreserved green pepper drupes, largely unknown in the West, are used in some Asian cuisines, particularly Thai cuisine. Their flavour has been described as spicy and fresh, with a bright aroma. They decay <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> not dried or preserved.|$|E

25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable fat or an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more <b>quickly.</b> <b>If</b> the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.|$|E
25|$|When P.clarus males {{compete for}} females, the winners {{are those that}} produce the most {{vibrations}} {{on the surface and}} those that are largest. Contests between females involve less displaying, and physical fights between females are more likely to end in injury or death. The most successful males choose the largest females, as these produce the most eggs and most <b>quickly.</b> <b>If</b> a female that has mated already then finds a larger male, she will often mate again with the larger male. The average clutch is 135eggs. Unlike most of the genus Phidippus, P.clarus females die after one brood has left the nest.|$|E
25|$|Some feed on carrion. Cameras {{show that}} when a dead fish {{is placed on the}} bottom, {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate scavengers appear very <b>quickly.</b> <b>If</b> the fish is large, some scavengers burrow in and eat it from the inside out. Some fish, such as grenadiers, also appear and start feeding on the scavenging inverebrates and amphipods. Other specialization is based on depth distribution. Some of the more abundant upper continental slope fish species, such as cutthroat eel and longfinned hake, mainly feed on epipelagic fish. But generally, the most abundant deep water demersal fish species feed on invertebrates.|$|E

25|$|After his death, his wife, Belle Case La Follette, {{remained}} an influential figure and editor, watching their sons Philip and Robert enter politics. By the mid-1930s, the La Follettes had reformed the Progressive Party {{on the state}} level {{in the form of the}} Wisconsin Progressive Party. The party <b>quickly,</b> <b>if</b> briefly, became the dominant political power in the state, electing seven Progressive congressmen in 1934 and 1936.

25|$|On {{his return}} to the US, Spitzer {{calculated}} that something was wrong with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so <b>quickly.</b> <b>If</b> the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April Phillips {{attempted}} {{to escape from}} the lifeboat, but was recaptured after the captors fired shots. The pirates then threw a phone and a two-way radio dropped to them by the U.S. Navy into the ocean, fearing the Americans were somehow using the equipment to give instructions to the captain. The United States dispatched another warship, amphibious assault ship , to the site off the Horn of Africa. The pirates' strategy was to link up with their comrades, who were holding various other hostages, and to get Phillips to Somalia where they could hide him and make a rescue more difficult for the Americans. Anchoring near shore would allow them to land <b>quickly</b> <b>if</b> attacked. Negotiations were ongoing between the pirates and the captain of Bainbridge and FBI hostage negotiators. The captors were also communicating with other pirate vessels by satellite phone.|$|E
