Based on the {{experimental}} data of entropy change varying with temperature, the regenerative Brayton refrigeration cycle using Gd 0. 94 er 0. 06 as the working substance {{is set up}} for magnetic field changes with 0 - 1 T and 0 - 2 T.

At the higher suction quantities, the maximum lift of the aerofoil was considerably greater than for the Lighthill and Glauert sections previously tested when due allowance was made for the difference in camber. At low suction quantities, there was no improvement. Tests with various slot widths showed that the velocity into the slot {{as well as the}} suction quantity was important in relation to high maximum lift, and that the values of Czm~x achieved with suction were determined more nearly uniquely by the momentmn coefficient rather than by the <b>quantity</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Static pressure measurements made in the slot and ducting indicated that the suction head required at the stall was high, being at least equal to the dynamic head in the slot throat, but that some reduction could be expected from improvements in the slot entry shape. 1.
