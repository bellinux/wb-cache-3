5|$|Tantalum is {{considered}} a conflict resource. Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite–tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted, {{can also be found}} in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report, the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998 – making it the world’s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical <b>questions</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin. However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002–2006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.|$|E

25|$|In the 21st century, <b>questions</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> {{about the}} future of the County Championship in the light of the shaky {{financial}} structure of many counties, poor attendances and the rise of Twenty20 cricket. Doubts have been raised over many decades concerning the competition's viability, yet it still survives. The Changing Face of Cricket (1963) by Clarke and Batchelor, made negative predictions about county cricket.|$|E

The Church says that its use of the legal system is necessary to protect its intellectual property and its right to freedom of religion. Critics say that most of the Church's claims are designed to harass Suppressive Persons, people who impede the progress of the Scientology movement.|$|E

25|$|Although Kevin Sullivan's {{works were}} {{initially}} {{based upon the}} works of Montgomery, Sullivan developed most of his successful Anne-related film properties (Anne of Avonlea, Anne -the Continuing Story, Anne – A New Beginning and Road to Avonlea) based on original material, not directly adapted from Montgomery's books. Many <b>questions</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> in court as to the author’s heirs’ rights in her copyright. The heirs have tried to extend the copyright in Montgomery's unpublished works until 2017 but lost that opportunity in 2004 when the Canadian Parliament rejected the provision they had pursued so ardently for the unpublished works of dead authors.|$|E
25|$|The {{arm of the}} {{condemned}} person is swabbed with alcohol before the cannula is inserted. The needles and equipment used are sterilized. <b>Questions</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about why these precautions against infection are performed despite {{the purpose of the}} injection being death. The several explanations include: cannulae are sterilized during manufacture, so using sterile ones is routine medical procedure. Secondly, the prisoner could receive a stay of execution after the cannulae have been inserted, as happened in the case of James Autry in October 1983 (he was eventually executed on March 14, 1984). Third, use of unsterilized equipment would be a hazard to prison personnel.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its Pittsburgh campus, Carnegie Mellon has a branch campus in the Middle East, Carnegie Mellon University in Qatar, which offers a full undergraduate curriculum with degree programs in computer science, business administration, biology, computational biology, and information systems. The campus is located in Doha’s Education City which is home to multiple other U.S. universities {{all of which are}} funded by the Qatar Foundation. The Qatari campus in particular {{has been the subject of}} criticism due to Qatar’s adherence to Sharia Law and lack of freedom of speech and intellectual freedoms. <b>Questions</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about whether an American institution that values these ideas can provide an equal experience in a community that limits them. Additionally, Carnegie Mellon and other U.S. Universities in Education City have been criticized for being essentially complicit in Qatar's funding of terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda, ISIS, and Hamas and their questionable human rights record by continuing to operate there despite these issues.|$|E

25|$|As an example, the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) {{prepared}} {{in compliance with}} these requirements indicates that the energy sector accounts for 69 per cent of Australia’s emissions, agriculture 16 per cent and LULUCF six per cent. Since 1990, however, emissions from the energy sector have increased 35 per cent (stationary energy up 43% and transport up 23%). By comparison, emissions from LULUCF have fallen by 73%. However, <b>questions</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> by Andrew Macintosh about the veracity of the estimates of emissions from the LULUCF sector because of discrepancies between the Australian Federal and Queensland Governments’ land clearing data. Data published by the Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) in Queensland, for example, show that {{the total amount of}} land clearing in Queensland identified under SLATS between 1989/90 and 2000/01 is approximately 50 per cent higher than the amount estimated by the Australian Federal Government’s National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) between 1990 and 2001.|$|E
25|$|<b>Questions</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> {{over the}} propriety of Gary's conviction. According {{to a group of}} {{supporters}} and a book by investigative journalist David Rose, Gary's lawyer was refused state funding to carry out a defense. There is also evidence that Gary's fingerprints were not held to match the crime scene prints until seven years after, when the case was re-examined, despite Gary having been printed just one year after the murder at a time when all prints in the U.S. were being compared to prints found at the crime sites. They also claim Gary's interview at which he supposedly confessed was not recorded, nor were notes taken, and Gary's confession was written by a police officer in the days following the interview, from his own recollection. When submitted as evidence, the confession was unsigned and undated, and Gary denied having made it. They allege Gary's semen antigen secretion did not match the perpetrator's. Furthermore, a cast made from a bite wound on a victim allegedly did not match Gary's bite-mark pattern. His supporters claimed that the prosecution withheld this evidence at trial.|$|E
