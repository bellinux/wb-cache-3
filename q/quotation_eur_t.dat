40|$|Production of refuse {{derived fuel}} from {{municipal}} solid waste in future shall play a strategic role in an integrated waste management system. The amount of landfilled biodegradable materials thus will be diminished according to provisions of the 1999 Waste Landfill Directive. The aim {{of this article is}} to evaluate cost effectiveness based on cost evaluation of the different complication of the waste pre-treatment equipment complectation and based on regenerable waste quantities in Latvia. The comparison of cost estimates is done in 3 scenarios considering potential waste quantities in Latvia: Scenario I - planned annual waste quantity is 20 kT; Scenario II - 40 kT and Scenario III - 160 kT. An increase in amount of waste and processing capacity means the decrease in costs of mechanical pre-treatment of 1 ton of waste. Thus, costs of mechanical sorting line under different scenarios with capacities of 10 t h- 1, 20 t h- 1 and 80 t h- 1 are <b>EUR</b> 32 per <b>t,</b> <b>EUR</b> 24 per <b>t</b> and <b>EUR</b> 15 per <b>t,</b> respectively. Most feasible cost for a set of mechanical pre-treatment equipment for the capacity of 10 t h- 1 is <b>EUR</b> 32 per <b>t</b> by using rotating drum screener with the following manual sorting. Mechanical pre-treatment equipment of unsorted municipal waste is economically nonbeneficial, when the use of fine (biologically degradable) fraction is not possible. As the sorting of biodegradable kitchen waste is not developed under the current waste management system in Latvia, the lines for mechanical pre-treatment of household waste would be better to install in landfills...|$|R
40|$|I discuss three {{passages}} of Heliodorus' novel Aithiopika {{in the light}} of their connections with some classical tragic antecedents. The wording of 8. 17. 4 is reminiscent of Soph. Oed. Col. 770 - 774. The allusion to Eur. Hel. 1285 - 1286 in 8. 7. 4 recalls not only the form and the content of the Euripidean passage, but also its context. The explicit <b>quotation</b> of <b>Eur.</b> Med. 1317 in 1. 8. 7 points to the paratragic overtones of the following digression and lays the cornerstone on which Heliodorus builds a whole part of his novel...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{calculate}} {{total costs}} {{during the first}} year after diagnosis in 463 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) included during 2006 - 09 (T 2) and compare the results with a similar cohort included in 1996 - 98 (T 1). METHOD: Clinical and laboratory data were collected regularly in both cohorts, and patients completed biannual questionnaires reporting health care utilization and number of days lost from work. RESULTS: Disease activity was similar in both cohorts T 1 and T 2 at inclusion. Significant improvements were seen {{during the first year}} in both cohorts but were more pronounced in T 2. Outpatient care increased and hospitalization decreased in T 2 compared with T 1. Almost 3 % of patients had surgery in both cohorts, but in T 2, only women had surgery. Drug costs were higher in T 2 than in <b>T</b> 1 (<b>EUR</b> 689 vs. <b>EUR</b> 435). In <b>T</b> 2, 12 % of drug costs were direct costs and 4 % were total costs. The corresponding values for T 1 were 9 % and 3 %. In T 1, 50 % were prescribed disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) at inclusion, compared to T 2, where prescription was > 90 %. Direct costs were <b>EUR</b> 5716 in <b>T</b> 2 and <b>EUR</b> 4674 in <b>T</b> 1. Costs for sick leave were lower in T 2 than in <b>T</b> 1 (<b>EUR</b> 5490 vs. EUR 9055) but disability pensions were higher (EUR 4152 vs. EUR 2139), resulting in unchanged total costs. In T 1, direct costs comprised 29 % and indirect costs 71 % of the total costs. The corresponding values for T 2 were 37 % and 63 %. CONCLUSIONS: The earlier and more aggressive treatment of RA with traditional DMARDs in T 2 resulted in better outcomes compared to T 1. Direct costs were higher in T 2, partly offset by decreased sick leave, but total costs remained unchanged.

40|$|Abstract. The large basis spreads {{observed}} on {{the interest rate}} mar-ket since the liquidity crisis of summer 2007 imply that different yield curves are required for market coherent estimation of forward rates with different tenors (e. g. Euribor 3 months, Euribor 6 months, etc.). In this paper we review the methodology for bootstrapping multi-ple interest rate yield curves, each homogeneous in the underlying rate tenor, from non-homogeneous plain vanilla instruments quoted on the market, such as Deposits, Forward Rate Agreements, Futures, Swaps, and Basis Swaps. The approach includes turn of year effects and is ro-bust to deliver smooth yield curves and to ensure non-negative rates also in highly stressed market situations, characterized by crazy roller coaster shapes of the market <b>quotations.</b> The concrete <b>EUR</b> market case is analyzed in detail, using the open source QuantLib implementation of the proposed algorithms. 1...|$|R
30|$|Samples of {{commercial}} activated carbons (AC) obtained from different sources: Norit E Supra USP, Norit B <b>Test</b> <b>EUR,</b> and ML (Baracoa, Cuba) were investigated. The adsorption of acetaminophen, Co[*]=[*] 2500  mg/L, occured in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at pH  1.2 {{in contact with}} activated carbon for 4  h at 310  K in water bath with stirring. Residual acetaminophen was monitored by UV visible. The results were converted to scale adsorption isotherms using alternative models: Langmuir TI and TII, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) and Temkin. Linearized forms of the characteristic parameters were obtained in each case. The models that best fit the experimental data were Langmuir TI and Temkin with R 2 ≥ 0.98. The regression best fits followed the sequence: Langmuir TI[*]=[*]Temkin[*]>[*]DR[*]>[*]LangmuirTII[*]>[*]Freundlich. The microporosity determined by adsorption of CO 2 at 273  K with a single term DR regression presented R 2 [*]>[*] 0.98. The adsorption of acetaminophen may occur in specific sites {{and also in the}} basal region. It was determined that the adsorption process of acetaminophen on AC in SGF is spontaneous (ΔG < 0) and exothermic (−ΔHads.). Moreover, the area occupied by the acetaminophen molecule was calculated with a relative error from 7.8 to 50 %.|$|R

40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI-MS) is being increasingly applied {{to study the}} solution equilibria of metal-ligand systems,[1] together with or in alternative to the techniques traditionally employed to this aim, e. g. potentiometry, UV-Vis, NMR. ESI-MS results are usually different from those obtained by traditional techniques, both in the qualitative (number and stoichiometry of the species observed in solution) and quantitative data (relative concentrations of all species at equilibrium). To our knowledge, a systematic investigation {{of the nature of}} these differences and of their causes is lacking in the literature. In this work, selected aluminium(III) -ligand systems were examined by ESI-MS. The ligands considered were 3 -hydroxy- 2 (1 H) -pyridinone, 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid, citric acid, and ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid. Spectra (in positive and/or in negative ion mode) were obtained at various metal-to-ligand ratios and pH values, and results were compared with those obtained previously [2 - 5] by traditional techniques. For the qualitative results, the main differences between ESI-MS and traditional techniques regard the acidic proton content of the metal-ligand species, and the presence of clusters at ES conditions. The former difference is observed when the complexes in solution have acid-base properties and a high charge (> ± 1), and it is due to the easy of the proton displacement at ES conditions. The formation of clusters is an ES artifact which regards polycarboxylic and polyphosphonic ligands, but it can be minimized by strictly optimizing the instrumental parameters. Other minor ES artifacts are the formation of solvent and cation (or anion) adducts, which usually don’t impair the qualitative analysis. For the quantitative results, the differences between ESI-MS and traditional techniques are more evident for the systems which also show significant qualitative differences, and they are due to different solvents and ionic strengths of the solutions analysed, to a different pH definition, and to the presence of ion response factors in ESI-MS.
