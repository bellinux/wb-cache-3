State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E

Unlike managers, however, these employees move out of employment at a larger than the average rate in the two lower <b>quintiles.</b> This tendency, driven by associate professionals and technicians, appears to have worsened {{at the onset of the}} crisis.

5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings <b>quintile</b> to about 170% for the lowest earning <b>quintile,</b> making the system progressive.|$|E

40|$|Wealth <b>quintiles</b> {{derived from}} {{household}} asset indices are routinely used for measuring socioeconomic inequalities {{in the health}} {{of women and children}} in low and middle-income countries. We explore whether the use of wealth deciles rather than <b>quintiles</b> may be advantageous. We selected 46 countries with available national surveys carried out between 2003 and 2013 and with a sample size of at least 3000 children. The outcomes were prevalence of under-five stunting and delivery by a skilled birth attendant (SBA). Differences and ratios between extreme groups for deciles (D 1 and D 10) and <b>quintiles</b> (Q 1 and Q 5) were calculated, as well as two summary measures: the slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index (CIX). In virtually all countries, stunting prevalence was highest among the poor, and there were larger differences between D 1 and D 10 than between Q 1 and Q 5. SBA coverage showed pro-rich patterns in all countries; in four countries the gap was greater than 80 pct points. With one exception, differences between extreme deciles were larger than between <b>quintiles.</b> Similar patterns emerged when using ratios instead of differences. The two summary measures provide very similar results for <b>quintiles</b> and deciles. Patterns of top or bottom inequality varied with national coverage levels. Researchers and policymakers should consider breakdowns by wealth deciles, when sample sizes allow. Use of deciles may contribute to advocacy efforts, monitoring inequalities over time, and targeting health interventions.
