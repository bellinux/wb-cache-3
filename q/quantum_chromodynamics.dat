5|$|According to <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (QCD), quarks {{possess a}} {{property}} called color charge. There are {{three types of}} color charge, arbitrarily labeled blue, green, and red. Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – antiblue, antigreen, and antired. Every quark carries a color, while every antiquark carries an anticolor.|$|E
5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory similar {{in some ways}} to <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> is equivalent to string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft on the relationship between string theory and <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|QED {{has served}} as the model and {{template}} for all subsequent quantum field theories. One such subsequent theory is <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> which began in the early 1960s and attained its present form in the 1970s work by H. David Politzer, Sidney Coleman, David Gross and Frank Wilczek. Building on the pioneering work of Schwinger, Gerald Guralnik, Dick Hagen, and Tom Kibble, Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} by <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} special {{relativity}} {{can be summarized}} by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime (withc relating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc. Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such as quantum electrodynamics, <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> the Standard Model of particle physics, and general relativity. As such, the parameterc is ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatc is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves. In non-inertial frames of reference (gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames), the local speed of light is constant and equal toc, but {{the speed of light}} along a trajectory of finite length can differ fromc, depending on how distances and times are defined.|$|E
5|$|Two {{terms are}} used in {{referring}} to a quark's mass: current quark mass refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while constituent quark mass refers to the current quark mass plus {{the mass of the}} gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron's mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> binding energy (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately 938MeV/c2, of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about 9MeV/c2; much of the remainder {{can be attributed to the}} field energy of the gluons. See Chiral symmetry breaking.|$|E

25|$|The {{theory of}} <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> was {{formulated}} {{beginning in the}} early 1960s. The theory {{as we know it today}} was formulated by Politzer, Gross and Wilczek in 1975.|$|E
25|$|A goldstone boson is a massless {{excitation}} of a {{field that}} has been spontaneously broken. The pions are quasi-goldstone bosons (quasi- {{because they are not}} exactly massless) of the broken chiral isospin symmetry of <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The QCD vacuum is {{the vacuum}} state of <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (QCD). It {{is an example}} of a non-perturbative vacuum state, {{characterized}} by a non-vanishing condensates such as the gluon condensate and the quark condensate in the complete theory which includes quarks. The presence of these condensates characterizes the confined phase of quark matter. In technical terms, gluons are vector gauge bosons that mediate strong interactions of quarks in <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (QCD). Gluons themselves carry the color charge of the strong interaction. This is unlike the photon, which mediates the electromagnetic interaction but lacks an electric charge. Gluons therefore participate in the strong interaction in addition to mediating it, making QCD significantly harder to analyze than QED (quantum electrodynamics) as it deals with nonlinear equations to characterize such interactions.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally {{observed}} bounds on {{the electric}} dipole moment of the nucleon currently set stringent limits on the violation of time reversal symmetry in the strong interactions, and their modern theory: <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics.</b> Then, using the CPT invariance of a relativistic quantum field theory, this puts strong bounds on strong CP violation.|$|E

25|$|Under some circumstances, {{perturbation}} theory is an invalid approach to take. This {{happens when the}} system we wish to describe cannot be described by a small perturbation imposed on some simple system. In <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> for instance, the interaction of quarks with the gluon field cannot be treated perturbatively at low energies because the coupling constant (the expansion parameter) becomes too large.|$|E
25|$|The eight gluons {{mediate the}} strong {{interactions}} between color charged particles (the quarks). Gluons are massless. The eightfold multiplicity of gluons is labeled {{by a combination}} of color and anticolor charge (e.g. red–antigreen). Because the gluons have an effective color charge, they can also interact among themselves. The gluons and their interactions are described by the theory of <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model groups the electroweak {{interaction}} {{theory and}} <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> into a structure denoted by the gauge group SU(3)SU(2)U(1). The {{formulation of the}} unification of the electromagnetic and weak interactions in the standard model is due to Abdus Salam, Steven Weinberg and, subsequently, Sheldon Glashow. Electroweak theory was later confirmed experimentally (by observation of neutral weak currents), and distinguished by the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{existence}} of quarks was first proposed in 1964, Oscar W. Greenberg introduced the notion of color charge to explain how quarks could coexist inside some hadrons in otherwise identical quantum states without violating the Pauli exclusion principle. The theory of <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> has been under development since the 1970s and constitutes {{an important component of}} the Standard Model of particle physics.|$|E
25|$|For a {{complete}} description of phase diagram it is required {{that one must}} have complete understanding of dense, strongly interacting hadronic matter and strongly interacting quark matter from some underlying theory e.g. <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (QCD). However, because such a description requires the proper understanding of QCD in its non-perturbative regime, which is still far from being completely understood, any theoretical advance remains very challenging.|$|E
25|$|In <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> a quark's color {{can take}} one of three values or charges, red, green, and blue. An {{antiquark}} can {{take one of}} three anticolors, called antired, antigreen, and antiblue (represented as cyan, magenta and yellow, respectively). Gluons are mixtures of two colors, such as red and antigreen, which constitutes their color charge. QCD considers eight gluons of the possible nine color–anticolor combinations to be unique; see eight gluon colors for an explanation.|$|E
25|$|In many {{quantum field}} theories, such as quantum electrodynamics and <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> left- and {{right-handed}} fermions are identical. However, in the Standard Model, left-handed and right-handed fermions are treated asymmetrically. Only left-handed fermions {{participate in the}} weak interaction, {{while there are no}} right-handed neutrinos. This is an example of parity violation. In the literature, left-handed fields are often denoted by a capital L subscript (e.g. L) and right-handed fields are denoted by a capital R subscript.|$|E
25|$|Yang–Mills {{theory is}} a gauge theory {{based on the}} SU(N) group, or more {{generally}} any compact, reductive Lie algebra. Yang–Mills theory seeks to describe the behavior of elementary particles using these non-Abelian Lie groups and {{is at the core}} of the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces (i.e. U(1) × SU(2)) as well as <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> the theory of the strong force (based on SU(3)). Thus it forms the basis of our understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics.|$|E
25|$|Observations of {{the light}} baryons (those made of up, down and strange quarks) imply {{that some of these}} {{particles}} are so similar in terms of their strong interactions that they can be treated as different states of the same particle. In the modern understanding of <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> this is because up and down quarks are very similar in mass, and have the same strong interactions. Particles made of the same numbers of up and down quarks have similar masses and are grouped together.|$|E
25|$|Additionally the Standard Model {{contains}} a high energy unification of the electroweak theory {{with the strong}} force, described by <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics.</b> It also postulates a connection with gravity as yet another gauge theory, but the connection is as of 2015 still poorly understood. The theory's prediction of the Higgs particle to explain inertial mass has stood recent empirical tests at the Large Hadron Collider, and thus the Standard model is now considered the basic and more or less complete description of particle physics as we know it.|$|E
25|$|Phenomenology {{at lower}} {{energies}} in <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> {{is not completely}} understood due to the difficulties of managing such a theory with a strong coupling. This may be the reason why confinement has not been theoretically proven, {{though it is a}} consistent experimental observation. Proof that QCD confines at low energy is a mathematical problem of great relevance, and an award has been proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute for whoever is also able to show that the Yang–Mills theory has a mass gap and its existence.|$|E
25|$|In principle, {{the physics}} within a nucleus {{can be derived}} entirely from <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (QCD). In {{practice}} however, current computational and mathematical approaches for solving QCD in low-energy systems such as the nuclei are extremely limited. This {{is due to the}} phase transition that occurs between high-energy quark matter and low-energy hadronic matter, which renders perturbative techniques unusable, making it difficult to construct an accurate QCD-derived model of the forces between nucleons. Current approaches are limited to either phenomenological models such as the Argonne v18 potential or chiral effective field theory.|$|E
25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for {{the strong}} nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the {{strong nuclear force}} is called <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Tamiaki Yoneya {{discovered}} {{that all the}} known string theories included a massless spin-two particle that obeyed the correct Ward identities to be a graviton. John Schwarz and Joel Scherk came {{to the same conclusion}} and made the bold leap to suggest that string theory was a theory of gravity, not a theory of hadrons. They reintroduced Kaluza–Klein theory as a way of making sense of the extra dimensions. At the same time, <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> was recognized as the correct theory of hadrons, shifting the attention of physicists and apparently leaving the bootstrap program in the dustbin of history.|$|E
25|$|In QFT this {{combination}} of fields is called the vacuum state, its associated zero-point energy is called the vacuum energy and the average expectation value of the Hamiltonian is called the vacuum expectation value (also called condensate or simply VEV). The QED vacuum {{is a part of}} the vacuum state which specifically deals with quantum electrodynamics (e.g. electromagnetic interactions between photons, electrons and the vacuum) and the QCD vacuum deals with <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (e.g. color charge interactions between quarks, gluons and the vacuum). Recent experiments advocate the idea that particles themselves can be thought of as excited states of the underlying quantum vacuum, and that all properties of matter are merely vacuum fluctuations arising from interactions with the zero-point field.|$|E
25|$|In the {{standard}} model of particle physics, the strong force is described by the theory of <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> (QCD). At ordinary temperatures or densities this force just confines the quarks into composite particles (hadrons) of size around 10−15m = 1femtometer = 1fm (corresponding to the QCD energy scale ΛQCD≈200MeV) and its effects are not noticeable at longer distances. However, when the temperature reaches the QCD energy scale (T of order 1012kelvins) or the density rises {{to the point where}} the average inter-quark separation is less than 1 fm (quark chemical potential μ around 400MeV), the hadrons are melted into their constituent quarks, and the strong interaction becomes the dominant feature of the physics. Such phases are called quark matter or QCD matter.|$|E
25|$|The {{physics of}} the quark–gluon plasma is governed by a theory called <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics,</b> but this theory is mathematically {{intractable}} in problems involving the quark–gluon plasma. In an article appearing in 2005, Đàm Thanh Sơn and his collaborators showed that the AdS/CFT correspondence {{could be used to}} understand some aspects of the quark–gluon plasma by describing it in the language of string theory. By applying the AdS/CFT correspondence, Sơn and his collaborators were able to describe the quark gluon plasma in terms of black holes in five-dimensional spacetime. The calculation showed that the ratio of two quantities associated with the quark–gluon plasma, the shear viscosity and volume density of entropy, should be approximately equal to a certain universal constant. In 2008, the predicted value of this ratio for the quark–gluon plasma was confirmed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|String {{theory was}} first {{studied in the}} late 1960s as a theory of the strong nuclear force, before being {{abandoned}} in favor of <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics.</b> Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, bosonic string theory, incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons. It later developed into superstring theory, which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s {{that they were all}} different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as M-theory. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory.|$|E
25|$|If {{the system}} is rescaled, the change in {{conductivity}} depends only on the distance between a fixed saddle point and the conductivity. The scaling behavior near the quantum Hall transitions is then universal and different quantum Hall samples will give the same scaling results. But, by studying the quantum Hall transitions theoretically, many different systems that are all in different universality classes {{have been found to}} share a super-universal fixed point structure. This means that many different systems that are all in different universality classes still share the same fixed point structure. They all have stable topological sectors and also share other super-universal features. That these features are super-universal is due to the fundamental nature of the vacuum angle that governs the scaling behavior of the systems. The topological vacuum angle can be constructed in any quantum field theory but only under the right circumstances can its features be observed. The vacuum angle also appears in <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> and might have been important {{in the formation of the}} early universe.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Juan Maldacena {{noted that}} the low energy {{excitations}} of a theory near a black hole consist of objects close to the horizon, which for extreme charged black holes looks like an anti-de Sitter space. He noted that in this limit the gauge theory describes the string excitations near the branes. So he hypothesized that string theory on a near-horizon extreme-charged black-hole geometry, an anti-de Sitter space times a sphere with flux, is equally well described by the low-energy limiting gauge theory, the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory. This hypothesis, which is called the AdS/CFT correspondence, was further developed by Steven Gubser, Igor Klebanov and Alexander Polyakov, and by Edward Witten, {{and it is now}} well-accepted. It is a concrete realization of the holographic principle, which has far-reaching implications for black holes, locality and information in physics, as well as the nature of the gravitational interaction. Through this relationship, string theory {{has been shown to be}} related to gauge theories like <b>quantum</b> <b>chromodynamics</b> and this has led to more quantitative understanding of the behavior of hadrons, bringing string theory back to its roots.|$|E
