2500|$|President Bush, 45 {{days after}} 9/11, Congress passed the Patriot Act, which takes away checks on law enforcement, weakens American citizens' rights and freedoms, {{especially}} Fourth Amendment rights. With expansions of the Patriot Act and Patriot Act II, my <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> is, why are my rights being watered down and my citizens around me, {{and what are}} the specific justifications for these reforms? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And do {{you expect}} me," [...] Captain Ackinson remarked, [...] "to hand over the person in <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> on the {{authority}} of that document?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{distress}} you," [...] I began. [...] "I {{will only}} ask leave, before {{we change the}} subject, to put one <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about the cottage and the lake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "`Stay, boy,' {{interrupted}} the master, smiling; `I {{do not want}} <b>to</b> know what <b>you</b> can play at. Keep silence until I put a few <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> What is English grammar?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is the commonest thing," [...] {{she said}} presently, [...] "to make {{mistakes}} about matters of this sort. Now, for instance, I once put some <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> which seemed <b>to</b> {{indicate that there}} might be some reason for Sylvia's uneasiness. Didn't you think they pointed that way?" ...|$|R
60|$|NAPOLEON (drily). Excuse me, madame. With {{all respect}} to your brother, I {{do not yet}} {{understand}} what an officer on General Massena's staff wants with my letters. I have some <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> put <b>to</b> <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will put}} the <b>{{question}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> for form's sake, sir, if you wish it," [...] she proceeded. [...] "But I am already certain, without any question at all, that you have made your will?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But to return. Are you {{strong enough}}--are you strong enough {{even with my}} help--to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner, Heintzelman, and Keyes all at once? This is a {{practical}} and very serious <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|JENNIFER. It is {{too late}} for reproaches now. When I turned and saw you just now, I {{wondered}} how you could come here coolly {{to look at his}} pictures. You answered the <b>question.</b> <b>To</b> <b>you,</b> he was only a clever brute.|$|E

60|$|CHRIS. My brother, I {{did not put}} the <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> {{for that}} I doubted of the truth of our belief myself, but <b>to</b> prove <b>thee,</b> and <b>to</b> fetch from <b>thee</b> a fruit of the honesty of thy heart. As for this man, I {{know that he is}} blinded. Let thee and me go on, knowing that we have belief of the truth, and no lie is of the truth.|$|R
60|$|BARNABAS [malevolently] Good day <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> I have a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> put <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> if {{you don't}} mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, now, Mr. Cargill, {{you really}} carry the {{privilege}} of Scotland too far--I have not put a single <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but what you have answered by another--let us converse intelligibly for five minutes, if you can but condescend so far." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rosamund, {{my cousin}} and lady, I come {{to put a}} <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but first--why you will {{understand}} afterwards--it is my duty to ask that you will give me no {{answer to that question}} until a full day has passed." ...|$|E
6000|$|JOB ARTHUR. Quiet a bit Sh-h-h!--We {{put this}} plain <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> Mr. Barlow. Why did {{you refuse to}} give the clerks this just and fair advance, when you knew that by refusing you would throw three {{thousand}} men out of employment? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not putting}} {{official}} <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> at all," [...] he replied, [...] "nor am I cross-examining you, {{as might be}} my duty, under the circumstances, simply because your friendship with the Cranstons is, of course, a guarantee as to your position. But on the other hand, I {{think it would be}} reasonable if <b>you</b> were <b>to</b> answer my question." ...|$|R
60|$|RANKIN (stopping him). No, stop: we're oalways {{ready for}} {{travellers}} here. I {{have something else}} <b>to</b> say--a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, White, I wished <b>to</b> see <b>you.</b> I have a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>you.</b> Who put the forged will in Mr. Ashurst's desk? Was it you, or {{some other}} person?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bight you are!' cried Wegg. 'Then,' {{screwing}} {{the weight}} of his body upon his wooden leg, and screwing his wooden head very much on one side, and screwing up one eye: 'then, I put the <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> what's this paper worth?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{told the}} Court, Miss Smithers, at the {{conclusion}} of your evidence, that you are now engaged to be married to Mr. Meeson, the plaintiff. Now, I am sorry to have to put a personal <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> but I must ask you--Were you {{at the time of the}} tattooing of the will, in love with Mr. Meeson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He obeyed. [...] "And now," [...] she said, [...] "before you go I {{want to put}} a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Sit round {{there in}} front of me, on that low chair, and bring the candles, or one, to the little table. Do you smoke? Yes? That's right--I am learning. Take one of these; and here's a light." [...] She threw a {{matchbox}} across.|$|E
6000|$|CHR. My brother, I {{did not put}} the <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> {{for that}} I doubted of the truth of our belief myself, but <b>to</b> prove <b>thee,</b> and <b>to</b> fetch from <b>thee</b> a fruit of the honesty of thy heart. As for this man, I {{know that he is}} blinded by the god of this world. Let thee and I go on, knowing that we have belief of the truth, [...] "and no lie is of the truth" [...] (1 John 2:21).|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said, [...] "do not ask me any <b>questions.</b> <b>To</b> tell <b>you</b> the truth, I am not {{yet fully}} persuaded that the {{necessity}} exists." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before I go to London," [...] I began, [...] "I {{have two}} <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>you.</b> They relate <b>to</b> myself, and I {{believe they will}} rather {{surprise}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, Captain," [...] I answered, [...] "if {{we were at}} sea and you did {{something}} of the sort, I should not put such a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and if by any chance I did, I should not expect you to answer. Well, by your own wish I am in command here and I think that the same argument holds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young lady," [...] he said, [...] "I {{will ask}} you this. I {{do not wish}} to seem obstinate in my refusal to accept Craig's guilt as proved, but I would like to put this simple <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Did Craig's {{demeanour}} during your conversation seem to you to indicate the master criminal? Did he seem to you to be possessed of supreme courage, of marvellous intelligence?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Q. This {{is indeed}} stupendous. Let me put one more question, one last <b>question,</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> before we part to meet no more;--for even if I fail to avoid your asylum, a meeting there {{will go for}} nothing as a meeting, since by that time you will easily have {{forgotten}} me and my name: did you die a natural death, or were you cut off by a catastrophe? ...|$|E
6000|$|Oakhurst (gently {{restraining}} her). <b>You</b> {{have another}} <b>question</b> <b>to</b> ask: <b>you</b> hesitate: {{let me ask}} it. (Crossing <b>to</b> the DUCHESS.) <b>You</b> have heard my answer. Madam, are you the legal wife of Alexander Morton? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have a few}} <b>questions</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>you,</b> Mr. Hathorn," [...] Mr. Wakefield, Ned's lawyer, said. [...] "Had you {{any reason}} for expecting any {{outbreak}} of this kind among your boys?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will not}} prolong this interview," [...] said the young man, calming himself by an evident effort. [...] "I have one <b>question</b> <b>to</b> ask <b>you,</b> and then {{no more to}} say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I too am {{compelled}} {{to follow a}} course I did not originally mean to take.' After saying no more for a few moments, she added, {{in a tone of}} sudden openness, a richer tincture creeping up her cheek, 'I want to put a <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> boldly--not exactly a question--a thought. Have you considered whether the relations between us which have lately prevailed are--are the best for you--and for me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well {{then why}} isn't he free? He swears {{to me he}} is, but {{meanwhile}} does nothing--except of course that he's so kind to me--to prove it; and couldn't really act much otherwise if he weren't. My <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> just now was exactly on this queer impression of his diplomacy: as if instead of really giving ground his line were to keep me on here and set me a bad example." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{have said}} what I had to say, stumblingly and badly, and baldly. But I am sick of tearing up letters and hopeless of getting what I {{have to say}} better said. It would be easy {{enough for me to}} write an eloquent letter about {{something}} else. Only I do not care to write about anything else. Let me put the main <b>question</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now that I could not put the other afternoon. Will you marry me, Ann Veronica? ...|$|E

6000|$|The plaintive tone of her {{compassion}} {{merged into}} the less musical {{voice of the}} Judge, as he said something fiercely: [...] "Answer the <b>questions</b> put <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and make no remark upon them." ...|$|R
