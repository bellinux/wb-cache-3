As he walked and munched the soft bread from his scrip, it seemed strange to him to feel that it was still warm from the ovens of Beaulieu.|$|E

50|$|As European harps {{evolved to}} play more complex music, a key {{consideration}} was {{some way to}} facilitate the <b>quick</b> <b>changing</b> of a string's pitch {{to be able to}} play more chromatic notes. By the Baroque period, in Italy and Spain, more strings were added to allow for chromatic notes in more complex harps. In Germany in the second half of the 17th century, diatonic single-row harps were fitted with manually turned hooks which fretted individual strings to raise their pitch by a half step. In the 18th century, a link mechanism was developed connecting these hooks with pedals, leading to the invention of the single-action pedal harp.|$|E

Unlike most previous work where RL {{is used to}} improve accuracy in the action selection process, CBRetaliate uses CBR to allow RL to respond more quickly to changing conditions. CBRetaliate combines two key features: it uses a time window to compute similarity and stores and reuses complete Q-tables for continuous problem solving.

5000|$|The {{business}} model of fast fashion {{is based on}} consumers’ desire for new clothing to wear. In order to fulfill consumer’s demand, fast fashion brands provide affordable prices and {{a wide range of}} clothing that reflects the latest trends. This ends up persuading consumers to buy more items which leads to the issue of overconsumption.Planned Obsolescence {{plays a key role in}} overconsumption. Based on the study of planned obsolescence in the Economist, Fashion is deeply committed to built-in obsolescence. Last year's skirts; for example, are designed to be replaced by this year's new models. In this case, fashion goods are purchased even when the old ones are still wearable. The quick response model and new supply chain practices of fast fashion even accelerate the speed of it. In recent years, the fashion cycle has steadily decreased as fast fashion retailers sell clothing that is expected to be disposed of after being worn only a few times. [...] This dramatically shortens the consumers’ buying cycle. The <b>quick</b> <b>changing</b> stocks and low price of fashion goods encourage consumers to visit the store and make purchases more frequently. As a result, excessive stock and untrendy clothes tends to end up in landfills.|$|E

While Hopfield systems use a Hebbian learning strategy, Boltzmann machines favor a backpropagation strategy (Widrow-Hoff rule) with hidden neurons in a many-layered network.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Pedestrian {{safety systems}} play an {{increasing}} significant role to reduce injuries and fatal casualties caused by accidents. One automotive safety system for pedestrian protection is the bonnet lifting system. Using shape memory alloys (SMA) the existing systems could be simplified, performing the same function through new mechanisms with reduced size, weight and costs. A drawback {{for the use}} of SMA in such safety systems is the lack of material knowledge concerning the durability of the switching function. This paper gives an introduction to existing bonnet lifting systems for pedestrian protection, describes the use of <b>quick</b> <b>changing</b> SM actuators and presents the testing facilities and some results of the study concerning the long-time stability of the tested NiTi-wires. Design/methodology/approach: A large number of NiTi-wires was trained, exposed up to four years at elevated temperatures and tested regarding their phase change temperatures, times and strokes. Findings: It was found out that Ap-temperature is shifted towards higher temperatures with longer exposing periods and higher temperatures. However, in the functional testing plant a delay in the switching time could not be detected. Research limitations/implications: For future works it is suggested that more NiTi-specimens at longer ageing periods should be tested, stress should also be applied by a constant load and the functional testing plant should be further optimized. Practical implications: It can be concluded, that the use of <b>quick</b> <b>changing</b> SM actuators in safety systems could simplify the mechanism, reduce maintenance and manufacture cost and should be insertable also for other automotive applications. Originality/value: This paper gives some answers concerning the long-time stability of NiTi-wires that were missing till now. With this knowledge the number of future automotive applications using SMA can be increased...|$|E

When capitalism is seriously threatened by a systemic crisis, a new version much better adapted to existing conditions appears. Critical analysis of the fundamental ideas underlying neoclassical economic theory shows that the capitalist system is fundamentally a dynamic and therefore static neoclassical models proved to be unsuitable for studying it. Contrary to neoclassical economic vision, the capitalist economy is not governed by immutable economic laws.
