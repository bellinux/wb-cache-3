5|$|Fireforce was {{a variant}} on the {{vertical}} envelopment tactic in which ground {{troops would be}} carried directly to the target by air and dropped. It was designed to react instantly to guerrilla ambushes, farm attacks and sightings, and could also be called upon {{by members of the}} security forces as reinforcements. Preparatory deployment was very flexible: all that was required for a base was an airstrip. There would usually be three main Fireforces in operation at each time, each of which would be handled by a company-sized body of men, usually one of the RLI Commandos or a company of the Rhodesian African Rifles. The unit in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> be posted at a forward airfield for six weeks (though sometimes for longer) and given responsibility for thousands of square kilometres of Rhodesian countryside. The Selous Scouts' hidden forward observation posts (OPs) allowed for instant reactions by Fireforce to sightings of the enemy guerrillas.|$|E

25|$|The Street {{court did}} not {{consider}} whether a prohibition on burning the flag, without also prohibiting words against the flag, would be constitutional or unconstitutional. This <b>question</b> <b>would</b> remain open until 1989, when in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, the Court invalidated a flag-burning statute.|$|E
25|$|Disobeying {{the rules}} for {{acceptable}} releases carried varying penalties. At the very least, the offending party would be warned and the material in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> not be published or exhibited. Bans from publishing or performing were also levied {{in order to keep}} the material from being released.|$|E
25|$|On 3 December Head of the Central Election Commission Batal Tabagua {{also stated}} that {{although}} no official complaints had been made, reports had come in concerning the bribing of voters. He warned that if {{this turned out to}} be true, the candidate in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> be excluded from the election.|$|E
50|$|Question 1 {{repealed}} {{the sales}} tax on alcohol. <b>Question</b> 2 <b>would</b> have repealled an affordable housing statute. <b>Question</b> 3 <b>would</b> have lowered {{the sales tax}} rate.|$|R
25|$|All {{of these}} <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> {{necessarily}} await the interpretative {{role of the}} courts, and such a process would likely require several years for the resolution of each issue.|$|R

25|$|Opponents of Roe {{assert that}} the {{decision}} lacks a valid constitutional foundation. Like the dissenters in Roe, they maintain that the Constitution is silent on the issue, and that proper solutions to the <b>question</b> <b>would</b> best be found via state legislatures and the legislative process, rather than through an all-encompassing ruling from the Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|The ballot {{consisted}} of two questions; voters could vote on one or the other, or on both. The first question asked whether Gray Davis should be recalled. It was a simple yes/no question, and if a majority voted no, then the second <b>question</b> <b>would</b> become irrelevant and Gray Davis would remain California governor. If a majority voted yes, then Davis would {{be removed from office}} once the vote was certified, and the second <b>question</b> <b>would</b> determine his successor. Voters had to choose one candidate from a long list of 135 candidates. Voters who voted against recalling Gray Davis could still vote for a candidate to replace him in case the recall vote succeeded. The candidate receiving the most votes (a plurality) would then become the next governor of California. Certification by the Secretary of State of California would require completion within 39 days of the election, and history indicated that it could require that entire time frame to certify the statewide election results. Once the results were certified, a newly elected governor would have to be sworn into office within 10 days.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{speech at}} Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said that judges {{should strive to}} apply the law as it is, {{focusing}} backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader {{at the time of}} the events in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.|$|E
40|$|Summary charts of the {{following}} topics are presented: the Percentage of Critical Questions in Constrained and Robust Programs; the Executive Committee and AMAC Disposition of Critical Questions for Constrained and Robust Programs; and the Requirements for Ground-based Research and Flight Platforms for Constrained and Robust Programs.

50|$|Souter opposed having {{cameras in}} the Supreme Court during oral {{arguments}} because he said <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> {{be taken out of}} context by the media and the proceedings would be politicized.|$|R
50|$|However, the Court also {{recognized}} that these <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> likely {{need to be}} answered on a case-by-case basis, first by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), then by the courts.|$|R
25|$|The {{state in}} <b>question</b> <b>would</b> still {{be bound by}} the {{obligations}} treaties and the Council acting by majority may alter or lift such sanctions. The Treaty of Nice included a preventative mechanism whereby the Council, acting by majority, may identify a potential breach and make recommendations to the state to rectify it before action is taken against it as outlined above. However the treaties do not provide any mechanism to expel a member state outright.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} an {{analogous}} arrangement to yibbum is recounted in the Book of Ruth. After {{the death of her}} husband, Ruth is noticed and welcomed by her husband's kinsman, Boaz. After Ruth is rejected by an anonymous Ploni Almoni who performs halizah, Boaz marries her. In this case as well, the kin in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> not have been subject to the biblical levirate marriage obligation, as neither Ploni Almoni nor Boaz were brothers of Ruth's late husband.|$|E
25|$|Mrs McIan was a noted {{painter in}} her own right, who {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy and other leading galleries. She too favoured historical subjects from the Highlands, such as Highlander defending his Family at the Massacre of Glencoe. The Highlander in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> have been a MacDonald of Glencoe, also known as Clan McIan. From 1842 until Robert's death {{she was the first}} Superindent of the Female School of Design, which became the Royal Female School of Art and ultimately part of the Central School of Arts and Crafts.|$|E

50|$|The bonus round {{was played}} {{for a family}} vacation. Up to five trivia <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> be asked of the winning team. Before each <b>question,</b> Eubanks <b>would</b> give the child the {{category}} of the question and have them decide whether mom or dad would answer it. If the team gave three wrong answers, the round ended with a loss, but if they gave three correct answers they won the trip.|$|R
25|$|The {{information}} segment {{was introduced}} in Season 2. It consists of Lizzy Lovette and later Sally Stanton giving a brief report on a particular topic. Teams are asked a 10-point buzz-in question on the topic {{to make sure they}} were listening. Initially the team who correctly answered the question also won the right to be the first team to get their question round, but was later dropped. No points are lost if a team answers the question incorrectly, but will be locked out in the next question. Should this happen, another <b>question</b> <b>would</b> be asked by Reeve for the remaining teams.|$|E
25|$|Many Czech {{people were}} waiting for {{political}} changes in monarchy, including Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk and others. Masaryk served in the Reichsrat (Imperial Council) from 1891 to 1893 in the Young Czech Party and again from 1907 to 1914 in the Realist Party (which he had founded in 1900), {{but he did not}} campaign for the independence of Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. In 1909 he helped Hinko Hinković in Vienna in the defense during the fabricated trial against mostly prominent Croats and Serbs, members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition (such as Frano Supilo and Svetozar Pribićević), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties. The Czech <b>question</b> <b>would</b> remain unresolved for the entirety of Franz Joseph's political career.|$|E
25|$|Pit'dah (פִּטְדָה = in the masoretic text) / Topazios (in the Septuagint) - {{despite the}} {{suggestion}} of the Septuagint that it was Topaz, Topaz was scarcely known {{at the time the}} Book of Exodus was written (according to both the traditional dating of the book and that by critical scholars); in the classical era, topazios referred to Topazos Island on which a particular yellow mineral was mined (topazios means to seek, in reference to the difficulty in finding the island). Others suggest that topaz was merely peridot, a light green semi-precious stone, and which stone in the ancient world was found primarily on Topazos Island as well as on St. John’s Island (Zabargad) in the Egyptian Red Sea. The word pit'dah is thought by scholars to be connected with the Assyrian word hipindu, which refers to something that flashed (presumably meaning shimmered), and thus the jewel in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> fit the description of Chrysolite, a translucent greenish yellow mineral, common throughout the Levant, and particularly found on a particular island in the Red Sea, {{under the control of the}} Egyptian Pharaoh.|$|E
30|$|The third seed pair was gill and lung. The generator’s output was 4750 {{question}}s. Most of the <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> {{not make}} good comparisons. This seed question led to few restrictions, which caused {{the output of}} too many pairs of concepts.|$|R
50|$|If {{one of the}} two {{preselected}} categories was chosen, both <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> {{be asked}} in turn. If Potluck was chosen, both questions were toss-ups and could be answered by either player by buzzing in. Later, every question became a toss-up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not in Belgium?" [...] De Brensault exclaimed. [...] "We {{might go}} to a little town I know of very near to my estates. Everything could be {{arranged}} there very easily. I am quite well-known, and no <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> be asked." ...|$|R
500|$|Thus, the <b>question</b> <b>would</b> {{revolve around}} legal connections, and not around [...] "Australia's strong {{historical}} and emotional {{ties with the}} United Kingdom." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Kenneth R. Beesley, who {{submitted}} {{the proposal to}} expand the encoding, [...] "Unicode fonts based on the current heterogeneous collection of glyphs will be useless for any practical typesetting of 40-letter Deseret Alphabet documents." [...] This is because the Unicode Consortium chose to use glyphs from 1855 as the reference glyphs, while by 1859 those glyphs were already outmoded and replaced with newer glyphs. Beesley thus recommends using LaTeX along with his Metafont [...] font to typeset Deseret text, but fonts which use the alternate glyphs for the two codepoints in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> also work for transcription of 40-letter Deseret texts written during and after 1859.|$|E
500|$|Another {{issue of}} concern for Dodd was Alabama's and other SEC schools' over-recruitment of players. Universities would recruit more players than {{available}} space on their rosters. During the summer the teams in <b>question</b> <b>would</b> cut the players well after signing day. This practice prevented the cut players {{from being able to}} play for other colleges during the following football season. Dodd appealed the SEC administration to punish the [...] "tryout camps" [...] of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC after 1963 football season. Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final three years of Dodd's coaching tenure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{prefer to}} depart by {{the usual way}} for your sake," [...] {{returned}} the other, unabashed. [...] "If I left by the window all sorts of <b>questions</b> <b>would</b> be asked, {{and you know what}} a talkative chap I am." ...|$|R

5000|$|This view of artist-as-change-agent {{changes the}} {{questions}} researchers ask of creative economies.
