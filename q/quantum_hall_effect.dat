This phenomenon arising {{due to the nature}} of charge carriers in the conductor came to be termed the Hall effect, but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the <b>quantum</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> discovered half a century later.|$|E

25|$|While quantum {{mechanics}} primarily {{applies to the}} smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale. Superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an electric current) at sufficiently low temperatures. The fractional <b>quantum</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> is a topological ordered state which corresponds to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement. States with different topological orders (or different patterns of long range entanglements) cannot change into each other without a phase transition.|$|E

Another {{variation of the}} bottom-up approach is molecular beam epitaxy or MBE. Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s.

500|$|The <b>quantum</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> was {{discovered}} by Klaus von Klitzing in 1980 when he observed the Hall conductance to be integer multiples of a fundamental constant [...](see figure) The effect was observed to be independent of parameters such as system size and impurities.

[...] It also implied that the Hall conductance can be characterized {{in terms of a}} topological invariable called Chern number. Shortly after, in 1982, Horst Störmer and Daniel Tsui observed the fractional <b>quantum</b> <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> where the conductance was now a rational multiple of a constant. Laughlin, in 1983, realized that this was a consequence of quasiparticle interaction in the Hall states and formulated a variational method solution, named the Laughlin wavefunction.

40|$|In recent years, the {{discovery}} of topological insulators brought a topological classification of materials and opened a new field in condensed matter physics. Due to the nontrivial topological properties, the topological insulators have insulating bulk and metallic edge/surface relating to some exotic physics such as <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect,</b> <b>quantum</b> spin <b>Hall</b> <b>effect,</b> and magneto-electric effect. Followed realizations of the Z 2 topological insulators in two and three dimensions, the <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> was realized in the magnetic-doped topological insulators very recently, which attracts intensive interest. In this thesis, the magnetic topological insulators {{as a consequence of}} time-reversal symmetry breaking in the Z 2 topological insulators in two or three dimensions are studied. As an introduction, a review of the topological insulators including some relevant theories is given. The approaches involved in this study are also presented. The results can be summarized in two parts. First, the <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> {{can be found on the}} two-dimensional decorated lattice with spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interaction. Without interaction, this model exhibits the <b>quantum</b> spin <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> and has at bands in the middle of the spectra. A at-band ferrimagnetism which breaks the time-reversal symmetry and a charge-density wave can be induced by the electron-electron interaction. Altogether they can modulate the Chern number of the system and give rise to the <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect.</b> In the second part, the realization of the <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> in magnetic-doped topological insulator thin films is investigated. With an effective Hamiltonian of the surface states of a topological insulator thin _lm, the condition of the <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> and the behavior of the longitudinal and Hall conductivity is given, which agrees with the experimental results. The effects of the structural inversion asymmetry potential and the particle-hole symmetry breaking term are studied. With a thin _lm model of the three-dimensional topological insulator, it is shown that the lateral surface states account for the non-quantized value of the Hall conductance and the nonzero longitudinal conductance. The quantized Hall conductance restores when the lateral surface state electrons are thoroughly localized by disorder. The <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> phase in magnetic topological insulator thin film in the present of disorder is also studied. The disorder will shrink the regime of the <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect</b> in a thick film and becomes an obstacle to the realization of the <b>quantum</b> anomalous <b>Hall</b> <b>effect.</b> published_or_final_versionPhysicsDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} {{motivation of}} great interest to topological insulators was the hope to observe the <b>quantum</b> spin <b>Hall</b> <b>effect.</b> Therefore if a material is in the topological insulator state they frequently call it the <b>quantum</b> spin <b>Hall</b> state.

A result that was irreconcilable with the observations on delocalization.
