50|$|The Elder Smith woolstore is most {{significant}} {{in its own}} right and for its heritage contribution to the Teneriffe precinct. It reflects important developments, technological features and marketing procedures in Queensland's wool industry since the 1920s as well as the history of <b>quayage</b> along the Brisbane River and of the pastoral companies concerned.|$|E
50|$|This {{complex of}} three Winchcombe Carson woolstores is most {{significant}} {{in its own}} right and for its heritage contribution to the Teneriffe precinct. It reflects several developmental stages in the economic history of the wool industry, modifications in technology and changes in marketing as well as the history of <b>quayage</b> along the Brisbane River and of the pastoral companies concerned.|$|E
50|$|Cardiff Docks is a port in {{southern}} Cardiff, Wales. At its peak, the port {{was one of}} the largest dock systems in the world with a total <b>quayage</b> of almost 11 km. Once the main port for the export of South Wales coal, the Port of Cardiff remains active in the import and export of containers, steel, forest products and dry and liquid bulks.|$|E
5000|$|The dock {{upstream}} {{from the bridge}} was begun in 1833, but financial troubles meant it was only finished between 1869 and 1875, and is nearly rectangular with a <b>quayage</b> of 3860 ft and an area of 10.7 acres. The bridge was built between 1871 and 1874 to service the new docks. It was engineered by Rendel and Robertson, with J. H. Bostock as resident engineer. McDonald & Grant were contractors for the foundations, and the bridge was built by the Skerne Iron Works. The works cost around [...]|$|E
50|$|Work on {{building}} the Glamorganshire Canal began in 1790, took {{eight years and}} involved installing 50 locks. The Cardiff Sea Lock, which enabled barges to unload iron into seagoing ships, was built at Harrowby Street (Harrowby - a Viking place-name - had been the original Norse trading post in Cardiff). Eventually the Taff Vale Railway replaced the canal barges and massive marshalling yards sprang up as new docks were developed in Cardiff - all prompted by the soaring worldwide demand for south Wales coal. By 1907 Cardiff's docks had 11 km of <b>quayage,</b> {{one of the largest}} dock systems in the world at that time.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} docks of London, all built {{close to}} the City, were opened in stages by {{what was to become}} the East and West India Docks Company (E&WIDC) {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. With the coming of the railways and increasing ship size, location {{close to the}} centre of London became less important than access to deep water, unrestricted sites and reduction in time spent travelling up the winding Thames. The Company had long been in competition with their rival, the London and St Katherine Dock Company (L&StKDC), and had been doing all it could to dominate it. The opening of the Royal Albert Dock by the L&StKDC, with its deepwater <b>quayage,</b> in 1880 had given access to the Thames at Gallions Reach, 11 mi by river below London Bridge and downstream of the then principal London docks. The E&WIDC were forced to retaliate.|$|E
40|$|Ships, {{the sea and}} {{the coast}} have always been popular {{pictorial}} motifs, even if marine painting did not become established as an independent genre {{until the end of the}} sixteenth century in the Netherlands. Among the painters for whom maritime motifs played an important role even earlier is Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1525 / 30 - 1569), the greatest Netherlandish painter of the sixteenth century. In this context, the grandiose harbour view in Bruegel's painting "The Tower of Babel" (1563) is particularly worthy of mention, as two different phases of harbour development are juxtaposed here: on the one hand the wharf, entirely void of dock constructions, a relic from the earliest stages of harbour development and still prevalent in the Early Middle Ages, on the other hand the harbour of the Late Middle Ages / Early Modern Times, dominated as it was by the shoreline quay with its typical cargo-handling gear (heavy-duty crane, whip-and-skid devices, winches). While the harbour facilities of Antwerp - where Bruegel lived and worked for many years - will have served him as a model for <b>quayage</b> in the highly developed form of a well-fortified fortress, the rural environment of his native Flanders will have provided him with a wealth of visual aids for the more primitive harbour form, the wharf. Excellent descriptions of historical harbour types are now and then to be found in fictional literature. Thomas Mann (1875 - 1955) for example, in his novel cycle Joseph and his Brothers (1948), or Conrad Ferdinand Meyer (1825 - 1898) in his novel Jürg Jenatsch (1874) both brought the shoreline market to life, an archaic harbour form in which the harbour and the market are an indivisible unit, both spatially as well as operationally. Both market scenes take place in out-of-the-ordinary times and places: In Thomas Mann’s trilogy the setting is provided by the Upper Egyptian pharaoh city of Thebes in the middle of the second millennium B. C., in C. F. Meyer's work it is Lake Como on the southern edge of the Alps at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War. By dint of their exceptional powers of intuition, both authors succeed in staging the characteristic atmosphere of a typical waterside market with great mastery. Each in his own way and with his own artistic means, Pieter Bruegel the Elder, Thomas Mann and Conrad Ferdinand Meyer all created concordant images of certain specific historical harbour forms - the wharf, the waterside market, the Early Modern shore quay. While artistic designs such as these cannot replace the precise methods of science, they are nevertheless capable of making a welcome contribution to the vivid visualisation of historical harbour development...|$|E
