The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people <b>queued</b> to see the body.|$|E

Each <b>queue</b> is serviced based on how much packets are served in each <b>queue.</b> If that limit is met, the network OS will hold packets of current <b>queue</b> and services the next <b>queue</b> until that <b>queue</b> is empty or it reaches its packet limit.

An automated <b>queue</b> forwarding feature is provided that will remove entries from a <b>queue</b> and invoke an associated Enduro/X ATMI services, placing the reply message on an associated reply <b>queue</b> and failed messages to failure <b>queue.</b>|$|R
5|$|Titan is {{available}} for any scientific purpose; access depends {{on the importance of}} the project and its potential to exploit the hybrid architecture. Any selected programs must also be executable on other supercomputers to avoid sole dependence on Titan. Six vanguard programs were the first selected. They dealt mostly with molecular scale physics or climate models, while 25 others were <b>queued</b> behind them. The inclusion of GPUs compelled authors to alter their programs. The modifications typically increased the degree of parallelism, given that GPUs offer many more simultaneous threads than CPUs. The changes often yield greater performance even on CPU-only machines.|$|E
5|$|Mughal-e-Azam had {{the widest}} release of any Indian film {{up to that}} time, and patrons often <b>queued</b> all day for tickets. Released on 5 August 1960, it broke box office records in India and became the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, a {{distinction}} it held for 15 years. By some accounts, Mughal-e-Azam was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time, adjusted for inflation. The accolades awarded to the film include one National Film Award and three Filmfare Awards at the 8th Filmfare Awards. Mughal-e-Azam was the first black-and-white Hindi film to be digitally coloured, and the first in any language {{to be given a}} theatrical re-release. The colour version, released in November 2004, was a commercial success.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke's (Paul Keane) bucks party. When {{the night was}} {{interrupted}} by a neighbour, Daphne left some belongings behind and returned the following morning to collect them. Des's fiancée assumed she had spent the night and called the wedding off. Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off, Daphne moved in. Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men <b>queued</b> up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship.|$|E
50|$|A <b>queue</b> {{management}} system {{is used to}} control <b>queues.</b> <b>Queues</b> of people form in various situations and locations in a <b>queue</b> area. The process of <b>queue</b> formation and propagation is defined as <b>queuing</b> theory.|$|R
50|$|Network devices use First-In-First-Out <b>queue,</b> Weighted fair <b>queue,</b> Priority <b>queue</b> and Custom <b>queue.</b>|$|R
50|$|Priority <b>queue</b> {{is divided}} into 4 sub <b>queues</b> with {{different}} priorities. Data in each <b>queue</b> are only served when the higher priority <b>queues</b> are empty. If data come into the empty higher priority <b>queue</b> while the network OS is transferring data of lower priority <b>queue,</b> network OS will hold data of the lower priority <b>queue</b> and process data in higher priority <b>queue</b> first. The network OS does not care how long lower priority <b>queues</b> {{have to wait for}} their turn because it always finishes each <b>queue</b> from highest to lowest priority first before moving to the next <b>queue.</b> Within each <b>queue,</b> packets are forwarded based on First-In-First-Out basis.|$|R
5|$|The {{controller}} {{is central}} to the correct function of an Xgrid, as this node is responsible for the distribution, supervision and coordination of tasks on agents. The program running on the controller can assign and reassign tasks to handle individual agent failures on demand. The number of tasks assigned to an agent depend on two factors: the number of agents on an Xgrid and the number of processors in each node. The number of agents on an Xgrid determines how the controller will assign tasks. The tasks may be assigned simultaneously for a large number of agents, or <b>queued</b> for a small number of agents. When a node with more than one processor is detected on an Xgrid, the controller may assign one task per processor; this only occurs if the number of agents on the network is lower than the number of tasks the controller has to complete.|$|E
25|$|When {{a job is}} newly created, it is {{automatically}} suspended (or paused). It has to be explicitly resumed to be activated. Resuming moves the job to the <b>queued</b> state. On its turn to transfer data, it first connects to the remote server and then starts transferring. After the job's time slice expires, the transfer is temporarily paused, and the job is {{moved back to the}} <b>queued</b> state. When the job gets another time slice, it has to connect again before it can transfer. When the job is complete, BITS transfers ownership of the job to the application that created it.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the tail {{behavior}} of the stationary <b>queue</b> length of an M/G/ 1 retrial <b>queue.</b> We show that the subexponential tail of the stationary <b>queue</b> length of an M/G/ 1 retrial <b>queue</b> is determined by that of the corresponding M/G/ 1 <b>queue,</b> and hence the stationary <b>queue</b> length in an M/G/ 1 retrial <b>queue</b> is subexponential if the stationary <b>queue</b> length in the corresponding M/G/ 1 <b>queue</b> is subexponential. Our results for subexponential tails also apply to regularly varying tails, and we provide the regularly varying tail asymptotics for the stationary <b>queue</b> length of the M/G/ 1 retrial <b>queue...</b>|$|R

25|$|Intersections have no signals or signage, and a {{particular}} road at a busy intersection may be dominant – that is, its traffic flows – until {{a break in}} traffic, at which time the dominance shifts to the other road where vehicles are <b>queued.</b> At the intersection of two perpendicular roads, a traffic jam may result if four vehicles face each other side-on.|$|E
50|$|Shared <b>Queues</b> (z/OS only):In a Shared <b>Queue</b> environment, an {{application}} can connect {{to any of}} the <b>queue</b> managers within the queue-sharing group. Because all the <b>queue</b> managers in the queue-sharing group can access the same set of shared <b>queues,</b> the application does not depend on the availability of a particular <b>queue</b> manager. This gives greater availability if a <b>queue</b> manager stops because all the other <b>queue</b> managers in the queue-sharing group can continue processing the <b>queue.</b>|$|R

25|$|A <b>queued</b> serial {{peripheral}} interface (QSPI) {{is a type}} of SPI controller that uses a data queue to transfer data across the SPI bus. It has a wrap-around mode allowing continuous transfers to and from the queue with only intermittent attention from the CPU. Consequently, the peripherals appear to the CPU as memory-mapped parallel devices. This feature is useful in applications such as control of an A/D converter. Other programmable features in QSPI are chip selects and transfer length/delay.|$|E

25|$|The {{movie was}} {{scheduled}} to be released on home video in the United Kingdom several weeks before broadcast to capitalize on the interest in the series returning. However, the British Board of Film Classification required the video release to have the same one minute of cuts as the broadcast version, and so the release was delayed to a week prior to its debut broadcast on BBC One. Hundreds of fans <b>queued</b> in London at midnight in order to buy a copy at the earliest possible moment, however overall sales were impacted by the now-imminent broadcast.|$|E

Rolling roadblocks were also reported in North East England on the A1 and A55 roads.
