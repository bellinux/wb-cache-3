5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', quantitative and qualitative methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{qualitative}} {{data can be}} used to strengthen quantitative research designs in general and intervention research designs (i.e., experimental, quasi-experimental) in particular. For example, in educational psychology, researchers could conduct a qualitative pilot study to determine which group of students should be selected for <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> by observing or interviewing different groups of students.|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} studies {{addressing}} anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa among Native Americans, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Africans, and Middle Easterners yielded only 35 studies, of which 22 were qualitative case reports, three were clinical <b>quantitative</b> <b>studies,</b> and ten were non-clinical <b>quantitative</b> <b>studies.</b> The case studies reported symptoms {{similar to those}} of Caucasian patients, and eating disorders were reported in all SES classes. The clinical studies, all reported from Asian countries, described a number of cases for eating disorders quite different from one another. The non-clinical <b>quantitative</b> <b>studies</b> reported a number of cases consistent with the ranges previously reported for controlled samples of non-clinical Caucasian populations. We found few or no <b>quantitative</b> <b>studies</b> on eating disorders from Hispanic, Middle Eastern, African, or Asian countries other than Japan...|$|R

25|$|A <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> of E2F {{transcriptional}} dynamics at the single-cell {{level by}} using engineered fluorescent reporter cells provided a quantitative {{framework for understanding}} the control logic of cell cycle entry, challenging the canonical textbook model. Genes that regulate the amplitude of E2F accumulation, such as Myc, determine the commitment into cell cycle and S phase entry. G1 cyclin-CDK activities are not the driver of cell cycle entry. Instead, they primarily tune the timing of E2F increase, thereby modulating the pace of cell cycle progression.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Minnesota, {{prompted}} by the Wisconsin decision {{and the growth of}} painted turtle capture in the 1990s, commissioned <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> of the state's painted turtles. After a two-year study, Gamble and Simon found a clear pattern of harvested lakes having half the painted turtle density of off-limits lakes. They also modeled the painted turtles' replacement rate and suggested that unrestricted harvest put the populations in danger of dropping strongly. In 2002, Minnesota forbid new harvesters and limited trap numbers, although harvest did continue by old harvesters. From 2002 to 2005, the most recent recorded, the yearly Minnesota painted turtles harvests were half the average size of that in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Gustav Fechner began {{conducting}} psychophysics {{research in}} Leipzig in the 1830s, articulating {{the principle that}} human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's stricture against <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> of the mind. In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.|$|E
500|$|Author Bill Martin {{recognises}} the Beatles and the Beach Boys as {{the most}} significant contributors {{to the development of}} progressive rock, transforming rock from dance music into music that was made for listening to. Citing a <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> of tempos in music from the era, musicologist Walter Everett identifies the Beatles' 1965 album Rubber Soul as a work that was [...] "made more to be thought about than danced to", and an album that [...] "began a far-reaching trend" [...] in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. Upon release, the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds was hailed by British newspapers as [...] "the most progressive pop album ever". Clevelands Troy Smith believes that the album [...] "established the group as forefathers of progressive pop, right from the beginning chords of 'Wouldn't It Be Nice', a Wall of Sound style single".|$|E
500|$|Resistance to {{the growing}} {{influence}} of molecular biology was especially evident in evolutionary biology. Protein sequencing had great potential for the <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> of evolution (through the molecular clock hypothesis), but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology for answering the big questions of evolutionary causation. Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence: Theodosius Dobzhansky made the famous statement that [...] "nothing in biology makes sense except {{in the light of}} evolution" [...] {{as a response to the}} molecular challenge. The issue became even more critical after 1968; Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution suggested that natural selection was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution, at least at the molecular level, and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from morphological evolution. (Resolving this [...] "molecular/morphological paradox" [...] has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s.) ...|$|E

2500|$|Kimura {{spent the}} rest of his life {{developing}} and defending the neutral theory. As James Crow put it, [...] "much of Kimura's early work turned out to be pre-adapted for use in the <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> of neutral evolution". As new experimental techniques and genetic knowledge became available, Kimura expanded the scope of the neutral theory and created mathematical methods for testing it against the available evidence. Kimura produced a monograph on the neutral theory in 1983, The neutral theory of molecular evolution, and also worked to promote the theory through popular writings such as My views on evolution, a book that became a best-seller in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Author and musicologist Walter Everett {{recognises}} {{the album}} {{as a successful}} combination of [...] "rich multipart vocals brimming with expressive dissonance treatment, a deep exploration of different guitars and the capos that produced different colors from familiar finger patterns, surprising new timbres and electronic effects, a more soulful pentatonic approach to vocal and instrumental melody tinged by frequent twelve-bar jams that accompanied the more serious recording, and a fairly consistent search for meaningful ideas in lyrics". Everett credits several of these qualities, as on Revolver, as the inspiration for many progressive rock bands of the early 1970s. Citing a <b>quantitative</b> <b>study</b> of tempos in music from the era, he also identifies Rubber Soul as a work that was [...] "made more to be thought about than danced to", and an album that [...] "began a far-reaching trend" [...] in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music.|$|E
