25|$|Hindu {{women have}} also been known to be victims of {{kidnapping}} and forced conversion to Islam. An official of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said in 2010 that around 20 to 25 Hindu girls are abducted every month and forcibly converted to Islam. Many Hindus are continuing to flee Pakistan even now due to persecution. Krishan Bheel, a Hindu member of the National Assembly of Pakistan, came into the news recently for manhandling <b>Qari</b> Gul Rehman after being taunted with a religious insult.|$|E
25|$|With {{the support}} of United States special forces and German troops, a third {{offensive}} was launched in the Gor Tepa region and spearheaded by Afghan forces on November 5.

25|$|On October 2, 2003, Khadr, his son Abdulkareem, al-Jowfi, al-Iraqi, Khalid Habib and <b>Qari</b> Ismail {{were all}} {{staying at a}} South Waziristan safe house. The {{following}} day, after Fajr prayers, Khadr told his son that Pakistani troops had warned a raid was scheduled in the village, {{and told him to}} start preparing to leave the village together. However, a Pakistani helicopter team and hundreds of security forces attacked the village before the pair were able to depart, and Abdulkareem lay down in a ditch but was shot in the spine, paralyzing him from the waist down. The 17-year-old Khalid Murjan Salim was arrested at the scene, the son of alleged militant Murjan Salim, and extradited to Egypt shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Qari</b> Bashir Haqqani, the Taliban {{commander}} for Kunduz province, had in 2008 already {{vowed to}} increase his men's efforts against the Germans. Reluctant to engage directly, the Taliban mainly relied on guerilla tactics, killing three Germans over the year and wounding more than thirty along with causing casualties among the mountain Afghan security forces. This trend continued until 2009 (hitherto German troops had only {{been involved in a}} handful of firefights with opposing forces). In mid-2009 though, the number of direct contacts had already exceeded the total of the prior seven years. A similar development struck Faryab province and the surrounding districts: having already taken action to rout the Taliban, the Norwegian forces of Provincial Reconstruction Team Meymaneh saw themselves increasingly threatened by insurgent activities.|$|E
25|$|Additionally {{reinforcements}} {{were deployed}} to PRT Kunduz, almost doubling the garrison there. The security situation had turned notably worse. All girl schools in Chardara {{had to be}} closed for fear of imminent terrorist attacks. Manpower shortages did not allow German forces to uphold a permanent deterrence against armed militias, crippling the long-term effect of their actions. However, German and Afghan troops increased their efforts {{to take on the}} Taliban in different operations of various character. On May 15, ANSF killed <b>Qari</b> Sidiqulla, a Taliban district commander for Imam Sahib, in Imam Sahib's Sharawan region. Three of his fighters were also killed. In the same week, the Taliban tried to assassinate Mohammad Omar, the Governor of Kunduz. He and his bodyguard were slightly wounded. On July 1, four ANSF personnel were killed in Chahardara.|$|E

500|$|The Lal Masjid {{was founded}} by Maulana <b>Qari</b> Abdullah in 1965. In English, Lal Masjid {{translates}} to the [...] "Red Mosque", and the name {{is derived from the}} red colour of the mosque's walls and interiors. Abdullah taught radical Islam and preached Jihad during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Since its founding, Lal Masjid was frequented by leaders of the Pakistani military and government. Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Army Chief of Staff who later became president after seizing power in a coup d'état in 1977, was a close associate of Abdullah's. The mosque is located near the headquarters of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), and several staff members were known to go there for prayers.|$|E
500|$|The general {{population}} was less sympathetic towards Noreen. Several signs were erected in Sheikhupura and other rural areas declaring {{support for the}} blasphemy laws, including one that called for Noreen to be beheaded. Mohammad Saleem, {{a member of the}} Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan Party, organized a demonstration in Rawalpindi and led a small crowd chanting, [...] "Hang her, hang her." [...] In December 2010, a month after Noreen's conviction, a Muslim cleric announced a 500,000 Pakistani rupee award (the equivalent of $10,000) to anyone who would kill her. One survey reported that around 10 million Pakistanis had said that {{they would be willing to}} personally kill her out of either religious conviction or for the reward. The village mosque in Ittan Wali was reportedly indifferent towards Noreen's plight; its imam, <b>Qari</b> Mohammed Salim, stated that he had wept for joy on learning that she had been sentenced to death and threatened that some people would [...] "take the law into their own hands" [...] should she be pardoned or released. However, journalist Julie McCarthy suggested that the country's [...] "more peaceful majority views" [...] had been overshadowed by the more vocal fundamentalists.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier {{claims of}} the Taliban were refuted by <b>Qari</b> Malang, the {{representative}} of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. [...] "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded.

2500|$|Janner-Klausner was {{especially}} vocal {{on the topic}} of the Calais Jungle, visiting on multiple occasions. In September 2015, a short film was made documenting Janner-Klausner visiting the Jungle alongside Imam <b>Qari</b> Muhammad Asim. When the Jungle was threatened with demolition in early 2016, she was a key signatory on a Citizens UK letter signed by over 90,000 people to halt demolition until vulnerable children had been granted safe arrangements. In July 2016, she led further efforts to prevent the demolition, including a letter to the government signed by Christian and Jewish faith leaders. After the demolition of the camp, Janner-Klausner continued to speak out, stating that [...] "it is beyond comprehension that people can be mistreated like this".|$|E
2500|$|A {{significant}} breakthrough {{was made}} {{four days after}} the incident when all 16 of the attackers were identified. According to the police chief, Zakaria, the help from the local Diamer jirga was instrumental in this development. The men volunteering in the jirga were dropped off into various adjacent valleys and then picked up for a debriefing in Chilas. The police chief further stated that all the attackers were local, with 10 of them belonging to Diamer, 3 to Mansehra and 3 of them belonging to Kohistan. The ten Diamer valley residents were identified as Hidayat Ullah, Shafiqullah, <b>Qari</b> Rafaqat, Sana Ullah, Malik Nijad, Azizullah, Mahfoozul Haq, Mujeed, Shafi Muhammad and Hazrat Oman. The Chief Secretary of Gilgit-Baltistan, Munir Badini, was hesitant in linking them to the Pakistani Taliban but confirmed that from the reports he received, the assailants were trained in FATA, a place [...] downhill that is a hotbed of extremism and borders Afghanistan.|$|E
2500|$|Three of {{the most}} {{prominent}} classical poets in Afghanistan at the time were <b>Qari</b> Abdullah, Abdul Haq Betab and Khalil Ullah Khalili. The first two received the honorary title Malek ul Shoara (King of Poets). Khalili, the third and youngest, was drawn toward the Khorasan style of poetry instead of the usual Hendi style. He was also interested in modern poetry and wrote a few poems in a more modern style with new aspects of thought and meaning. In 1318 (AH), after two poems by Nima Youshij titled [...] "Gharab" [...] and [...] "Ghoghnus" [...] were published, Khalili wrote a poem under the name [...] "Sorude Kuhestan" [...] or [...] "The Song of the Mountain" [...] in the same rhyming pattern as Nima and sent it to the Kabul Literary Circle. The traditionalists in Kabul refused to publish it because it was not written in the traditional rhyme. They criticized Khalili for modernizing his style.|$|E
