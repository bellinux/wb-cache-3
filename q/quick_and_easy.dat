5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> to use.|$|E

25|$|Linear {{interpolation}} is <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy,</b> {{but it is}} {{not very}} precise. Another disadvantage is that the interpolant is not differentiable at the point x'k.|$|E
25|$|A <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> {{remedy for}} nettle stings is to rub bracken on the {{affected}} area. The juice it releases alleviates the sting, and bracken often grows near stinging nettle.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} water vapor {{directly}} controls the permittivity of the air. During times of low humidity, static discharge is <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy.</b> During times of higher humidity, fewer static discharges occur. Permittivity and capacitance work hand in hand to produce the megawatt outputs of lightning.|$|E

25|$|Maximum Principal Stress Theory – by W.J.M Rankine(1850). Yield {{occurs when}} the largest {{principal}} stress exceeds the uniaxial tensile yield strength. Although this criterion allows for a <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> comparison with experimental data it is rarely suitable for design purposes. This theory gives good predictions for brittle materials.|$|E

25|$|Social {{networking}} is {{more recently}} {{being used by}} various government agencies. Social networking tools serve as a <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> way {{for the government to}} get the opinion of the public and to keep the public updated on their activity, however this comes with a significant risk of abuse, for example to cultivate a culture of fear such as that outlined in Nineteen Eighty-Four or THX-1138.|$|E
25|$|The CSR, has {{a variety}} of other {{features}} which enhance its performance. There are no power brakes or power steering, making the CSR extremely responsive and extremely agile. The clutch also engages extremely high, allowing for quick shifts while racing. In addition, the flywheel is very light. This makes heel-and-toeing extremely <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> as the engine revs up very quickly with little momentum.|$|E
50|$|Chapter 13 {{talks about}} how a person comes from base to great fortune more through fraud than through force. He thinks that fraud is just <b>quicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>easier,</b> so force is not needed.|$|R
50|$|The {{completion}} of the Northern Central Railway after 1850 further escalated Elmira's contribution to the Underground Railroad. The new railway allowed slaves to hide in baggage cars, making their journey <b>quicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>easier.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shaving {{green wood}} with the {{drawknife}} or spokeshave {{along the grain}} is far <b>quicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> work than turning across it. Skilled operators can produce very fine results with a drawknife and shavehorse, requiring minimal lathe finishing.|$|R
25|$|The KLM was {{designed}} to be a <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> to use system design tool, which means that no deep knowledge about psychology is required for its usage. Also, task times can be predicted (given the limitations) without having to build a prototype, recruit and test users, which saves time and money. See the example for a practical use of the KLM as a system design tool.|$|E
25|$|Chappakadavu is the {{mainstay}} of the fishing industry in the area. Earlier it was a unique place close to the sea, with a canal having <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> access to the backwater system and thence to the consumers. Now transport is mainly overland, but the prominence of this fish processing area and market continues. The provision of the fishing gap has helped to retain the importance of Chappakadavu.|$|E
25|$|Mixing by gas separation: a {{nitrogen}} permeable membrane is used {{to remove}} some of the smaller nitrogen molecules from low pressure air until the required mix is achieved. The resulting low pressure nitrox is then pumped into cylinders by a compressor. Limited range of mixes are possible, but the equipment is <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> to operate and relatively safe, as there is never high partial pressure oxygen involved.|$|E

25|$|Subsonic (or low-speed) {{aerodynamics}} describes fluid {{motion in}} flows which are {{much lower than}} the speed of sound everywhere in the flow. There are several branches of subsonic flow but one special case arises when the flow is inviscid, incompressible and irrotational. This case is called potential flow and allows the differential equations that describe the flow to be a simplified version of the equations of fluid dynamics, thus making available to the aerodynamicist a range of <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> solutions.|$|E
25|$|The D'Arsonval/Weston meter {{movement}} uses {{a moving}} coil which carries a pointer and rotates on pivots or a taut band ligament. The coil rotates in a permanent magnetic field and is restrained by fine spiral springs which {{also serve to}} carry current into the moving coil. It gives proportional measurement rather than just detection, and deflection is independent of {{the orientation of the}} meter. Instead of balancing a bridge, values could be directly read off the instrument's scale, which made measurement <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{coalition}} government has given funding {{approval for the}} extension of the Midland Metro from Birmingham Snow Hill Station, passing through the shopping district to Birmingham New Street Station. The £127 million state-of-the-art, electrically powered light rail system will also provide <b>quick</b> <b>and</b> <b>easy</b> access to Birmingham's business district and the Jewellery Quarter. Track laying was due to start in 2013 with a completion date of 2015 however following a number of delays the extension was finally opened on 30 May 2016. The extension is forecast to boost the regional economy by £50 million a year and create up to 1,300 sustainable new jobs.|$|E
30|$|Various studies {{comparing}} the MEA with trans-cervical resection of endometrium (TCRE) and roller-ball technique have consistently {{shown that the}} former is a safer, <b>quicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> technique with similar efficacy. It avoids hysteroscopic distension media, and risks of earthing and haemorrhage [2 – 7].|$|R
50|$|The {{second is}} a rail mount, which clamps {{to both sides}} of the rail from {{underneath}} it. This can be seen as <b>quicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> to mount in the right conditions, but can mean more frequent checks need to be made to ensure correct positioning.|$|R
50|$|However, in many {{buildings}} the crash bar functions {{as the primary}} mechanism for opening a door in normal circumstances as well. In some places, they are even used when not required by code because they are <b>quicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> for users compared with a knob or lever handle.|$|R
