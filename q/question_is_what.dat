25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It {{is based on the}} here and now, and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into figure or ground. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.|$|E
25|$|Among the 5 million, 771,844 were {{military}} casualties {{killed in}} action and other causes. The military only covers 15% of the total casualties. The main <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened to 85% (spread over all millets) of the casualties, which is more {{but not less than}} 4,000,000. Ottoman statistics analyzed by Turkish Kamer Kasim (Manchester University, Ph.D.), claims that cumulative percentage was 26.9% (higher than 25% reported by western sources) of the population, which this size stands out among the countries that took part in World War I. To understand the size of the issue, Kamer Kasım's %1.9 increase on the totals adds 399,000 civilians to the total number, which has not been reported in western sources.|$|E
25|$|Since 1972, {{however, the}} U.K. has fallen under the cross-border-competition law regime of the European Community, which is found {{primarily}} in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty of the European Community. Companies that form a cartel or collude to disrupt competition (Article 81) or to abuse a dominant {{position in the}} market – for instance through a monopoly (Article 82) – face fines from the public-enforcement authorities, {{and in some cases}} they also face a cause of action in tort. A huge issue in the E.U. is whether to follow the U.S. approach of private damages actions to prevent anti-competitive conduct. In other words, the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> should be seen as a private wrong (as was held in the vertical restraints case of Courage Ltd v Crehan) and what should be seen as a public wrong where only public enforcers are competent to impose penalties. In 1998 the United Kingdom brought its legislation up to date, with the Competition Act 1998, followed by the Enterprise Act 2002, a regime mirroring that of the European Union. The domestic enforcers are the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission.|$|E

500|$|A {{closely related}} <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> counts {{as a good}} {{scientific}} explanation. In addition to providing predictions about future events, society often takes scientific theories to provide explanations for events that occur regularly or have already occurred. [...] Philosophers have investigated the criteria by which a scientific theory {{can be said to}} have successfully explained a phenomenon, as well as what it means to say a scientific theory has explanatory power.|$|E
500|$|As Michael Robertson and Garry Walter suppose, {{psychiatric}} {{power in}} practically all societies expands {{on the grounds}} of public safety, which, {{in the view of the}} leaders of the USSR, was best maintained by the repression of dissidence. According to Gwen Adshead, a British forensic psychotherapist at the Broadmoor Hospital, the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is meant by the word [...] "abnormal." [...] Evidently it is possible for abnormal to be identified as [...] "socially inappropriate." [...] If that is the case, social and political dissent is turned into a symptom by the medical terminology, and thereby becomes an individual's personal problem, not a social matter.|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{of several}} probability puzzles {{related to the}} Monty Hall problem is Bertrand's box paradox, posed by Joseph Bertrand in 1889 in his Calcul des probabilités (Barbeau 1993). In this puzzle there are three boxes: a box containing two gold coins, a box with two silver coins, and a box with one of each. After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random {{that happens to be}} a gold coin, the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> is the probability that the other coin is gold.

2500|$|The <b>question</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> are {{the ways}} in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody {{unchanged}} or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach's treatment of chorales.... Another method... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above.... There is yet a third way... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue.|$|E
2500|$|For example, {{consider}} a phylogeny recovered for a genus of plants containing 6 species A - F (Figure 1), where each plant is pollinated by either a [...] "bee", [...] "hummingbird" [...] or [...] "wind". One obvious <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> the pollinators at deeper nodes {{were in the}} phylogeny of this genus of plants. Under maximum parsimony, an ancestral state reconstruction for this clade reveals that [...] "hummingbird" [...] is the most parsimonious ancestral state for the lower clade (plants D, E, F), that the ancestral states for the nodes in the top clade (plants A, B, C) are equivocal and that both [...] "hummingbird" [...] or [...] "bee" [...] pollinators are equally plausible for the pollination state {{at the root of}} the phylogeny. Supposing we have strong evidence from the fossil record that the root state is [...] "hummingbird". Resolution of the root to [...] "hummingbird" [...] would yield the pattern of ancestral state reconstruction depicted by the symbols at the nodes (Figure 1) with the state requiring the fewest number of changes circled.|$|E
