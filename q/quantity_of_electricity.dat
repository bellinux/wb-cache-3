The harmony {{which this}} {{theory of the}} {{definite}} evolution and the equivalent definite action <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> introduces into the associated theories of definite proportions and electrochemical affinity, is very great. According to it, the equivalent weights of bodies are simply those <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> them which contain equal <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity,</b> or have naturally equal electric powers; it being the ELECTRICITY which determines the equivalent number, because it determines the combining force. Or, if we adopt the atomic theory or phraseology, then the atoms of bodies which are equivalents {{to each other in}} their ordinary chemical action, have equal <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> naturally associated with them.

In {{the third}} series of these Researches, after proving the {{identity}} of electricities derived from different sources, and showing, by actual measurement, the extraordinary <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> evolved by a very feeble voltaic arrangement (371. 376.), I announced a law, derived from experiment, which seemed to me {{of the utmost importance}} to the science of electricity in general, and that branch of it denominated electro-chemistry in particular.

In {{concluding}} {{this division}} on the intensity necessary for electrolyzation, I cannot resist {{pointing out the}} following remarkable conclusion in relation to intensity generally. It would appear that when a voltaic current is produced, having a certain intensity, dependent upon {{the strength of the}} chemical affinities by which that current is excited (916.), it can decompose a particular electrolyte without relation to the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> passed, the intensity deciding whether the electrolyte shall give way or not. If that conclusion be confirmed, then we may arrange circumstances so that the same <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> may pass in the same time, in at the same surface, into the same decomposing body in the same state, and yet, differing in intensity, will decompose in one case and in the other not:--for taking a source of too low an intensity to decompose, and ascertaining the quantity passed in a given time, it is easy to take another source having a sufficient intensity, and reducing the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> from it by the intervention of bad conductors to the same proportion as the former current, and then all the conditions will be fulfilled which are required to produce the result described.|$|E

6000|$|... 868. What, then, follows as a {{necessary}} consequence of the whole experiment? Why, this: that the chemical action upon 32.31 parts, or one equivalent of zinc, in this simple voltaic circle, was able to evolve such <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> {{in the form of}} a current, as, passing through water, should decompose 9 parts, or one equivalent of that substance: and considering the definite relations of electricity as developed in the preceding parts of the present paper, the results prove that the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> which, being naturally associated with the particles of matter, gives them their combining power, is able, when thrown into a current, to separate those particles from their state of combination; or, in other words, that the electricity which decomposes, and that which is evolved by the decomposition of a certain quantity of matter, are alike.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Power {{system losses}} {{can be divided}} into two categories: {{technical}} losses and non-technical losses. Technical losses are naturally occurring losses (caused by actions internal to the power system) and consist mainly of power dissipation in electrical system components such as transmission lines, power transformers, measurement systems, etc. Technical losses result from the impedance of the network components such as electric lines / cables, transformers, metering and protecting equipment etc. Non-technical losses, on the other hand, are caused by theft, metering inaccuracies. The distribution system accounts for highest technical and non technical losses in the power system. The transmission and distribution losses in our country, which were around 15 % up to 1968, increased gradually to 30 % by 2012 - 13. Simply Electricity losses are defined as the difference between <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> delivered and <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> recorded as sold to customers. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze Technical and Non Technical Losses and its economic consequences in power sector with the help of a case study and MATLAB Simulation in power systems...|$|R
2500|$|This {{argument}} is disputed by large industrial customers, who {{point out that}} data from 2000 to 2006 indicate that electricity exports prices get lower when quantities increase, and vice versa. [...] "We find that the more we export, the less lucrative it gets", said Luc Boulanger, {{the head of the}} association representing Quebec's large industrial customers. In his opinion, the high volatility <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> markets and the transmission infrastructure physical limitations reduce the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> that can be exported when prices are higher.|$|R

6000|$|... 329. When electro-chemical {{decomposition}} takes place, {{there is}} great {{reason to believe that}} the quantity of matter decomposed is not proportionate to the intensity, but to the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> passed (320.). Of this I shall be able to offer some proofs in a future part of this paper (375. 377.). But in the experiment under consideration, this is not the case. If, with a constant pair of points, the electricity be passed from the machine in sparks, a certain proportion of gas is evolved; but if the sparks be rendered shorter, less gas is evolved; and if no sparks be passed, there is scarcely a sensible portion of gases set free. On substituting solution of sulphate of soda for water, scarcely a sensible quantity of gas could be procured even with powerful sparks, and nearly none with the mere current; yet the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> in a given time was the same in all these cases.|$|E
6000|$|... 510. Electro-chemical {{decomposition}} is {{well known}} to depend essentially upon the current of electricity. I have shown that in certain cases (375.) the decomposition is proportionate to the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>electricity</b> passing, whatever may be its intensity or its source, and that the same is probably true for all cases (377.), even when the utmost generality is taken on the one hand, and great precision of expression on the other (505.).|$|E
