40|$|Abstract This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the close company rules in chapter 56 - 57 within the Swedish income tax law (IL). The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the outsider rule in 57 : 5 IL. If a shareholder or a family member works or have worked actively within the company within the fiscal year or the last five fiscal years then the partner has <b>qualified</b> <b>shares</b> and is to be taxed according to the special closed company rules. If an outsider, directly or indirectly, is a significant shareholder within the company, and directly or indirectly, are entitled to dividends then an active partner only has <b>qualified</b> <b>shares</b> if there is special reasons. When making the assessment regard {{must be made to}} conditions under the fiscal year or the last five fiscal years. There is special reason not to apply the rule if there are agreements regarding how the profit should be split or cross-ownerships between companies. If a taxpayer can show that an outsider own 30 percent of the closed company and has a right to dividends and there is no special reason to why the rule should not be applied then the outsider rule is applicable. If the rule is applicable it means that all the shareholders within the company will be taxed for dividends and capital gain with a 25 percent tax rate...|$|R

This paper presents a secure steganographic technique for true color (RGB) images and uses Discrete Cosine Transform to compress the images.

The joint-operating plan became effective January 1, 1908.

40|$|A visual {{cryptography}} scheme (VCS) is {{a secret}} sharing of secret image shares which involves dividing the secret image into number of shares and {{a certain number of}} shares are sent over the network. The decryption process involves stacking of the shares to get the secret image. The main advantage of visual cryptography scheme is that a number of <b>qualified</b> <b>shares</b> are able to recover the secret image without any cryptographic knowledge, calculation and computation devices. Simple Visual Cryptographic technique is not secure. Because simple visual cryptography scheme only deals with creation of secret share and just combined it at receiver side. In the proposed system we apply visual cryptography technique. The image is to be transferred on the network (also known as secret image) is first compressed and then hidden by cover image using LSB technique. To enhance security, additional security measures are applied further to get encrypted image using symmetric key algorithm. The shares are generated from the encrypted image using RNS (Residual Number System) algorithm. Next share stacking procedure is applied using CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) algorithm to get final encrypted image at receiver side. Further, decryption of final encrypted image is done by using same algorithm which is used for encryption purpose. By applying this technique security and quality of image is improved and pixel expansion problem will get reduced...|$|R
