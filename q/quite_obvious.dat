The convictions of those who are thus locally convinced are taken on trust and believed by the masses everywhere.|$|E
25|$|It was {{interesting}} to see the crowd's reaction to the English last-wicket partnership. They cheered every scoring shot and went into ecstasy over Tattersall's efforts. It was <b>quite</b> <b>obvious</b> that {{they had decided to}} fight the battle out for England and were plainly partisan...There are many Australians, and I am one of them, who believe that cricket will reach its highest level again when England and Australia are on level pegging. These were the people who cheered the tenth-wicket partnership to the echo.|$|E
25|$|It is <b>quite</b> <b>obvious</b> from {{a review}} of Schreiner's conduct through {{the latter half of}} 1899 that he was entirely mistaken in his view of the Transvaal situation. He {{demonstrated}} the same inability to understand the uitlanders' grievances, the same futile belief in the eventual fairness of President Kruger as premier of Cape Colony as he had shown when giving evidence before the British South Africa Select Committee into the causes of the Jameson Raid. Experience should have taught him that President Kruger was beyond any appeal to reason, and that the protestations of President Steyn were insincere.|$|E

25|$|Intertidal {{organisms are}} also {{especially}} prone to desiccation {{during periods of}} emersion. Again, mobile organisms avoid desiccation {{in the same way}} as they avoid extreme temperatures: by hunkering down in mild and moist refuges. Many intertidal organisms, including Littorina snails, prevent water loss by having waterproof outer surfaces, pulling completely into their shells, and sealing shut their shell opening. Limpets (Patella) do not use such a sealing plate but occupy a home-scar to which they seal the lower edge of their flattened conical shell using a grinding action. They return to this home-scar after each grazing excursion, typically just before emersion. On soft rocks, these scars are <b>quite</b> <b>obvious.</b> Still other organisms, such as the algae Ulva and Porphyra, are able to rehydrate and recover after periods of severe desiccation.|$|E
25|$|Development {{continued}} in the US as well during the 1930s and mid-1930, the first inverting image intensifier was developed at RCA. This tube used an electrostatic inverter to focus an image from a spherical cathode onto a spherical screen. (The choice of spheres was to reduce off-axial aberrations.) Subsequent development of this technology led directly to the first Generation 0 image intensifiers which were used by the military during World War II to allow vision at night with infrared lighting for both shooting and personal night vision. The first military night vision device were introduced by the German army as early as 1939, developed since 1935. Early night vision devices based on these technologies were used by both sides in World War II. However, the downside of active night vision (when infrared light is used) {{is that it is}} <b>quite</b> <b>obvious</b> to anyone else using the technology.|$|E
500|$|In her director's notes, Burshtein wrote, [...] "I love Jane Austen. She's romantic, intelligent, {{and full}} of humor. … The {{parallel}} is also <b>quite</b> <b>obvious</b> in that 'Fill the Void' {{takes place in a}} world where the rules are rigid and clear. The characters are not looking for some way to burst out of that world. Instead, they are {{trying to find a way}} to live within it." [...] Critics noted the similarities between Austen's characters and those in Fill the Void, and Stephanie Merry from The Washington Post likened the character of Frieda to Charlotte Lucas from Pride and Prejudice. Frieda, like Charlotte, has never had any marriage prospects and is the subject of others' pity as a result.|$|E

500|$|Although rival claimants {{of royal}} descent must have existed, {{there is no}} {{recorded}} resistance to Aldfrith's accession. It has also been suggested that Aldfrith's ascent was eased by support from Dál Riata, the Uí Néill, and the Picts, all of whom might have preferred the mature, known quantity of Aldfrith to an unknown and more warlike monarch, such as Ecgfrith or Oswiu had been. The historian Herman Moisl, for example, wrote that [...] "Aldfrith was in Iona in the year preceding the battle immediately afterwards, he was king of Northumbria. It is <b>quite</b> <b>obvious</b> {{that he must have}} been installed by the Pictish-Dál Riatan alliance". Subsequently a battle between the Northumbrians and the Picts in which Berht was killed is recorded by Bede and the Irish annals in 697 or 698. Overall, Aldfrith appears to have abandoned his predecessors' attempts to dominate Northumbria's neighbours.|$|E
500|$|Another popular Farkism {{involves}} KABC-TV Consumer Specialist Ric Romero, {{which began}} on October 19, 2005, {{when he wrote}} a news story on the [...] "new" [...] Internet phenomenon of blogging.

On December 7, 2009, Drew Curtis discovered his Facebook fan page, which led Romero to ask the Farkers that joined his new Facebook page to donate to the Spark of Love Toy Drive, which subsequently resulted in 582 online donations totaling $13,659.20 by December 16, 2009.

500|$|The {{operation}} had two aims: {{creating the}} appearance of army units where none existed and concealing the real armour, artillery and matériel at the front. Barkas observed that [...] "the concealment of the huge assembly of the Armoured Corps was essentially a piece of military planning by Army Headquarters, with Camouflage carrying out certain specific tasks". Since {{it would be impossible}} to hide the existence of such a large number of vehicles, especially of tanks in the Martello area, Barkas planned instead to make the vehicles there <b>quite</b> <b>obvious,</b> as trucks, well before battle. The tanks, too, would be openly displayed, far behind the battle front. When the enemy saw that nothing seemed to be happening, the trucks would be replaced by tanks, masquerading as trucks. That meant that the tanks, too, would have to be seen not to move.so they would all be replaced with dummies. An unprecedented and [...] "formidable" [...] number of dummies were required: more than 400 tanks, 100 guns, and nearly 2000 soft-skinned vehicles.|$|E

Robida had a swastika tattoo and flaunted Nazi insignias and paraphernalia on his website. On February 5, Robida shot and killed a traffic officer during a routine stop. When police pulled Robida over during a later stop, he killed his girlfriend, Jennifer Bailey of Charleston, West Virginia, then opened fire on the police. Robida was shot twice in the head during the shootout with the police, and later died in the hospital. On February 7, Insane Clown Posse released a statement on the Robida attacks. The group's manager Alex Abbiss extended Bruce and Utsler's condolences and prayers {{to the families of}} the victims, stating that [...] "It's <b>quite</b> <b>obvious</b> that this guy had no clue what being a Juggalo is all about.

[...] Though Miller strongly implies that Hubbard's mentor, Snake Thompson, was only a myth, Frenschkowski confirms that Joseph [...] "Snake" [...] Thompson (1874-1943) was an actual Commander in the US Navy Medical Corp and a personal friend of Sigmund Freud, just as Hubbard said. [...] Miller states that Hubbard was a disciple of Aleister Crowley, with the implication that Scientology derives from Crowley's teachings, but Frenschkowski concludes, [...] "Nevertheless it remains <b>quite</b> <b>obvious</b> that Hubbard did not take much inspiration from Crowley and Parsons." ...|$|E
