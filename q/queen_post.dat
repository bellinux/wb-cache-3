2500|$|Early European truss bridges used {{king post}} and <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> configurations. Some early German bridges {{included}} diagonal panel bracing in trusses with parallel {{top and bottom}} chords. [...] To {{solve the problem of}} deterioration of the wood upon exposure to weather, various forms of covering came to be employed.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> truss, {{sometimes}} queenpost or queenspost, {{is similar}} to a king post truss in that the outer supports are angled towards the centre of the structure. [...] The primary difference is the horizontal extension at the centre which relies on beam action to provide mechanical stability. This truss style is only suitable for relatively short spans.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Blomfield's {{church of}} 1881 {{was built in}} his {{preferred}} Early English Gothic Revival style, mostly in red brick with some Bath Stone dressings. [...] The arcade-flanked nave had {{five and a half}} bays—an arrangement also seen at Blomfield's St John the Evangelist's Church in Preston Village, Brighton—a clerestory and a <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> ceiling. [...] The aisles on the north and south sides had brick arches and Bath Stone pillars. [...] The chancel had an organ chamber. [...] The octagonal tower at the southwest corner (a local landmark) rose in four stages, the topmost of which had four bells. [...] The church also had a baptistery.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} truss construction uses two <b>queen</b> <b>posts</b> (or queen-posts). These vertical posts, positioned {{along the}} base of the truss, are supported by the sloping sides of the truss, rather than reaching its apex. A development adds a collar beam above the <b>queen</b> <b>posts,</b> which are then termed queen struts. A section of the tie beam between the <b>queen</b> <b>posts</b> may be removed to create a hammerbeam roof.|$|R
50|$|In 1982 {{there were}} {{original}} massive floor beams and double-collared trusses, with <b>queen</b> <b>posts</b> below. There {{is also a}} massive fireplace.|$|R
50|$|In an eight-season career, <b>Queen</b> <b>posted</b> a 27-40 {{record with}} 328 strikeouts and a 5.09 ERA in 556 innings pitched. His best season was in 1951 {{when he led}} the National League {{pitchers}} with a 6.58 SO/9 (123 SO in 168 IP).|$|R
50|$|Queen strut: 1)(U.K.) A <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> {{which does}} not carry a plate.; 2)(U.S.) A <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> {{not part of a}} truss in the {{engineering}} sense and in compression (a more modern definition than 2)in <b>Queen</b> <b>Post</b> above).|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the span}} range of <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> trusses was fairly narrow, with king posts {{being used for}} shorter spans and the upper limit of a <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> span being not much longer. [...] After {{the turn of the}} 20th century, steel beam bridges became more common, and metal Pratt truss bridges {{superseded}} the <b>queen</b> <b>post.</b> With no new <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> bridges being built in Michigan, attrition eliminated all but this single example.|$|E
50|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> truss and {{the king}} post truss may be combined, by using the {{straining}} beam of the <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> truss as the tie beam for a king post truss above. Such combinations are known as compound trusses.|$|E
50|$|Students {{may live}} in one of the eight {{residence}} halls on campus. All are co-ed, with males and females divided by floor or wing. Each hall accommodates from 40 to 380 students. Five of the residence halls - Brookville, Kings, <b>Queens,</b> <b>Post</b> and Riggs - offer traditional-style living.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} remains basically unchanged {{since it}} was first built. The altar is along the east wall of the sanctuary. The aisle is left of center with the pews along the north wall. The structural system on the inside consists of King <b>posts,</b> <b>Queen</b> <b>posts,</b> collar beams and struts which enhance the vertical character of the space.|$|R
50|$|The {{second floor}} {{has a similar}} layout {{although}} it is less ornate. All the bedrooms have cast-iron heat registers and a brass nameplate on {{the door with the}} manufacturer's name. The third story's garret was used as a ballroom. Four <b>queen</b> <b>posts</b> surround the area under the skylight {{in the middle of an}} L-shaped set of servants' quarters on the north and east.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> bridge has two upright queen posts {{on either}} side, each placed {{about one-third of}} the way along the span, {{connected}} across the top by a beam. (In comparison, each side of a king post bridge has a single king post {{in the center of the}} span.) A diagonal brace runs between the top of the <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> and the outer edge. [...] <b>Queen</b> <b>post</b> bridges can span greater distances than single-upright king post bridges.|$|E
50|$|A <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> is {{a tension}} member in a truss that can span longer {{openings}} than a king post truss. A king post uses one central supporting post, whereas the <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> truss uses two. Even {{though it is}} a tension member, rather than a compression member, they are commonly still called a post. A <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> is often confused with a queen strut, one of two compression members in roof framing which do not form a truss in the engineering sense.|$|E

5000|$|The roof is now tiled, {{although}} Horsham {{stone was}} used previously and straw {{may have been}} used in the building's early history. [...] It is hipped on the south side and gabled at the north, behind the modern chimney. The internal roof structure uses crown <b>posts</b> and <b>queen</b> <b>posts</b> throughout, with a mixture of flat and arched tie-beams. [...] Except in the south bay, all of the internal timbers are original, albeit with some reconditioning, and the 20th-century work uncovered {{them for the first time}} in many years.|$|R
50|$|A <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> truss has two {{principal}} rafters and two vertical queen posts. The <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> truss extends the span, and combined with spliced joints {{in the longer}} members extends the useful span for trusses of these types. As with a king post, the queen posts may be replaced with iron rods and thus called a queen rod truss. This truss is often known as a palladiana (Palladian truss) in Italy, as it was frequently used by the Venetian architect Andrea Palladio. Sometimes a palladian truss {{is defined as a}} compound truss with a <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> and king post truss in the same assembly.|$|E

50|$|After Gnarr became {{mayor of}} Reykjavík, it was jokingly {{proposed}} that the city be nicknamed Gnarrenburg, the title of an earlier television talk show featuring Gnarr. As mayor, he has appeared at the 2010 Gay Pride parade as a drag <b>queen,</b> <b>posting</b> a video holiday greeting wearing a Darth Vader mask and a Santa Claus cap, and suggesting a merger with neighboring municipality Kópavogur. Gnarr protested about the Chinese government's treatment of human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, before the announcement of Liu's award for the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. He has also stated that he believes {{the importance of the}} European Union is highly over-rated. His government also included the granting of long-awaited permission for the construction of Iceland's first purpose-built mosque.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> {{truss bridge}} is of ancient origin, and both king post and <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> trusses were {{constructed}} from timber from the Middle Ages through early American history, {{and used for}} roof trusses and bridges. [...] The technology spread through the United States with the pioneers, and uncounted numbers of timber king- and <b>queen</b> <b>post</b> bridges were constructed throughout Michigan in the 18th and 19th centuries. As the 19th century progressed, the basic engineering form of the bridge remained constant, but the materials used evolved from timber to timber/iron combinations to iron and steel. Iron and steel versions of the bridge were marketed to local governments by bridge fabricators as low-cost durable structures for spanning short distances.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{principal}} trusses of {{the roof}} of the Chapel are sound, of oak, and moulded. The <b>queen</b> <b>posts</b> have moulded bases, and have the appearance of having been used in a more ancient building. The roof was once stripped of stone slates, and new rafters and Welsh slates put. These are lighter, and thus the weight, which has pressed the walls outwards has been relieved. The groined ceiling, of wood and plaster, seems sound. Brackets and corbels are decayed. The walls are much perished, especially the south wall. Part of the cornice has been removed and wet has got in. The upper part of the wall is nearly 7 inches out of centre. Pinnacles and battlements are much perished... The Chapel to be done as soon as possible. The interior decayed work to be taken out, and the cornice, between the battlements, done in cement." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{second floor}} of the William Street wing is notable for its exposed roof {{structure}} comprising multiple sets of <b>Queens</b> <b>post</b> trusses with unusual tusk tenon detailing and rafters.

50|$|The Great Hall, or dining hall, is a {{space with}} a large wooden roof of collar beams and arched braces, with king <b>post</b> and raking <b>queen</b> <b>posts.</b> Each truss is {{visually}} supported by short stone shafts with foliate capitals and corbels in the early 14th century manner, as is the tracery. The formal entry stairs intended to be placed to the south have never been built, and the original eastern wall {{has been replaced by}} an open arcade. On the western wall of the Great Hall is the Purcell Window, completed in 1930 by Hardman & Co. Birmingham. The upper windows contain the coats of arms of the universities of Sydney, Oxford (trefoils), Cambridge (trefoils), Paris (left soufflet) and St. John's College (right soufflet). The Great Hall has on display a collection of portraits of past visitors, rectors, fellows, and students, with the most significant portrait being Archbishop Polding / Gallery oil painting of Archbishop Polding DSB, 1866, by Eugene Montagu Scott (1835-1909), which was originally commissioned for St Mary's Cathedral.|$|R
5000|$|Although Menokin {{is now in}} ruin, a {{remarkable}} collection of Colonial architectural elements remains. Approximately 80 percent of Menokin's original materials have survived, including: original stones, brick and mortar; <b>queen</b> <b>posts</b> and dragon beams; intact framing assemblages; and the interior woodwork. In 1940, while the house and one outbuilding were still standing, the Historic American Buildings Survey produced detailed photography and comprehensive measured drawings of the property. In 1964, the original pen and ink presentation drawings for Menokin were discovered among some Tayloe family papers in the attic of Mount Airy [...] Four years later, as the house was in serious trouble of collapsing, the interior woodwork was removed by the owner and put into storage. The surprisingly intact woodwork is back at Menokin and can be viewed at the Foundation's King Conservation and Visitors Center [...] Menokin's dining room paneling is on loan to the Virginia Historical Society {{where it is now}} on display. In 1971, Menokin was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior.|$|R
