The study does not reveal excessive deviation because the time is too long or too short. However, using the <b>quarterly</b> <b>data</b> also has potential problems. Thus, we want to test the sensitivity of the results for the <b>quarterly</b> <b>data</b> and consider the potential of parameter estimation measurement error due to seasonal quarterly earnings.|$|R

In contrast to the VECM for <b>quarterly</b> <b>data,</b> the VECM for annual data disprove any possibility of Granger causality between taxes and expenditure.

Exploiting the advantage of using <b>quarterly</b> <b>data,</b> it is possible for the policy effect to be estimated by each quarter within the policy period, which will be further discussed in the following section.

The ILS approach is extended to multi-model estimation and the computational schemes are provided. The empirical evidence suggests that the ILS estimates well characterize how the exchange rate relates to the gold price, both in the long-run and short-run. The comparison between the interval and point method indicates that the difference between the OLS and the ILS estimates is increasing from weekly <b>data</b> to <b>quarterly</b> <b>data,</b> since the lowest frequency point data lost the most information of volatility. ...|$|R

Purely quarterly models are compared with models designed to exploit early releases of monthly indicators for the nowcast and forecast of quarterly GDP growth. Amongst the latter, we consider small bridge equations and forecast equations in which the bridging between monthly and <b>quarterly</b> <b>data</b> is achieved through a regression on factors extracted from large monthly datasets. The forecasting exercise is performed in a simulated real-time context, which takes account of publication lags in the individual series.
