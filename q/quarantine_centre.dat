30|$|During FGDs, forest {{adjacent}} households {{revealed the}} use of different plant species for treatment against some human diseases such as cholera, typhoid, dysentery and amoebiasis. Malaria, stomach ache, skin rushes, cold and cough, {{as well as some}} non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension. Government intervention was also reported which included provision of mosquito nets as a protective measure of malaria. Also during outbreaks of cholera, the government took care of all affected people through establishment of <b>quarantine</b> <b>centres.</b> In the <b>quarantine</b> <b>centres</b> people were provided with all necessary treatment and preventive measures against cholera. Frequent outbreak of pests and diseases (most of them being due to adverse climate conditions) necessitated forest adjacent households to rely much on medicinal plants because most of them were not able to afford modern treatments because of either limited health centres or cash income. Most of the popular remedies were reported to be common to the majority of the forest adjacent households. Dependence on medicinal plants as a primary healthcare by rural people has also been reported elsewhere in Tanzania (Kitula 2007; Otieno et al. 2011; Kayombo et al. 2013; Njana et al. 2013; Nahashon 2013; Augustino et al. 2014). Nkem et al. (2010) urged that dependency on traditional medicine is perpetuated by the fact that artificial medicinal care is limited in rural areas, and where it is available the costs are relatively high.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{outbreak}} of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in different countries, especially the West African nations has been ravaging human {{lives and the}} economy. The ugly situation calls for urgent provision of sound EVD control measures. Methods/ Statistical Analysis: This paper proposes the queueing technique as a promising and efficient mathematical approach {{for the study of}} EVD transmission and control. It highlights the queueing theory governing equation and applies the theory to EVD problem. Findings: The application of the technique to the Guinea 2014 EVD outbreak indicates that the use of two <b>quarantine</b> <b>centres</b> to combat the outbreak would have served as an adequate control measure. This technique can be used to manage the manpower and material resources in the combat against EVD outbreak. Applications/Improvements: This approach brings to fore the possible use of queueing technique in the analysis of EVD outbreak. Transmission and control in other countries ravaged by EVD could be studied using queueing network models...|$|R

It was owned by the government and was used as a cattle <b>quarantine</b> and slaughter <b>centre</b> for more than 90 years. Central planning and development occurred throughout the years and people started to reside at Ma Tau Kok. In 1999, the old Ma Tau Kok Cattle Depot was finally closed down due to expressed concerns by the neighbouring residents about hygiene problems deriving from a slaughterhouse in the urban area. It was replaced by a new slaughterhouse in Sheung Shui.|$|R

50|$|The International Cocoa <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Centre</b> (ICQC), {{located in}} Arborfield, {{a suburb of}} Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom, is an {{organization}} aiming {{to reduce the amount}} of disease affecting cocoa plants. Cocoa plants are quarantined in a 1000 square meter greenhouse before being transported to across the globe. Quarantining cocoa plants is considered important because over 70% of the global cocoa supply originates from West Africa, and therefore the cocoa market is susceptible to any catastrophic effects that should occur in that region.|$|E
50|$|In 1592, a {{quarantine}} hospital {{known as}} Lazzaretto was built after {{an outbreak of}} the plague. The hospital was made of wooden huts, and it was pulled down a year later after the disease had subsided. In 1643, {{during the reign of}} Grandmaster Lascaris, the Order of Saint John exchanged the island with the church for some land in Rabat and built a permanent Lazzaretto in an attempt to control the periodic influx of plague and cholera on board visiting ships. It was initially used as a <b>quarantine</b> <b>centre</b> where passengers from quarantined ships were taken. The hospital was subsequently improved during the reigns of Grandmasters Cotoner, Carafa and de Vilhena.|$|E
50|$|Saint John's Island {{formerly}} {{housed a}} quarantine station for cholera cases detected among {{immigrants in the}} late 19th century, and starting from 1901, victims of beri-beri were also brought to the island. By 1930, the island gained world recognition as a <b>quarantine</b> <b>centre</b> screening Asian immigrants and pilgrims returning from Mecca. The quarantine station was eventually also used to house victims of other diseases, such as leprosy. When mass immigration was closed in mid-20th century, the island was used to house a penal settlement and a drug rehabilitation centre. The 40.5-hectare hilly island was transformed in 1975 into a tranquil getaway with swimming lagoons, beaches, picnic grounds, trekking routes and football fields. The island is also a haven {{for a host of}} flora and fauna, and is popular for weekend visits.

Prior to this case, the WHO had advised that [...] "we still anticipate more flare-ups and must be prepared for them. A massive effort is underway to ensure robust prevention, surveillance and response capacity across all three countries by the end of March." [...] On 16 January, aid workers reported that a woman had died of the virus and that she may have exposed several individuals; the government later announced that 100 people had been quarantined. Investigations indicated that the deceased was a female student from Lunsar, in Port Loko District who had gone to Kambia District on 28 December 2015 before returning symptomatic. She had also visited Bombali District to consult a herbalist, and had later gone to a government hospital in Magburaka. The WHO indicated that there were 109 contacts (28 of them high-risk), that there were another 3 missing contacts, and that the source or route of transmission that caused the fatality was unknown. A second new case - confirmed by WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic to be a 38-year-old relative and caregiver of the aforementioned Ebola victim - had become symptomatic on 20 Jan while under observation at a <b>quarantine</b> <b>centre.</b> On 22 January, it was reported that this patient was responding to treatment. On 26 January, WHO Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan officially confirmed that the outbreak was not yet over; that same day, it was also reported that Ebola restrictions had halted market activity in Kambia District, amid protests. On 7 February 70 individuals were released from quarantine, and on 8 February the last Ebola patient was also released. On 17 February, the WHO indicated that 2,600 Ebola survivors had accessed health assessments and eye examinations.|$|E
50|$|By 1928, the Lytton Quarantine Station {{facilities}} {{had been}} extended and enhanced. Vessels were {{met at the}} river mouth by the Health Authorities who boarded each ship (two launches were kept at Lytton) and inspected all goods and personnel on board. Suspect people and goods were landed at Lytton for fumigation and isolation. Jetty facilities permitted passengers to disembark on foot and a crane was provided for conveying sick passengers, luggage and stores to shore. A tram line ran from the jetty to the reception house. A permanent staff of a foreman assistant, two engine-drivers, a coxswain and four assistants was employed to maintain the facilities and attend to non-human quarantine, which included disinfection of luggage and materials using a steam disinfector (autoclave) with attachments for cyanide or formaldehyde gas. A bathing block permitted 10 cabin passengers and 20 crew, third class or deck passengers to bathe simultaneously. Separate accommodation in tents or troop huts had been established for Asiatics, with separate kitchen, dining-room, shelter shed, lavatory and bath blocks. Lighting was supplied from kerosene lamps. A water carriage sewerage system discharged directly into the river, with a chlorination chamber available for disinfection of sewerage as necessary. The medical officer's and foreman assistant's quarters were connected to the city telephone service and internal telephones served most of the principal buildings. A cemetery was located within the grounds. The Lytton facility functioned as a human quarantine station until the early 1980s, by which time the decision {{had been made to}} phase out human quarantine services. Arrangements were made for Kenmore Repatriation Hospital to provide observation facilities in the event that they were required, and in 1982 the Lytton facility reverted to its earlier role as an animal quarantine station, re-designated the Lytton Quarantine Complex and Animal Detention Centre. Facilities comprised a launch jetty, workshop, inflammable store, guinea pig area, imports treatment laboratory, utility buildings area, offices, stores, and animal quarantine detention facilities. In addition to its role as an animal <b>quarantine</b> <b>centre,</b> Lytton served as a communications centre, a base for south side shipping clearance and inspection, a facility for dealing with quarantine treatment and detention of materials, a training area and a depot for stores. Many of the buildings associated with the human quarantine station at Lytton were removed after the 1982 closure, some relocated to sites in the Lytton and Wynnum districts.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to obtain}} hematological database of healthy Sumatran orangutans (Pongo abelii) at the Sumatran Orangutan <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Centre,</b> in Batu Mbelin, Sibolangit, North Sumatra, Indonesia. This secondary datacomes from hematological examination results in 52 healthy Sumatran orangutans in Batu Mbelin, from May 2003 to August 2010. This research used a factorial complete randomized design (CRD) that has two factors namely, gender {{as the first}} factor and age as the second factor. Data was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results of ANOVA show that gender affects (P< 0. 05) {{on the value of}} mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in Sumatran orangutans. Age influences (P< 0. 05) on the lymphocytes and monocytes Sumatran orangutans.

40|$|There are 2 {{international}} cacao collections, one {{maintained at}} CATIE in Costa Rica {{and the other}} at the Cocoa Research Centre (CRC) in Trinidad and Tobago. The materials in the collections have been included under Article 15 of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) through a formal agreement signed in 2006 for CATIE and 2009 for CRC. The germplasm is distributed with an accompanying Standard Material Transfer Agreement (SMTA) (template from of the ITPGRFA. The SMTA includes an Access and Benefit-Sharing (ABS) agreement for the distribution and receipt of germplasm. In addition to the 2 collections maintained at CATIE and CRC, the International Cocoa <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Centre,</b> Reading (ICQCR), UK ensures the safe movement of cacao germplasm between countries and regions. The materials maintained at the ICQCR mainly come from the 2 international collections but they also can manage materials provided to them by a national programme. The rest of cacao genetic diversity is maintained in national collections and farmers’ fields and in the wild, and is therefore {{outside the scope of}} the ITPGRFA because cacao is not an Annex 1 crop, which by definition is within the scope of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya Protocol and bilateral agreements. The FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (CGRFA), including plants, animal, microbial and forests, is the overarching inter-governmental body discussing all aspects of genetic resources for food and agriculture. The work of Bioversity International over the years in this area can provide guidance.

40|$|Rehabilitation {{centers in}} Indonesia and Malaysia {{accommodate}} displaced orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and P. abelii) and aim to facilitate their release {{into the wild}} by developing in them the skills that are necessary for survival. Regular forest excursions are provided but their efficacy in improving learning of appropriate behaviors is unknown. We observed 40 rehabilitating orangutans from the Orangutan Care and <b>Quarantine</b> <b>Centre</b> during 3 forest excursions each to determine whether their behavior fostered the development of survival skills. In total, 38 % of their time was spent in locomotion, particularly quadrupedal arboreal travel (13 %), walking (8 %), climbing (7 %), and vine−swinging (4 %). 26. 5 % of their time was spent[*]≥[*] 5 m from the ground, at heights up to 25 m. Arboreal activities were more common early in the excursions and interaction with caregivers more common later (h 1 : 0. 3 % of time; h 5 : 0. 9 % of time). Individuals of lower body mass {{were significantly more likely}} to engage in arboreal movement, locomotion in general, eating of bark and leaves, and social play, and less likely to eat insects. Those that had been at the Centre the longest were less likely to perform arboreal activities and significantly more likely to be found standing and at ground level than those that had been there for a shorter time. During this study, many forest food items were consumed, particularly leaves and fruit, but also invertebrates and bark. Little time was spent in sexual behavior, tool use, nest building, or socially mediated learning, but social play occupied almost 6 % of their time. We conclude that regular excursions into the forest are likely to assist in the development of locomotion and feeding skills for survival in rehabilitating orangutans, but special attention is needed to encourage nest building, social activities, and arboreal activity. Heavy individuals and those that have been captive for a long time are least likely to benefit...|$|E
