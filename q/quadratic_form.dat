50|$|The {{theory of}} <b>quadratic</b> <b>forms</b> and methods {{used in their}} study depend in a large measure {{on the nature of}} the coefficients, which may be real or complex numbers, {{rational}} numbers, or integers. In linear algebra, analytic geometry, and in the majority of applications of <b>quadratic</b> <b>forms,</b> the coefficients are real or complex numbers. In the algebraic theory of <b>quadratic</b> <b>forms,</b> the coefficients are elements of a certain field. In the arithmetic theory of <b>quadratic</b> <b>forms,</b> the coefficients belong to a fixed commutative ring, frequently the integers Z or the p-adic integers Zp.
