40|$|In {{the context}} of {{increasing}} water scarcity, understanding is growing that irrigation water rights are important and {{that a lack of}} an effective water rights system constitutes a major reason for inefficient water management. This study carried out a contingent ranking experiment to study how smallholder irrigators in South Africa would value potential changes in water rights. Three specific dimensions of water rights, relevant for the South African case, are considered: duration, <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>title,</b> and transferability. Results indicate that smallholder irrigators are prepared to pay considerably higher water prices if improvements are made in the water rights system. This implies that the proposed interventions in the water rights system would improve the efficiency and productivity of the small-scale irrigation sector. The increased willingness to pay could furthermore also assist the South African government to reach the objective of increased cost recovery. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) to effectively manage fishing impacts on all ecosystem components, as required under Ecosystem Based Fisheries Management (EBFM) principles. A consequence of changing from input controls to output-based (catch) management is that {{the control of the}} regulating authority tends to be reduced, which may affect the outcomes for ecosystem management. This study reviewed the use of input controls across six fishing methods in 18 ITQ fisheries, which have been independently accredited as ecologically sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (12 fisheries) or under Australian environmental legislation for Wildlife Trade Operation (six fisheries). Input controls were retained across a range of ITQ fisheries, with non-selective fisheries such as trawl, gillnet and line employing more input controls than selective fisheries such as purse-seine, pot/trap and dredge. Further case-studies confirmed the widespread and recent use of input controls (spatial and temporal closures) with the aim of managing ecosystem impacts of fishing. The retention of input controls, particularly closures affects the security (<b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>title)</b> characteristic of the fishing use right and the theoretical ability of fishers to manage their right for their future benefit. The security characteristic is weakened by closures through loss of access, which undermines industry trust and incentive for long-term decision making. By reducing the security of ITQs, individual fisher incentives and behaviour may separate from societal objectives for sustainability, {{which was one of the}} foremost reasons for introducing ITQ management.

40|$|Identifying {{translations}} from comparable corpora is {{a well-known}} problem with several applications. Existing methods rely on linguistic tools or high-quality corpora. Absence of such resources, especially in Indian languages, makes this problem hard; for example, state-of-the-art techniques achieve a mean reciprocal rank of 0. 66 for English-Italian, and a mere 0. 187 for Telugu-Kannada. In this work, we {{address the problem of}} comparable corpora-based translation correspondence induction (CC-TCI) when the only resources available are small noisy comparable corpora extracted from Wikipedia. We observe that translations in the source and target languages have many topically related words in common in other ``auxiliary'' languages. To model this, we define the notion of a translingual theme, a set of topically related words from auxiliary language corpora, and present a probabilistic framework for CC-TCI. Extensive experiments on 35 comparable corpora showed dramatic improvements in performance. We extend these ideas to propose a method for measuring cross-lingual semantic relatedness (CLSR) between words. To stimulate further research in this area, we make publicly available two new high-quality human-annotated datasets for CLSR. Experiments on the CLSR datasets show more than 200 % improvement in correlation on the CLSR task.

The method combines a thematic clustering algorithm and the Pool Adja-cent Violators algorithm to induce signifi-cant themes.
