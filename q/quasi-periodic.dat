25|$|In {{the case}} of harmonic, <b>quasi-periodic</b> musical tones, {{wavetable}} synthesis can be as general as time-varying additive synthesis, but requires less computation during synthesis.

25|$|Another way {{ergodicity}} can {{be broken}} is by the existence of nonlinear soliton symmetries. In 1953, Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou conducted computer simulations of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that {{the behavior of the}} system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated <b>quasi-periodic</b> behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the Korteweg–de Vries equation {{led to the development of}} soliton mathematics.|$|E
2500|$|Although the , , and [...] {{points are}} {{nominally}} unstable, there are (unstable) periodic orbits called [...] "halo" [...] orbits around these {{points in a}} three-body system. A full n-body dynamical system such as the Solar System does not contain these periodic orbits, but does contain <b>quasi-periodic</b> (i.e. bounded but not precisely repeating) orbits following Lissajous-curve trajectories. These <b>quasi-periodic</b> Lissajous orbits are what most of Lagrangian-point space missions have used until now. Although they are not perfectly stable, a modest effort of station keeping keeps a spacecraft in a desired Lissajous orbit for a long time. Also, for Sun–Earth- missions, it is preferable for the spacecraft {{to be in a}} large-amplitude (...) Lissajous orbit around [...] than to stay at , because the line between Sun and Earth has increased solar interference on Earth–spacecraft communications. Similarly, a large-amplitude Lissajous orbit around [...] keeps a probe out of Earth's shadow and therefore ensure a better illumination of its solar panels.|$|E
2500|$|Moser and Arnold {{expanded}} {{the ideas of}} Kolmogorov (who was inspired by questions of Poincaré) and gave rise {{to what is now}} known as Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem (or [...] "KAM theory"), which concerns the persistence of some <b>quasi-periodic</b> motions (nearly integrable Hamiltonian systems) when they are perturbed. KAM theory shows that, despite the perturbations, such systems can be stable over an infinite period of time, and specifies what the conditions for this are.|$|E

Its central supermassive black hole is among the largest known, with a mass of 18 billion solar masses, more than six times the value calculated for the previous largest object.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of {{characteristic}} earthquakes was {{the basis}} of the Parkfield prediction: fairly similar earthquakes in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966 suggested a pattern of breaks every 21.9 years, {{with a standard deviation of}} ±3.1 years. Extrapolation from the 1966 event led to a prediction of an earthquake around 1988, or before 1993 at the latest (at the 95% confidence interval). The appeal of such a method is that the prediction is derived entirely from the trend, which supposedly accounts for the unknown and possibly unknowable earthquake physics and fault parameters. [...] However, in the Parkfield case the predicted earthquake did not occur until 2004, a decade late. This seriously undercuts the claim that earthquakes at Parkfield are <b>quasi-periodic,</b> and suggests the individual events differ sufficiently in other respects to question whether they have distinct characteristics in common.|$|E

The <b>quasi-periodic</b> array of nanoholes functioned as a light concentrator.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in 1865 in Walk, Livonia, in {{the family of a}} poor Baltic German merchant. In 1884, after graduating from a German school in Viljandi, he entered the faculty of physics and {{mathematics}} at the University of Tartu. In 1893 Bohl was awarded his Master's degree. This was for an investigation of <b>quasi-periodic</b> functions. The notion of <b>quasi-periodic</b> functions was generalised still further by Harald Bohr when he introduced almost-periodic functions. He has been the first to prove the three-dimensional case of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem, but his work was not noticed at the time.|$|E

50|$|The limb is {{organized}} into three regions: stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod (in order from proximal to distal). The two distal {{regions of the}} skeleton contain a number of periodic and <b>quasi-periodic</b> pattern motifs. The zeugopod consists of two parallel elements along the anteroposterior (AP) axis and the autopod contains 3-5 (in most cases) elements along the same axis. The digits also have a <b>quasi-periodic</b> arrangement along the proximodistal (PD) axis, consisting of tandem chains of skeletal elements. The generation of the basic limb plan during development results from the patterning of the mesenchyme by an interplay of factors that promote precartilage condensation and factors that inhibit it.|$|E

50|$|In X-ray astronomy, <b>quasi-periodic</b> {{oscillation}} (QPO) is {{the manner}} in which the X-ray light from an astronomical object flickers about certain frequencies.

50|$|Circuits which exhibit chaotic {{behavior}} can be considered <b>quasi-periodic</b> or nonperiodic oscillators, and like all oscillators require a negative resistance in the circuit to provide power. Chua's circuit, a simple nonlinear circuit widely used as the standard example of a chaotic system, requires a nonlinear active resistor component, sometimes called Chua's diode. This is usually synthesized using a negative impedance converter circuit.|$|E
50|$|One {{sees that}} while long term {{irregular}} {{behavior in the}} temporal variations of the pulsation amplitudes is possible when amplitude equations apply, {{this is not the}} general situation.
