The proposed VCO technique accomplishes wide tuning by utilizing a <b>quantum</b> <b>dot</b> transistor as a tunable capacitor. The capacitance of the <b>quantum</b> <b>dot</b> transistor is changed by controlling the <b>quantum</b> <b>dot</b> charges that lead to vary the threshold voltage. The results show that a wide oscillation frequency range is achieved. The oscillation frequency is tuned from 19. 13 GHz to 27. 18 GHz, tuning of 42 %, as the <b>quantum</b> <b>dot</b> transistor threshold voltage shift varies by 0. 7 V.
