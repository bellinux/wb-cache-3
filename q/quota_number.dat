40|$|Statistics Sweden is an {{administrative}} agency that delimits built-up areas and produces statistics regarding them. The statistics {{provide information about}} {{the area of the}} built-up areas, their population number, number of gainfully employees working in the built-up areas, and of buildings. Now Statistics Sweden wishes to extend such statistics by producing a measure regarding how well developed the service is in each built-up area. This study is a contribution to this statistical improvement work and the purpose is to – by employing geographical information systems and cluster analysis – classify the Swedish built-up areas according to 1) service width and 2) service degree. A particular built-up area has a high service width if it has many different service functions, such as pharmacies, schools and grocery stores. It has a high service degree if it has many service functions per 1000 inhabitants. The result consists of two different “urban hierarchies”, one in which one can identify the level of service width of each built-up area and one in which one can position each built-up area according to its service degree. This study shows that built-up areas with a high service width also have manyinhabitants. In contrast, {{this is not the case}} for built-up areas with a high service degree: built-up areas with high service degree have relatively few inhabitants. The study shows that built-up areas with high service degree have a higher <b>quota</b> <b>number</b> of people employed in the locality / number of residents, which indicates that these built-up areas are “commuting localities” – built-up areas where people work but not necessarily live. The results from the two separate modes of classification also show that the service width and service degree do not display a positive correlation. Built-up areas with high service degree are thus not the same built-up areas that those scoring high onservice width; if anything, the relationship is rather the opposite...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} contains documents {{relating to the}} Naumann family, primarily Nathan and Thekla (née Gutmann). Personal documents include 19 th-century family documents, such as birth and wedding certificates, {{as well as other}} official documents from the early 1900 s and materials from Nathan's service in the German Army during World War One. The collection also contains materials concerning the emigration of Nathan, Thekla, Gertrud, and Jeanette Naumann to the United States via Cuba, as well as a few materials about the new life that the Naumanns built in New York. Photographs and photo albums, many depicting World War One and life in Unsleben, are also included. This collection also documents the wholesale grain company Gebrueder Gaertner in Unsleben, Bavaria, which was jointly operated by Nathan Naumann and his brother Ludwig until shortly before their flight from Germany in 1938. Included are a wide range of business documents, such as basic postcard correspondence about prices and stock with suppliers, banks, and clients; bills and account books; and insurance and legal documents. It also includes extensive records of quasi-judicial litigation with customers, mainly farmers, regarding debt relief (Entschuldungsverfahren). Nathan Naumann (1899 - 1986) was born to Isak Naumann (1864 - 1930) and Jeanette (née Gutmann) Naumann (1868 - 1959) in Unsleben, Bavaria, in the Lower Franconia region of Germany. He had four siblings: Fanni (1892 - 1971, married Theo Mittel), Max (1893 - 1938, married Rose Mittel), Otto (1901 - 1974), and Ludwig (1895 - 1973, married Hilde Mittel). Between 1937 and 1939, the Naumann siblings and Jeanette all managed to emigrate, Otto to Johannesburg, South Africa, and the rest to the United States. From 1917 to 1918, Nathan served in the German army along with two of his brothers. Upon his return, he and Ludwig joined their father Isak in the family business, the grain wholesaler Gebrueder Gaertner. The business came to the Naumann family via the mother of Isak Naumann's wife, Babette Gutmann (née Gaertner). After Isak's death in 1930, Nathan and Ludwig took over the firm. As conditions for Jews in Germany deteriorated, business became more difficult, and in late 1937 the brothers decided to liquidate the company. In 1931, Nathan married Thekla Gutmann (1902 - 1995) of Windsbach, Bavaria. Their daughter Gertrud ("Trudy") Naumann Dreyer was born in 1932. In November 1938, after Nathan was briefly detained during Kristallnacht, the family left Germany. They arrived in New York in October 1939, after a nearly a year spent in Havana, Cuba, awaiting their <b>quota</b> <b>number.</b> While in Cuba, Nathan facilitated his mother's journey to Cuba, and also attempted to help other Jews escape Germany by providing advice about Cuban visas. In the United States, Nathan worked in a variety of jobs, such as a dishwasher at the World's Fair and as a Fuller Brush man, before settling into a position at the real estate firm Singer & Bassuck.
