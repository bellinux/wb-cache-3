5|$|There are two {{versions}} of the PowerBook100's <b>QWERTY</b> layout keyboard: a domestic US version with 63keys and an international ISO version with 64keys. The caps lock key on the PowerBook100 did not have a locking position or a lighted indicator of its status, and to compensate, the System7 operating system software includes an extension file that causes an icon of the international caps lock symbol (⇪) to appear in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar when Caps Lock is active.|$|E
5|$|Of the 71 {{words in}} this list, 67 are nouns, and most would {{generally}} be considered loanwords; the only modern-English words that contain Q not followed by U {{and are not}} borrowed from another language are qiana, <b>qwerty,</b> and tranq. However, all of the loanwords on this list {{are considered to be}} naturalised in English according to at least one major dictionary (see References), often because they refer to concepts or societal roles that do not have an accurate equivalent in English. For words to appear here, they must appear in their own entry in a dictionary; words which occur only as part of a longer phrase are not included.|$|E
25|$|Some {{keyboard}} layouts for non-Latin alphabetic scripts, {{most notably}} the Greek layout, {{are based on the}} <b>QWERTY</b> layout, in that glyphs are assigned as far as possible to keys that bear similar-sounding or appearing glyphs in <b>QWERTY.</b> This saves learning time for those familiar with <b>QWERTY.</b>|$|E
25|$|Significantly reduced: Captioners use <b>QWERTY</b> {{input to}} type summary {{captions}} yielding {{the essence of}} what the commentators are saying, delayed due to the limitations of <b>QWERTY</b> input.|$|E
25|$|It builds {{upon the}} <b>QWERTY</b> layout as a base, {{changing}} {{the positions of}} 17 keys while retaining the <b>QWERTY</b> positions of most non-alphabetic characters and many popular keyboard shortcuts, supposedly {{making it easier to}} learn than Dvorak for people who already type in <b>QWERTY</b> without sacrificing efficiency. It shares several design goals with the Dvorak layout, such as minimizing finger path distance and making heavy use of the home row.|$|E

25|$|<b>QWERTY</b> is {{the most}} used modern-day {{keyboard}} layout on English-language computer and typewriter keyboards. It {{takes its name from}} the first six characters seen in the far left of the keyboard's top row of letters. The <b>QWERTY</b> design was invented and patented by Christopher Sholes in 1874.|$|E
25|$|The QZERTY layout {{was used}} mostly, if not exclusively, in Italy, {{where it was}} the {{traditional}} typewriter layout. In recent years, however, a modified <b>QWERTY</b> layout with stressed keys such as à, è, ò, has gained widespread usage throughout Italy. Computer keyboards usually have <b>QWERTY,</b> although non-alphanumeric characters vary.|$|E
25|$|The {{keyboard}} layout used for Hawaiian is <b>QWERTY.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many non-Latin alphabets have {{keyboard}} layouts {{that have}} nothing to do with <b>QWERTY.</b> The Russian layout, for instance, puts the common trigrams ыва, про, and ить on adjacent keys so that they can be typed by rolling the fingers. The Greek layout, on the other hand, is a variant of <b>QWERTY.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>QWERTY</b> layout is not {{the most}} {{efficient}} layout possible for the English language, since it requires a touch-typist to move his or her fingers between rows to type the most common letters. Although the <b>QWERTY</b> keyboard was the most commonly used layout in typewriters, a better, less strenuous keyboard was being searched for throughout the late 1900s.|$|E
25|$|Common {{sequences}} from {{a keyboard}} row: <b>qwerty,</b> 12345, asdfgh, fred, etc.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} radically {{different}} layouts such as Dvorak {{have been proposed}} to reduce the perceived inefficiencies of <b>QWERTY,</b> but none {{have been able to}} displace the <b>QWERTY</b> layout; their proponents claim considerable advantages, but so far none has been widely used. The Blickensderfer typewriter with its DHIATENSOR layout may have possibly been the first attempt at optimizing the keyboard layout for efficiency advantages.|$|E
25|$|As the letter-keys were {{attached}} to levers that needed to move freely, inventor Christopher Sholes developed the <b>QWERTY</b> layout to {{reduce the likelihood of}} jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, <b>QWERTY</b> layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard are not in widespread use.|$|E
25|$|Standard <b>QWERTY</b> {{keyboards}} {{are used}} for writing in Latvian; diacritics are entered by using a dead key (usually ', occasionally ~). Some keyboard layouts use a modifier key AltGr (most notable of such is the Windows 2000 and XP built-in layout (Latvian <b>QWERTY)).</b> In the early 1990s, the Latvian ergonomic keyboard layout was developed. Although this layout may be available with language support software, it has not become popular {{because of a lack}} of keyboards with such a configuration.|$|E
25|$|Mac OS-X {{introduced}} Tibetan Unicode {{support with}} OS-X version 10.5 and later, now {{with three different}} keyboard layouts available: Tibetan-Wylie, Tibetan <b>QWERTY</b> and Tibetan-Otani.|$|E
25|$|The Iomega TV with Boxee also {{ships with}} a similar small two-sided RF remote control with 4-way D-pad {{navigation}} and full a <b>QWERTY</b> keypad as standard.|$|E
25|$|Other layouts lay {{importance}} on minimal key deviation from <b>QWERTY</b> {{to give a}} reasonable increase in typing speed and ergonomics with minimal relearning of keys.|$|E
25|$|Several non-BlackBerry {{mobile phones}} have been {{released}} featuring the BlackBerry email client which connects to BlackBerry servers. Many of these phones have full <b>QWERTY</b> keyboards.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{news stories}} are of short duration, {{so even if}} they are made {{available}} only just prior to broadcast, there is still time to <b>QWERTY</b> in text.|$|E
25|$|Standard <b>QWERTY</b> {{keyboards}} {{are used}} for writing in Latvian; diacritics are entered by using a dead key (usually ', occasionally ~). Some keyboard layouts use the modifier key AltGr (most notably the Windows 2000 and XP built-in layout (Latvian <b>QWERTY),</b> it is also default modifier in X11R6, thus a default in most Linux distributions). In the early 1990s, the Latvian ergonomic keyboard layout was developed. Although this layout may be available with language support software, it has not become popular {{because of a lack}} of keyboards with this layout.|$|E
25|$|Within a community, {{keyboard}} layout is generally quite stable, {{due to the}} high training cost of touch-typing, and the resulting network effect of having a standard layout and high switching cost of retraining, and the suboptimal <b>QWERTY</b> layout is {{a case study in}} switching costs. Nevertheless, significant market forces can result in changes (as in Turkish adoption of <b>QWERTY),</b> and non-core keys are more prone to change, as they are less frequently used and less subject to the lock-in of touch-typing. The main, alphanumeric portion is typically stable, while symbol keys and shifted key values change somewhat, modifier keys more so, and function keys most of all: <b>QWERTY</b> dates to the No. 1 (1874) (though 1 and 0 were added later), shifted keys date in some cases to the No. 2 (1878), in other cases to the Selectric (1961), and modifier key placement largely dates to the Model M (1985); function key placement typically dates to the Model M, but varies significantly, particularly on laptops.|$|E

25|$|In {{countries}} {{using the}} Latin script, the center, alphanumeric {{portion of the}} modern keyboard is most often based on the <b>QWERTY</b> design by Christopher Sholes, who laid out the keys {{in such a way}} that common two-letter combinations were placed on opposite sides of the keyboard so that his mechanical keyboard would not jam, and laid out the keys in rows offset horizontally from each other by three-eighths, three-sixteenths, and three-eighths inches to provide room for the levers. Although it has been demonstrated that the <b>QWERTY</b> layout is not the most efficient layout for typing, it remains the standard.|$|E
25|$|The Burmese script can {{be entered}} from a {{standard}} <b>QWERTY</b> keyboard, and is supported within the Unicode standard, meaning {{it can be}} read and written from most modern computers and smartphones.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2013, BlackBerry {{announced}} {{the release of}} the Z10 and Q10 smartphones. Both models consist of touch screens: the Z10 features an all-touch design and the Q10 combines a <b>QWERTY</b> keyboard with touchscreen features.|$|E
25|$|Sebeolsik 390 (세벌식 390; 3-set 390) was {{released}} in 1990. It is based on Dr. Kong Byung Woo's earlier work. This layout is notable for its compatibility with the <b>QWERTY</b> layout; almost all <b>QWERTY</b> symbols that are not alphanumeric are available in Hangul mode. Numbers are placed in three rows. Syllable-initial consonants {{are on the right}} (shown green in the picture), and syllable-final consonants and consonant clusters are on the left (shown red). Some consonant clusters are not printed on the keyboard; the user has to press multiple consonant keys to input some consonant clusters, unlike Sebeolsik Final. It is more ergonomic than the dubeolsik, but is not in wide use.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} {{keyboard}} layouts {{that do not}} resemble <b>QWERTY</b> very closely, if at all. These are designed to reduce finger movement and are claimed by some proponents to offer higher typing speed along with ergonomic benefits.|$|E
25|$|One popular but unverified {{explanation}} for the <b>QWERTY</b> arrangement {{is that it was}} designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.|$|E
25|$|The QWERTZ layout {{is widely}} used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main {{difference}} between it and <b>QWERTY</b> is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters.|$|E
25|$|Current affairs {{programs}} usually require stenographic assistance. Even {{though the}} segments which comprise a current affairs program may {{be produced in}} advance, they are usually done so just before on-air time and their duration makes <b>QWERTY</b> input of text unfeasible.|$|E
25|$|The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (DSK) layout, {{also known}} as the American Simplified Keyboard (ASK) layout, is the best-known {{alternative}} to <b>QWERTY.</b> It was named after its inventor, August Dvorak. There are also numerous adaptations for languages other than English, and single-handed variants. Dvorak's original layout had the numerals rearranged, but the present-day layout has them in numerical order. The Dvorak Simplified Keyboard has numerous properties designed to increase typing speed, decrease errors, and increase comfort. Research has found a modest 4% average advantage to the end user in typing speed. The most prominent property involves concentrating the most used English letters in the home row where the fingers rest, thus having 70% of typing done in the home row (compared to 32% in <b>QWERTY).</b>|$|E
25|$|The Typing of the Dead was {{originally}} released for arcades in Japan in 1999 {{with a special}} cabinet equipped with dual <b>QWERTY</b> keyboards. The game {{was one of the}} first developments by Smilebit, a team of Sega developers that had recently spun off as a new company.|$|E
25|$|Not {{surprisingly}} network economics {{became a}} hot topic after the diffusion of the Internet across academia. Most people know only of Metcalfe's law as part of network effects. Network effects are notorious for causing lock-in with the most-cited examples being Microsoft products and the <b>QWERTY</b> keyboard.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{dedicated}} Macedonian keyboard {{that is based on}} <b>QWERTY</b> (LjNjERTDz) and uses Alt Gr to type the dje and tshe. However, the capital forms are next to the small forms. An alternative version of the layout is quite different and has no dje or tshe access. This alternative was not supported until Windows Vista.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} Eastern and Western Armenian keyboards {{are based}} on the layout of the font Arasan. These keyboard layouts are mostly phonetic, and allow direct access to every character in the alphabet. Because there are more characters in the Armenian alphabet (39) than in Latin (26), some Armenian characters appear on non-alphabetic keys on a conventional <b>QWERTY</b> keyboard (for example, շ maps to ,).|$|E
