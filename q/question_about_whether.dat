25|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, in its {{documentary}} series Inside Story, in 1978 produced a programme on the Tamam Shud case, entitled The Somerton Beach Mystery, where reporter Stuart Littlemore investigated the case, including interviewing Boxall, who could add no new {{information on the}} case, and Paul Lawson, who made the plaster cast of the body, and who refused to answer a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> anyone had positively identified the body.|$|E

25|$|Boorda was {{survived by}} his wife, Bettie Moran Boorda, four {{children}} and eleven grandchildren. Boorda was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on May 19, 1996 with a tombstone marked with the Star of David, though there was some <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> he considered himself Jewish, or had converted to another religion. On May 21, a public memorial service {{was held at the}} Washington National Cathedral that was broadcast nationally by CNN with tape delay broadcast on the C-SPAN network.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate is}} famous {{due to the}} fact that Newt Gingrich spent three minutes yelling at the {{moderator}} at the beginning of the debate after Gingrich was asked a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> he had been asked to enter into an open marriage. Gingrich felt that the question was an extremely unfair way to begin a presidential debate and was an attempt to protect President Barack Obama. The incident resulted in a great amount of applause for Gingrich, and was widely broadcast on YouTube. It was also credited with raising Gingrich's support in South Carolina, leading to his win in that state's primary two days later.|$|E
25|$|The 2001 season saw the {{emergence}} of JUCO transfer Seneca Wallace and star wide receiver Lane Danielson. The dynamic duo led the Cyclones to a last second win over Iowa, a 7–5 overall record, and {{an invitation to the}} Independence Bowl against Alabama, their second consecutive bowl game. The Cyclones just missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 0:46 remaining in the fourth, which would have given State the lead and potential victory. Subsequent to the game there was some <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> or not the field goal was actually good, as it sailed directly over one of the uprights. The Cyclones lost 13–14.|$|E

25|$|Kristina Hjartåker was {{a female}} four-year-old fatally wounded in the Hatlestad slide, and died on February 7, 2006, when her {{treatment}} was ended. The <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> to continue her treatment became a cause célèbre, and caused the Liberal Party of Norway to announce their desire for a 'Kristina Law' that, if passed, will require an independent group to consider discontinuing life-prolonging treatment in cases where a dispute exists. The controversy surrounding {{the handling of the}} case, in particular an incident in which doctors from the hospital visited the girl's father at home without invitation to convince him to end her treatment, would cause the leader of the Bergen Health Trust, to retire.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these findings, some detractors {{have pointed out that}} the Davis–Bacon Act requirements were rendered moot by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). At the time that Davis–Bacon Act was passed, legal scholars were divided on the <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the federal government could regulate labor costs and conditions. The Davis–Bacon Act was seen as a legitimate way to control labor wages and conditions on federal projects since there was clear jurisdiction on those. However, as the Depression rolled on, especially after the West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish ruling in 1937, the Roosevelt Administration succeeded in establishing a federal authority to dictate wages, including a federal, universal minimum wage. In the view of some reviewers, this superseded the need for a prevailing wage law specific to federal contracts.|$|E
25|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} emission is {{a problem}} facing the delicate balance within the ecosystems that contain the Bay checkerspot in many areas. At Coyote Ridge the problem is well documented by conservation biologist Stuart Weiss. Faced with a declining population of Bay checkerspots at Coyote Ridge, Weiss searched for a cause. He found a link {{to a combination of}} pollution from the freeway below the ridge and, again, a cutback in cattle grazing locally. Weiss documented how nitrogen oxide emissions from cars enriched the nutrient-poor serpentine soil. This {{is a prime example of}} the nitrogen effect explained above. Aside from helping decrease nitrogen, the cattle also help to control invasive grasses by eating them. Any <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> nitrogen emissions from cars traversing U.S. Route 101, 110,000 vehicles daily, is significant evaporates when faced with monitoring statistics from Weiss. His monitoring equipment has confirmed that 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre is deposited on Coyote Ridge annually. Some of the particles stick to the plant and ground and are washed into the soil, and others are directly absorbed by the plants themselves. By contrast, pollution from power plants and vehicles drops only about four to five pounds of nitrogen per acre per year on the Jasper Ridge preserve.|$|E

500|$|Ridgway had {{prepared}} an offensive known as Operation Rugged, and pressed MacArthur {{for permission to}} launch it.

MacArthur thereupon gave Ridgway permission to launch his attack, setting an objective line north of the 38th Parallel that would secure Seoul's water supply. He did so without consulting with Washington until after the attack began on 5 April 1951. It was making steady progress when MacArthur was relieved on 11 April.|$|E

[...] He had had surgery to repair cartilage damage in high school, but that did not alleviate his problems. [...] When Jordan responded yes to a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> he had had any surgeries in the prior 12 months, it triggered a line of questioning about his senior season meniscus surgery. He did not make the 2008 Wolverines due to a knee problem, but was advised to try out again after his knee healed. [...] After discovering a torn meniscus, he had a second knee surgery, which was successful. He attended every game that season in his family's season ticket section.|$|E

500|$|Rumors of Stroud's {{homosexuality}} {{were noted}} at Alcatraz. According to Donald Hurley, {{whose father was}} a guard at Alcatraz, [...] "Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies." [...] In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in 'dog block' (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital {{because he was a}} 'wolf' (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper." [...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on {{one of the problems that}} prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual." [...] Lancaster quoted Stroud as saying, [...] "Let's face it, I am 73 years old. Does that answer your <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> I would be a dangerous homosexual?" ...|$|E
500|$|When the Thirteenth Amendment was {{submitted}} to the states on February 1, 1865, it was quickly taken up by [...] several legislatures. By {{the end of the}} month it had been ratified by eighteen states. Among them were the ex-Confederate states of Virginia and Louisiana, where ratifications were submitted by Reconstruction governments. These, along with subsequent ratifications from Arkansas and Tennessee raised the issues of how many seceded states had legally valid legislatures; and if there were fewer legislatures than states, if Article V required ratification by three-fourths of the states or three-fourths of the legally valid state legislatures. President Lincoln in his last speech, on April 11, 1865, called the <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the Southern states were in or out of the Union a [...] "pernicious abstraction." [...] Obviously, he declared, they were not [...] "in their proper practical relation with the Union"; whence everyone's object should be to restore that relation.

500|$|Long an {{advocate}} for gender equality in climbing, Hill has argued {{that men and women}} can climb the same routes: [...] "I think they should have women compete on the same climbs as the men, and if the women can't do the climbs, then they shouldn't be competing". For example, she argued that both sexes compete on the same routes in World Cup competitions. However, Hill later revised her view, noting that while she could and did compete with men [...] "spectators want to see people get to the top. And since most women aren't climbing at the same level as the top men, it's necessary to design a route that's a little easier for women". In answer to a <b>question</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> or not women [...] "will ever equal or surpass men in climbing", Hill gave a detailed response, focused on body composition, size, and psychology, explaining that climbing [...] "favors people with high strength-to-weight ratios", less body fat, and greater height, articulating that such characteristics often favor men but that women [...] "have the advantage of being relatively light, with the capacity for tremendous endurance". She explained that [...] "theoretically somebody as short as me could be {{the best in the world}} because it doesn't depend so much on height now... And it's a psychological thing more than a physical thing." ...|$|E
