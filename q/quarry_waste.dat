Granite <b>quarries</b> <b>waste</b> consisted of about 52 wt. % of the batch constituents depending on composition. The granite <b>quarries</b> <b>waste</b> composition was sometimes modified by adding other ingredients such as dolomite, limestone and Al 2 O 3. Batches were melted and then casted into glass, which was then subjected to heat-treatment to induce crystallisation. The resulting glass-ceramic materials (heat-treated at 1000 °C for 3 h) were mainly composed of diopside, anorthite, wollastonite and mullite. With increasing temperature (to 1050 °C for 3 h), diopside and anorthite transformed into akermanite and mullite. It {{has been found that}} increasing the content of the diopside-anorthite eutectic in the batch constituents, resulted in increased bulk crystallisation. Samples were characterised with different techniques including differential thermal analysis, polarizing microscope, X-ray diffraction and indentation microhardness testing.

In this paper, rock fragments 2 – 3  cm in size were mixed with landfill stabilized waste (LSW) in different proportions (LSW : gravel, R L), which was called LGM. The water content, runoff and plant growth under natural precipitation were monitored for 2  years using a runoff plot experiment. LGM with a low fraction of LSW was compacted to different degrees to achieve an appropriate porosity; water dynamics and plant growth of compacted LGM were studied in a field experiment. The results showed the following: (1)  LGM can be used during restoration in abandoned quarries as growing material for plants. (2)   R L had a significant effect on the infiltration and water-holding capacity of LGM and thus influenced the retention of precipitation, water condition and plant growth. LGM with R L ranging from 8 : 1 to 3 : 7 was suitable for plant growth, and the target species grew best when R L was 5 : 5. (3)  Compaction significantly enhanced water content of LGM with a low R L of 2 : 8, but leaf water content of plants was lower or unchanged in the more compacted plots. Moderate compaction was beneficial to the survival and growth of Robinia pseudoacacia L. Platycladus orientalis (L.)

50|$|Cellular Confinement Systems (CCS) {{have been}} used to improve the {{performance}} of both paved and unpaved roads by reinforcing the soil in the subgrade-base interface or within the base course. The effective load distribution of CCS creates a strong, stiff cellular mattress. This 3D mattress reduces vertical differential settlement into soft subgrades, improves shear strength, and enhances load-bearing capacity, while reducing the amount of aggregate material required to extend the service life of roads. As a composite system, cellular confinement strengthens the aggregate infill, thereby simultaneously enabling the use of poorly graded inferior material (e.g. local native soils, <b>quarry</b> <b>waste</b> or recycled materials) for infill as well as reducing the structural support layer thickness.Typical load support applications include reinforcement of base and subbase layers in flexible pavements, including: asphalt pavements; unpaved access, service and haul roads; military roads, railway substructure and ballast confinement; working platforms in intermodal ports; airport runways and aprons, permeable pavements; pipeline road support; green parking facilities and emergency access areas.|$|E
