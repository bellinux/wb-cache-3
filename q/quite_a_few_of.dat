25|$|The {{members of}} the MADS-box family of {{transcription}} factors play a very important and evolutionarily conserved role in flower development. According to the ABC model of flower development, three zones - A,B and C - are generated within the developing flower primordium, {{by the action of}} some transcription factors, that are {{members of the}} MADS-box family. Among these, the functions of the B and C domain genes have been evolutionarily more conserved than the A domain gene.

25|$|Beginning around 900 BC the Lusatian people {{gradually}} fortified their settlements, {{first in}} the Silesia region. By 650–600 BC there were <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them there {{and all over the}} western zone. Often built in locations naturally easy to defend, they were surrounded by walls made of earth, stone and wood, and moats, and could cover anywhere from 0.5 to 20 hectares. Smaller strongholds were built at strategic locations such as mountain passes and trade routes, where the residents could control and police the area. The strongholds also functioned as industrial centers; a good example of a trade-manufacturing fortified settlement is the one in Komorów, located near the Gorszewice cemetery. Some of the large fortified areas didn't have many structures inside and served probably as temporary sanctuaries for the local population at times of danger.|$|E

25|$|In Berlin, Smetona and Yčas {{signed a}} loan {{agreement}} with Germany for 100 million marks. The money was used primarily {{to build and}} supply the army.

Article 12 of the Compiègne Armistice required the Germans to protect Lithuania from possible Soviet attacks, but Germany was also interested in maintaining its influence in the region and weakening Russia. At first they tried to organize volunteers from the retreating soldiers of the 10th German Army, commanded by General Erich von Falkenhayn. However, the soldiers were tired and demoralized and wanted to return home as soon as possible. Recruitment continued in Germany, especially in Saxony. The volunteers were paid 30 marks per month plus 5 marks per day and had to sign up for three months. The first Saxon Volunteers, as they became known, arrived to Kaunas at the beginning of January, but <b>quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them were judged unfit for duty and sent back. By the end of January, German volunteers numbered 4,000. They were not very reliable as the German Revolution increased popularity of the Spartacist League and Soviet causes.

500|$|Today, {{there is}} no longer a single, {{cohesive}} Fourth International. Throughout the better part of its existence, the Fourth International was hounded by agents of the Soviet secret police, repressed by capitalist countries such as France and the United States and rejected by followers of the Soviet Union and later Maoism as illegitimate—a position these communists still hold today. It struggled to maintain contact under these conditions of simultaneous illegality and scorn around much of the world during World War II, because when workers' uprisings did occur, they were usually under the influence of Soviet-inspired, anarchist, social democratic, Maoist, or militant nationalist groups, leading to further defeats for the FI and its Trotskyists, who never gathered similar support. Even after the Soviet repudiation of Stalin and de-stalinization, Trotskyism continued to be regarded as politically discredited and there was very little renewed support for Trotskyist ideas, particularly from those already committed to another form of communism. Ideologically, Maoists, left communists, and anarchists all consider Trotskyism, and thus also the Fourth International, to be ideologically bankrupt and impotent. Despite this, many parts of Latin America and Europe continue to have large Trotskyist groupings, with followings both young and old, who are attracted to its [...] "anti-Stalinist" [...] positions and its rhetoric of workers' internationalism. <b>Quite</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> these groups carry the label [...] "Fourth Internationalist" [...] either in their organisation's name, major political position documents, or both.|$|E
