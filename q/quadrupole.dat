5|$|The dipole {{component}} of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14microteslas (0.14G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2T·m3 (14μT·R'N3, where R'N is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong <b>quadrupole</b> moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small <b>quadrupole</b> moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large <b>quadrupole</b> moment of Neptune {{may be the result}} of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.|$|E
5|$|Lipid bilayers are {{complicated}} molecular systems with many degrees of freedom. Thus atomistic simulation of membrane {{and in particular}} ab initio calculations of its properties is difficult and computationally expensive. Quantum chemical calculations has recently been successfully performed to estimate dipole and <b>quadrupole</b> moments of lipid membranes.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is non-linear: {{the gravitational}} influence of two masses {{is not simply}} the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had {{been the case in}} Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the back-reaction from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard <b>quadrupole</b> formula for the energy flux for systems like the binary pulsar had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Ramsey {{returned}} to Columbia as a professor and research scientist. Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, William Nierenberg, measured various nuclear magnetic dipole and electric <b>quadrupole</b> moments.With Rabi, he helped establish the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His time there was brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at Harvard University, where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at Middlebury College, Oxford University, Mt. Holyoke College and the University of Virginia. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser to NATO, and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both have nuclear spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear <b>quadrupole</b> moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Jupiter's {{magnetic}} field, like Earth's, {{is generated}} by an internal dynamo supported by the circulation of a conducting fluid in its outer core. But whereas Earth's core is made of molten iron and nickel, Jupiter's is composed of metallic hydrogen. As with Earth's, Jupiter's magnetic field is mostly a dipole, with north and south magnetic poles {{at the ends of}} a single magnetic axis. However, on Jupiter the north pole of the dipole is located in the planet's northern hemisphere and the south pole of the dipole lies in its southern hemisphere, opposite to the Earth, whose north pole lies in the southern hemisphere and south pole lies in the northern hemisphere. Jupiter's field also has <b>quadrupole,</b> octupole and higher components, though they are less than one tenth as strong as the dipole component.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of magnets, both warm and superconducting, {{will be used in}} the LHC. In {{addition}} to main dipoles, <b>quadrupoles</b> are used to focus the beam in regular arcs. Special dipoles separate or merge the two beams in insertion regions. A few very strong superconducting <b>quadrupoles</b> squeeze the beam to achieve the required luminosity, while warm <b>quadrupoles</b> are used in the collimation insertions. At injection the main dipoles largely dominate beam dynamics, but contributions from smaller classes of magnets should not be neglected. Peculiar optical configurations may dramatically enhance beam dynamics effects of a few magnetic elements. This paper will focus on the effect of insertion <b>quadrupoles,</b> e. g. wide-aperture, and warm <b>quadrupoles,</b> as well as separation dipoles on the dynamic aperture of the LHC machine...|$|R
25|$|A linear <b>quadrupole</b> {{ion trap}} {{is similar to}} a <b>quadrupole</b> ion trap, but it traps ions in a two {{dimensional}} <b>quadrupole</b> field, instead of a three-dimensional <b>quadrupole</b> field as in a 3D <b>quadrupole</b> ion trap.

25|$|<b>Quadrupole</b> mass analyzers use {{oscillating}} electrical {{fields to}} selectively stabilize or destabilize {{the paths of}} ions passing through a radio frequency (RF) <b>quadrupole</b> field created between 4 parallel rods. Only the ions in a certain range of mass/charge ratio are passed through the system at any time, but changes to the potentials on the rods allow {{a wide range of}} m/z values to be swept rapidly, either continuously or in a succession of discrete hops. A <b>quadrupole</b> mass analyzer acts as a mass-selective filter and is closely related to the <b>quadrupole</b> ion trap, particularly the linear <b>quadrupole</b> ion trap except that it is designed to pass the untrapped ions rather than collect the trapped ones, and is for that reason referred to as a transmission <b>quadrupole.</b>|$|E
25|$|Comparing the <b>quadrupole</b> {{moment of}} {{different}} arenes {{is a useful}} qualitative tool to predict trends in cation-π binding, since it roughly correlates with interaction strength. Arenes with larger <b>quadrupole</b> moments are generally better at binding cations.|$|E

25|$|When {{a second}} phase of mass {{fragmentation}} is added, for example using a second <b>quadrupole</b> in a <b>quadrupole</b> instrument, it is called tandem MS (MS/MS).

25|$|The <b>quadrupole</b> {{ion trap}} {{works on the}} same {{physical}} principles as the <b>quadrupole</b> mass analyzer, but the ions are trapped and sequentially ejected. Ions are trapped in a mainly <b>quadrupole</b> RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to DC or auxiliary AC potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, {{in which case the}} ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.|$|E

25|$|Benzene, {{the model}} π system, has no {{permanent}} dipole moment, as {{the contributions of}} the weakly polar carbon–hydrogen bonds cancel due to molecular symmetry. However, the electron-rich π system above and below the benzene ring hosts a partial negative charge. A counterbalancing positive charge is associated with the plane of the benzene atoms, resulting in an electric <b>quadrupole</b> (a pair of dipoles, aligned like a parallelogram so there is no net molecular dipole moment). The negatively charged region of the <b>quadrupole</b> can then interact favorably with positively charged species; a particularly strong effect is observed with cations of high charge density.|$|E
