40|$|BACKGROUND: High intercoder {{reliability}} (ICR) {{is required}} in <b>qualitative</b> <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> for assuring quality when more than one coder is involved in data analysis. The literature is short of standardized procedures for ICR procedures in <b>qualitative</b> <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> OBJECTIVE: To illustrate how ICR assessment {{can be used to}} improve codings in <b>qualitative</b> <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> METHODS: Key steps of the procedure are presented, drawing on data from a qualitative study on patients' perspectives on low back pain. RESULTS: First, a coding scheme was developed using a comprehensive inductive and deductive approach. Second, 10 transcripts were coded independently by two researchers, and ICR was calculated. A resulting kappa value of. 67 can be regarded as satisfactory to solid. Moreover, varying agreement rates helped to identify problems in the coding scheme. Low agreement rates, for instance, indicated that respective codes were defined too broadly and would need clarification. In a third step, the results of the analysis were used to improve the coding scheme, leading to consistent and high-quality results. DISCUSSION: The quantitative approach of ICR assessment is a viable instrument for quality assurance in <b>qualitative</b> <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> Kappa values and close inspection of agreement rates help to estimate and increase quality of codings. This approach facilitates good practice in coding and enhances credibility of analysis, especially when large samples are interviewed, different coders are involved, and quantitative results are presented...|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} explore, identify and describe the main issues surrounding the footwear experiences of people with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. Methods: A <b>qualitative</b> manifest <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> of open-ended survey responses concerning footwear experiences was conducted from a national footwear survey of people with chronic musculoskeletal diseases in New Zealand. Eighty-five respondents submitted usable responses. Specific statements in the text were identified as ‘units of analysis’ prior to coding and organisation of these units into emerging mutually-exclusive categories. <b>Content</b> <b>analysis</b> was independently undertaken by three researchers and final categories and coding was achieved through consensus. Frequencies of assigned units of analysis were calculated in order to obtain a quantitative description for each category. Results: Four categories encompassing a total of nine subcategories related to the footwear experiences of respondents emerged from the <b>qualitative</b> data <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> including: 1) difficulties in finding appropriate footwear; 2) dissatisfaction with therapeutic footwear provision and foot care access; 3) high costs of footwear, foot care and self-care; and 4) satisfaction with therapeutic footwear and foot care. Conclusion: Key categories describing the important issues surrounding the footwear experiences of respondents with chronic musculoskeletal diseases were identified which may provide important targets for improving footwear and foot care services, and self-management strategies.

40|$|Aims: To explore adolescents' {{explanations}} of their temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain, their pain management strategies for TMD pain, and their treatmentseeking behavior. Methods: One-on-one {{interviews were conducted}} with 21 adolescents aged 15 to 19 years old who had TMD pain and followed a semistructured interview guide. Subjects were strategically selected from patients referred to orofacial pain clinic. All participants had been examined and received a pain diagnosis based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD. The interviews focused on the adolescents' experiences of TMD pain, their strategies for handling pain, and how they seek care. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using <b>qualitative</b> manifest <b>content</b> <b>analysis.</b> Results: <b>Qualitative</b> manifest <b>content</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed two categories: (1) self-constructed explanations, with three subcategories (situation-based explanatory model, physical/bilogic model, and psychological explanatory model); and (2) pain management strategies, with four subcategories (social support, treatment, relaxation/rest, and psychological strategies). Adolescents used physical activities and psychological and pharmacologic treatment to manage pain. Reasons for seeking treatment were to be cured, to obtain explanation for their pain, and because their symtoms bother others. Conclusion: Adolescents living with TMD pain develop self-constructed explanations and pain management strategies. With access to these descriptions, dentists can be better prepared to have a dialouge with their adolescent patients about their own {{explanations of}} pain, the nature of pain, and in wich sitations the pain appears.
