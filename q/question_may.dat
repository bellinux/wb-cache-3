5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were designed to accommodate much smaller garrisons than their predecessors from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, {{the implication is that}} the resident units were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fort just one-seventh the size of a typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in a fort only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence must be treated with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in <b>question</b> <b>may</b> be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit in two or three different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E
25|$|In a 2002 poll of 100 researchers, 61 {{believed}} {{the answer to}} be no, 9 {{believed the}} answer is yes, and 22 were unsure; 8 believed the <b>question</b> <b>may</b> be independent of the currently accepted axioms and therefore impossible to prove or disprove.|$|E

25|$|A {{recent study}} found that lying takes longer than telling the truth, and thus the time to answer a <b>question</b> <b>may</b> be used as a method of lie detection. However, it has also been shown that instant-answers can be proof of a {{prepared}} lie.

25|$|The AMPS program, {{implemented}} in December 2005, {{is a system}} that encourages compliance with Customs legislation through the tendering of monetary penalties.

For more serious or deliberate infractions, the goods in <b>question</b> <b>may</b> be seized or subject to forfeiture. AMPS penalties are imposed depending on the severity and frequency of the infraction. Multiple infractions will result in higher penalties under the AMPS system.|$|E

25|$|Externalities are costs (or benefits) {{that are}} not borne by {{the parties to the}} {{economic}} transaction. A producer may, for example, pollute the environment, and others may bear those costs. A consumer may consume a good which produces benefits for society, such as education; because the individual does not receive all of the benefits, he may consume less than efficiency would suggest. Alternatively, an individual may be a smoker or alcoholic and impose costs on others. In these cases, production or consumption of the good in <b>question</b> <b>may</b> differ from the optimum level.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} {{source for}} mythology is ritual. Many rituals {{make reference to}} myths and are sometimes based directly on them. But {{it is difficult to}} determine whether a culture's myths developed before rituals or vice versa. Questions about this relationship between myth and ritual have spawned much discussion among Egyptologists and scholars of comparative religion in general. In ancient Egypt, the earliest evidence of religious practices predates written myths. Rituals early in Egyptian history included only a few motifs from myth. For these reasons, some scholars have argued that, in Egypt, rituals emerged before myths. But because the early evidence is so sparse, the <b>question</b> <b>may</b> never be resolved for certain.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{intoxication}} on criminal responsibility varies by jurisdiction and offense. The criminal code in <b>question</b> <b>may</b> require proof of {{various levels of}} intent. This may range from premeditation, through various degrees of intent or willingness to commit a crime, general recklessness, and finally no intent at all in some instances of strict liability. Intoxication {{may serve as a}} defense against proving more specific forms of intent. If so, its potential effectiveness will sometimes hinge on whether the defendant's intoxication was voluntary or involuntary: the defense would be denied defendants who had voluntarily disabled themselves by knowingly consuming an intoxicating substances, but allowed to those who had consumed it unknowingly or against their will.|$|E

25|$|Avicenna's {{consideration}} of the essence-attributes <b>question</b> <b>may</b> be elucidated {{in terms of his}} ontological analysis of the modalities of being; namely impossibility, contingency, and necessity. Avicenna argued that the impossible being is that which cannot exist, while the contingent in itself (mumkin bi-dhatihi) has the potentiality to be or not to be without entailing a contradiction. When actualized, the contingent becomes a 'necessary existent due to what is other than itself' (wajib al-wujud bi-ghayrihi). Thus, contingency-in-itself is potential beingness that could eventually be actualized by an external cause other than itself. The metaphysical structures of necessity and contingency are different. Necessary being due to itself (wajib al-wujud bi-dhatihi) is true in itself, while the contingent being is 'false in itself' and 'true due to something else other than itself'. The necessary is the source of its own being without borrowed existence. It is what always exists.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the <b>question</b> <b>may</b> be raised: Are {{corporations}} themselves mere {{grants of}} monopoly privilege? Some {{advocates of the}} free market were persuaded to accept this view by Walter Lippmann's The Good Society. It should be clear from previous discussion, however, that corporations are not at all monopolistic privileges; they are free associations of individuals pooling their capital. On the purely free market, such individuals would simply announce to their creditors that their liability is limited to the capital specifically invested in the corporation, and that beyond this their personal funds are not liable for debts, as they would be under a partnership arrangement. It then rests with the sellers and lenders to this corporation {{to decide whether or not}} they will transact business with it. If they do, then they proceed at their own risk. Thus, the government does not grant corporations a privilege of limited liability; anything announced and freely contracted for in advance is a right of a free individual, not a special privilege. It is not necessary that governments grant charters to corporations.|$|E
25|$|Yet {{another kind}} is actual video spam, giving the {{uploaded}} movie {{a name and}} description with a popular figure or event {{that is likely to}} draw attention, or within the video has a certain image timed to come up as the video's thumbnail image to mislead the viewer, such as a still image from a feature film, purporting to be a part-by-part piece of a movie being pirated, e.g. Big Buck Bunny Full Movie Online - Part 1/10 HD, a link to a supposed keygen, trainer, ISO file for a video game, or something similar. The actual content of the video ends up being totally unrelated, a Rickroll, offensive, or simply on-screen text of a link to the site being promoted. In some cases, the link in <b>question</b> <b>may</b> lead to an online survey site, a password-protected archive file with instructions leading to the aforementioned survey (though the survey, and the archive file itself, is worthless and doesn't contain the file in question at all), or in extreme cases, malware. Others may upload videos presented in an infomercial-like format selling their product which feature actors and paid testimonials, though the promoted product or service is of dubious quality and would likely not pass the scrutiny of a standards and practices department at a television station or cable network.|$|E

500|$|Nestor's {{account of}} the first {{encounter}} between the Rus' and the Byzantines {{may have contributed to}} the popularity of the Theotokos in Russia. The miraculous saving of Constantinople from the barbarian hordes would appear in Russian icon-painting, without understanding that the hordes in <b>question</b> <b>may</b> have issued from Kiev. Furthermore, when the Blachernitissa was brought to Moscow in the 17th century, it was said that it was this icon that had saved Tsargrad from the troops of the [...] "Scythian khagan", after Michael III had prayed before it to the Theotokos. Nobody noticed that the story had obvious parallels with the sequence of events described by Nestor.|$|E
500|$|In 1853, Tischendorf {{revisited}} the Saint Catherine's Monastery to get {{the remaining}} 86 folios, but without success.

[...] Indeed, it has been noted that the leaves were in [...] "suspiciously good condition" [...] for something found in the trash.)
