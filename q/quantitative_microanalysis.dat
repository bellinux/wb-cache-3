The current techniques for manipulation of microparticles allow {{only a single}} particle in the manipulation workspace, or simultaneous transportation of multiple microparticles in batches. In this work, a method based on a robotized electromagnetic needle for manipulation of individual superparamagnetic microparticles within a microparticle population is introduced. By automatically controlling the highly localized magnetic field of the needle, a single microparticle is selectively picked when its neighboring particle is few micrometers away. Supported by the nanometer resolution of the robotic positioner, particles are placed at sub-micrometer precision. This manipulation technique allows the creating of arbitrary patterns, sorting of microparticles based on size and morphology, and transporting of individual microparticles in three-dimensional space.

40|$|The {{overview}} {{of the history of}} quantitative x-ray microanalysis shows the efficiency of the use of standards to achieve the most reliable quantification. State-of-the-art cold field emission gun scanning electron microscopes offer excellent resolution but lack a sufficient level of beam current stability essential for reliable <b>quantitative</b> <b>microanalysis.</b> The purpose of this work is to develop a new method for quantitative x-ray microanalysis adapted to unstable beam current conditions. In the Cliff and Lorimer method, which was developed for the analytical transmission electron microscope, the composition was calculated from the ratio of the characteristic x-ray intensities of two elements in the same spectrum. In this work, this ratio method is applied to bulk specimens in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). In order to reduce the amplitude of error propagation, the proposed ratio for SEM <b>quantitative</b> <b>microanalysis</b> is the intensity of a x-ray divided by the sum of intensities of one or more characteristic lines of each of tire elements found in the specimen. Moreover, the calculated x-ray intensities are corrected for the effects of absorption, fluorescence and Coster-Kronig yields, and other physical factors normally considered in microbeam analysis. Uncertainties in physical parameters and models, clue to the lack of exhaustive measurements as well as their scattering, revealed by a disaggrement between the measured and calculated ratios, are minimized by the use of a calibration factor inserted into the ratio. This calibration factor is determined using a standard for a given element. It can be used as often as needed and allows for the correction of uncertainties in the x-ray detector efficiency. In order to quantify the specimen, the measured experimental ratio is compared to a simulated ratio with the appropriate calibration factor. The composition is interpolated from the theoretical ratio curves. Two methods of calculation of emitted x-ray intensity are proposed, by analytical calculations using the Pouchou and Pichoir model or by an in-house developed Monte Carlo simulation program. Two sets of National Bureau of Standards (NBS) microanalysis standard reference materials, AuCu (SRM 482) and AuAg (SRM 481), are used to validate this method. The comparison of calculated composition with the nominal one underlines the need for a beam-energy-dependent calibration factor, particularly because of ionization cross-section uncertainties. The use of high energy characteristic x-ray lines (above 5 keV) permits accuracy around 3 % with a beam-energy-dependent calibration factor. The effects of beam energy, ionization cross-section models, mass-absorption coefficients and x-ray generation methods are compensated by the appropriate calibration factor. The change of the family of characteristic lines affects the accuracy. Finally, as in any <b>quantitative</b> <b>microanalysis,</b> the use of a filter to extract the characteristic intensity causes errors for low energy peaks. The analysis of the effect of calibration factors and mass-absorption coefficient enhances the need for refining the x-ray generation and emission parameters. The error propagation is less important than if using the classical Cliff and Lorimer method in a SEM. However, the use of appropriate calibration factors and pair of lines offers promising accuracy in almost any conditions. This method is independent of the beam current, which is the purpose of this work. Despite many uncertainties of physical parameters, this method offers an efficient and reliable alternative to quantitative x-ray microanalysis with any electron microscope. Although developed for a binary material, the method can be extended to heterogeneous, rough, multiple-component materials, inasmuch as it can be simulated with a Monte Carlo program or any other method that computes characteristic x-ray lines intensities...|$|E

40|$|In {{biological}} sample microanalysis, a mass-normalisation method {{is commonly used}} as a quantitative index of elemental concentrations determined by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE).

Non-damaging STIM analysis of samples before PIXE irradiation is certainly one of the most accurate ways to determine the sample mass, however, this requires strong experimen tal handling.

Significant progress has been achieved in qualitative investigations of signaling peptides in the nervous system using single cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. However, quantitative information about signaling peptides is difficult to obtain with this approach because only small amounts of analytes are available for analysis. Here we describe several methods for <b>quantitative</b> <b>microanalysis</b> of peptides in individual Aplysia californica neurons and small pieces of tissue. Stable isotope labeling with d 0 - and d 4 -succinic anhydride and iTRAQ reagents has been successfully adopted for relative quantitation of nanoliter volume samples containing the Aplysia insulin Cβ peptide. Comparative analysis of the Cβ peptide release site, the upper labial nerve, and its synthesis location, the F- and C-clusters, shows that the release site possesses almost three times more of this compound. The method of standard addition permits absolute quantitation of the physiologically active neuropeptide cerebrin from small structures, including nerves and neuronal clusters, in the femtomole range with a limit of detection of 19 fmol.

The DNB-DGs were resolved by HPLC using a reverse column with an isocratic solvent. Peak areas of DNB-DGs prepared from dipalmitoyl and dioleoyl phosphatidylcholines were proportional to the amounts of the derivatives. The quantification could be done at pmole level. The molecular species profiles of phosphatidylcholine of rat lung and liver obtained by the DNB-DG method were almost identical with those determined by DG-acetate RI method reported by Itoh et al.

Commercially available software now allows for the acquisition and storage of such spectrum-images, perhaps comprising as much as 100 MBytes of data or more. A variety of post-acquisition processing tools are provided by the developer to allow the extraction of both X-ray intensity maps, with or without rudimentary background subtraction, or full spectra from pixels of interest. In order to maximize the extraction of information from these large data sets, a number of linear and nonlinear methods are currently being explored that identify statistically significant variations among the series of spectra without a priori assumptions about the content of the data set.
