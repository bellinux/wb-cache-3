When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports too were dismissed.|$|E
40|$|Study objective: To assess if {{less than}} 11 hours off work between work shifts (<b>quick</b> <b>returns)</b> {{was related to}} insomnia, sleepiness, fatigue, anxiety, {{depression}} and shift work disorder among nurses. Methods: A questionnaire including established instruments measuring insomnia (Bergen Insomnia Scale), sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), fatigue (Fatigue Questionnaire), anxiety/depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and shift work disorder was administered. Among the 1990 Norwegian nurses {{who participated in the}} study; 264 nurses had no <b>quick</b> <b>returns,</b> 724 had 1 – 30 <b>quick</b> <b>returns</b> and 892 had more than 30 <b>quick</b> <b>returns</b> during the past year. 110 nurses did not report the number of <b>quick</b> <b>returns</b> during the past year. The prevalence of insomnia, excessive sleepiness, excessive fatigue, anxiety, depression and shift work disorder was calculated within the three groups of nurses. Crude and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relation between <b>quick</b> <b>returns</b> and such complaints. Results: We found a significant positive association between <b>quick</b> <b>returns</b> and insomnia, excessive sleepiness, excessive fatigue and shift work disorder. Anxiety and depression were not related to working <b>quick</b> <b>returns.</b> Conclusions: There is a health hazard associated with <b>quick</b> <b>returns.</b> Further research should aim to investigate if workplac...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the study}} was to study the effects of a {{flexible}} shift system (based on selfdetermined work hours) with respect to sleep/wake complaints and subjective health. The comparison group was a rapidly rotating shift system, with frequently occurring <b>quick</b> <b>returns.</b> A secondary aim was to examine the relation between work hour characteristics indicating compressed or difficult rosters (e. g. number of workdays in a row, frequency of <b>quick</b> <b>returns</b> and long work shifts) and subjective sleep and sleepiness, within the flexible shift system group. The sample of the analysis included 533 randomly selected police officers, of which 26 % were females. The participants answered a questionnaire. The results showed that the flexible shift system group did not differ with respect to sleep/wake complaints and subjective health. However, the flexible shift group obtained more sleep in connection with the shifts, probably because of longer rest time between shifts. Thus, they worked less <b>quick</b> <b>returns</b> and long work shifts. The association between work hour characteristics and sleep/wake complaints was weak in the flexible shift group. Instead, sleep/wake problems were mainly associated with the attitude to work hours...|$|R
5|$|It is {{not quite}} clear where Gaveston spent his time abroad; the {{conditions}} of his exile banned him from staying {{in any of the}} lands of the English king. This precluded both Aquitaine and Ireland, where he had spent his previous exiles. There is some evidence that he might have gone to France initially, but considering the French king's hostile attitude towards him, he is not likely to have stayed there long. Flanders is a much more likely candidate for Gaveston's third and final exile. This time his absence was even shorter than the second time, lasting no more than two months. Returning around Christmas 1311, he was reunited with the King early in 1312, probably at Knaresborough on 13 January. The reason for his <b>quick</b> <b>return</b> might have been the birth of his child, a daughter named Joan, around this time. On 18 January, Edward declared the judgement against Gaveston unlawful, and restored all lands to him.|$|E
5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's <b>quick</b> <b>return</b> and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E
5|$|After 1945, a Hutu counter-elite developed, {{leading to}} a {{deterioration}} in relations between the groups. The Tutsi leadership agitated for speedy independence to cement their hold on power, while the Hutu elite called for the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu, a stance increasingly supported by {{the church and the}} colonial government. In November 1959, the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the Rwandan Revolution. The king and Tutsi politicians attempted a fightback, seeking to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians. This plan was thwarted by Belgian colonel Guy Logiest, who was brought in by the colonial governor. Logiest re-established law and order, and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite, replacing many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu, and forcing King Kigeli V into exile. Logiest and Hutu leader Grégoire Kayibanda declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961, and it became independent in 1962. More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda to escape the Hutu purges, settling primarily in the four neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and Zaire. The Tutsi exiles were regarded as refugees in their host countries, and sought a <b>quick</b> <b>return</b> to Rwanda. They formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda, the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963. These groups were known as the inyenzi (cockroaches). Historians do not know the origin of this term – it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night. The inyenzi label resurfaced in the 1990s, as a highly derogatory term used by Hutu hardliners to refer to all Tutsi, dehumanising them. The inyenzi attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them, following up with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.|$|E

25|$|United's next {{match was}} on the road, against Montreal Impact, and the game {{could not have been}} more {{different}} than the nearly record-setting 6-4 shootout in United's prior game at home against RSL. The surprising, <b>quick</b> <b>return</b> from injury by goalie Bill Hamid and the sprained knee injury suffered by Fabian Espindola during training the day before the match virtually guaranteed that United would play a cautious, defensive-minded game. Statistics from the game bore that out, as United was outshot 25–1 by the home team, and possession was more than 2–1 in the Impact's favor. Amazingly though, United emerged with a 1–0 victory, thanks to strong goalkeeping and a first-half goal by Rolfe that finished off a play assisted by Arrieta's high pressure. Arrieta forced a turnover by the Montreal defense and directed the ball to Rolfe who scored what proved to be the game-winner on United's only shot of the game.
