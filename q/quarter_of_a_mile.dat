5|$|In heavy rain, Baker {{took off}} and began to level off at 600 feet. A <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> into the flight, the engine failed. The plane was {{generally}} easy to crash-land if necessary, something he had done previously {{at the cost of}} a few broken ribs.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{minutes after}} {{sighting}} the lighthouse, the ship ran aground violently {{at full speed}} amongst the rocks of Maenheere Reef, a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> off The Lizard. Suevic was about 16 miles closer to the shore than her command crew believed.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{demolished}} {{the original}} building around 1812 and in 1814 rebuilt the seat a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> further north-east, to designs by Thomas Hopper, that {{were based on}} plans which Hopper had previously drawn for Pytminster House, Wiltshire. Philip Miles died in 1845, leaving Leigh Court to his eldest son, William Miles, for whom the Miles Baronetcy of Leigh Court, Somerset was created in 1859. In 1884 the second Baronet, Sir Sir Philip Miles, entertained the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.|$|E

5|$|NY33A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY33 {{just east of}} the village of Bergen in the town of the same name. From this point, NY33 travels to the west and to the northeast while NY33A heads east. Less than a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> (0.4km) from its western terminus, NY33A meets Interstate490 (I-490) at exit2. In this area, I-490 straddles the border between Genesee County and Monroe County; thus, the westbound portion of the interchange is in Genesee County while the eastbound half is in Monroe County.|$|E
5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered into two groups. It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The Russians had a {{numerical}} advantage {{but soon the}} tide swung as Drouet's Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte's I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The horse artillery of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile.</b> The casualties of the Russians in Pratzen included Kutuzov, who was severely wounded, and his son-in-law Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen who was killed.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Finnair started {{flying to}} Helsinki, {{although}} direct flights were not introduced until 1971. After 1962, the east–west runway became the main runway. Along with the runway expansion, a new service building, with {{a capacity for}} 2million passengers, was opened in 1964. It was located about half a kilometer (<b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile)</b> south of the former terminal. Designed by Odd Nansens Arkitektkontor, it had two stories, one for arrivals and one for departures, and two wings, one for domestic and one for international flights. It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft. The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes, although they were also occasionally used to Bodø.|$|E
5|$|Middlewich {{was founded}} by the Romans, who gave it the name Salinae because of its {{surrounding}} salt deposits. It {{became one of the}} major Roman sites for salt production, an activity that was centred on the township of Kinderton, about a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> north of the present-day parish church of St. Michael and All Angels. It has been suggested that pre-Roman salt production also occurred in the same area, but there is no supporting archaeological evidence. Whittaker's History of Manchester claims that the Iron Age Cornovii made Kinderton their capital, but {{it is more likely that}} the Cornovii inhabited Kinderton for its salt-making potential. There was once thought to have been a medieval castle at Kinderton, but that is now thought to have been unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The East Washington Avenue Bridge serves an {{area that}} was {{previously}} known as Pembroke, the name stemming from the 1650s, that grew to become a prosperous agricultural community. East of Pembroke was the village of Newfield, which was chartered as the borough of Bridgeport in 1800. In 1821, it became the township of Bridgeport before being chartered as a city in 1836. The need for the bridge arose when Reverend Birdsey Noble purchased 50 acres from Senator Wright; {{with the intention of}} selling housing lots. The location of the bridge was originally planned to be one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> to the south, but it was changed through public opposition, and a toll bridge was constructed in 1836. The description of this bridge and details of its service life and replacement have not been found in records.|$|E

5|$|Even by May 1943 Mark II ASV (Air-to-surface-vessel) {{was still}} being used. By then the German Metox {{receivers}} could detect the 1.5m radiations. A variable condenser was installed as an interim solution to reduce {{the strength of the}} signal. This gave U-boats the impression the aircraft was moving away from it. There was a radical change in 1943 with radar equipment when the ASV Mark III was becoming available. Based on RAF Bomber Command's H2S, it transmitted a much shorter wavelength of 9.1cm instead of 1.5m as with Mark Is and IIs and could not be detected by Metox receivers in U-boats. Instead of fixed aerials there was a rotary scanner, and thus the return signals gave a visual trace through 360 degrees on a CRT known as the Plan Position Indicator (PPI). The Mark II would only cover a forward arc, unlike the Mark III. The Mark III would indicate surface vessels via a dot on the screen while the coast would be given in the shape of an outline. Targets remained visible on the screen to within a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile.</b> The Mark III also suffered much less from 'sea return' obscuring targets at short range.|$|E
5|$|Orme and La Fleche {{met again}} in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood with two other opponents, Watercress and Royal Harry. Starting favourite, Orme had La Fleche in trouble {{with more than a}} <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> still to run. He seemed to have the race won, but then veered left forcing Morny Cannon to pull him back and {{allowing}} La Fleche to draw level. However Orme pulled away again and won by a neck, with Watercress a further six lengths back in third. Orme's final race came in the Limekiln Stakes where he had to carry 10 stone. He finished second to Childwick, who was receiving 33 pounds. During the autumn Orme's legs had started to give him trouble and during the Limekiln a suspensory ligament gave way. This injury brought an end to his racing career, and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career he won a total of £32,528 in prize money.|$|E

25|$|A <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> past Milefortlet 21 {{is another}} side-road, this time {{leading to the}} village of Crosscanonby. There was a car park {{opposite}} the turning, but it was claimed by the sea during a winter storm in early 2014. As Allonby bay turns, so does the road, and by the time it reaches Maryport golf club it is heading almost due west. A bend in the road as it cuts through the golf course, however, puts it back on a more southerly course as it enters the final mile toward its southern terminus. A <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> beyond the golf club is Maryport cemetery, {{on the outskirts of the}} town.|$|E
25|$|There {{was a small}} depot at Carpenters Road about a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> {{south of}} Stratford station. Opened in 1900, the depot {{consisted}} of four long sidings and primarily dealt with coal and building materials. It was closed on 7 December 1964.|$|E
