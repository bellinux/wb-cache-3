However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E

5|$|By January 1974, a {{joint working}} party {{representing}} Greater Manchester had drawn up its county Structure Plan, ready for implementation by the Greater Manchester County Council.

40|$|Objetivo: A doença de Parkinson é uma enfermidade neurodegenerativa com diversas manifestações motoras e não-motoras que podem provocar impacto na qualidade de vida. Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar a qualidade de vida em pacientes com doença de Parkinson com idade {{superior}} a 60 anos por meio do questionário World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults e possíveis fatores determinantes, tais como qualidade de sono, sintomas motores e depressivos. Método: Foi realizado estudo transversal avaliando a qualidade de vida pelo questionário World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults em 57 pacientes com doença de Parkinson. Resultados: World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults total apresentou associação com a severidade da doença de Parkinson (rs = - 0, 43; p ≤ 0, 001). As facetas de habilidade sensorial e de participação social apresentaram maior pontuação nos indivíduos com estágio leve em comparação ao grupo com doença de Parkinson avançada. World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults (faceta-I) apresentou associação com Índice de Qualidade de Sono de Pittsburg e Escala de Sono na Doença de Parkinson (rp = - 0, 46 e rp = 0, 41; p < 0, 001, respectivamente). A Escala Geriátrica de Depressão apresentou associação com World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults (rp = - 0, 70; p < 0, 001). Conclusão: A qualidade de vida em pacientes com doença de Parkinson pode ser avaliada pelo questionário World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults e foi demonstrado que a severidade da doença de Parkinson e os sintomas depressivos podem comprometer negativamente a qualidade de vida. Objective: Parkinson’s {{disease is}} a neurodegenerative disease {{with a number of}} motor and non-motor features that can affect <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> In this study, we aimed to assess <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> as well as to evaluate the potential determinants <b>of</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> such as sleep quality, motor and depressive symptoms, in elderly patients with Parkinson’s disease. Method: This was a cross-sectional study in which we applied the World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults in 57 Parkinson’s disease patients over 60 years of age. Results: Total World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults score was found to be associated with Parkinson’s disease severity (rs = − 0. 43; p ≤ 0. 001). World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults scores for sensory abilities (facet 1) and social participation (facet 4) were higher among the patients with mild Parkinson’s disease than among those in the more advanced stages (rs = - 0. 43; p ≤ 0. 001). Facet 1 scores were found to be associated with Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale score (rp = - 0. 46 and rp = 0. 41; p < 0. 001, respectively). The Geriatric Depression Scale score showed an association with the total score on the World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults (rp = - 0. 70; p < 0. 001) Conclusion: <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in Parkinson’s disease patients can be assessed by the World Health Organization <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> Assessment <b>for</b> Older Adults.

5|$|Controversy emerged over Entrance 2's {{location}} in February 2011, when a lawsuit was {{filed by the}} Yorkshire Towers over the location of Entrance 2.

The lawsuit was later dismissed because the suit had been filed two years after the FTA's FONSI was published, which was past the statute of limitations. A new lawsuit was filed on March 15, 2013, after the MTA started construction on the entrances. In June 2013, that lawsuit was also dismissed.|$|E

Destroying ivory in those countries is thus often a controversial decision for internal stakeholders as well as external commentators, as the funds gained by selling the material could be used to improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> human citizens.|$|E

He also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. He suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> Africans.

5|$|Villermé’s Tableau {{discussed}} {{the role of}} industrialization on the general health and <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>for</b> the laboring class. His perspective in this work is unique in that he maintained {{that the process of}} industrialization is not completely to blame. He even suggested the industrial movement to be beneficial for the future of society, calling on examples of industrialization in the United States. He also {{discussed the}} role of children working in the textile industry. The point is made that, in some cases, {{at least half of the}} workforce in a textile factory was made up of the children of textile workers, many under the age of eighteen. Villermé contrasted the quality of life of workers who maintained family life with those taken over completely by their labor. He blamed both the working conditions associated with industrialization as well as the workers themselves to an extent. This work served not only as valuable information to medical institutions and boards, but also as a social statement, widely accepted by the public. It is from this work that Villermé received his reputation as a moral economist.|$|E
