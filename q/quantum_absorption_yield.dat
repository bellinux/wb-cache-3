We also show that it is generically possible to have fast cooling. We demonstrate our results for two separate models of thermalization, and show that a transient cooling without steady-state cooling is associated with generation of negligible, or no bipartite quantum correlations.

Gametophytes {{of the red}} {{intertidal}} macroalga Porphyra abbottae {{were grown}} in batch cultures {{in order to examine}} some of their plastic responses to key environmental factors. Conchospores from a conchocelis stock culture (originated from a single carpospore) were grown under various conditions of photon flux density (PFD) and nutrient supply (nitrogen, phosphorus enrichment and water motion). The research centered on how these factors affect morphology (shape, thickness) and light harvesting by young gametophytic blades, and how changes in the latter influence photosynthesis and growth. Blades grown at low PFD and high water motion were narrower; under nutrient limitation they were thinner. Whole thallus broadband absorptance (400 - 700 nm) was used as a measure of light harvesting ability. Absorptance increased at PFDs limiting for growth, indicating photoacclimation by light harvesting pigments, but this increase was not sufficient to compensate for low ambient PFD. The resulting decrease in the amount of light harvested at subsaturating PFDs did not account entirely for the decrease in growth rates at these PFDs: quantum yields of growth in plants grown under a range of PFDs showed decreased light use efficiency at low PFD, suggesting increased metabolic maintenance costs at limiting PFD. Nutrient limitation decreased the light harvesting ability, light-limited and light-saturated photosynthetic rates, and growth. Minor shifts in maximal quantum yields of photosynthesis indicated that differences in light-limited rates were primarily determined by light <b>absorption.</b> <b>Quantum</b> <b>yields</b> of growth were increased by nitrogen limitation. Increased absorptance, brought about by low PFD and/or high nitrogen, was accompanied by enrichment of the accessory pigments phycoerythrin and phycocyanin relative to chlorophyll a, and of phycocyanin relative to phycoerythrin. Addition of accessory pigments to photosynthetic membranes may thus involve an increase in phycobilisome density along with a reduction in the phycoerythrin content of phycobilisomes...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{hydrogen}} atom (H-atom) transfer {{reactions of the}} lowest electronic excited state of the d 8 dimer [Pt 2 (P 2 O 5 H 2) 4] 4 - (the ground state is abbreviated Pt 2]; the lowest excited state is a long-lived triplet, abbreviated 3 Pt 2 *). Factors that influence initial rates of reaction of the excited state with alcohol and hydrocarbon H-atom donors are examined in Chapter 2. Observation of a large kinetic deuterium isotope effect (kH/kD= 4) for phosphorescence quenching by [alpha]-secphenethyl alcohol verifies the importance of bond strength in determining reaction rates. A plot of H-atom abstraction rates versus C-H bond strengths reveals that bond strength is not the sole determinant of abstraction rate, however. Faster rates are observed when an [alpha]-hydroxy functionality is present, {{and the size of}} the substrate also influences abstraction rates. Chapter 3 features characterization of a diplatinum dihydride complex (Pt 2 H 2) that acts as a key intermediate in H-atom transfer reactions. 3 Pt 2 * reacts with hydrogen-atom donors to give a complex characterized by strong absorption at 314 nm; NMR (1 H and 31 P) and IR spectroscopic studies show that the complex is an axial dihydride (Pt 2 H 2). Reactions of Pt 2 H 2 include photochemical release of H 2, rapid thermal reduction of O 2, and thermal reduction of HCl to H 2. Chapter 4 describes synthesis and characterization of a derivative of Pt 2 modified by substitution of electron-withdrawing BF 2 + groups for ligand H+.

40|$|Quantum speed limit, {{furnishing}} a {{lower bound}} on the required {{time for the}} evolution of a quantum system through the state space, imposes an ultimate natural limitation to the dynamics of physical devices. <b>Quantum</b> <b>absorption</b> refrigerators, on the other hand, have attracted {{a great deal of attention}} in the last few years. In this article, we discuss the effects of quantum speed limit on the performance of a <b>quantum</b> <b>absorption</b> refrigerator. In particular, we show that there exists a trade-off relation between the steady cooling rate of the refrigerator and the minimum time taken to reach the steady state. Based on this, we define a figure of merit called "bounding second order cooling rate" and show that this scales linearly with the unitary interaction strength among the constituent qubits. We also study the increase of bounding second order cooling rate with the thermalization strength. We subsequently demonstrate that coherence in the initial three qubit system can significantly increase the bounding second order cooling rate. We study the efficiency of the refrigerator at maximum bounding second order cooling rate and, in a limiting case, we show that the efficiency at maximum bounding second order cooling rate is given by a simple formula reminiscent of the Curzon-Ahlborn relation.

We show that for a relativistically intense plane-wave laser field many features of the momentum distribution of the produced electron-positron pair like its extension, region of highest probability and carrier-envelope phase effects can be explained from the classical evolution of the created particles in the background field. To this end an intuitive semiclassical picture based on the local constant-crossed field approximation applied on the probability-amplitude level is established and compared with the standard approach used in QED-PIC codes. The main difference is the substructure of the spectrum, which results from interference effects between macroscopically separated formation regions. In order to compare the predictions of the semiclassical approach with exact calculations, a very fast numerical scheme is introduced. It renders the calculation of the fully differential spectrum on a grid which resolves all interference fringes feasible.
