40|$|In this study, {{the ways}} in which older siblings’personal <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> sibling {{relationship}} experiences were associated with younger siblings’levels of empathy during early adolescence and preadolescence were explored. Participants were 199 sibling dyads (mean years of age = 11 and 8, respectively) who were interviewed using two procedures: (a) in their homes about their family relationships <b>and</b> personal <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> (b) in a sequence of seven nightly telephone interviews about their daily activities and companions. Multiple regression analyses were conducted separately by younger siblings’gender to examine the relations of older siblings’personal <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> sibling relationship experiences to younger siblings’ empathy. Analyses revealed that younger sisters’ as compared to younger brothers’ empathy was related differentially to their older siblings’ personal <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> to the nature of their sibling relationship. Additional analyses to examine younger siblings’ personal <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> sibling relationship experiences as potential predictors of older siblings’ empathy generally were nonsignificant, indicating that older siblings enhance younger siblings’empathy rather than vice versa...|$|R

5|$|A {{series of}} {{biennial}} {{reports from the}} U.S. National Research Council have reviewed the progress of CERP. The fourth report in the series, released in 2012, found that little {{progress has been made}} in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem; instead, most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery. The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines, it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades, and to improve both the <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> quantity of the water in the ecosystem. To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress, the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes, including phosphorus loads, peat depth, and populations of snail kites, birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida. Most attributes received grades ranging from C (degraded) to D (significantly degraded), but the snail kite received a grade of F (near irreversible damage). The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios: improved water quality, improved hydrology, and improvements to both water <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> hydrology, which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction. Overall, the report concluded that substantial near-term progress to address both water <b>quality</b> <b>and</b> hydrology in the central Everglades is needed to reverse ongoing degradation before it is too late.|$|E

40|$|Research on the <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> {{characteristics}} that individuals value in those from whom they seek "career help" is very limited. Existing studies provide little {{insight into the}} meaning behind the labels individuals use to identify valued <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> characteristics. We address this neglected area using qualitative interviews based on life story method whereby individuals identified informal and professional career helpers <b>and</b> the <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> characteristics they valued in these helpers. Meanings are explored, <b>qualities</b> <b>and</b> characteristics conceptualized and a new conceptual framework showing the relationship between concepts is developed. Findings {{give rise to a}} discussion about the value and meaning of knowledge, impartiality, power and influence from the perspective of individuals in receipt of career help, and in so doing we challenge some commonly accepted discourse about these concepts in the academic and professional careers literature.
