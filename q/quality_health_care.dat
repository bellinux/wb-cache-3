Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to <b>quality</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E

25|$|Israel is {{emerging}} as a popular destination for medical tourists. In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue. The advantages of Israel for health tourism include good natural resources; stable, comfortable climate all year round; a progressive medical systems, and scenic locations which have a calming effect on patients. Medical tourists choose Israel for several reasons. Some come from European nations such as Romania where certain procedures are not available. Others come to Israel, most commonly from the United States, because they can receive <b>quality</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> {{at a fraction of}} the cost it would be at home, for both surgeries and in-vitro fertilization treatments. Other medical tourists come to Israel to visit the Dead Sea, a world-famous therapeutic resort. The Israel Ministry of Tourism and several professional medical services providers have set out to generate awareness of Israel's medical capabilities.|$|E

500|$|Women's {{health has}} been {{described}} as [...] "a patchwork quilt with gaps". Although many of the issues around women's health relate to their reproductive health, including maternal and child health, genital health and breast health, and endocrine (hormonal) health, including menstruation, birth control and menopause, a broader understanding of women's health to include all aspects of the health of women has been urged, replacing [...] "Women's Health" [...] with [...] "The Health of Women". The WHO considers that an undue emphasis on reproductive health has been a major barrier to ensuring access to good <b>quality</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> for all women. Conditions that affect both men and women, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, also manifest differently in women. Women's health issues also include medical situations in which women face problems not directly related to their biology, such as gender-differentiated access to medical treatment and other socioeconomic factors. Women's health is of particular concern due to widespread discrimination against women in the world, leaving them disadvantaged.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To date, the {{available}} {{information regarding the}} <b>quality</b> of primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services in Albania is scarce. The aim of our study {{was to assess the}} <b>quality</b> of primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services in Albania based on physicians' perceptions towards the quality of the services provided to the general population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in January-March 2013 including a representative sample of 132 physicians (59 men aged 41. 3 ± 6. 9 years and 73 women aged 43. 7 ± 4. 8 years; overall response rate: 132 / 150 = 88 %) providing primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services in several polyclinics (health centers) of Tirana, the Albanian capital city. A structured self-administered and anonymous questionnaire was applied including physicians' perceptions regarding different dimensions of the <b>quality</b> of primary <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association of self-perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services with baseline characteristics of physicians. RESULTS: Self-perceived adequate <b>quality</b> of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services was positively related to the age of physicians, their working experience, female gender, a lower population served, and specialization in family medicine. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide useful evidence on the self-perceived <b>quality</b> of <b>health</b> services from primary <b>health</b> <b>care</b> physicians' perspective in transitional Albania. Health authorities in Albania should implement suitable instruments to measure the <b>quality</b> of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services at all levels...|$|R
