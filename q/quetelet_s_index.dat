The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate, using water retention characteristics and the <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> the physical quality of an Oxisol (Red-Yellow Latosol), subjected to weed control during the cultivation of coffee. The following weed control methods were evaluated: harrowing, brushcutting, residue crushing, manual weeding, post-emergence herbicide application, pre-emergence herbicide application, and maintenance of soil cover with peanut forage, Brachiaria grass, and spontaneous vegetation (no weed treatment). The following properties were determined for physical characterization of the soil: bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, microporosity, water retention, and the <b>S</b> <b>index.</b> The weed control method significantly affected the physical properties and water retention in the subsurface layer of the Oxisol.

Numerous {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to assess the differences in soil properties caused by different management systems in olive cropped farms. Nevertheless {{the influence of the}} most frequent management systems on the hydraulic properties of these soils has not been evaluated. Contrarily, there are very few studies that have tried to correlate these results with soil losses due to water erosion. There are complementary approaches to traditional degradation <b>indices,</b> as the <b>S</b> <b>index</b> based on the form of the soil retention curve (Dexter 2004 a,b,c). The objectives of this study were (i) to evaluate the methods based on the <b>S</b> <b>index</b> to assess the physical quality of soil in olive orchards, (ii) to assess the short-term changes (2 years) in soil physical and chemical properties in two olive orchards under different managements systems, namely conventional tillage and cover crop, and (iii) to formulate strategies for assessing the quality of soil in olive orchards. For the studied soils, degradation processes (associated to conventional tillage) and the improvement of their properties (linked to cover crops) showed a fast response. Chemical changes were quickly observed. However physical changes are slower than chemical changes for both soils. Water retention curves allowed the evaluation of soil porosity based on depth in the profile and the management practices. The <b>S</b> <b>index</b> was computed for every soil using the conventional soil water retention equations fitted to the experimental data. For the olive cropped soils, higher <b>S</b> <b>index</b> values were obtained in the less degradated areas, in most of the cases.

In this paper, based on the S-theory, data from 16 collection sites in the Haihe River Basin in northern China were used, {{and the effects of}} soil particle size distribution and bulk density on three important indices of theS-theory were investigated on a regional scale. The relationships between unsaturated hydraulic conductivityKi at the inflection point and S values (S/hi) were also studied using two different types of fitting equations.

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 91 patients with pathologically confirmed CHB who visited General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University and underwent liver biopsy from January 2009 to April 2015. According to the Scheuer pathological stage and liver fibrosis stage (S), the patients were divided into non-liver fibrosis group (a liver fibrosis stage of S 0, 32 patients), mild liver fibrosis group (a liver fibrosis stage of ＜S 2, 30 patients), and marked liver fibrosis group (a liver fibrosis stage of ≥S 2, 29 patients). The APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> and <b>S</b> <b>index</b> were calculated, and liver stiffness was measured by FibroScan. An analysis of variance was used for the comparison of normally distributed continuous data between three groups, and the Dunnett t-test was used for further comparison between any two groups. The Spearman correlation analysis was also performed. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the value of these noninvasive techniques in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. Results There were significant differences in age, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and platelet count between the three groups (F= 3. 552, 4. 035, 4. 374, and 5. 992, all P＜ 0. 05), and there were significant differences in these parameters between the non-liver fibrosis group and the mild and marked liver fibrosis groups (P＜ 0. 05). There were significant differences in APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> and FibroScan between the three groups (F= 4. 579, 5. 728, 10. 501, 14. 118, and 30. 039, all P＜ 0. 05); there were significant differences in these indices between the non-liver fibrosis group and the mild and marked liver fibrosis groups (P＜ 0. 05), and {{there was a significant difference}} in FibroScan between the mild liver fibrosis group and the marked liver fibrosis group (P＜ 0. 05). APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> and FibroScan were positively correlated with the pathological stage of liver fibrosis (r= 0. 499, 0. 498, 0. 402, 0. 395, and 0. 739, all P＜ 0. 05). APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> or FibroScan alone has certain value in the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, with an AUC (95 % CI) of 0. 786 (0. 679 - 0. 892), 0. 818 (0. 717 - 0. 918), 0. 770 (0. 661 - 0. 880), 0. 718 (0. 599 - 0. 837), or 0. 919 (0. 864 - 0. 974) (all P＜ 0. 01). When APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> or <b>S</b> <b>index</b> was combined with FibroScan, the AUC (95 % CI) was increased to 0. 922 (0. 868 - 0. 976), 0. 931 (0. 881 - 0. 981), 0. 926 (0. 873 - 0. 979), and 0. 918 (0. 862 - 0. 974), respectively. A combination of APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> and FibroScan increased the AUC (95 % CI) to 0. 927 (0. 875 - 0. 979). Conclusion APRI, FIB- 4, Forns <b>index,</b> <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> and FibroScan are significantly positively correlated with liver fibrosis grade.

Noninvasive fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) signals from 45 pregnant women at the gestational age from 16 to 41 weeks with normal single pregnancies were analysed. A nonlinear parameter called heart rate asymmetry (HRA) index that measures time asymmetry of RR interval time-series signal was used to understand the changes of HRA in early and late fetus groups. Results indicate that fetal HRA measured by Porta 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Index</b> (PI) consistently increases after 35 weeks gestation compared to foetus before 32 weeks of gestation. It {{might be due to}} significant changes of sympatho-vagal balance towards delivery with more sympathetic surge. On the other hand, Guzik 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Index</b> (GI) showed a mixed effect i. e., increases at lower lags and decreases at higher lags. Finally, fHRA could potentially help identify normal and the pathological autonomic nervous system development...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the global characteristics of the ionospheric scintillation <b>S</b> 4 <b>index</b> {{and the level of}} geomagnetic activity is investigated. The 4 -year dataset covers the bottom of the declining phase of solar cycle 23 and is used to study the diurnal and seasonal variations of the space-based S 4 measurements obtained from a large number of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) events. The statistical patterns observed are used as quiet-time baselines to investigate the effects of geomagnetic disturbances on the measured ionospheric scintillation levels at different locations. In addition, these characteristics are investigated for different longitude sectors. A ground-based Ionospheric Scintillation Monitor (ISM) is also employed to determine the relationship, if any, between the <b>S</b> 4 <b>index</b> measured on the ground and the <b>S</b> 4 <b>index</b> derived from GNSS RO in the Asian sector. The feasibility of utilising the RO <b>S</b> 4 <b>index</b> as a proxy for the level of amplitude scintillation measured on the ground is also explored and discussed in the context of space weather-related GNSS scintillation prediction...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Problem: DMFT and OHI- <b>S</b> <b>indices</b> {{are two of}} {{the most}} {{important}} quantitative factors, measuring tooth health and oral hygiene, respectively. Propose: The aim {{of this study was to}} study of correlation between these indices in 12 -year old school girls of Kashan. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study on the correlation between these indices were carried out on 242, twelve year- old school girls in Kashan and the results, have been presented in this paper. Results: The findings were as follows:Average and standard deviation of decayed, missed and filled teeth were (1. 12, 1. 5), (0. 05, 0. 25) and (0. 28, 0. 92), respectively. Average and standard deviation of DMFT was 1. 45 and 1. 73, respectively, with 45. 5 percent of the cases being caries free (DMFT= O). OHI- <b>S</b> <b>index,</b> on the other hand, showed an average of 1. 46 with a standard deviation of 0. 42. Conclusion: The result of the c 2. test, carried out on the measured data, showed no correlation between the DMFT and OHI-S indices...|$|R
