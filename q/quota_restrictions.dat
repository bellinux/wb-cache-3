The practice of discarding is driven by economic and political factors; fish which are discarded are often unmarketable species, individuals which are below minimum landing sizes and catches of species which fishermen {{are not allowed to}} land, for instance due to <b>quota</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Discards form part of the bycatch of a fishing operation, although bycatch includes marketable species caught unintentionally. Discarding can be highly variable in time and space as a consequence of changing economic, sociological, environmental and biological factors.|$|E

In part this may be because of a desire to increase Chinese soft power. The same technology as in Hollywood is available and much postproduction is outsourced to China. Successful indigenous artistic creativity is seen as a problem and may be restricted by factors such as production being aimed at getting government patronage rather than public approval, censorship, and some story lines based on Chinese culture not appealing to foreign audiences. DreamWorks Animation, in a joint venture with Chinese companies, will set up a studio in Shanghai that may eventually get bigger than DreamWorks HQ, in part to avoid to <b>quota</b> <b>restrictions</b> on foreign films with China within a decade having been predicted to become the world's biggest cinema and entertainment market.

Many Jordanian organizations criticized Salah for doing business with Israel and boycotted the purchase of output in Jordan.

He then actively lobbied the Jordanian government to set negotiate {{a free trade agreement}} with the United States on the lines of the United States-Israel Free Trade Area Implementation Act of 1985. Faced with little enthusiasm by the Jordanian government, Salah scrutinized the Presidential Proclamation (No. 6955) {{that was part of the}} Palestinian agreement signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in 1993.

In today’s volatile and homogenous economy of Iceland, fisheries is one of its main export industries, together with power-intensive manufacturing and tourism.  Consequently, movements in fish prices {{have a significant effect on}} the economy as a whole, making the small nation of Iceland vulnerable to fish price volatility.  In this study, we investigate market price uncertainty of exported whitefish in Iceland. Among whitefish, cod is the most important fish species for the Icelandic fisheres, with haddock and pollack following. We model the price volatility for a set of whitefish speiees and establish empirically that price volatility is stable or in a downward trend. Contributing factors such as the food price trends and trends in world whitefish markets are discussed. In addition, we account for other contributing factors to volatility such as the financial crisis, exchange rates, <b>quota</b> <b>restriction</b> and policy implications...|$|R

40|$|If {{one takes}} the {{pair-wise}} definition of equivalence, that a quota will {{give rise to}} an implicit tariff rate which, if alternatively set as a tariff, will generate {{the same level of}} imports as the quota, it is unambiguously clear that equivalence breaks down when there is monopoly import under both tariff and quota. An explicit tariff will not lead to an import level which, if set alternatively as a quota, will generate an implicit tariff equal to the explicit tariff; nor will a quota lead to an implicit tariff which, if set alternatively as an explicit tariff, will generate the same level of imports. In the case when foreign supply is monopolistic, the implicit tariff rate is zero under the quota but setting the actual tariff rate at zero and removing the <b>quota</b> <b>restriction</b> will not yield the same level of imports and domestic production; the truly equivalent tariff rate is higher.

40|$|Management {{objectives}} of the European Union for North Sea fish stocks are shifting towards considering both biological sustainability and economic benefits. As part of multiannual management plans, an adjustment <b>restriction</b> on fish <b>quota</b> has been introduced. Its objective is to obtain an efficient fish stock and to reduce overcapacity for the fishing industry. We develop and apply a bi-level stochastic dynamic programming model to study {{the effect of a}} <b>quota</b> adjustment <b>restriction</b> on the net present value of resource rents, overcapacity and fish stock, when the system is recovering from a downward environmental shock. At level one, a policy maker sets the quota, considering fishermen behavior, stochastic fish stock dynamics, capital stock dynamics and a <b>quota</b> adjustment <b>restriction.</b> At level two, fishermen harvest myopically and make long-term investment decisions, assuming that fish stock and quota do not change over time. The two levels are linked by the quota, which is optimized by the policy maker at level one and becomes a restriction for myopic harvest and long-term investment decisions of fishermen at level two. Our analysis suggests that in the long run, overcapacity can be reduced by 54 % at modest costs, namely at a 1 % reduction in the net present value of resource rents. Long and short run sustainability of the fish stock is not affected. </p...|$|R
