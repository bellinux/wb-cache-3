40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{some results}} of a thesis, where the objective was to show how far a biomass quantity, equal to the annual potential produced within the Swedish borders, could reach to cover the present energy needs inSwedenwith respect to ecological circumstances. Three scenarios were studied where the available biomass was converted to different energy carriers; heat, electricity and vehicle fuel. Two levels of biomass supply were studied for each scenario: 1) potential biomass <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> energy conversion received from forestry, non-forest land, forest industry and municipality; 2) the same quantities as in case 1 plus the potential biomass <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> energy conversion received from agriculture. It was indicated {{that it may be}} possible to produce as much as 209. 4 PJ (58. 2 TWh) of electricity via gasification of the Swedish potential of biomass assortments <b>available</b> <b>for</b> energy conversion (i. e. case 2 of biomass supply). The maximum amounts of hydrogen or methanol which may be produced via gasification of the same biomass amounts excluding black liquor were 241. 5 PJ/year (67. 1 TWh/year) or 197. 2 PJ/year (54. 8 TWh/year) respectively.

25|$|Supply is the {{relation}} between the price of a good and the <b>quantity</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> sale at that price. It may be represented as a table or graph relating price and quantity supplied. Producers, for example business firms, are hypothesized to be profit-maximizers, meaning that they attempt to produce and supply the amount of goods that will bring them the highest profit. Supply is typically represented as a function relating price and quantity, if other factors are unchanged.|$|R

Ten types of biomass were identified and evaluated. The <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> power generation were estimated separately for five U. S. regions and Canada. A method entitled ''competitive resource profile'' was used to rank resources based on economics, utilization, and environmental impact.

A review of current biomass conversion technologies was accomplished, linking technologies to resources...|$|R
50|$|The {{market is}} an {{approach}} that stands {{in contrast to the}} better known Canton Fair, an exhibition held twice a year for manufacturers and buyers to conclude business deals. The difference lies not only in the Yiwu market remaining open year round but due to the small <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> sale. Buyers are easily able to buy one or two cartons of goods, a quantity usually far too small for manufacturers to entertain at the Canton Fair. A downside the Yiwu market is a focus on mass market goods with a lack of selection in niche categories unlike the Canton Fair.|$|R
50|$|Long An Province {{implemented}} price reforms under Chinh's {{leadership in}} 1977. The province {{bought and sold}} sugar and peanuts at prices higher than the official prices, thereby giving farmers an incentive to sell and increasing the <b>quantity</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> sale (farmers were previously unwilling to sell at the low official prices). The surplus purchased was not sold on to the central state to avoid losses (selling at official prices after buying at higher prices), but to a trading company in Ho Chi Minh City that in return provided the province with consumption goods that {{would otherwise have been}} distributed by the central state. This was a violation of rules and the provincial leadership was ordered to discontinue the practice.|$|R

In a molecular dynamics model, visualization of the atom to atom interaction and the processor mappings provides insight into the effectiveness of the communications algorithms. The basic <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> visualization in a model of this type are the number of molecules per unit volume, the mass, and velocity of each molecule. The computational information <b>available</b> <b>for</b> visualization is the atom to atom interaction within each time step, the atom to processor mapping, and the energy rescaling events. We use the CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment) to provide interactive, immersive visualization experiences. 1 Introduction Molecular dynamic simulations are increasingly being used to perform simulations of materials and in the modeling of drug compounds.

The proposed approaches are studied under different operating scenarios characterized by the communication technologies at hand and by the level of information available {{on the state of the}} world. Extensive computational results show how communication and a good level of information represent valuable tools for a decision maker, and provide interesting guidelines for decision makers involved with similar stochastic and dynamic problems...|$|R

This quantitative study examines how state water plans and state hazard mitigation plans address climate change. Plans were coded for the extent to which they address climate change in their calculations regarding future water supply and demand. Ordinal logistic regression models were developed to test the predictive value of independent variables including statewide voting, vulnerability to climate change, and recent experience with droughts and natural disasters. The most significant predictor variable for both state water planning and state hazard mitigation planning was state partisanship.

40|$|Most {{manufacturers}} or retailers must procure items {{or services}} necessary for their businesses, {{in an environment}} that typically includes a number of competing suppliers with varying cost structures, price schemes, and capacities. In this paper, we consider the sourcing problem in which the buyer determines the sources that should be utilized and to what extent, in turn, dictating the total <b>quantity</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> the buyer to sell/utilize, subject to stochastic demand/requirement. Our approach advocates not to determine the quantity to be sourced a priori. We allow for capacitated sources and any cost structure in which fixed costs and quantity discounts are special cases. Some simpler versions of this problem are shown to be NP-hard in literature. By proving that the order of the sources is irrelevant for the optimal solution, we devise a dynamic programming model with pseudo-polynomial complexity to solve the multiple supplier sourcing problem to optimality. We propose two extensions: one limits the number of suppliers, and the other allows multi-period sourcing...|$|R

40|$|Reported {{nanoscale}} {{mechanical properties}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) suggest that their use may enable the fabrication of significantly lighter structures {{for use in}} space applications. To be useful in the fabrication of large structures, however, their attractive nanoscale properties must be retained as they are scaled up to bulk materials and converted into practically useful forms. Advances in CNT production have significantly increased the <b>quantities</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> use in manufacturing processes, but challenges remain with the retention of nanoscale properties in larger assemblies of CNTs. This work summarizes recent progress in producing carbon nanotube composites with tensile properties approaching those of carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites. These advances were achieved in nanocomposites with CNT content of ~ 70 % by weight. The processing methods explored to yield these CNT composite properties will be discussed, as will the characterization and test methods that were developed to {{provide insight into the}} factors that contribute to the enhanced tensile properties.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{procurement}} {{problem of a}} company that needs to purchase a number of products from a set of suppliers to satisfy demand. The suppliers offer total quantity discounts and the company aims at selecting a set of suppliers so to satisfy product demand at minimum purchasing cost. The problem, known as Total Quantity Discount Problem (TQDP), is strongly NP-hard. We study different families of valid inequalities and provide a branch-and-cut approach to solve the capacitated variant of the problem (Capacitated TQDP) where the <b>quantity</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> a product from a supplier is limited. A hybrid algorithm, called HELP (Heuristic Enhancement from LP), is used to provide an initial feasible solution to the exact approach. HELP exploits information provided by the continuous relaxation problem to construct neighborhoods optimally searched through the solution of mixed integer subproblems. A streamlined version of the proposed exact method can optimally solve in a reasonable amount of time instances with up to 100 suppliers and 500 products, and largely outperforms an existing approach available in the literature and CPLEX 12. 2 that frequently runs out of memory before completing the search...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the development of}} international guidelines {{for the design of}} urban water distribution systems in developing countries where intermittent supplies are unavoidable for the foreseeable future, in order to sustain adequate and safe supplies. The development of these guidelines has been funded by the Department for International Development (UK). The available water sources throughout the world are becoming depleted and this has brought into focus the urgent need for planned action to manage water resources effectively for sustainable development. The problem of water scarcity in urban areas of developing countries is of particular concern and as the water <b>quantity</b> <b>available</b> <b>for</b> supply generally is not sufficient {{to meet the demands of}} the population, water conservation measures are employed. One of the most common methods of controlling water demand is the use of intermittent supplies, usually by necessity rather than design. It is evident from literature surveyed that the design of distribution networks operating intermittent supplies has in general been based on the assumption of continuous supply; the concepts and methods used are identical with those used in developed countries. This has resulted in sever...|$|R
