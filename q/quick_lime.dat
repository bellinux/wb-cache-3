40|$|A {{study has}} been carried out to {{investigate}} the suitability of wastepaper sludge ash (WSA) andits potential for partial or full replacement of cement in binder mixtures for deep-mix stabilization of quick clay. The motives for the study have been the anticipated technical, environmental and economic advantages of converting this industrial waste into a valuable construction material. A successful utilization of WSA for soil stabilization would help to check the installation costs {{associated with the use of}} cement, convert WSA into a valuable material, reduce WSA disposal expenses, mitigate environmental pollution and degradation, conserve the cement natural raw materials and, in general, promote the overall sustainability. Technically, the lime-WSA stabilized columns are anticipated to provide a better soil-column interaction than lime-cement columns. Besides, the study intended to study the geomechanical behaviour of quick clay as it changes from a gel-like remoulded liquid mass to a stiff to hard stabilized material, and the effects of cementation on the stress-strain properties of stabilized quick clay. Accordingly, a series of laboratory tests was conducted on the natural materials as well as stabilized quick clay samples. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of WSA were done to establish the conformity of WSA to the international limits on heavy metal contents and its potential for producing cementitious products in the pozzolanic reactions with lime, i. e. qualifying as a binder material. A new method for laboratory preparation of stabilized quick clay samples was devised, which produced samples of acceptable quality for geomechanical testing. The new method is described herein and appraised against the traditional methods. The samples were cured at the temperature of 5 º C for periods of 7, 14, 28, 56, 90 and 180 days before being subjected to different types of laboratory tests. Unconfined compression test was conducted for each of the above mentioned curing periods at a constant strain rate of 1 % per minute. The Atterberg limits were determined for each set of the UCT samples. CIU triaxial compression tests were done for the curing periods of 28, 90 and 180 days at a constant rate of strain of 0. 02 % per minute and a back pressure of about 400 kPa. Incremental loading and CRS oedometer tests were conducted on natural quick clay as well as the stabilized samples for the curing periods of 28, 56 and 90 days. The permeability of stabilized quick clay samples was determined on samples cured for a period of 90 days. UCT and permeability test were also conducted on cored field samples from the actual in-situ columns stabilized with an L-C-WSA binder mixture of mix ratio 25 : 65 : 10. All test results are presented and discussed in this thesis. Lime-WSA and limecement-WSA mixtures gave comparable results to those of the traditional lime-cement mixtures. Based on these results, a constitutive model for stabilized quick clay, called QUICKSTAB, has been formulated. The model takes into account the actual mechanical properties of the stabilized material, such as the cohesion, friction angle and stiffness variations. It also simulates fairly well the stress-strain behaviour, including the cohesion-softening and destructuration phenomena. The results of this study have highlighted the potential for utilizing WSA (in a mixture with lime) as a binder for deep-mix stabilization of <b>quick</b> clay. A <b>lime</b> to WSA mix proportion of 50 : 50 together with a mixture water content of 53 % were found to give the samples of optimum quality, using the devised sample preparation method. A more rapid strength development was realized by partial replacement of cement compared with full replacement. However, incorporation of WSA was found to give higher long-term strength. This could be explained by the relatively slow pozzolanic reaction between WSA and lime. The study recommends installation of trial columns using the results of this study for in-situ testing as well as laboratory tests on cored samples. Also, the study recommends additional tests using other types of loading, such as the direct shear test and the oedometric, extension and cyclic triaxial tests, for a better understanding of the behaviour of stabilized quick clay and data for validation the proposed constitutive model.

5000|$|Higham set out {{to develop}} the route. The route surveys took {{the spring and summer}} of 1837. From his report to the board, one can derive a sense of the state of {{railroad}} technology at the time:To the President and Directors of the Auburn and Rochester Railroad Company:Gentlemen:We shall be able to pass the whole distance, between Auburn and Rochester, without having any grade to exceed twenty-eight feet ascent or descent, per mile, and that without any very deep cuttings on the summits, or high embankments in the valleys. The curves generally will be of a large radius only one being as low as 1000 feet.The work throughout, will be of a plain and easy character, without any heavy rock excavation, or expensive river walling, and with as little perishable structure as perhaps any Road of the same extent in the United States. The superstructure of bridges over the Erie and Seneca canals, the Seneca and Genesee rivers, and some others of minor importance, (the cost of the whole amounting to $19,190) in fact, constituting the only perishable part of the road; and allowing that this will require an expenditure equal to ten per cent per annum, on its cost, to renew and keep it in repair, will amount to $1,919 -- a mere nominal sum for repairs, on so great a work. This permanency in the character of the work, will unquestionably be a consideration of great importance, with those who wish to have their money invested in stocks that will yield them an annual return of profits instead of having it consumed in continual repairs.The grading for that portion of the route which lies between the village of Auburn and Seneca Falls, is through gravel and clay soils; for the remainder of the distance it is generally through loam, sand and gravel, and at three several points some slight lime-rock cuttings, but not more than will furnish the necessary quantity of stone to be used for culverts and bridge abutments, in their vicinity.The character of the masonry, I have estimated to be of plain, rough, hammer dressed stone work, laid in <b>quick</b> <b>lime</b> mortar.The following estimates are made for grading and masonry for a double track -- the first track to be laid immediately, the second track as soon after as requisite. Considering this as one of the links in the great chain of Western Railroads, from Boston to Buffalo and the [...] "far West," [...] the estimates are made on a scale of corresponding character and magnitude to accommodate the business of this great and increasing thoroughfare; and nothing short of a double track will, in my opinion, be adequate for any great period. This is indicated by the fact, that the travel on the Utica and Schenectady Railroad, (which forms another link in this same chain) already requires the second track, to do the business of carrying passengers only; and the fact, that the Tonawanda Railroad, (from Rochester to Batavia) with its present accommodations, having only a single track, is inadequate to the business, although trains of cars run day and night.The subject of wooden superstructure, from its importance, has occupied much attention. From the experience of the present day, there can be no question, that a combination of timber and iron makes, under all circumstances, the preferable road for this climate. The greatest objection to roads of this character, is the large amount of perishable materials used in their construction, as all the different kinds of timber that can be procured in sufficient size and quantities for rails, are not of a durable nature; and from their exposed situation near the surface of the ground they must decay very rapidly. It is found, that in ordinary cases, the common timber of the country will require replacing, on an average, every six or seven years.The following plan for a durable structure, is suggested for your consideration, as a better and cheaper road, than the common modes: The sills to be 4 by 12 inches, well bedded; the top surface four inches below the grade of the road; on the sills are spiked cross-ties of red cedar, three inches thick, of any width not less than 4 inches, and two feet from centre to centre. Between the cross-ties are red cedar blocks, 3 by 6 inches, and one foot long, leaving spaces between the ties and blocks, not exceeding 8 inches. Upon the blocks and ties, and under the rail plates, is a locust ribbon, one inch thick and three inches wide, to raise the iron rail, and clear the flanges of the wheels from the ties. Upon the locust ribbon is placed the rail plate, one inch thick, 2 inches wide on the bottom, and two inches wide on the top. The spikes to pass through the iron plate, the locust ribbon and the ties, into the sills, confining the whole together.The locust and cedar being durable beyond any experience, may be considered, practically, as permanent as the iron. The sills may be of any timber of the country; being bedded in the earth, and remaining moist and free from the action of the atmosphere they will last for a great length of time. The bearing between the ties and blocks being so small, the plate and ribbon will be abundantly strong for any weight that can at any time be brought upon them. Their spikes being one foot from centre to centre, and passing into the ties and sills, would have an equal or greater hold to keep the rail in its place, than in the common wooden rails. It is believed that the increased size of the rail plate will be materially important in giving stability to the road, and will be more than sufficient to compensate for the large wooden rails, in keeping the road firm and in place.The fare rates set by the charter provide some insight into prices of the day. The passenger fare per mile for one person and ordinary baggage was restricted to three cents. The company lobbied the legislature of 1837 to secure an increase to a maximum of four cents. Among the incentives for this move was the difficulty of attracting sufficient capital with the three cent limitation, other railroads having been granted better terms.|$|E

This paper presents the <b>quick</b> <b>lime</b> stabilization design of the subgrade from the bearing strength point of view based on the CBR test results for the <b>quick</b> <b>lime</b> mixed soil. A series of laboratory frost heave tests was also performed to confirm the frost heave control effects of <b>quick</b> <b>lime</b> for the soil samples. A new and simple frost heave test apparatus was developed and used for the present test for convenience to deal large number of test in future. According to the test results, the amount of frost heave decreased with increasing additive amount of lime. The frost heave control effect of <b>quick</b> <b>lime</b> stabilization is presently investigated on-site through measurements of depth distributions of temperature and displacement under the road...|$|E
