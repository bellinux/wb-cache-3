40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of national and state efforts to address school-performance scores as a means of monitoring local school productivity for the 21 st century. School-accountability report cards were introduced in the early 1990 s to provide parents and others with interesting and useful information about schools. However, many of these report cards appeared to provide little comparative information about one school's achievement over another. As a result of this deficiency, the late 1990 s brought a refinement in the report-card process. State legislatures and departments of public education began to design and mandate additional <b>qualifying</b> <b>instruments</b> to measure and compare the effectiveness of local schools. Thus, local school performance scores (SPS) have been instituted in many states as a process to compare the progress of schools toward predetermined benchmarks of effectiveness over time. A number of states have also attached rewards or sanctions to the progress of local schools toward their growth goals. Some states even rank and compare each school's SPS to those of others within the state. (Contains 10 references.) (DFR...|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{instrumentations}} {{designed for}} planetary studies are often open to other interesting applications from ground: {{not only one}} can efficiently carry out detailed calibrations before space data become available, but also the prototypes of the satellite instruments can be successfully employed in different fields ranging from astrophysics to cosmology. Both possibilities are opened by coupling these instruments with ground based telescopes having short focal ratios, like those designed for far infrared studies. These possibilities are particularly amazing in view of the long delay usually present between the launch and the collection of the first scientific data (months in case of Mars Express, years in case of Rosetta). We propose in this article to employ immediately this technology, by coupling the developing model of the Image-Spectrometer VIRTIS-M with the ground telescope MITO.

40|$|None of the {{previous}} aeolian snow transport campaigns in Antarctica meet the requirements in terms of tempo- ral resolution, long-term series and <b>qualified</b> <b>instruments</b> for evaluations of meteorological and climate models including parameterization for aeolian snow transport. Consequently, determining the quantity of snow transported remains a challenge. A field campaign was therefore launched in January 2009, in Adélie Land, Antarctica, to acquire new model-evaluation-oriented observations within the European ICE 2 SEA project, with the logistical support of the French polar Institute (IPEV). The available aeolian snow transport sensors are reviewed and the sensor that best suited our specific needs was chosen: FlowCaptTM acoustic sensors. Three au- tomatic weather stations were deployed with FlowCaptsTM close to the coast. The stations' locations are distinct, ranging from 1 to 100 km inland, one of them with a 7 -m mast with six levels of anemometers and thermohygrometers. The fluid and impact threshold friction velocities recorded were 0. 48 ± 0. 09 m s− 1 and 0. 4 ± 0. 09 m s− 1, respectively, with a high standard deviation of 0. 12 ± 0. 03 m s− 1 and 0. 13 ± 0. 03 m s− 1, respectively. The aeolian snow transport frequency in Adélie Land was very high with seasonal variation of trans- port occurring with minima during the austral summer.

Additionally, reference lists of retrieved publications and treatment guidelines were reviewed, and experts were consulted. Inclusion criteria were: depression had to be measured at least twice during the study with <b>qualified</b> <b>instruments</b> and the chronic somatic illness had to be assessed by self-report or by a medical professional. Information on depressive recurrence was extracted and additionally risk ratios of recurrence were calculated. RESULTS: The search generated four articles that fulfilled our inclusion criteria.

40|$|Management {{teams are}} {{frequently}} charged with making informed decisions for valid investments and cost-saving ideas for laboratory instruments. Cliniqa Corporation {{is a research}} and manufacturing company that produces quality controls and calibrators {{for a number of}} in-vitro diagnostic instruments. The semester-in-residence project resulted in an organized investment evaluation procedure for management to consider all the relevant factors before committing to an instrument procurement decision. Purchasing new equipment can extend the capabilities of the company into additional product lines and strategically target desired customers. It was important to establish an expert system to harvest the knowledge of senior management and to potentially improve on the current evaluation techniques. The research methodology included an evaluation of the current instruments in operation to set a baseline on the previous evaluations and to establish a quantitative ranking system. The sensitivity of the factors required the continuous fine-tuning of the analysis tool. The result of the project was a five-step evaluation tool with proof-of-concept pilot testing for the recommendation of instrument investment. The process began with setting constraints based on the needs and requirements that the company can commit to for asset acquisition. Secondly, data was collected for the criteria of: manufacturer, type of analyzer, first year introduced to market, square footage, routine maintenance, assay menu capability, test throughput, ability of being an open channel instrument and continuous runs, requirement for mainline water hookups, and incremental training required for a routine operator. Then, quantitative ranking values (1 - 10) were applied and compared against the constraints. Third was to calculate the total cost of ownership for <b>qualified</b> <b>instruments.</b> The fourth step was to consider the qualitative factors of: instrument usability, upholding company reputation, customer satisfaction, self-imposed analyzers for strategic contractual purposes, and product line expansion. The last step of the tool was to analyze all the factors involved for the recommendation of new instruments. The pilot testing proposed the purchase of a refurbished Roche cobas e 411, Abbott Architect i 1000 sr, or Siemens Advia Centaur CP to meet the company???s objectives of maintaining quality products and boosting overall profitability.

40|$|The Space Shuttle Thermal Protection System (TPS) {{tiles and}} {{blankets}} are waterproofed using DimethylEthoxySilane (DMEX) in the Orbiter Processing Facilities (OPF). DMES has a Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for exposure of personnel to vapor concentration in air of 0. 5 ppm. The OPF high bay cannot be opened for normal work after a waterproofing operation until the DMES concentration is verified by measurement to be below the TLV. On several occasions the high bay has been kept closed {{for up to}} 8 hours following waterproofing operations due to high DMES measurements. In addition, the Miran 203 and Miran 1 BX infrared analyzers calibrated at different wavelengths gave different readings under the same conditions. There was {{reason to believe that}} some of the high DMES concentration readings were caused by interference form water and ethanol vapors. The Toxic Vapor Detection Laboratory (TVDL) was asked to test the existing DMES instruments and identify the best <b>qualified</b> <b>instrument.</b> In addition the TVDL was requested to develop instrumentation to ensure the OPF high bay could be opened safely as soon as possible after a waterproofing operation. A Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer instrument developed for an earlier project was reprogrammed to measure DMES vapor along with ethanol, water, and several common solvent vapors. The FTIR was then used to perform a series of laboratory and field tests to evaluate the performance of the single wavelength IR instruments in use. The results demonstrated that the single wavelength IR instruments did respond to ethanol and water vapors, more or less depending on the analytical IR wavelength selected. The FTIR was able to separate the responses to DMES, water and ethanol, and give consistent readings for the DMES vapor concentration. The FTIR was then deployed to the OPF to monitor real waterproofing operations. The FTIR was also used to measure the time for DMES to evaporate from TPS tile under a range of humidity conditions in controlled laboratory tests. The combination of laboratory and field tests with the FTIR instrument demonstrated superior sensitivity, ability to reject interference from water and ethanol vapors, ruggedness to be transported from the lab to the OPF and set up without special procedures or degradation of performance. The multiple component vapor analysis algorithm was developed at KSC and incorporates automatic baseline correction and shape fitting of the spectra. The analysis for DMES, TetraMethylDiSiloxane (TMDS), ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and baseline parameters uses 161 points per sample at 4 cm(exp - 1) resolution, and processes an eight scan sample every ten seconds. The standard deviation of the measurements is 0. 013 ppm and the upper linear limit is 125 ppm DMES. Based on successful demonstration of capabilities we produced three mobile instrument carts to be used in each OPF to support future waterproofing operations.
