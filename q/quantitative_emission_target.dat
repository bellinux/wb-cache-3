40|$|Summary: The {{efficiency}} of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) can be seriously hampered because both investors and hosts of CDM projects will seek to achieve maximum emission reduction. To avoid overstatement of emission reduction, it becomes necessary to define the emission that would have occurred without the project [...] the “baseline. “ This chapter describes several possible kinds of baselines and the problems posed by each. Country-wide baselines offer the possibility of quantifying indirect effects through aggregation, but this must be balanced against {{the uncertainty of the}} assumptions required in an aggregate baseline. Sectoral baselines are as problematic as sector boundaries are arbitrary. Thus, project-specific baselines with sectoral elements are recommended as a basis for the CDM. Introduction to the CDM Greenhouse gases affect the atmosphere on a global level [...] the location of the emitter is not relevant. International climate policymakers, however, face the dilemma that only OECD and Eastern European countries have committed themselves to <b>quantitative</b> <b>emission</b> <b>targets</b> in the Kyoto Protocol, whereas the developing countries, with prevailin...|$|R
40|$|The US has {{repeatedly}} criticized {{the lack of}} "meaningful participation" of developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol. I discuss the course of negotiations on developing country participation between the conferences at Kyoto in 1997 and Marrakech in 2001. The reluctance of developing countries to enter into discussions on <b>quantitative</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>targets</b> {{can be explained by}} the principle of "common, but differentiated responsibilities" enshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the fact that both per capita cumulative emissions and per capita income are still much lower in developing countries than in the industrialized world. Moreover, the Clean Development Mechanism that generates emissions credits for projects in developing countries clearly has led to a participation of developing countries in greenhouse gas mitigation. However, one major problem for the negotiation strategy of developing countries has been the internal diversity ranging from OPEC countries that actively fight climate policy to the small island states extremely vulnerable to sea level rise. Especially the rapidly industrializing countries China, India, Brazil and Indonesia played a key role, stressing their voluntary activities to reduce energy intensity and subsidies for fossil fuels. Least developed countries were unable to muster a common voice. Thus, it was not possible to leverage resources for adaptation to climate change impacts apart from some voluntary pledges. International climate policy, Kyoto Protocol, developing countries, Environmental Economics and Policy, Q 540, Q 560,...|$|R
40|$|This note {{considers}} {{the treatment of}} risk and uncertainty in the recently established ‘social cost of carbon’ (SCC) for analysis of federal regulations in the United States. It argues that {{the analysis of the}} US Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon did not go far enough into the tail of low-probability, high-impact scenarios, and, via its approach to discounting, it mis-estimated climate risk, possibly hugely. Given the uncertainty about estimating the SCC, the note concludes by arguing that there is in fact much to commend an approach whereby a <b>quantitative,</b> long-term <b>emissions</b> <b>target</b> is chosen, and the price of carbon for regulatory impact analysis is then based on estimates of the marginal cost of abatement to achieve that very target...|$|R
40|$|Russiaâs {{stance on}} climate change action is ambivalent. On the one hand, the country has both signed up to {{relevant}} international treaties and introduced domestic legislation. The Climate Doctrine 2009 and the Climate Action Plan 2011 outline a general framework and measures for addressing climate change by sector, albeit with no <b>quantitative</b> <b>emission</b> reduction <b>targets</b> included, and with much focus on adaptation. Russia has also expressed its intention to develop renewable energy sources; indigenous renewables could provide significant emission reduction, given that their technical potential exceeds the countryâs energy needs by at least 30 times (according to the Krzhizhanovsky Energy Instituteâs estimates). On the other hand, the government continues to support the hydrocarbon industry.

40|$|A new {{climate change}} treaty must plug three gaps: {{the absence of}} <b>emission</b> <b>targets</b> {{extending}} far into the future, the absence of participation by the United States, China, and other developing countries, {{and the absence of}} reason to expect compliance. To be politically acceptable, it must obey certain constraints regarding country-by-country economic costs. We offer a framework to assign <b>quantitative</b> <b>emission</b> allocations, across countries, one budget period at a time. The two-part plan: (i) China and other developing countries accept targets at BAU in the coming budget period, the same period in which the US first agrees to cuts below BAU; (ii) all countries are asked in the future to make further cuts in accordance with a formula which sums a Progressive Reductions Factor, Latecomer Catch-up Factor, and Gradual Equalization Factor. An earlier proposal for specific parameter values in the formulas achieved the environmental goal that CO 2 concentrations plateau at 500 ppm by 2100. It obeyed our political constraints: keeping the economic cost for every country below thresholds of Y= 1 % of income in Present Discounted Value, and X= 5 % of income in the worst period. In this paper we attain a concentration goal of 460 ppm CO 2, but only by loosening political constraints. ...|$|R

40|$|Sweden's current climate policy affects {{domestic}} combustion {{of fossil}} fuels and, thus, produces synergies on the policies aiming at reducing NOx and SO 2 emissions. A matter of climate policy recently discussed by the Swedish Government, however, is to adopt a carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>target,</b> which excludes traded CO 2 allowances. Although, this redefined carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>target</b> could be attained at the least costs through emissions trading, it will obstruct the ancillary benefits of reduced SO 2 and NOx emissions arising from the current climate policy.
