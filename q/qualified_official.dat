40|$|U radu se razmatra {{institut}} porezne tajne propisane njemačkim pravom. Riječ je o institutu uređenom u postupovnim propisima koji se tiču javnih davanja. U uvodnom dijelu rada objašnjava se pojam porezne tajne, a zatim se upućuje na osobe koje su dužne čuvati poreznu tajnu i slučajeve kršenja porezne tajne. Izdvojeno se promatraju situacije u kojima zakon dopušta objavu porezne tajne te se završno ističu sankcije za neovlašteno i protuzakonito kršenje tajne. In {{addition to}} the institute of protection of official secret, in procedural regulations pertaining to taxes German law provides, as a lex specialis, {{for the protection of}} the institute of tax secret as a so-called <b>qualified</b> <b>official</b> secret. The importance given to this institute in German law is evident in the fact that it has a constitutional origin - it is based on the constitutionally protected personal right and the right to informational self-determination. The purpose of this institute is not only to protect taxpayers, but also the interests of financial authorities. It is a correlation of sorts: a taxpayer is ready to provide information necessary for the taxation procedure if he or she is certain that the information will not be publicized. The obligation to keep a tax secret applies to a broad range of civil servants, but also to a specific group of persons who are not in civil service, but are employed by the authorities or carry out tasks at their request. The broad inclusion of bearers of a tax secret also guarantees a broad protection of other (tax relevant) circumstances and conditions, i. e. business secrets. It pertains both to the prohibition of publicizing confidential information and to protected use of such information. However, in spite of the high level of legal protection provided for the institute of tax secret, which is evident in the possibility of criminal prosecution of persons who disclose a tax secret, legislation allows for the possibility of publicizing tax secrets under certain circumstances. These mostly pertain to clearly specified situations, with the possible exception of publication in the case of protection of “forced public interests”. It is a relatively abstract concept the application of which can in some cases cause doubt and extensive interpretation to the detriment of the taxpayer. In all the other segments the institute of tax secret indicates a high level of structure, normative specification and clarity in application...|$|E

2500|$|Nineteenth-century {{political}} scientist Max Weber outlined {{the characteristics of}} the bureaucratic state in his [...] "Economy and Society." [...] Weber emphasized the benefits of an even distribution of duties and power, the hiring of <b>qualified</b> <b>officials,</b> a hierarchy of authority and a written set of rules that can be universally learned and followed. The methods by which a state builds infrastructural power mesh perfectly with the establishment of a bureaucracy: literacy allows for a widespread comprehension of the written rules; a standard set of measurements and efficient systems of transportation and communication allow for greater efficiency in the distribution of authority; and a division of labor ensures that <b>qualified</b> <b>officials</b> in each field can take full advantage of their expertise.|$|R

The greatest good was order. History meant that feeling was now replaced by rational thought, and private considerations by public, accompanied by properties, prohibitions and restraints. In-order to have prohibitions, it is necessary to have executioners, hence officials, and a supreme ruler. Virtuous men are replaced by <b>qualified</b> <b>officials,</b> objectively measured by Fa. The ruler should rely neither on his nor his officials' deliberations, but on the clarification of Fa. Everything should be done by Fa, whose transparent system of standards will prevent any opportunities for corruption or abuse.|$|R

5000|$|Another major {{difference}} of the 107% rule in Super GT {{is that there}} is a protection system called [...] "seeded teams", which is awarded to each class's team which participated in all races and finished within top 12 in the previous season. [...] "Seeded teams", provided they meet other entrance requirements, are allowed to participate in the race even when they have not met the <b>qualifying</b> time in <b>official</b> <b>qualifying</b> sessions. The right will be forfeited when the team switches class or withdraws from the series, the void caused by this will not be filled by other teams.|$|R
50|$|In Super GT series, a {{slightly}} different 107% rule is being used. The base time was being calculated by averaging time of top three vehicles in their class rather than by taking pole position time. All drivers in the non-seeded team must finish within this {{time in order to}} qualify for the race. However, teams which could not <b>qualify</b> in <b>official</b> <b>qualifying</b> sessions, may still be allowed to retry in following day's practice session, providing reasons such as accidents. In this case, the 107% of top three cars in practice session's will be used instead, in return, they will start {{at the back of the}} grid. In race using knockout format, a separated qualifying will be launched prior the knockout qualifying to decide teams which are allowed to take part in the race.|$|R

5000|$|The NFL {{currently}} employs 17 officiating [...] "crews"—one {{for each}} of the 16 games played, plus one extra. The league wanted to hire three additional crews, bringing the total to 20 crews. The league claimed this would improve the quality of officiating, since they would have a larger pool of <b>qualified</b> <b>officials</b> to choose from, rewarding the best performing crews, and giving them more flexibility to [...] "sideline" [...] or [...] "bench" [...] poor performing ones. The union indicated that they believed the NFL was using the issue to distract from the core issues in the negotiations, {{due to the fact that}} the proposition was introduced so late in the negotiating process, and because a provision for adding officials already existed in the previous CBA. However, referees felt that making it easier to [...] "bench" [...] them undermined their job security, and since officials are paid based on the number of games worked, increasing the number of officials would invariably reduce the number of games worked per official, thereby reducing each official's average pay for a full season.|$|R
5000|$|There was not {{a referee}} until the 1881 match, when Mr H. H. Taylor officiated. Prior to this each game had two umpires, one from each university. The record number of {{appearances}} is held by former RFU secretary Rowland Hill along with Welshman Gwynne Walters both with seven games. [...] Other notable International referees who have controlled this fixture are Englishmen G. H. Harnett (6) Cyril Gadney (6) and H.L. Ashmore (5), along with Welshmen Albert Freethy (6) and Clive Norling (5). Up until {{the start of the}} professional era, one of the unique aspects of the Varsity game was that the referee {{was not a}}ppointed by the RFU but agreed upon and invited by the two captains. This tradition ended after the 1997-98 season, along with that of the previous year's captains returning to act as touch judges (a continuation of the original custom of each university appointing an umpire), when the RFU Referees' committee decided that touch judges could only be <b>qualified</b> <b>officials</b> and that the RFU should appoint the referee. Now there is also a television match official.|$|R
