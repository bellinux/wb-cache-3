5|$|Due to the {{prolonged}} development {{period of the}} film, in 2010, DC Entertainment shifted focus onto developing a television series adaptation. Film director James Mangold pitched a series concept to cable channel HBO, whilst consulting with Gaiman himself on an unofficial basis, but this proved to be unsuccessful. It was reported in September 2010 that Warner Bros. Television was licensing the rights to produce a TV series, and that Supernatural creator Eric Kripke was their preferred candidate to adapt the saga. In March 2011, it was announced via Neil Gaiman's web blog that while he and DC liked Eric Kripke and his approach, it didn't feel <b>quite</b> <b>right.</b> The author hoped to launch the series in another form but plans for a television adaptation are on hold as production moves forward on the film. As the film adaptation of Morpheus' story was being planned, DC and Fox discussed in September about a possible TV series based on the Sandman character Lucifer.|$|E
5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|If I were to {{say that}} the {{so-called}} philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be <b>quite</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
25|$|That Susan was Kane's {{wife and}} Marion was Hearst's {{mistress}} {{is a difference}} more important than might be guessed in today's changed climate of opinion. The wife was a puppet and a prisoner; the mistress was never less than a princess. Hearst built more than one castle, and Marion was the hostess in all of them: they were pleasure domes indeed, and the Beautiful People of the day fought for invitations. Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and Susan was <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, {{and she was the}} precious treasure of his heart for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life. Theirs is truly a love story. Love is not the subject of Citizen Kane.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, several {{students}} are murdered, and thanks to Hajime's investigative skills, their killers are found out and executed. However, Hajime begins to realize something isn't <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> with the world, and discovers a terrible truth. He and his fellow students are in fact the surviving members of Ultimate Despair, a group led by the first game's antagonist, Junko Enoshima, whose sole purpose was to spread despair to the world. They managed to instigate a worldwide rebellion that caused society to collapse. However, one group, called the Future Foundation, has been attempting to undo the damage Ultimate Despair caused. They captured the surviving members, but instead of executing them, decided to try and rehabilitate them by erasing their memories and putting them in a virtual reality program.|$|E

25|$|Jan van Mill has {{described}} βN as a 'three headed monster' — the three heads being a smiling and friendly head (the behaviour {{under the assumption}} of the continuum hypothesis), the ugly head of independence which constantly tries to confuse you (determining what behaviour is possible in different models of set theory), and the third head is the smallest of all (what you can prove about it in ZFC). It has relatively recently been observed that this characterisation isn't <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> - there {{is in fact a}} fourth head of βN, in which forcing axioms and Ramsey type axioms give properties of βN almost diametrically opposed to those under the continuum hypothesis, giving very few maps from N* indeed. Examples of these axioms include the combination of Martin's axiom and the Open colouring axiom which, for example, prove that (N*)2 ≠ N*, while the continuum hypothesis implies the opposite.|$|E
25|$|A famous {{example of}} a {{revolution}} in scientific thought is the Copernican Revolution. In Ptolemy's school of thought, cycles and epicycles (with some additional concepts) were used for modeling {{the movements of the}} planets in a cosmos that had a stationary Earth at its center. As accuracy of celestial observations increased, complexity of the Ptolemaic cyclical and epicyclical mechanisms had to increase to maintain the calculated planetary positions close to the observed positions. Copernicus proposed a cosmology in which the Sun was at the center and the Earth was one of the planets revolving around it. For modeling the planetary motions, Copernicus used the tools he was familiar with, namely the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic toolbox. Yet Copernicus' model needed more cycles and epicycles than existed in the then-current Ptolemaic model, and {{due to a lack of}} accuracy in calculations, his model did not appear to provide more accurate predictions than the Ptolemy model. Copernicus' contemporaries rejected his cosmology, and Kuhn asserts that they were <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> to do so: Copernicus' cosmology lacked credibility.|$|E
500|$|From 1903 to 1906 Walpole studied {{history at}} Emmanuel College, Cambridge. While there {{he had his}} first work published, the {{critical}} essay [...] "Two Meredithian Heroes", which was printed in the college magazine in autumn 1905. As an undergraduate he met and fell {{under the spell of}} A. C. Benson, formerly a greatly loved master at Eton, and by this time a don at Magdalene College. Walpole's religious beliefs, hitherto an unquestioned part of his life, were fading, and Benson helped him through that personal crisis. Walpole was also attempting to cope with his homosexual feelings, which for a while focused on Benson, who recorded in his diary in 1906 an unexpected outburst by his young admirer: [...] "e broke out rather eagerly into protestations – He cared for me more than anyone in the world. I could not believe it... It is extraordinarily touching.... It is <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> that he should believe all this passionately; it is <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> that I should know that it will not last... I tried to say this as tenderly as I could..." ...|$|E

500|$|Describing {{the real}} Seymour Skinner, Keeler remarked, [...] "It {{would have been}} easy to make him a really horrible, nasty, dislikeable guy, but we didn't do that. We made him just not <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> not quite Skinner, and a little bit off." [...] Bill Oakley said the idea behind the {{character}} was that he [...] "just lacked pizzazz". The producers selected Martin Sheen to voice the character because they admired his performance in Apocalypse Now and felt his voice would be appropriate for a Vietnam veteran.|$|E
500|$|In a {{conversation}} with John Barron of the New York Times in 2004, Lockhart was asked what Lassie was all about and why it remains something of a magical memory {{for those who were}} children in the 1950s and 1960s. She responded, [...] "This was a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial. Often, if the scene had gone well, and maybe we hadn't gotten the dialogue <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> if the dog was right, they'd print it." ...|$|E

I have spent the best part of my life trying to put these thoughts into the stream that makes decisions, and I've been spectacularly unsuccessful. That, I think, is a reflection on my ability in the climate of the time, not on the value of the thoughts." ...|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, then Prime Minister John Key {{revealed}} that he had asked McCaw {{about the possibility of}} a knighthood in the 2012 New Year Honours, but that McCaw had turned it down. According to Key, [...] "He made the call that he's still in his playing career and it didn't feel <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> for him, that day where he's no longer on the pitch may be the right time for him." [...] No formal offer was ultimately made. McCaw was appointed a member of New Zealand's highest honour, the Order of New Zealand, in the 2016 New Year Honours. The honour surpassed the knighthood he had previously turned down prior to his retirement because only 20 living New Zealanders can gain membership at any one time.|$|E
500|$|Heavy tanks {{have high}} attack and defense with {{moderate}} speed and low range. Missile tanks have moderate attack and defense with moderate range and low speed. [...] G.E.V.s ("ground effect vehicles"—roughly, heavily armored hovercraft) have very high speed (moving twice per turn), low attack, low range, and moderate defense. [...] Howitzers have very high attack and range but are easily destroyed (once an attacker {{has managed to}} get close enough), immobile, and expensive. However, according to the game's designer, this balanced mix of units was not <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> in the first edition; the second edition sped up heavy tanks, slowed down G.E.V.s, and changed the defender's purchasing from [...] "attack factors" [...] to [...] "armor units" [...] (everything is considered equivalent, except howitzers, which are worth two of anything else).|$|E
500|$|The shot of Dr. Secare {{resurfacing}} out of {{the water}} was created by the visual effects unit. Actor Simon Webb was raised up on a crane under the water, which had been levered so that he could [...] "actually" [...] be raised {{out of the}} bay. According to Goodwin, the timing was not <b>quite</b> <b>right,</b> but that failed shot [...] "worked" [...] on a different level and proved to be a [...] "fascinating shot". The scene had to be re-shot later, however. When filming the episode the production crew did not know that Webb had a phobia towards water. The first test shot of Scully removing the alien fetus doll from liquid nitrogen went right, but under the hot studio lights the model started falling apart, leading the following take to flash the lighting in another direction.|$|E

500|$|Writer Michael Michaelian {{originally}} {{pitched a}} story idea based on andropause, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "male menopause". He wrote a treatment and first draft script involving reverse aging. D. C. Fontana later explained that the terrorist MacGuffin (an ambiguous but central plot point) was not <b>quite</b> <b>right.</b> Fontana was brought in to overhaul the ending, and explained that a [...] "lot of what I put in at the end was also in Michael's story and drafts, but approached with a different emphasis". One significant alteration she made was to change the plot from involving actual terrorists to a trap that the crew must defuse. The original ending also had the two opposing parties on the planet sit down for peace talks with Jameson surviving the effects of the de-aging drugs. He would have been reduced in age to fourteen and could no longer remember his wife.|$|E
500|$|The script {{comments}} cheekily on the Beatles' fame. For instance, at {{one point}} a fan, played by Anna Quayle, apparently recognises John Lennon, though she does not actually mention Lennon's name, saying only [...] "you are...". He demurs, saying his face is not <b>quite</b> <b>right</b> for [...] "him", initiating a surreal dialogue ending with the fan agreeing that Lennon doesn't [...] "look like him at all", and Lennon saying to himself that [...] "she looks more like him than I do". Other dialogue is derived from actual interviews with the Beatles. When Ringo is asked if he's a mod or a rocker, he replies: [...] "Uh, no, I'm a mocker", a line derived from a joke he made on the TV show Ready Steady Go!. The frequent reference to McCartney's grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell) as a [...] "clean old man" [...] sets up a contrast with the stock description of Brambell's character, Albert Steptoe in Steptoe and Son, as a [...] "dirty old man".|$|E

[...] Billboard reviewer Ken Tucker stated that it [...] "is an airy and flowing song about family on which father and daughter's voices blend nicely". Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter called [...] "Butterfly Fly Away" [...] a [...] "tender Glen Ballard/Alan Silvestri ballad". The song was included {{on the short list}} for Best Original Song at the 82nd Academy Awards, but did not achieve a nomination.|$|E
