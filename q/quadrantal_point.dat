A <b>quadrantal</b> <b>point</b> infilling strategy is developed to generate point and combine clouds of points automatically. A point-moving algorithm is introduced to ensure the clouds of points following the movements of body boundaries. A dual time method for solving the two-dimensional Euler equations in Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is presented. Dual time method allows the real-time step to be chosen on the basis of accuracy rather than stability. It also permits the acceleration techniques, which are commonly used to speed up steady flow calculations, to be used when marching the equations in pseudo time. The spatial derivatives, which are used to estimating the inviscid flux, are directly approximated by using local least-squares curve method. An explicit multistage Runge-Kutta algorithm is used to advance the flow equations in pseudo time. In order to accelerate the solution to convergence, local time stepping technique and residual averaging are employed. The results of NACA 0012 airfoil in transonic steady flow are presented to verify the accuracy of the present spatial discretization method. Finally, two AGARD standard test cases in which NACA 0012 airfoil and NACA 64 A 010 airfoil oscillate in transonic flow are simulated. The computational results are compared with the experimental data to demonstrate the validity and practicality of the presented method...|$|E

Quadrantal error does not affect signals from straight ahead or behind, nor on the wingtips. The further from these cardinal points and the closer to the <b>quadrantal</b> <b>points</b> (i.e. 45째, 135째, 225째 and 315째 from the nose) the greater the effect, but quadrantal error is normally much less than dip error, which is always present when the aircraft is banked.|$|R
