Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast <b>quantum</b> <b>computer,</b> and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E

25|$|Quantum-enhanced machine {{learning}} refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in {{machine learning}}, thereby improving a classical machine learning method. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a <b>quantum</b> <b>computer,</b> {{so as to}} make it accessible for quantum information processing. After this, quantum information processing routines can be applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system.

25|$|Quantum {{annealing}} is not {{the only}} technology for sampling. In a prepare and measure scenario, a universal <b>quantum</b> <b>computer</b> prepares a thermal state, which is then sampled by measurements. This can reduce the time required to train a deep restricted Boltzmann machine, and provide a richer and more comprehensive framework for deep learning than classical computing. The same quantum methods also permit efficient training of full Boltzmann machines and multi-layer, fully connected models and do not have well-known classical counterparts. Relying on an efficient thermal state preparation protocol starting from an arbitrary state, quantum-enhanced Markov logic networks exploit the symmetries and the locality structure of the probabilistic graphical model generated by a first-order logic template. This provides an exponential reduction in computational complexity in probabilistic inference, and, while the protocol relies on a universal <b>quantum</b> <b>computer,</b> under mild assumptions it can be embedded on contemporary quantum annealing hardware.|$|E

In particular the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data.

Chapters 2, 3 and 4, describe Brownian motion from three different perspectives. The next four chapters are devoted {{to the subject of}} <b>quantum</b> <b>computers,</b> which are the signal of a new era of technology and science combined together. In the first chapter I present to a reader the two topics of my problem {{in lieu of}} thesis. In the second chapter I explain the idea of Brownian motion, its interpretation as a stochastic process and I find its distribution function. The next chapter illustrates the probabilistic picture of Brownian motion, where the statistical averages over trajectories are related to the probability distribution function. Chapter 4 shows how to derive the Langevin equation, introduced in chapter 1, using a Hamiltonian picture of a bath with infinite number of harmonic oscillators. The chapter 5 explains how the idea of <b>quantum</b> <b>computers</b> was developed and how step-by-step all the puzzles for the field of <b>quantum</b> <b>computers</b> were created. The next chapter, chapter 6, discus the basic quantum unit of information namely, the so called qubit and its properties. Chapter 7 is devoted to quantum logic gates, which are important for conducting logic operation in <b>quantum</b> <b>computers.</b> This chapter explains how they were developed and how they are different from classical ones. Chapter 8 is about the quantum algorithm, Shor's algorithm. Quantum algorithm in <b>quantum</b> <b>computers</b> enables one to solve problems that are hard to solve on digital computers.
