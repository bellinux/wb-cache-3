25|$|Side {{corridor}} stock {{such as the}} J6 thirds and F2 composites had {{doors with}} adjacent quarter lights to all compartments and ventilation was by droplights set into the doors. G1 tea cars had a small dining saloon and kitchen set into {{one end of a}} composite coach. Although there were no external doors to the dining saloon, the windows retained the droplight and <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> arrangement.|$|E
25|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The front window was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E
6000|$|What {{makes your}} heart so beat? [...] Some one should stay at her side. [...] When beauty is {{complete}} [...] Her own thought will have died [...] And danger not be diminished; [...] Dimmed at three <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> [...] When moon's round is finished [...] The stars {{are out of}} sight.|$|E
50|$|In 1993 the <b>light</b> <b>quarters</b> and <b>light</b> were {{completely}} renovated.|$|R
5000|$|... 1977: The R5 GTL got opening rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and the R5 L got the new 845 cc engine.|$|R
50|$|The 1954 Morris Cowley was a four-cylinder midsize car {{produced}} from 1954 to 1959. It {{was essentially a}} budget version of the Morris Oxford series III with less chrome, no heater, fixed front <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and a simplified dashboard.|$|R
50|$|The 1970 MK III had larger rear <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century, A. Hays Town, an architect, {{redesigned}} {{the original}} French <b>Quarter</b> <b>light</b> {{from the early}} 17th century's European architecture. Andrew John Bevolo was commissioned to build the light. It officially became a company in 1945.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1952 the Paris Motor Show welcomed a {{modified}} 203 which now featured hinged <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows [...] {{on the front}} ends of the front doors and an enlarged rear window on the saloon versions. [...] This upgrade also saw {{the removal of the}} speedometer from the centre of the dashboard to a position directly ahead of the driver.|$|E
5000|$|September 1974: R5 LS renamed R5 TS. The TS had all {{features}} of the previous LS, plus new front seats with integrated head restraints, black bumpers, illuminated heater panel, front spoiler, clock, opening rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and reversing lights.|$|R
50|$|Rapid Cabriolet (1984 - 1990) - Developed {{from the}} Rapid Coupe at Ludgate Design Developments in Kent {{initially}} in Standard form only, {{which included a}} removable full-sized hood and a central rollover T-bar. The rarer Lux model available from 1987 had wind down rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights.</b> At least 334 cabriolets were sold in Britain.|$|R
5000|$|An {{additional}} 4 {{inches of}} wheelbase provided greater rear legroom, equaling {{that of the}} long wheelbase model Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud also introduced that year. [...] Removable rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> allowed an unobstructed view in and out from the front vent window on back, much valued in the model's popular role as a [...] "parade car".|$|R
50|$|Side {{corridor}} stock {{such as the}} J6 thirds and F2 composites had {{doors with}} adjacent quarter lights to all compartments and ventilation was by droplights set into the doors. G1 tea cars had a small dining saloon and kitchen set into {{one end of a}} composite coach. Although there were no external doors to the dining saloon, the windows retained the droplight and <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|Quarter {{glass or}} <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> on {{automobiles}} and closed carriages {{may be a}} side window {{in the front door}} or located {{on each side of the}} car just forward of the rear window of the vehicle. Only some cars have them. In some cases the fixed quarter glass may set in the corner or [...] "C-pillar" [...] of the vehicle. Quarter glass is also sometimes called a valence window.|$|E
50|$|As Fiat and SEAT's {{licensing}} agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing {{with the old}} pushrod Fiat-based engines, <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.|$|E
50|$|The 3000 sports {{convertible}} Mark II {{was launched}} {{at the end}} of August 1962. It was a true convertible with almost saloon car comfort, a new wrap-around windscreen, wind-up side windows, swivelling <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and a quick-action folding roof. Twin SU HS6 carburettors replaced the triple SUs. Austin-Healey claimed it could exceed 115 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Comparisons {{between the}} Victor and the broadly similar RÃ¼sselsheim built Opel Rekord Series D were inevitable. An {{important}} {{difference from the}} back seat involved the rear doors. The Opel's door incorporated rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and windows that wound fully down into the door whereas Vauxhall's designers preferred the [...] "cleaner uncluttered look" [...] arising from their elimination of rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights.</b> The fact that back seat passengers could only open their windows down to approximately a third of their depth before further opening was blocked by the presence of the wheel arches was held out as a safety feature to complement the fitting of child-proof locks, given that back-seat passengers would no doubt include small children. Despite the absence of shared body panels anywhere that they could be seen, detailed investigation disclosed that minor assemblies such as the door locks and the wiper mechanisms were shared with the Opel Rekord D.|$|R
2500|$|Top {{speed was}} [...] From a {{mechanical}} standpoint the Junior {{differed from the}} 1750 only in engine displacement and output, while inside it lacked some features of the pricier model: namely opening <b>quarter</b> <b>lights,</b> centre console, and the three-spoke wood rimmed steering wheel, replaced by a two-spoke plastic rimmed one. From outside the Junior version could be recognised by its black-coloured lower front bumper and absence of plastic headlamp fairings.|$|R
50|$|The four-door saloon {{body was}} made {{in-house}} by Morris {{and had the}} traditional MG grille flanked by two large chromium-plated headlights. Unlike the SA the front doors did not have separate <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows. The spare wheel was carried on the left front wing, with a second spare {{on the other side}} as an option. Inside there were individual seats in front and a bench seat at the rear, all with leather covering. A fitted radio was an option.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious {{radiator}} grill and bumper bar changes, {{there were other}} less obvious changes that {{took place during the}} Midgets production run. The first cars assembled in 1967 were wired positive earth, had thinly cast engine blocks requiring nitrated crank shafts to provide extra rigidity. Later engines blocks were cast with thicker walls. Other changes were to negative earth wiring and alternator, chunckier boot lock handle, internal door latch handles, and <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> window handles. Plastic window winder and internal door pull handles. Crossflow radiators running at higher pressures. The differential ratio was also changed to 3.9 some time during 1970.|$|E
50|$|The A1 was a fully enclosed, 4-door sedan, {{with normal}} front doors and forward-opening suicide-style rear doors. It was heavily {{based on the}} Chrysler built DeSoto Airflow; Toyoda bought an Airflow and {{disassembled}} it the year before producing the A1. The front window was {{a single piece of}} flat glass with a top-mounted wiper on the driver's side. There were 3 windows per side, one for the front door (without a <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> window), one for the rear door and one behind the rear door. A spare tyre was mounted on the nearly vertical boot lid.|$|E
50|$|The Series III was {{produced}} in open and removable hardtop versions. On the hardtop version the top could be removed and the soft-top was stored behind the small rear seat; also the 1592 cc engine was less powerful. To provide more room in the boot, twin fuel tanks in the rear wings were fitted. <b>Quarter</b> <b>lights</b> were fitted to the windows. Between 1963 and 1964, 5863 were made.|$|R
50|$|With large {{panoramic}} {{windows and}} <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> in the roof, {{the area of}} glass per AK car is 52 m2. To one side of each seat is a jack for headphones for the on-board commentary, {{and in front of}} each seat is a flip-down tray table. Seats facing each other in groups of four are positioned around a fixed table. Power points are provided at each seat area. Carry-on baggage can be stored overhead.|$|R
60|$|Here Bes took {{dust and}} threw it into the air that we might learn from which <b>quarter</b> the <b>light</b> wind blew.|$|R
50|$|A unique {{aspect of}} Rip's {{is the fact}} there is no {{tangible}} menu. The menu is given {{by word of mouth}} to the customers as they are waiting in line. This particular type of menu makes the ordering process simple; Bill Rounds, a current co-owner, asks each customer waiting in line if he or she would like to order a <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> or a quarter dark. Depending on the day, he could also add chicken strips or fish to this question. The informal nature of the ordering process distinguishes Rip's from other taverns. Once seated, customers receive crispys and pickles, Rip's signature appetizers. Crispys are the spare batter pieces dropped from the chicken during the frying process.|$|E
50|$|Units {{had begun}} being {{withdrawn}} from 1950. From 1978, new Class 507 units began to {{arrive on the}} network and the 502s, which by now were considered life-expired, were gradually withdrawn. The final regular passenger service was on 1 September 1980, with a farewell tour five days later. The last set was withdrawn in November 1980. Two DMBS cars were reinstated in 1981 for departmental duties, and allocated to Hall Road. The departmental units were renumbered from M28354 and M28357 to ADB977017 and ADB977018, respectively, and kept at Kirkdale until 1986. Compared to the similar 503s on the Wirral lines, the Southport 502s appeared run-down and distinctly down-at-heel {{by the end of}} their life, with dented panels and peeling paint, even some of the opening <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows were replaced by plain glass, whereas the Wirral units appeared tidy and well-presented to the end. All of the cars, except for one two-car set, were scrapped.|$|E
5000|$|The new car was {{introduced}} in 1966 and called the Triumph GT6. The new body was a sleek fastback design with an opening rear hatch (This gave the GT6 the nickname [...] "Poor man's E-Type".) It was really a 2-seater, but a small extra rear seat could be ordered if required and was large enough for small children. The family resemblance to the Spitfire Mk II was strong, the longer 6-cylinder engine necessitated a new bonnet top with a power bulge and the doors were provided with opening <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows and squared-off glass in the top rear corner. The 6-cylinder engine was tuned to develop [...] at 5000 rpm, and produced 117 lbft Nm of torque at 3000 rpm. The increased power necessitated certain changes to the Spitfire mechanics; the radiator was new and mounted further forward {{in the car and}} the gearbox was the stronger unit from the Vitesse, with optional overdrive. Front springs were uprated to cope with the extra weight of the new engine. The overall vehicle weight unladed was 1904 lb. The interior of the GT6 was well equipped; a wooden dashboard housed a full complement of instruments, with carpets and heater included as standard.|$|E
2500|$|Billed {{extensively}} as the [...] "new-line" [...] Minicar, {{the final}} {{evolution of the}} Bond Minicar was still based {{to a large extent}} on the bodyshell of the Mark F. Nevertheless, a revised shape fibreglass roof, new doors, new windscreen with opening <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and bigger wheels largely transformed the cars appearance. However, although the car was similar in layout to the Mark F, almost everything mechanically about the Mark G was different with very few components carried over.|$|R
50|$|The RHD Audi 200 5E and 5T were {{introduced}} into the UK in 1979, only 500 were imported. The 5T (170 PS) was a higher spec Turbo version of the 5E (136 PS injection) and came with many optional extras as standard. The UK version of the 5T had opening <b>quarter</b> <b>lights,</b> electric door mirrors, a sunroof, cruise control and heated seats. All Type 43 200's came with automatic gearboxes, with a five-speed manual available by special order.|$|R

5000|$|In January 1986, the Panda {{received}} a substantial overhaul {{and a series}} of significant mechanical improvements. Most of these changes resulted in the majority of parts being changed and redesigned, making many of the pre-facelift and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible between models. The 652 cc air-cooled 2-cyl engine was replaced by a 769 cc (34 bhp) water-cooled 4-cyl unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999cc (45 bhp, 50 bhp (37 kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new FIRE family of 4-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the [...] "Omega axle", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the Lancia Y10, which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up, presumably to avoid having to redesign the entire 4WD system.Improvements were also made to the interior and the structure. The body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's strong tendency to rust. The rear panel design was also revamped to include flared arches that mirrored those of the front wings, replacing the un-sculpted style seen on earlier models, and the doors {{received a}} slight redesign with the earlier car's <b>quarter</b> <b>light</b> windows being removed and replaced by a full width roll-down window. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors unfortunately retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust. In ascending order of specification and cost, the revised range was as follows: 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4.|$|E
25|$|In {{a bid to}} stem declining sales, a 2-seat economy {{version of}} the Minicar was {{introduced}} in October 1964, the Bond 250 G Tourer. This basically used the saloon car body, but with a larger rear deck incorporating an opening boot lid, a folding hood, new fibreglass bonnet, plain door panels, no chrome side trim and non-opening <b>quarter</b> <b>lights.</b> In standard form it came with the 35A engine, but the side trim and 4T engine were available as an option.|$|R
50|$|A {{big change}} came in December 1936 with the almost {{streamlined}} Cambridge saloon and Conway cabriolet. Compared with the preceding cars the passengers and engine were positioned much further forward, {{the back seat}} now being rather forward of the back axle. There were six side windows like the Sherborne and the <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> were fixed. Again like the Sherborne the forward doors opened rearwards. At the back there was now a compartment large enough to take a trunk {{as well as more}} luggage on the open compartment door when it was let down.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the flag {{is based on the}} British Civil Air Ensign, which is divided into {{quarters}} by a dark blue cross with a white fimbriation. There is a Union Jack in the upper hoist quarter, and the other <b>quarters</b> <b>light</b> blue. When an Australian version was first adopted in 1935, it included the stars from the Australian National Flag in yellow, and with the Southern Cross rotated by roughly 45 degrees, meaning that the smallest star was completely inside the arm of the blue cross. In 1948, the colour of the stars was changed to white.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name was}} also {{applied to a}} small coupe utility of similar layout {{produced}} by Ford in Brazil and exported to countries such as Mexico. It {{is based on the}} 1998 model of the Ford Fiesta. While its front treatment {{is the same as the}} South African-built Fiesta-based Ford Bantam [...] "bakkie" [...] coupe utility, it has a completely different load box. The South African version had the short doors of the five-door hatchback and small <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> in the style of larger extended cab pickups, and the Brazilian version had the three-door's longer doors and no quarter windows.|$|R
50|$|The keeper's <b>quarters</b> and <b>light</b> were a {{combined}} structure, {{similar to the}} Yaquina Bay Light, in Newport, and used the same structure, materials, and optics as Point Fermin Light south of Los Angeles, California.|$|R
