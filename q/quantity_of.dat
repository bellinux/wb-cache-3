5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods in an economy, is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (<b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E

40|$|Physicochemical {{simulation}} (pH, electrolytes and temperature) {{of three}} physiological media {{was carried out}} in order to follow the release of trace elements contained in seven edible clays (mainly kaolinite, illite, muscovite and quartz) collected from the West African countries of Cote d'Ivoire, Guinee and Senegal. These clays are ingested by pregnant women for diverse reasons that are related to their condition. Simulated oral (6. 5 pH 7), stomach (pH approximately 1. 8) and intestinal (pH approximately 8. 3) media were prepared separately in order to compare the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> the trace elements released. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry and spectrophotometry for the evaluation of copper, iron ((Fe(II) and Fe(III)), lead, manganese, nickel and zinc, since some of these elements can palliate deficiency problems and others can induce toxic effects. The <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> the chemical elements released were pH dependent. The lower the pH, the higher the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> copper, Fe(III) and zinc. The <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> Fe(II) were similar at both lower (stomach) and higher (intestinal) pH values. However, the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> manganese, nickel and lead were lower than quantification limits. Heating (110 C) of the clays increased the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> trace elements released and could also participate in the microbiological 'decontamination' of raw materials. Microbiological analysis shows that all samples tested were in compliance with the recommendations of the European Pharmacopoeia. To verify the existence of possible beneficial and hazardous effects on human health, the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> copper, iron and zinc were compared with the recommended allowances for trace elements in France. In addition, the <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> manganese, nickel and lead were compared with the maximum admissible concentrations in drinking water...|$|R
