40|$|Meiosis in the {{tetraploid}} (2 n = 80) {{males of}} Dioscorea alata L. was investigated {{for the first}} time. During metaphase I, the chromosomes were associated mostly in 6 - 8 <b>quadrivalents</b> and the remaining ones as bivalents with no trivalents or univalents. Anaphase I and subsequent stages of meiosis were normal. The observation of <b>quadrivalents</b> in the tetraploids provides cytological evidence for autotetraploidy. The autotetraploid males and females were highly fertile and they produced viable seeds on artificial pollination. Pollination between diploids (2 n = 40) and tetraploids (2 n = 80) were also successful via embryo rescue, producing triploid (2 n = 60) progenies. The discovery of fertile autotetraploids could initiate polyploidy breeding in D. alata by conventional hybridization for the first time. The reduced number of <b>quadrivalents</b> and the high fertility of the autotetraploids {{are thought to be}} the result of partial diploidization of meiosis. The findings also refute the assumption of the allopolyploid origin of D. alata from two putative progenitors. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Meiotic {{chromosome}} pairing in isogenic triploid and tetraploid {{strains of yeast}} {{and the consequences of}} polyploidy on meiotic chromosome segregation are studied. Synaptonemal complex formation at pachytene was found to be different in the triploid and in the tetraploid. In the triploid, triple-synapsis, that is, the connection of three homologues at a given site, is common. It can even extend all the way along the chromosomes. In the tetraploid, homologous chromosomes mostly come in pairs of synapsed bivalents. Multiple synapsis, that is, synapsis of more than two homologues in one and the same region, was virtually absent in the tetraploid. About five <b>quadrivalents</b> per cell occurred due to the switching of pairing partners. From the frequency of pairing partner switches it can be deduced that in most chromosomes synapsis is initiated primarily at one end, occasionally at both ends and rarely at an additional intercalary position. In contrast to a considerably reduced spore viability (~ 40 %) in the triploid, spore viability is only mildly affected in the tetraploid. The good spore viability is presumably due to the low frequency of <b>quadrivalents</b> and to the highly regular 2 : 2 segregation of the few <b>quadrivalents</b> that do occur. Occasionally, however, <b>quadrivalents</b> appear to be subject to 3 : 1 nondisjunction that leads to spore death in the second generation...|$|R
40|$|Inheritance {{patterns}} at four allozyme loci and {{chromosome pairing}} behaviour at diakinesis {{were examined in}} the naturally occurring autotetraploid Heuchera grossulariifolia. Segregation patterns for Tpi, Pgi, Pgm- 2, and Lap deviated significantly from all possible disomic models. All patterns were consistent with tetrasomic inheritance of these marker loci. No chromatid segregation was detected electrophoretically. Meiotic chromosome configurations at diakinesis in 45 cells were compared with a previously published model to test for autopolyploid-like chromosome pairing. Using the observed chiasma frequencies, the frequency of <b>quadrivalents</b> {{was consistent with the}} expectations for an autotetraploid. We suggest that the low frequency of <b>quadrivalents</b> at diakinesis in Heuchera grossulariifolia is due to small chromosome size, which results in a low chiasma frequency.

40|$|Allium porrum L. (cultivated leek) (2 n = 4 x = 32) is {{a fertile}} {{tetraploid}} that forms bivalents with pericentric chiasmata at metaphase I. To investigate {{the basis of}} this unusual behavior for a tetraploid, we describe the karyotype, axial cores, synaptonemal complexes (SCs), and meiotic nodules of A. porrum. The karyotype appears to be autotetraploid. This conclusion is also supported by presynaptic alignment of axial cores in groups of four and partner trades between pairs of SCs. Numerous early nodules are distributed all along axial cores and SCs during zygonema, but they are lost by late zygonema - early pachynema. Late (recombination) nodules (RNs) are present on SCs near kinetochores throughout the remainder of pachynema. This pattern of RNs corresponds to the pattern of pericentric chiasmata. Pachytene <b>quadrivalents</b> usually are resolved into bivalents because partner trades between SC lateral elements rarely occur between RNs on the same segment of SC. Thus, the patterns of crossing-over and partner trades promote balanced disjunction and high fertility in autotetraploid A. porrum. Rare <b>quadrivalents</b> observed at metaphase I must be due to infrequent partner trades between RNs. Polycomplexes, unusual in their number and size, were observed during zygonema.

The sterile triploids were then doubled with colchicine to obtain fertile hexaploid plants. These plants and their open pollinated progeny varied in their chromosome number from 73 to 82 chromosomes, the majority being the expected 78 chromosomes. Chromosome associations included bivalents, trivalents, <b>quadrivalents,</b> and hexavalents. The caducous bract trait varied from being similar to each parent species to intermediate expression. Backcrossed to G. hirsutum, progeny with 61 to 67 chromosomes were obtained with associations including frequent trivalents, <b>quadrivalents,</b> and one hexavalent. The caducous bract trait was not expressed in most plants and only variable in others. Progeny from open pollination or backcrossing these plants gave chromosome numbers closer to the tetraploid parent, with ranges of 56 to 64 chromosomes in open pollinated progeny and 52 to 58 for backcrossed plants. Again, the caducous bract trait was variable, possibly due {{to the influence of}} the A and D genomes of the New World cottons. Tetraploids recovered from the progeny had bivalent pairing and chiasma frequencies similar to G. hirsutum. Further backcrossing is hoped to increase the expression of the caducous bract trait...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{detailed}} {{meiotic analysis}} {{was investigated in}} seven species of Curcuma (Linnaeus, 1753) which can contribute significantly to our understanding about species inter-relationship, speciation and evolution. The species {{were divided into two}} groups viz., Group I having 2 n = 42 (C. comosa Roxburgh, 1810, C. haritha Mangaly &amp; M. Sabu, 1993, C. mangga Valeton &amp; Zijp, 1917, and C. motana Roxburgh, 1800) and Group II with 2 n = 63 (C. caesia Roxburgh, 1810, C. longa Linnaeus, 1753 and C. sylvatica Valeton, 1918). Both groups display varying degree of chromosome associations. Group I species showed the prevalence of bivalents, however occasional <b>quadrivalents</b> besides univalents were also encountered. About 48 % of the PMCs analyzed in C. mangga showed 21 bivalents (II) meiotic configurations, 32 % in C. comosa and 16 % in C. haritha. Group II species as expected showed the presence of trivalents besides bivalents, univalents and <b>quadrivalents.</b> About 32 % of the PMCs analyzed at MI in C. sylvatica showed 21 trivalents (III) meiotic configurations, 24 % in C. longa and 8 % in C. caesia. Overall, low frequency of multivalent associations as compared to bivalents indicates that Curcuma is an allopolyploid complex. Moreover, x = 21 is too high a basic number, therefore, we suggest that the genus Curcuma has evolved by hybridization of species with different chromosome numbers of 2 n = 24 and 18, resulting in a dibasic amphidiploid species...|$|R

Pollen sterility {{is one of the}} most important factors which cause intersubspecific hybrid sterility. The hybrids with greater variation in seed set were used to study how the F 1 pollen sterile loci (S-a, S-b, and S-c) interact with each other and how abnormal chromosome behaviour and allelic interaction of F 1 sterility loci affect pollen fertility and seed set of intersubspecific autotetraploid rice hybrids. The results showed that interaction between pollen sterility loci have significant effects on the pollen fertility of autotetraploid hybrids, and pollen fertility further decreased with an increase in the allelic interaction of F 1 pollen sterility loci. Abnormal ultra-structure and microtubule distribution patterns during pollen mother cell (PMC) meiosis were found in the hybrids with low pollen fertility in interphase and leptotene, suggesting that the effect-time of pollen sterility loci interaction was very early. There were highly significant differences in the number of <b>quadrivalents</b> and bivalents, and in chromosome configuration among all the hybrids, and <b>quadrivalents</b> decreased with an increase in the seed set of autotetraploid hybrids. Many different kinds of chromosomal abnormalities, such as chromosome straggling, chromosome lagging, asynchrony of chromosome disjunction, and tri-fission were found during the various developmental stages of PMC meiosis. All these abnormalities were significantly higher in sterile hybrids than in fertile hybrids, suggesting that pollen sterility gene interactions tend to increase the chromosomal abnormalities which cause the partial abortion of male gametes and leads to the decline in the seed set of the autotetraploid rice hybrids...|$|R

40|$|Background: Mental {{retardation}} {{is defined}} as impaired mental capacity and ability to comply with environmental and social conditions. Chromosomal abnormalities {{are the most important}} causes of mental retardation. Carriers of balanced chromosomal translocation are phenotypically normal, although they may be at risk of infertility, recurrent miscarriage or giving birth to mentally retarded children. These abnormalities are caused because chromosomes participated in the reciprocal translocations produce <b>quadrivalents</b> at meiosis. These <b>quadrivalents</b> segregate and lead to several different meiotic outcomes, just two of which are normal or balanced. 			Case Presentation: A consanguineous family with three mentally retarded daughters at the ages of 24, 18 and 10 years was referred to Comprehensive Medical Genetics Centre, Shiraz, Iran in 2015. Family history showed a case of unexplained infant death as well as a spontaneous abortion. Three survived siblings had hypotonia and severe developmental delay during infantile period. In addition, they suffer from primary amenorrhea. Two siblings have vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Cytogenetic analysis of two patients showed 46,XX,t(6; 12) (q 23;q 22),der(9) t(8; 9) (q 24;p 24) with partial monosomy of chromosome 9 and partial trisomy of 8 q 24 segment, while the other patient had 46,XX,der(12) t(6; 12) (q 23;q 22) with partial monosomy of 12 q 22 qter and partial trisomy of 6 q 23 qter segment. Their mother had two balanced chromosomal translocations (46, XX, t(6, 12) (q 21;q 22), t(8, 9) (q 24;p 24)). 			Conclusion: The above presented case is another example for the rare occurrence of double balanced chromosomal translocations in a phenotypically normal person. Although the most important causes of mental retardation in consanguineous marriages are autosomal recessive disorders, the role of chromosomal aberrations in mental retardation in these families must not be neglected. In other words, cytogenetic studies should be performed as a first line test in either situation...|$|R
