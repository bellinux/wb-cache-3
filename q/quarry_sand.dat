40|$|A {{series of}} model footing tests were {{conducted}} to determine the bearing capacity and settlement behaviour of four different soils of which the first two were coarse-grained soils (Le. Filtration sand and <b>Quarry</b> <b>sand)</b> and the remainder two were fine-grained soils (i. e. Sil-co-sil 106 and Mil-u-sil 30) using four different sizes of model footings (Le. 20 mm x 20 mm, 37 mm x 37 mm, 41. 75 mm in diameter, and 50 mm x 50 mm) over a suction range of 0 to 8 kPa. This range of matric suction 0 to 8 kPa extends over the boundary effect, transition and residual stages (Vanapalli et al. 1999) for the two coarse-grained soils (Le. Filtration sand and <b>Quarry</b> <b>sand).</b> A soil container which is 300 mm in diameter and 700 mm in height {{has been used in}} the experiment. The targeted matric suction values in the soils were achieved by controlling the level of water table in the soil container and confirmed using Tensiometers installed in the soil at different depths. The experimental results demonstrated that: 1) The variation of bearing capacity of coarse-grained soils (Le. Filtration sand and <b>Quarry</b> <b>sand)</b> with respect to matric suction was nonlinear in nature. The bearing capacity increases up to the residual suction value and then decreases with further increase in matric suction values. The trends for settlement are however opposite; the settlement decreases up to residual suction value and gradually start increasing along with an increase in the matric suction. 2) For the unsaturated fine-grained soils (Le. Sil-co-sil 106 and Min-u-sil 30), bearing capacity increases and settlement decreases as the matric suction increases because the suction range (Le. 0 to 8 kPa) is in the boundary effect zone. In other words, the suction range in the boundary effect zone is lower than the air-entry value (i. e. saturation zone). More detailed discussions are offered with respect to the bearing capacity and settlement behaviour of unsaturated soils including the influence of footing size on the bearing capacity and settlement results. In addition, these test results were used to verify the semi-empirical models proposed by Vanapalli and Mohamed (2007) and Oh et al.

Addition of gravel results in decrease in dry density of the mixture and a decrease in mobilized strength. The Guth (1945) [1] Model is linear and predicted an increase in shear strength with gravel content in contrast with the laboratory values.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} high-rate compaction of brittle granular materials such as sand. However, {{the vast majority of}} studies focus on a single granular system, limiting our ability to make comparisons between materials to discern how granular structure manifests as bulk material response. Here, three different silica sands with similar grain size and shape are studied: we compare a rough <b>quarry</b> <b>sand,</b> a smoother-grained sand, and a sandy loam. Quasi-static compaction and planar shock loading responses are compared, and recovered samples analyzed. The combination provides information regarding the interplay between granular properties, loading conditions, and material response. We show that the fundamental grain-scale behaviour depends on loading conditions: At low strain rates compaction behaviour is dominated by grain morphology, and in particular, smoothness and particle size distribution. Under shock loading, grain rearrangement and force chain effects are suppressed, and the nature of inter-granular contact points, modified by the presence of moisture or fines, is most important. Furthermore, grain fracture under shock loading is substantially reduced with increasing moisture content...|$|E

Correlation of the permeability with the void ratio of bentonite was expressed by a power law. Later, Mollins et al. [7] measured the drained strength of bentonite clay–sand mixtures with different clay contents and relative density. The relative density and friction angle of sand at a critical state affected the ultimate shear strength of clay–sand mixtures. Dafalla [8] investigated the effects of clay content and moisture content on shear strength of clay–sand mixtures. As the water content increased, the cohesion and internal friction angle of clay–sand mixtures decreased. Moreover, at higher clay contents, the increase in water content sharply reduced the cohesion and internal friction angle. The increasing clay content resulted in an increase in cohesion for low clay content such as 5 and 10 %; however, at clay content as high as 20 %, cohesion could decrease.|$|E

40|$|Most European nations use {{washed sand}} to design their {{bituminous}} mixtures for wearing course, primarily to prevent excessive water sensitivity of asphalt {{due to the}} presence of clays in sand natural fines. The lack of fines is then offset by an addition of limestone filler. These practices lead to high water and energy consumption. France, Belgium and Denmark are exceptions: they use <b>quarry</b> <b>sands</b> with their natural fines, without washing, but after checking the harmfulness of fines (clay content) according to French specifications described in the XP P 18 - 545 standard section 8, a maximum methylene blue value of 2 g/kg is permitted.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the EC directive concerning landfill liners and covers sets stricter technical and environmental requirements for landfill barriers. It is therefore essential to identify suitable materials that fulfil these requirements. There is a general ambition to promote a sustainable society, {{and it would be}} advantageous, both environmentally and economically, if industrial waste materials could be reused as landfill barriers. The overall objectives {{of the present study was}} to facilitate and increase the use of sand-bentonite mixtures, including industrial waste materials and mixtures, in landfill barriers, and to increase the knowledge and understanding of the hydraulic conductivity. For engineering purposes, it would be useful to establish a relationship between the hydraulic conductivity of sand-bentonite mixtures and some more easily determined parameters, as it is complicated and time-consuming to determine the hydraulic conductivity of a landfill barrier in situ. Therefore, a methodology to estimate semi-theoretical relationships between hydraulic conductivity, dry density and bentonite content for sand-bentonite mixtures with different types of bentonite was developed. A number of laboratory and field tests were performed in order to develop and verify the semi-theoretical relationships for sand-bentonite mixtures. The materials tested were bentonite, foundry green sand and <b>quarry</b> <b>sand.</b> In the laboratory, conventional test methods such as flexible wall permeameters (FWP), as well as alternative methods, such as constant rate of strain (CRS) and constant pore pressure gradient (CGT) tests, were investigated, improved and used for determination of hydraulic conductivity. Hydraulic conductivity was also determined in situ by means of sealed single ring infiltrometers (SSRI) and porous probes (BAT permeameters). Generally, there was a good agreement between the laboratory hydraulic conductivity test results and the corresponding semi-theoretical relationship. The field test results were on average somewhat higher, probably due to the macroscopic effects that were present in situ. Based on the semi-theoretical relationships and the test results, design charts were proposed in order to facilitate an environmentally, technically and economically suitable design process for landfill barriers...|$|E

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the relative rates of sediment transport of an oolitic aragonite sand and a quartz <b>quarry</b> <b>sand</b> as possible beach renourishment materials has been conducted. When comparing equal volumes, the aragonite experienced less transport than the quartz in both the longshore and in the onshore-offshore directions. When comparing equal size fractions, in sizes 0. 35 mm and smaller, aragonite was less transportable. The quartz was less transportable in the sizes greater than 0. 35 mm. This trend was observed in two separate experiments and is attributed to the effective density ratio of aragonite to quartz, dissimilarities in roundness and sphericity, and to differential entrainment and transport of these materials in suspension and bed load {{within the confines of}} the inherent bed roughness. The effective density ratio of aragonite to quartz is highest in the smaller grain sizes and decreases with increasing grain size because the larger aragonitic grains possess fewer oolitic lamellae per grain and resemble their initial biogenic nucleus. In the smaller size fractions where suspension transport is thought to predominate, a larger quartz grain is hydraulically equivalent to a smaller aragonite grain due to the greater density of the aragonite. The aragonite has a higher settling velocity out of suspension and it is less entrainable, due to sheltering effects in the bed matrix allowing a lower position in the velocity profile and a larger reactive angle to the flow. As grain size increases above 0. 35 mm, the density of the aragonite approaches that of the quartz. The principle of hydraulic equivalence suggests that for two materials of similar density, there should be no difference in the entrainment and transportability between equal size fractions. The preferential transport of the aragonite relative to the quartz in the size fractions greater than 0. 35 mm is attributed to the difference in their shape, where the rounder aragonite is more easily rolled in traction as the size of both the aragonite and quartz exceed the background bed roughness. The physical characteristics of aragonite indicate that it has a hydraulic behavior similar to a quartz sand of a slightly larger size. If renourishment is undertaken on John U. Lloyd Beach with aragonite, the most probable source material would be a mining stockpile (mean size 0. 52 mm) from Ocean Cay in the Bahamas. Based on a theoretical (mean size only) method of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, utilization of this stockpile material would reduce the erosion rate on Lloyd Beach by 10 %. The results of my study indicate that beach losses could be further reduced by using this aragonite due its higher density. Secondary characteristics such as density and shape of the renourishment material manifest themselves differently in the suspension and bed load modes of transport and should be considered when choosing a borrow source. Additional transport studies need to be done utilizing larger volumes of material and monitored over a longer time interval...|$|E
