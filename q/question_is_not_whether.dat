500|$|At the BFI London Film Festival, Nagy {{said she}} titled the film Carol, not The Price of Salt, because Highsmith herself {{had changed the}} title to Carol when the novel was republished, and she also [...] "liked the sort of strange, obsessive nature of calling it by someone's name." [...] There were later other discussions with Haynes. Haynes said that the film is called Carol because the novel [...] "is locked into the {{subjectivity}} of the younger woman" [...] and Carol is [...] "really the object of desire in the story." [...] "There's an element of, something aloof ... something unsettled about , that puts Therese and these new feelings ... on edge {{throughout much of the}} film. That relationship of who's the object and who's the subject does shift in the story, but it made sense ultimately that that would be the name for the film." [...] On the universal theme of the story, Haynes said [...] "the real determining <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> society will accept [...] feelings or not; it's, will this person return her love or not? ... That is what transcends the class of love, or the period in which it's occurring, and makes it something that just humbles us all and levels us all in the throes of those experiences that most of us have." ...|$|E

2500|$|Alvin Plantinga {{presents}} {{an argument for}} the existence of God using modal logic. Others have said that the logical and philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God miss the point. The word God has a meaning in human culture and history that does not correspond to the beings whose existence is supported by such arguments, assuming they are valid. The real <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> a [...] "most perfect being" [...] or an [...] "uncaused first cause" [...] exist. The real question is whether Jehovah, Zeus, Ra, Krishna, or any gods of any religion exist, and if so, which gods? On the other hand, many theists equate all monotheistic or henotheistic [...] "most perfect Beings", no matter what name is assigned to them/him, as the one monotheistic God (one example would be understanding the Muslim Allah, Christian Yhwh, and Chinese Shangdi as different names for the same Being). Most of these arguments do not resolve the issue of which of these figures is more likely to exist. These arguments fail to make the distinction between immanent gods and a Transcendent God.|$|E

2500|$|In other words, whereas McGrew {{argues that}} anthropologists {{must focus on}} {{behaviors}} like communication and tool-use {{because they have no}} access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest stone tools in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the way they do these things. [...] "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," [...] and other examples of primate tool-use and learning [...] "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal." [...] Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. [...] "In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic. [...] In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{afternoon}} of the third day of the war, the American SIGINT spy ship USS Liberty, outfitted by the NSA, was attacked by Israeli warplanes and torpedo boats in international waters north of Sinai. This U.S. Navy ship was severely damaged with loss of life. The Israelis quickly notified the Americans and later explained that they [...] "had mistaken the Liberty (455 feet long) for the Egyptian coastal steamer El Quseir (275 feet long). The US government formally accepted the apology and the explanation." [...] Some continue to accept this position. Yet [...] "scholars and military experts," [...] according to author Thomas Powers, state that [...] "the hard <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> the attack was deliberate but why the Israelis thought it necessary." [...] About the Liberty Helms in his memoirs quotes the opinion of his deputy, DDCI Rufus Taylor, and mentions the conclusion of a board of inquiry.

In 2013 Israel and Qatar brought Gaza’s lone power plant back to life for the first time in seven weeks, bringing relief to the Palestinian coastal enclave where a lack of cheap fuel has contributed to the overflow of raw sewage, 21-hour blackouts and flooding after a ferocious winter storm.

2500|$|Sandiford appealed {{against this}} decision, {{but it was}} again {{rejected}} at the High Court in April 2013, by a three-judge panel, chaired by Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson. By then Sandiford's first line of appeal against her death sentence had been rejected, and she required £6,000 towards her legal costs for {{the next stage of}} her appeal. In his summing up on 22 April Lord Dyson said that it was [...] "most unfortunate" [...] Sandiford required [...] "relatively speaking ... very small sum indeed" [...] for her legal costs, but that this [...] "cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. It may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum {{in the course of the}} next few days." [...] The judges published their reasons for rejecting the appeal on 22 May. In the written judgement, Lord Dyson said that Sandiford had argued the Foreign Secretary's position was [...] "unlawful" [...] but that the High Court had been [...] "right to conclude" [...] it was not. [...] "As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances...But the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>whether</b> the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy.
