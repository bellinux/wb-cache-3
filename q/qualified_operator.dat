More precisely, we focus on human resources optimisation in design phase of a manufacturing system. We consider that operators may have different qualifications. A highly <b>qualified</b> <b>operator</b> is more expensive, but it is more efficient too.

This test has also been adapted to the mouse nose. Objectives: We aimed at evaluating variability of the NPD measurements in CF patients displaying two severe CFTR mutations and in sex-matched healthy controls. NPD recorded from F 508 del-CF and normal wild-type mice were also compared. Methods and Results: In each setting, tests were performed by a single <b>qualified</b> <b>operator.</b> In the clinical setting, the latest standardized operation protocol of the CF foundation was followed. A total of 80 trac-ings were obtained from 10 patients (23. 2 y; range 14 to 32) and 10 healthy subjects (34 y; range 24 to 53), each tested twice, in both nostrils. Two CF and two controls were excluded from the statistical data analysis due to the presence of a single non interpretable NPD tracing (4 / 80, 5 %). To achieve equal sample size, tests were obtained from 8 CF mice and normal wild-type. Comprehensive multivariate analysis of paired data showed a good reproducibility of NPD pa-rameters in the clinical and the preclinical setting; lower variability was observed in mice. However, 95 % repeatability limits of NPD parameters were large indicating a large measurement error, poor precision and low within-subject re-peatability.

Nowadays, 24 -hour BP monitoring is a necessary procedure in arterial hypertension treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} validate the BPLab&reg; ambulatory {{blood pressure}} monitor according to the European standard BS EN 1060 - 4 : 2004 and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) protocol, as well as to work out solutions regarding the suitability of using this device in clinical practice. Methods: A group of 85 patients of both sexes and different ages, who voluntarily agreed to take part in the tests and were given detailed instructions on the measurement technique were recruited for this study. The results of the BP measurement obtained by a <b>qualified</b> <b>operator</b> using the BPLab&reg; device were compared with the BP values measured using the Korotkov auscultatory method. Data were obtained simultaneously by two experts with experience of over 10 years and had completed a noninvasive BP measurement standardization training course.

Results: The device passed the requirements of the European Standard BS EN 1060 - 4 : 2004 and was graded &lsquo;A&rsquo; according to the criteria of the BHS protocol for both systolic BP and diastolic BP.

Advancement in the functionality, cost, capacity {{and speed of}} computers has been astounding. A variety of desktop turnkey systems are available {{for less than the}} annual salary of a <b>qualified</b> <b>operator.</b> Still the diffusion of GIS into local land use planning activities has been limited by our capacity to manage these systems. A core of literature is identified which focuses on GIS management issues facing local government planning practitioners. National surveys are reviewed which identify the significance of management issues in the process of adopting information technologies. Model adoption processes are identified to address these and other issues associated with GIS. These models are based on organizational theory. To explore these issues further this research utilizes surveys and other traditional geographic research methods, within a case study framework. This research examines the process of GIS adoption in local land use planning in Arizona. The primary case is the City of Douglas, located along the Mexican border in southern Arizona. In addition, Planning, Community Development, Public Works and Information Management Systems Directors throughout Arizona were surveyed to determine the current status of the diffusion of GIS. By systematically observing the adoption process this research describes the content and context of the use of geographic information in local land use planning. Operational applications are shown to be the most popular. GIS are not commonly being used to make policy improvements in local government. Computer graphics, including maps are used significantly more often than hand drawn material. Still, graphics in general are used infrequently in decision making forums, including public hearings and City Council meetings. The model adoption processes described herein are intended to remedy this situation. This research contributes knowledge which can help managers in designing their own implementation protocols. Further research is recommended to assess the day to day uses of this emerging technology...|$|E
40|$|This thesis focuses {{particularly}} on the application of chemometrics {{in the field of}} analytical chemistry. Chemometrics (or multivariate analysis) consists in finding a relationship between two groups of variables, often called dependent and independent variables. In infrared spectroscopy for instance, chemometrics consists in the prediction of a quantitative variable (the obtention of which is delicate, requiring a chemical analysis and a <b>qualified</b> <b>operator),</b> such as the concentration of a component present in the studied product from spectral data measured on various wavelengths or wavenumbers (several hundreds, even several thousands). In this research we propose a methodology in the field of chemometrics to handle the chemical data (spectrophotometric data) which are often in high dimension. To handle these data, we first propose a new incremental method (step-by-step) for the selection of spectral data using linear and non-linear 	regression based on the combination of three principles: linear or non-linear regression, incremental procedure for the variable selection, and use of a validation set. This procedure allows on one hand to benefit from the advantages of non-linear methods to predict chemical data (there is often a non-linear relationship between dependent and independent variables), {{and on the other hand}} to avoid the overfitting phenomenon, one of the most crucial problems encountered with non-linear models. Secondly, we propose to improve the previous method by a judicious choice of the first selected variable, which has a very important influence on the final performances of the prediction. The idea is to use a measure of the mutual information between the independent and dependent variables to select the first one; then the previous incremental method (step-by-step) is used to select the next variables. The variable selected by mutual information can have a good interpretation from the spectrochemical point of view, and does not depend on the data distribution in the training and validation sets. On the contrary, the traditional chemometric linear methods such as PCR or PLSR produce new variables which do not have any interpretation from the spectrochemical point of view. Four real-life datasets (wine, orange juice, milk powder and apples) are presented in order to show the efficiency and advantages of both proposed procedures compared to the traditional chemometric linear methods often used, such as MLR, PCR and PLSR.

Morse in 1844 quickly {{led to the development}} of a telegraphic network in the eastern United States, constructed and maintained by a number of private companies. [...] Operation of this network required skilled operators at each station, capable of sending and receiving messages in Morse code. The shortage of <b>qualified</b> <b>operators</b> led to the hiring of women as well as men to fill a rapidly growing need for operators in the late 1840s as the telegraph spread across the country. Sarah Bagley (1806 - ?), a women's rights advocate and founder of the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association, became the telegraph operator for Francis Ormand Jonathan Smith's New York and Boston Magnetic Telegraph Company in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1846. She probably became aware of the telegraph and its potential from her previous work as an editor for the reform newspaper, the Voice of Industry. Phoebe Wood (1816-1891), sister of Morse's associate Ezra Cornell and wife of telegraph entrepreneur Martin B. Wood, became the telegrapher in Albion, Michigan, in 1849, after Cornell's business partner John James Speed pointed out the need for operators in sparsely populated frontier areas.|$|R
