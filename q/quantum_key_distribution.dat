40|$|Abstract: BB 84 (Bennett and Brassard 1984) {{is one of}} {{the well}} known {{protocols}} of <b>quantum</b> <b>keys</b> <b>distribution.</b> It is built to allow two interlocutors commonly called Alice and Bob to share two similar binary keys and to detect the eavesdropper presence (the eavesdropper is commonly called Eve). However, Eve presence in a disturbed environment causes errors to the sifted keys and decreases the amount of secure information between Alice and Bob. One of the most important stages in BB 84 protocol is to decide by using error probability estimation if we can continue the protocol phases or no. Indeed, this decision is function of some factors like: what is the amount of information that we will lose in the error correction phase? What is the degree of errors detected in our sifted keys? What is the origin of these errors: Eve strategy or the channel disturbance? For these reasons, we will study in this study some conditions to stop BB 84 protocol in the context of depolarizing channel. We implement two types of eavesdropping strategy: Intercept and Resend and Cloning Attack...|$|R

40|$|Since quantum {{mechanics}} {{was applied for}} a quantum protocol which could transport a quantum state from one location to another, great attention has been drawn in quantum information and communications [1].

40|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>key</b> <b>distributions</b> (QKD) systems often rely on {{polarization}} of light for encoding, thus limiting {{the amount of}} information that can be sent per photon and placing tight bounds on the error that such a system can tolerate. Here we describe a proof-of-principle experiment that indicates the feasibility of high-dimensional QKD based on the transverse structure of the light field, allowing for the transfer of more than 1 bit per photon. Our implementation uses the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons and the corresponding mutually unbiased basis of angular position (ANG). Our experiment uses a digital micro-mirror device for the rapid generation of OAM and ANG modes at 4 kHz, and a mode sorter capable of sorting single photons based on their OAM and ANG content with a separation efficiency of 93 %. Through the use of a 7 -dimensional alphabet encoded in the OAM and ANG bases, we achieve a channel capacity of 2. 05 bits per sifted photon. Our experiment shows that, in addition to having an increased information capacity, QKD systems based on spatial-mode encoding will be more tolerant to errors and thus more robust against eavesdropping attacks...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} general idea to {{construct}} various methods which {{in an easy}} way teleport multi-qubit quantum information from a sender to a receiver via the control of many agents in a network. In each method, only all the agents collaborate can the unknown states in the sender’s qubits be fully reconstructed in the receiver’s qubits. The validity of various methods originates from our general idea which lets each agent’s encryption on the sender’s messages of his/her Bell-state measurement outcomes before his/her public announcements as the agent’s control parameter. The many-agent’s encryptions as control parameters can be achieved via the <b>quantum</b> <b>key</b> <b>distributions</b> (QKD) or the quantum secure direct communications (QSDC) or the combination of both.

25|$|The <b>quantum</b> <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> {{protocols}} {{described above}} provide Alice and Bob with nearly identical shared keys, {{and also with}} {{an estimate of the}} discrepancy between the keys. These differences can be caused by eavesdropping, but also by imperfections in the transmission line and detectors. As it is impossible to distinguish between these two types of errors, guaranteed security requires the assumption that all errors are due to eavesdropping. Provided the error rate between the keys is lower than a certain threshold (20% as of April 2007), two steps can be performed to first remove the erroneous bits and then reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrary small value. These two steps are known as information reconciliation and privacy amplification respectively, and were first described in 1992.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} and unique property of <b>quantum</b> <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> {{is the ability}} of the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about it), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted.|$|E
25|$|Hacking attacks target {{vulnerabilities}} in {{the operation}} of a QKD protocol or deficiencies in the components of the physical devices used in construction of the QKD system. If the equipment used in <b>quantum</b> <b>key</b> <b>distribution</b> can be tampered with, it could be made to generate keys that were not secure using a random number generator attack. Another common class of attacks is the Trojan horse attack which does not require physical access to the endpoints: rather than attempt to read Alice and Bob's single photons, Eve sends a large pulse of light back to Alice in between transmitted photons. Alice's equipment reflects some of Eve's light, revealing the state of Alice's basis (e.g., a polarizer). This attack can be detected, e.g. by using a classical detector to check the non-legitimate signals (i.e. light from Eve) entering Alice's system. It is also conjectured that most hacking attacks can similarly be defeated by modifying the implementation, though there is no formal proof.|$|E
