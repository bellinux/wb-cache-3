5000|$|The Royal Exchange Assurance {{emerged from}} a joint stock <b>{{insurance}}</b> <b>enterprise</b> known as Onslow's insurance or Onslow's Bubble. This had been begun as the Mercer's Hall Marine Company, or Undertaking kept at the Royal Exchange for insuring ships and merchandise at sea. A similar enterprise sought incorporation in 1718, but the Attorney-General reported against this. Lord Onslow then sought a means of avoiding the difficulty by his company acquiring the charters of Society of Mines Royal and Company of Mineral and Battery Works, which declared itself open for assuring ships and merchandise in March 1719. Their opponents petitioned against this and the Attorney-General reported in May 1719 that the use made of the charters was [...] "unwarrantable". The directors admitted this mistake but requested their own charter in January 1720. They and another <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprise</b> each offered £300,000 towards the king's Civil List debts. The king then encouraged the House of Commons to permit their incorporation. This {{was done in the}} Bubble Act.

40|$|The {{advent of}} risk-based capital {{requirements}} {{and the potential}} expansion {{of the role of}} the Appointed Actu-ary demand expertise in evaluating the financial stability of <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Because of the growth of property/casualty loss reserves and the wide fluctuations in interest rates during the past two decades, asset-liability management is of increasing importance for ca-sualty actuaries. The American Academy of Actuaries task force on risk-based capital has provided the NAIC with a pro-posed “interest rate risk charge ” for its risk-based cap-ital formula. This paper reviews the theoretical devel-opment of an interest rate risk charge as well as its practical application for setting capital requirements. Interest rate risk is the potentially adverse effect of a shift in market interest rates on the net worth of the <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprise.</b> For statutory risk-based capital re-quirements, interest rate risk depends on (i) the relative payment patterns of assets and liabilities, (ii) the statu-tory valuation rate for the assets, and (iii) the statutory valuation rate for the liabilities. The paper also discusses the effects of numerous exter-nal factors—such as changes in market interest rates or changes in statutory valuation rates—on the magnitude of the interest rate risk, as well as several unresolved issues, such as the proper allocation of assets to cover loss liabilities. It concludes with an example illustrat-ing the computation of an interest rate risk capital charge...|$|R

40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>enterprises</b> provide services, called {{insurance}} services, to policyholders. The {{values of}} such services are seldom, if ever, directly apparent; rather {{these values are}} implicitly entwined within the payment of premiums. This paper discusses the treatment of insurance services, and related transactions, {{in the balance of}} payments. A simple measure, based on a number of assumptions, of nonlife insurance services is considered. The assumptions underlying this measure are then relaxed. The treatment of life insurance, which has many of the characteristics of nonlife insurance, is then addressed. The paper concludes with a discussion on the practical aspects of measuring insurance transactions in the balance of payments. ...|$|R

40|$|Black {{entrepreneurs}} established viable {{insurance companies}} in the early 20 th century, responding {{to the need to}} provide insurance to those black consumers who were rejected or mistreated by insurance firms owned by whites. Adding to this account, one study has proposed that black employment in the insurance industry was also encouraged by residential segregation by race. In the present investigation, a regression analysis of census data for 22 southern and 42 northern cities in 1940 finds modest support for this proposal. The rate of the employment of blacks as "insurance agents and brokers" was positively associated with an index of black residential segregation in northern cities only. Moreover, the rate of black employment in these insurance occupations was higher in southern cities, and there was indirect evidence that this higher rate may have resulted from an old tradition of <b>insurance</b> <b>enterprise</b> among blacks in the South. ...|$|R
