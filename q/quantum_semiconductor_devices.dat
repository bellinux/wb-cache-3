We derive an {{approximate}} solution valid to all orders of h to the Bloch equation for quantum mechanical thermal equilibrium distribution functions via asymptotic analysis for high temperatures and small external potentials.

The validity of the asymptotic solution is investigated analytically and numerically and compared with Wigner’s O(h 2) solution.

With the aim of describing the semi-classical limit of the 3 D Schrodinger [...] Poisson system with an additional harmonic potential, we study some semi-classical limits of the Hartree equation with harmonic potential in space dimension n> 1. The harmonic potential is confining, and causes focusing periodically in time. We prove asymptotics in several cases, showing different possible nonlinear phenomena according to the interplay {{of the size of}} the initial data and the power of the Hartree potential. In the case of the 3 D Schrodinger-Poisson system with harmonic potential, we can only give a formal computation since the need of modified scattering operators for this long range scattering case goes beyond current theory.

40|$|Abstract—Perfect {{nanowires}} may {{be studied}} {{from both the}} bandstructure and transmission perspectives, and relating features in one set of curves to those in another often yields much insight into their behavior. For random-alloy nanowires, however, only transmission characteristics and virtual-crystal approximation (VCA) bands have been available. This is a serious shortcoming since the VCA cannot properly capture disorder at the primitive cell level: those bulk properties which it can satisfactorily reproduce arise from spatially extended states and measurements which average out primitive cell-level fluctuations. Here we address this deficiency by projecting approximate bands out of supercell states for AlH ISGaH VSAs random alloy nanowires. The resulting bands correspond to the transmission characteristics very closely, unlike the VCA bands, which cannot explain important transmission features. Using both bandstructure and transmission results, we {{are better able to}} explain the operation of these nanowires.

40|$|Abstract—The {{trend toward}} {{continuous}} {{integration of the}} nanometer scale {{and the rise of}} nonconventional device concepts such as multigate transistors present important challenges for the semiconductor community. Simulation tools have to be adapted to this new scenario where classical approaches are not sufficiently accurate, and quantum effects have to be taken into account. This paper proposes a method of including quantum corrections in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations without solving the Schrödinger equation. The approach, based on the effective conduction band-edge (ECBE) method, considers the effects of an arbitrary effective mass tensor, describing valley characteristics and confinement directions while avoiding the use of effective mass as a fitting parameter. The performance of the multivalley ECBE method is tested using an ensemble MC simulator to study benchmark devices for next International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors technological nodes, a 25 -nm channel length bulk-MOSFET and a double-gate silicon-on-insulator MOSFET in both steady-state and transient situations.
