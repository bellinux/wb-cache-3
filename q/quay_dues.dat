50|$|While {{generally}} agreed to depict a contemporary street scene in 17th-century Delft, where Vermeer lived and worked, {{the exact location}} of the scene Vermeer painted has long been a topic of research and dispute, with studies arguing for the Voldersgracht, where the Vermeer Centre is located, or the Nieuwe Langendijk at the present-day numbers 22 to 26.Later archival research based on the city's <b>quay</b> <b>dues</b> register, which gives detailed measurements of all houses and passageways at the time along the canals of Delft, has resulted in the conclusion that the site is the Vlamingstraat, a street with a narrow canal, at the present-day numbers 40 and 42. The property on the right in the painting belonged to Vermeer’s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne. She had a business selling tripe, and the passageway beside the house was known as the Penspoort , or Tripe Gate. Vermeer’s mother and sister also lived on the same canal, diagonally opposite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the docks was bitterly opposed by the lightermen and other vested interests, but went ahead anyway. However, they did win a major concession: {{what became known as}} the [...] "free-water clause", first introduced into the West India Dock Act of 1799 and subsequently written into the Acts governing all of the other docks. This stated that there was to be no charge for [...] "lighters or craft entering into the docks ... to convey, deliver, discharge or receive ballast or goods to or from on board any ship ... or vessel." [...] This was intended to give lighters and barges the same freedom in docks that they enjoyed on the open river. In practice, however, this proved highly damaging to the dock owners. It allowed ships to be loaded and unloaded overside, using barges and lighters to transfer their goods to and from riverside wharves rather than dock quays, thus bypassing <b>quay</b> <b>dues</b> and dock warehouses. This significantly reduced the docks' income and harmed their finances, while boosting the profits of their riverside competitors. Not surprisingly, the dock owners lobbied vigorously—but unsuccessfully—for the abolition of this damaging privilege.|$|E

25|$|Some of the temples, shrines {{and other}} places of worship still stand in the {{vicinity}} of the river. Bridges such as Anderson Bridge, Elgin Bridge and Cavenagh Bridge still remain, the Merlion, the shophouses, and the large trees such as Banyan and Madras Thorn. Some parts of this area include quays such as Clarke Quay, Boat Quay and Robertson Quay, which generated trade and extensive demand for services with the boats that landed at the quays. Boat Quay itself was handling three quarters of the shipping service in the 1860s. Shophouses and warehouses flourished around the <b>quays</b> <b>due</b> to their proximity to trade during the colonial era, but presently house various bars, pubs and restaurants, as well as antique shops.|$|R

It examines the rationale behind the BBC’s decision to move this production unit, and analyses the long-term impact of this policy on both the logistics and programme-making culture of the unit. Using interviews with staff working within the department {{at the time of the}} move, this research demonstrates how policy decisions such as this are negotiated by professionals within the Corporation and the conflicts which arise around efficiency and equality. The case of the Department of Religion and Ethics also provides important lessons for the future decentralisation of BBC departments to Salford <b>Quays</b> which is <b>due</b> to be implemented in 2011...|$|R
40|$|Failure of the <b>quay</b> walls <b>due</b> to {{earthquakes}} {{results in}} severe economic loss. Because of hazards threatening such inexpensive nodes {{of national and}} international transportation networks, seismic design of quay walls is still an evolving topic in marine structural engineering. This study investigates {{the sensitivity of the}} gravity-type quay wall stability respect to uncertain soil and seismic properties using ultimate limit-sate pseudo-static design process. Stability is defined in terms of safety factor against sliding (sfs), overturning (sfo) and exceeding bearing capacity (sfb). In order to assess the forces exerting on quay walls, to be more accurate, pore water pressure ratio, horizontal and vertical inertia forces, fluctuating and non-fluctuating components of hydraulic and soil pressure were considered. It was found that the increase of water depth in front of the quay, vertical and horizontal seismic coefficients, and pore water pressure ratio play important roles in reduction of all mentioned safety factors. Increase of specific weight of the rubble mound, backfill and foundation soil, friction angle of wall-foundation/seabed interface and wall back-face/backfill interface and friction angle of backfill soil, lead safety factors to magnify. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis was also performed using the tornado diagrams. Results of this study could give designers insights into the importance of uncertain soil and seismic factors, in order to choose geometry of the design in a way that its analysis and assessment is less relied on severely uncertain parameters and to introduce more reliable and economic quay walls...|$|R
40|$|The {{container}} relocation problem, where containers {{that are}} stored in bays are retrieved in a fixed sequence, is a crucial port operation. Existing approaches using branch and bound algorithms are only able to optimally solve small cases in a practical time frame. In this paper, we investigate iterative deepening A{*} algorithms (rather than branch and bound) using new lower bound measures and heuristics, and show that this approach is able to solve much larger instances {{of the problem in}} a time frame that is suitable for practical application. We also examine a more difficult variant of the problem that has been largely ignored in existing literature. Note to Practitioners-Container retrieval is an important operation in a container port. When a ship arrives, containers stored in the port yard are first retrieved by yard crane, loaded onto auto-guided vehicles, transported to quay cranes, and loaded onto the ship by <b>quay</b> crane. <b>Due</b> to various operational constraints, e. g., maintenance of vessel balance and safety issues, the containers in a storage bay are retrieved one by one in a fixed sequence. When the next container to be retrieved is not at the top of its stack, all other containers above it must then be first relocated onto other stacks within the bay. The relocation of a container is a time-consuming operation that essentially dominates all other aspects of the problem, and therefore {{it is important that the}} retrieval plan minimizes the number of such relocations. This study proposes a method to generate a near-optimal retrieval plan for yard cranes. This often arises as a subproblem when devising an overall plan for port operations that maximizes throughput, which involves the coordination of multiple pieces of machinery. Our approach produces significantly better results than all existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|Today, freight volumes {{on roads}} {{have gone up}} to a level {{that there is a}} need for {{alternative}} transport modes. Short Sea Shipping (SSS) is one alternative with a potential that can help reduce the high traffic on roads. Most SSS systems use vessels whereby cargo is rolled on and off using a ramp with very small capacities usually less than 500 TEU, but with increasing cargo traffic, it is not clear if such solutions will be efficient. For ports involved in SSS to meet up this new wave of change, the challenge to make appropriate investments and analysis tools is important. The type of vessel suitable for a SSS operation (such as roll-on roll-off (RoRo), lift-on lift-off (LoLo) etc) has been addressed in this thesis based on their compatibility and cost effectiveness with the terminal equipments. The purpose of this study is to develop an optimization model that can be incorporated into a Computer Decision Support System (DSS) for selecting equipments including ships at a strategic level for investments in handling unitised cargo at port terminals in the context of Short Sea Shipping (SSS). The main contribution of the thesis is the application of computer science techniques in the domain of strategic decision making related to the configuration of complex systems (e. g. interrelationships between ships and equipments) with choices of handling equipment. From modelling the selection of port terminal equipments for SSS, we realised that while integer linear programming is a promising approach for studying such systems, it remains a challenge to handle complex issues in depth especially in relation to the <b>quay</b> crane <b>due</b> to interdependencies between time, cost and capacity of equipments. Model results indicates that a LoLo vessel with a capacity between (500 and 1000 TEU) capable of completing a SSS voyage such that handling is done within 48 hours will be less costly than a RoRo that does it with multiple voyages or one voyage each for multiple RoRo vessels for TEU volumes greater than 1000. But RoRo vessels remain useful for trailers that cannot be transported by LoLo vessels. containers. Lotsgatan 14 374 35, Karlshamn Mobile: 0046 768 85 67 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} 50 years {{there have been}} many {{documented}} failures of gravity retaining <b>quay</b> walls <b>due</b> to earthquake events. These failures are often associated with significant deformation of liquefiable soil deposits (e. g. major damage occurred at Kobe Port during the 1995 Hyogoken-Nanbu earthquake). Saudi Arabia has similar types of quay walls located in regions that have the potential to experience significant seismic events. These walls have not been designed for seismic resistance and therefore have the potential to suffer serious damage from seismic activity. For many years the design of seismic gravity quay walls has been studied and design codes for engineering practice established; however, the widespread failures of these structures during recent earthquakes demonstrates that these design methods may be insufficient. Such gravity quay wall failures have stimulated progress {{in the development of a}} performance-based seismic design method using non-linear inelastic dynamic analysis for quay wall structures. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology for the seismic design of gravity quay walls using a non-linear elasto-plastic dynamic analysis. The final method adopted in this work is based on the generalised elasto-plasiticity constitutive model developed by Pastor et aL (1990), with some minor modifications, which has been incorporated into a finite element procedure. The proposed P-Z sand model was first validated by simulating published monotonic and cyclic test results. Secondly, an effective stress analysis was established by developing a finite element model for Kobe Port Island quay walls using the P-Z sand model. This model was validated by comparing the predicted deformations with those experienced at Kobe. The computed residual deformations from the analysis were in good agreement with published field observations. To develop mitigation strategies, a parametric study of the seismic perfonnance of gravity quay walls, using the effective stress analysis, was conducted. This study assessed the effect of various structural and geotechnical parameters on the seismic performance of quay walls. Twenty-six cases of effective stress analysis with variation in tidal range, soil permeability, soil relative densities, and wall widths were conducted as well as analyses to test the importance of considering multi-directional seismic excitations as opposed to uni-directional. In order to assess the safety of existing quay walls in Jeddah Port, an experimental programme was conducted. This programme consisted of a site investigation (using a standard penetration test (SPT)) to determine the in situ relative density of the existing backfill, a series of laboratory based, monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests (to define the soil properties of Jeddah Port sand) and a two-dimensional effective stress finite element analysis of a typical Jeddah quay wall. The monotonic and cyclic triaxial tests were conducted for three different relative densities of D, = 35 %, 55 % and 75 %. These represent loose (equal to in situ conditions as established by the site investigation), medium dense and dense sand. The experimental results are discussed and then used to identify the P-Z sand model parameters. These parameters were used in conjunction with a finite element analysis of Jeddah Port quay walls to Predict the seismic deformations. In this analysis the finite element model was subjected to a number of different ground motions, which represented two different levels of earthquake intensity; namely moderate and strong ground shaking. The effect of improvement strategies such as increasing the relative density of the backfill and foundation materials was then assessed The results of the simulations showed that existing Jeddah Port quay walls are not satisfactory to resist either moderate or strong earthquake excitations. However, if the relative density is increased to 55 % then satisfactory performance can be achieved for a moderate intensity earthquake. For the case of strong shaking, the analysis showed that the quay walls did not demonstrate the required performance levels; however, they were only under specification by 10 %. Finally, a flowchart illustrating a seismic design procedure for gravity quay walls has been proposed, which is applicable to both existing and new gravity quay walls. Key-words: quay wall, liquefaction, earthquake, port, effective stress, constitutive model.
