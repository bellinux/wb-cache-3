5|$|A {{series of}} biotic and abiotic cues, such as {{individual}} genetics, foraging quantity and <b>quality,</b> <b>or</b> population density, may trigger the maturation of the reproductive organs {{and the production}} of gametes and thus determine sexual maturity. Like many reptiles, all marine turtles of a same aggregation are highly unlikely to reach sexual maturity at the same size and thus age.|$|E

5|$|Statives are a {{class of}} predicative words expressing a <b>quality</b> <b>or</b> state, whose {{syntactic}} properties fall in between those of verbs and adjectives in Indo-European languages. Like verbs, statives can sometimes be inflected for person but normally lack inflections for tense, aspect and other purely verbal categories. Statives can be adjectives, positionals or numerals.|$|E

5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a <b>quality</b> (<b>or</b> perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, softwood cuttings {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect <b>quality</b> <b>or</b> make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
5|$|William De Morgan {{was unwilling}} to {{compromise}} on <b>quality</b> <b>or</b> embrace the trend towards mass production, and by this time his work was significantly more expensive than similar works by other designers. Consequently, his ceramics business was becoming increasingly unviable financially. In 1906 his first novel, Joseph Vance, was published and became a great success, prompting DeMorgan to close the ceramics business in 1907 to concentrate on writing. Mary Watts attempted to replicate DeMorgan's tile designs at Watts's pottery in Compton {{but was unable to}} do so, and investigated other tile manufacturers.|$|E

5|$|An {{independent}} diamond synthesis {{was achieved}} on February 16, 1953 in Stockholm by ASEA (Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget), one of Sweden's major electrical manufacturing companies. Starting in 1949, ASEA employed {{a team of}} five scientists and engineers {{as part of a}} top-secret diamond-making project code-named QUINTUS. The team used a bulky split-sphere apparatus designed by Baltzar von Platen and Anders Kämpe. Pressure was maintained within the device at an estimated 8.4GPa for an hour. A few small diamonds were produced, but not of gem <b>quality</b> <b>or</b> size. The work was not reported until the 1980s. During the 1980s, a new competitor emerged in Korea, a company named Iljin Diamond; it was followed by hundreds of Chinese enterprises. Iljin Diamond allegedly accomplished diamond synthesis in 1988 by misappropriating trade secrets from GE via a Korean former GE employee.|$|E
5|$|Prior to , {{a flourishing}} trade route for Percherons existed between Nogent-le-Rotrou, Le Havre and the United States. However, {{after the war}} began, an embargo was placed on French Percherons, disallowing them from exportation. Other than an {{exception}} in April 1916 to allow 59 horses to be shipped from France to the US, this embargo remained in place {{until the end of}} the war. The war took its toll on the Percheron breed as horses, fodder, and handlers were requisitioned for the fighting, and even after the embargo was lifted France did not have the <b>quality</b> <b>or</b> quantity of stock to fulfill the needs of American breeders. The embargo created a breeding boom in the US, replacing the previous practice of importing the majority of Percherons from France, and late in the war horses were shipped the other way– from the US to Europe– to supply those needed in the war. The lack of feathering on the Percheron's lower legs made them easier to care for in the mud that they often worked in during wartime. Their quick trot on paved roads made them more versatile than motorized vehicles, and they were useful for work with guns and in forward units due to their calm temperaments.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Suetonius {{was born}} in about AD70, and started writing around AD100. He was a child {{at the time of}} the games, but it is possible that he was born and raised in Rome, so he may have witnessed the inaugural games first-hand. His De Vita Caesarum (Lives of the Caesars, known also as The Twelve Caesars or Lives of the Twelve Caesars) probably completed around AD117 to 127, includes some detail on the opening days of the games. Later in his history of Titus he reveals further information about the games. Suetonius' histories of the early Caesars have been criticised for being based on rumour and gossip rather than accurate historical sources, and he often reports from sources which contradict each other without attempting to analyse their <b>quality</b> <b>or</b> accuracy. However, he is generally regarded as a thorough scholar and has been praised for his balanced treatment of his subjects.|$|E

5|$|Though the Mellotron was not {{extensively}} {{used in the}} 1980s, {{a number}} of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album Architecture & Morality. Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when {{growing up in the}} 1970s, and thought it would be an interesting addition to the group's sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for £165, and first used it on the album Mummer (1983). IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical <b>quality</b> <b>or</b> convenience.|$|E
