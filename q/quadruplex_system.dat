5000|$|During a 1955 Hockey Night in Canada {{broadcast}} on CBC Television, producer George Retzlaff used a [...] "wet-film" [...] (kinescope) replay, which aired several minutes later.Videotape {{was introduced in}} 1956 with the Ampex <b>Quadruplex</b> <b>system.</b> However, it was incapable of displaying slow motion, instant replay, or freeze-frames, and {{it was difficult to}} rewind and set index points.|$|E
50|$|Toshiba {{introduced}} helical-scan {{technology to}} the television industry in 1959. During the 1960s and 1970s, helical-scan recording machines were introduced by many manufacturers and marketed all over the world. The technology rapidly took over the market for video recording, due to its reduced complexity, greater reliability, lower manufacturing and servicing costs, lighter weight, lower energy consumption, and more versatile features, {{when compared to the}} <b>quadruplex</b> <b>system.</b> These factors also made it possible eventually to bring video recording to users at home, in a cassette format.|$|E
50|$|Recording {{an entire}} field {{in a single}} pass allows these {{machines}} to play back a viewable still frame when the tape is stopped, and display a viewable image sequence while shuttling forwards or backwards. This greatly facilitates the editing process. The <b>quadruplex</b> <b>systems</b> are unable to display video from tape except while playing at normal speed.|$|R

40|$|The author {{discusses}} some of {{the problems}} of failure-survival automatic flight control systems and suggests some basic ground rules as design criteria. The advantages and disadvantages of {{some of the}} main types of system are discussed duplex, triplex, triple component, duplicate-monitored and <b>quadruplex</b> <b>systems</b> being covered. In particular, a quadruplex actuator is described which has been designed and developed mainly for auto-matic flight control system applications where a very high degree of failure-survival capability is required. A detailed failure analysis of the various systems is carried out and the importance of the electrical and hydraulic supply system configurations and failure rates is brought out...|$|R
50|$|From then {{it became}} clear that 'rotating-head' helical scan {{recorders}} were the way forward with superior sound and picture quality. However the expense of rotating-head machines ($2000 for a machine in 1956) meant that work continued on developing a consumer stationary-head machine for some time with efforts from Akai, GEC and the BBC. The BBC abandoned their VERA system in 1958 in favor of the Ampex <b>quadruplex</b> <b>system,</b> though further research continued with the BBC Research department demonstrating an experimental digital LVR machine in June 1974 which recorded colour television on 42 tracks on a one-inch tape moving at 120 ips.|$|E
5000|$|The early {{machines}} use the Ampex 2 inch <b>quadruplex</b> <b>system</b> {{in which}} the drum has 4 heads and rotates at 14,400 RPM perpendicular to the tape, so the recorded tracks were transverse to the tape axis. With 2-inch tape this requires 16 tracks for a single analog NTSC video frame, or 20 for a PAL frame. Since each track is {{only a fraction of}} a video frame, quadruplex is not capable of modern editing functions like freeze-frame or slow motion. (In fact, the quadruplex format can only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape is playing at normal speed.) But in spite of its drawbacks it remained the broadcasting studio standard until about 1980.|$|E
5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so the tape heads, instead of {{moving across the}} tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the <b>quadruplex</b> <b>system,</b> move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the tape heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|E
50|$|Helical {{scanning}} was {{a logical}} progression beyond an earlier system (pioneered by Ampex) known as quadruplex recording, {{also referred to}} as transverse recording. In this scheme, the rotating head drum runs essentially perpendicular to a 2 in tape, and the slices recorded across the tape are nearly perpendicular to the tape's motion. U.S. <b>quadruplex</b> <b>systems</b> revolve the head drum at 14,400 revolutions per minute (240 revolutions per second) with four heads on the drum so that each television field is broken into 16 stripes on the tape (which requires appropriately complex head-switching logic). By comparison, the longer stripe recorded by a helical-scan recorder usually contains an entire video field and the two-headed drum spins at the frame rate (half the field rate) of the TV system in use.|$|R
40|$|Short {{amplicon}} autosomal short {{tandem repeat}} (Mini-STR) assay {{has proved to}} be a highly useful tool in forensic applications, especially for highly degraded DNA samples that typically result in partial profiles and total loss of information from regular STR amplicons. In this study two new <b>quadruplex</b> <b>systems</b> were designed to get nuclear DNA profile from degraded forensic casework samples. In order to obtain PCR products less than 120 bp in size, primer pairs of eight STR markers, included in available commercially multiplex PCR kits, were redesigned and assembled intwo PCR-multiplexes: D 8 S 1179, D 3 S 1358, TPOX, D 16 S 539 and CSF 1 P 0, TH 01, D 13 S 317, D 5 S 818. After validation, these two Mini-STR quadruplex were employed in paternity testing case that involved DNA extraction from archival postmortem Bouin’s fluid-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue where commercial kit yielded low success. The results obtained with the present Mini-STR PCR-multiplexes proved clearly demonstrating their usefulness in analyzing degraded DNA samples...|$|R
5000|$|While the <b>quadruplex</b> {{recording}} <b>system</b> per se is {{no longer}} in use, the principle evolved into the helical scanning technique used in virtually all video tape machines, such as those using the consumer formats known as VHS and the briefly successful Sony Betamax format. (Sony Betacam was successful as a professional format, but operated with a different recording system and faster tape speed than Betamax.) ...|$|R
50|$|In {{some early}} {{prototype}} linear {{video tape recording}} systems developed in the early 1950s from companies such as Bing Crosby Enterprises, RCA, and the BBC's VERA, the tape speed was extremely high, over 200 in/s, to adequately capture {{the large amount of}} image information. The need for a high linear tape speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now-obsolete professional <b>Quadruplex</b> <b>system</b> from 1956, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called transverse scanning), allowing for the linear tape speed to be much slower. Transverse scanning was superseded by the later technology of helical scanning, which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at an angle across the width of the tape.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{many other}} technologies, {{the cost of}} video editing has {{declined}} by {{an order of magnitude}} or more. The original 2" [...] <b>Quadruplex</b> <b>system</b> cost so much that many television production facilities could only afford a single unit and editing was a highly involved process requiring special training. In contrast to this, nearly any home computer sold since the year 2000 has the speed and storage capacity to digitize and edit standard-definition television (SDTV). The two major retail operating systems include basic video editing software - Apple's iMovie and Microsoft's Windows Movie Maker. Additional options exist, usually as more advanced commercial products. As well as these commercial products, there are opensource video-editing programs. Automatic video editing products have also emerged, opening up video editing to a broader audience of amateurs and reducing {{the time it takes to}} edit videos. These exist usually as media storage services, such as Google with its Google Photos or smaller companies like Vidify.|$|E
5000|$|Work {{had begun}} on {{longitudinal}} video recording {{as early as}} 1950 by the electronics division of entertainer Bing Crosby's production company, Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE), who had pioneered the use of magnetic tape recording for his radio show in the 1940s. [...] BCE gave the world's first demonstration of a videotape recording in Los Angeles on November 11, 1951. Developed by John T. Mullin and Wayne R. Johnson since 1950, the device gave what were described as [...] "blurred and indistinct" [...] images, using a modified Ampex 200 tape recorder and standard quarter-inch (0.6 cm) audio tape moving at 360 inches (9.1 m) per second. [...] A year later, an improved version, using one-inch (2.6 cm) magnetic tape, was shown to the press, who reportedly expressed amazement at {{the quality of the}} images, although they had a [...] "persistent grainy quality that looked like a worn motion picture". Overall, the picture quality was still considered inferior to the best kinescope recordings on film. Bing Crosby Enterprises hoped to have a commercial version available in 1954, but none came forth. BCE demonstrated a color model in February 1955, using a longitudinal recording on half-inch (1.3 cm) tape, essentially similar to what RCA had demonstrated in 1953. CBS, RCA's competitor, was about to order BCE machines when Ampex introduced the superior <b>Quadruplex</b> <b>system</b> (see below).|$|E
50|$|An early {{method used}} to get a higher data rate than the {{prevailing}} linear method was transverse scan. In this method a spinning disk, with the tape heads embedded in the outer edge, is placed perpendicular to {{the path of the}} tape. This method is used in Ampex's DCRsi instrumentation data recorders and the old Ampex <b>quadruplex</b> videotape <b>system.</b> Another early method was arcuate scan. In this method, the heads are on the face of a spinning disk which is laid flat against the tape. The path of the tape heads makes an arc.|$|R
50|$|As {{with the}} first major {{television}} program to be recorded on videotape-- The Edsel Show in 1957, this was a straight recording of a live performance with no editing. Early videotape use was confined largely to rebroadcasting programs from the east coast three hours later in the west, and was a cheaper, better-quality alternative to the film-based kinescopes. The experimental low-band <b>quadruplex</b> recording <b>system</b> in use was troublesome and hard to copy. Furthermore, early video editing was a highly complicated matter that required the engineer to cover the two-inch tape with iron oxide solution to locate the magnetic tracks and then splice it with a razor blade.|$|R
40|$|Structural and {{energetic}} features of arti fi cial DNA quadruplexes consisting of base tetrads and their stacks with Na + /K + ion(s) inside the central pore and incorporating halogenated derivatives of xanthine, 8 - fl uoro- 9 -deazaxanthine (FdaX), 8 - chloro- 9 -deazaxanthine (CldaX), 8 -bromo- 9 -deazaxanthine (BrdaX), or 8 -iodo- 9 -deazaxanthine (IdaX), {{have been investigated}} by modern state-of-the-art computational tools. The DNA (or RNA) quadruplex models based on 8 -halo- 9 -deazaxanthines are predicted to be more stable relative to those with unmodi fi ed xanthine due to the increased stabilizing contributions coming from all three main types of weak interactions (H-bonding, stacking, and ion coordination). Methods for analyzing the electron density are used {{to understand the nature}} of forces determining the stability of the system and to gain a predictive potential. <b>Quadruplex</b> <b>systems</b> incorporating polarizable halogen atoms (chlorine, bromine, or iodine) bene fi t signi fi cantly from the stabilizing stacking between the individual tetrads due to an increased dispersion contribution as compared to xanthine and guanine, natural references used. Ion coordination induces a signi fi cant rearrangement of electron density in the quadruplex stem as visualized by electron deformation density (EDD) and analyzed by ETS-NOCV and Voronoi charges. Na + induces larger electron polarization from the quadruplex toward the ion, whereas K + has a higher propensity to electron sharing (identi fi ed by QTAIM delocalization index). We expect that our results will contribute to the development of novel strategies to further modify and analyze the natural G-quadruplex core...|$|R
50|$|However, by {{this time}} {{it had already been}} {{rendered}} obsolete by the Ampex <b>quadruplex</b> video recording <b>system.</b> This used 5 cm wide tapes running at a speed of 38 cm per second. The rapid tape-to-head speed of quadruplex videotape was achieved by spinning the heads rapidly on a drum: the system used, with variations, on all video tape systems ever since, as well as DAT.|$|R
5000|$|Starting in {{the early}} 1950s, RCA, Bing Crosby and others tried to record analog video on very {{fast-moving}} magnetic tape. As early as 1952, Ampex developed prototype video tape recorders that used a spinning head and relatively slow-moving tape. In early 1956 {{a team led by}} Charles Ginsburg produced the first videotape recorder. [...] A young, 19-year-old engineer Ray Dolby was also part of the team. [...] Ampex demonstrated the VR-1000, which was the first of Ampex's line of 2 inch Quadruplex videotape recorders on April 14, 1956, at the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago. The first magnetically recorded time-delayed television network program using the new Ampex <b>Quadruplex</b> recording <b>system</b> was CBS's Douglas Edwards and the News on November 30, 1956.|$|R
40|$|G-quadruplex {{secondary}} structures, which play {{a structural}} role in repetitive DNA such as telomeres, may {{also play a}} functional role at other genomic locations as targetable regulatory elements which control gene expression. The recent interest in application of <b>quadruplexes</b> in biological <b>systems</b> prompted us to develop a tool for the identification and analysis of quadruplex-forming nucleotide sequences especially in the RNA. Here we present Quadfinder, an online server for prediction and bioinformatics of uni-molecular quadruplex-forming nucleotide sequences.

25|$|The wing {{was unusual}} {{in having a}} shallow sweep on the {{trailing}} edge, giving a fleche planform; the straight leading edge was swept at 54 degrees, with maneuver flaps on the outboard sections. Two piece flaperons occupied most of the trailing edge, which was blended into the fuselage with long fillets. A total of nine flight control surfaces were actuated by a <b>quadruplex</b> fly-by-wire (FBW) <b>system,</b> which lacked any mechanical backup counterpart, providing a factor of aerodynamic instability of between 10 and 12 per cent. The wingtips were cropped and fitted with missile rails to carry Rafael Python 3 air-to-air missile. At 38.5 square meters, the wing area was 38 per cent greater than the F-16, while the aspect ratio was 2.10, barely two-thirds that of the F-16. Development of the wing and fin were the responsibility of Grumman, who were contracted to initially manufacture the first 20 of each.|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{experience}} was acquired with Ada at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility during the on-going High Alpha Technology Program.
