This algorithm has been designed to tackle the resource allocation problem on a communication network. The aim of the problem is to supply all resource requested on a communica-tion network with minimal costs and using a fixed number of providers, everyone with a limited resource <b>quantity</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>supplied.</b> The scheduling of several resource allocations is a classical combinatorial problem that finds many applications in real-world problems. MIA incorporates two deterministic approaches: (1) a local search operator, which is based on the exploration of the neighbourhood; and (2) a deterministic approach for the assignment scheme based on the Depth First Search (DFS) algo-rithm. The results show that the usage of a local search procedure and mainly the DFS algorithm is an effective and efficient approach to bet-ter exploring the complex search space of the problem. To evaluate the performances of MIA we have used 28 different instances. The obtained results suggest that MIA is an effective optimization algorithm in terms {{of the quality of the}} solution produced and of the computational effort...|$|E
40|$|The {{prescriptions}} {{were recorded}} prospectively {{in the medical}} ward at Muhimbili National Hospital and screened for different types of prescribing errors. Of the 400 prescriptions 60 % were prescribed with prescription errors. Errors of omission were 94 % and errors of commission were 6 %. Correct prescription writing habits could have a great influence {{on the fate of}} drug therapy as well as the health of patients. Errors of omission included prescription without patient name, date, name of the clinic where prescription was issued, route of administration, dose frequency, strength, dosage form and <b>quantity</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>supplied.</b> Errors of commission included wrong dosage form, wrong strength and drug—drug interaction. The results of the study show low compliance rate to legal and procedural requirements in prescription writing (high rate of prescribing errors 60 %) - This indicates a need of pharmacists and medical educators to Further emphasize the importance of clear and complete prescription writing. lt also calls for implementation of educational and monitoring programmes to bring more awareness to all prescribers so as to reduce the rate of noncompliance and hence minimize prescribing errors...|$|E
40|$|Draft {{amendments}} to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations do not propose that prescriptions for benzodiazepines and z-drugs be handwritten, according to a clarification from the Department of Health. IMT understands that the clarification came after submissions to the Department presented concerns from doctors {{that they would be}} required to handwrite patients’ names, addresses and dosages when prescribing benzodiazepines and z-drugs. GPs had considered such a move as belonging to “a bygone era” and an unnecessary additional burden on practices already under huge pressures. However, a Department spokesperson told IMT that the only handwriting obligation proposed under the draft regulations in relation to benzodiazepines and z-drugs was where the prescription was to be extended beyond three months’ treatment in order to provide up to six months of treatment and in such cases, it was proposed that a “statement in the practitioner’s handwriting indicating that the quantity prescribed is necessary for the treatment of that patient” was required. In correspondence with doctors, Hawkins House noted that it was proposed that benzodiazepine and z-drug prescriptions would ordinarily be valid for up to a maximum of two months, with a total <b>quantity</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>supplied</b> on the prescription limited to three months, unless the prescriber decided that a patient required treatment for up to six months — triggering the necessity of the hand-written note. Consultation on the Draft Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations 2013 closes today (August 30). Controlling additional benzodiazepines (phenazepam) and z-drugs (zopiclone and zaleplon) is also proposed under the draft amendments, as is the removal of the requirement that methadone prescriptions be handwritten, in line with the recommendation of the HSE’s Introduction of the Opioid Treatment Protocol Report...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{prescriptions}} issued to patients with diabetes by nurse independent and nurse supplementary prescribers working in general practice. A total of 19 prescriptions were collected and assessed from four case-study sites based in general practice between October 2007 and September 2008. Prescriptions were collected from patients with diabetes whose consultations were video recorded {{for the purposes of}} research. Prescriptions were consistently issued on an appropriate computer-generated prescription form, written legibly in ink, used the correct terminology, generic prescribing and contained an accurate/appropriate product dose and preparation. They were less consistent in stating the number of days, <b>quantity</b> of medicine <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>supplied,</b> and providing clear and accurate instructions on frequency and timing of treatment. Nurses in general practice are using computer based repeat prescribing systems to issue prescriptions to patients for the management of diabetes and its common complications, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular disease. Whilst nurse prescribers were generally compliant with good practice in prescription writing, they need to ensure that they include ongoing information with respect to the number of days of treatment, <b>quantity</b> of medicine <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>supplied,</b> and clear and accurate instructions regarding the frequency and timing of medicines...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{examines}} {{the potential for}} applying non-structural fuzzy decision support theory to modelling the negotiation between various participants with conflicting objectives so as to establish the optimum buffer stocks for a construction project. Design/methodology/approach – In view of the divergence in objectives between various decision-makers when determining the amount of materials <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delivered <b>to</b> site, the concept of integrating the Non-Structural Fuzzy Decision Support System (NSFDSS) to multi-attribute decision making is reviewed. With {{the help of a}} case example, the process involved in the NSFDSS and the methodology of evaluation is illustrated. Finally, the paper proposes the use of the Nash criterion to measure the utility of various decision-makers so as to identify an equilibrium solution for the <b>quantity</b> of materials <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>supplied.</b> Findings – The results indicate that the requisite number of on-site stocks can be determined by referring to the utility of the parties involved in decision making. Research limitations/implications – The NFDSS systematically evaluates each scenario under different affected factors such as cost, schedule, quality, safety, etc. Finally, a scenario utility <b>is</b> computed <b>to</b> establish the preferences of each party. Practical implications – NFDSS can systematically analyse human judgments to generate relative weightings for the decision factors and elements. The NFDSS model can <b>be</b> applied <b>to</b> real-world cases to determine the frequency of delivery and the amount of buffer stocks that would meet the requirements of the various project participants...|$|R
