Compiled by Ann L. Shriver and Stefani J. Evers. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The European Common Fisheries Policy landing {{obligation}} has introduced significant uncertainty over <b>quota</b> <b>uptake</b> {{in the coming}} years. This year (2016) is {{the first year of}} the {{landing obligation}} for fleets targeting demersal stocks even though it will not be fully introduced across demersal quota stocks until 2019. A recent Seafish economic impact assessment of the landing obligation for UK fleets targeting demersal stocks highlights the challenges facing fleets in the face the landing obligation. Assuming imperfect allocation of quota, that does not reflect catch composition by fleets, in mixed fisheries fleets, <b>quota</b> <b>uptake</b> could be significantly lower than seen in recent history. Not only this, the landing obligation obliges vessels to land all catch. This will see fish not marketable for human consumption landed and sent for fishmeal or bait for example. This paper considers UK whitefish fleets that predominantly target cod, haddock and whiting and presents an economic impact assessment of the effects of CFP policy on not only the fleets but the markets that they provide for. It also considers the conflict between core objectives of achieving MSY and the landing obligation. Bioeconomic modelling is linked to value chain analysis to evaluate a number of scenarios to inform on the impact of European regulation on the competitiveness and sustainability of the UK whitefish sector in the European context. Initial findings suggest that choke species in 2019 will impact supply of fish to markets significantly, impacting fleets and requiring markets to adjust...|$|E

Since 1983 this has included a system of annual total allowable catches (TACs) for most commercially important stocks within the zone of extended fisheries jurisdiction created by the 200 -mile limits of all the EC Member States with coastlines bordering the North East Atlantic and adjacent seas. The TACs are divided into national catch quotas according to an established allocation mechanism which gives each Member State a fixed percentage share each year (although a number of international quota swaps are regularly undertaken). While the national fishing fleets are subject to certain common input controls under the common fisheries policy (in particular technical conservation measures such as minimum mesh sizes) each Member State is free to determine the means for allocating its quotas and for regulating <b>quota</b> <b>uptake.</b> EC rules do, however, require all vessels of 10 metres or over in length to keep a logbook of their activities which must include details of the quantities of TAC species caught and retained on board and the time and location of capture. Inshore vessels of less than 10 metres long are not obliged to carry logbooks but Member States are still required to monitor their landings to ensure that national quota limits are respected. Figure 1 shows the sea areas surrounding the United Kingdom according to the ICES nomenclature used to denominate fish stocks in the North East Atlantic. The main areas, within which United Kingdom vessels are active, are the North Sea (Area IV), West of Scotland and Rockall (Area VI), the Irish Sea (Area VIIa), the English Channel (Areas VIId and VIIe), the Bristol Channel and South East of Ireland (Areas VIIf and VIIg) and Western Waters (Areas VIIh-k). The main stocks in these waters subject to TACs are listed in Tables 3 and 4...|$|E

We use a mathematical model of phytoplankton with flexible stoichiometry to explain patterns of phytoplankton composition in chemostat experiments and nutrient drawdown dynamics that are found in the field. Exponential growth and equilibrium represent two distinct phases, each amenable to mathematical analysis. In a chemostat at a fixed dilution (growth) rate, phytoplankton stoichiometry matches the nutrient supply stoichiometry over a wide range at low growth rates and over a narrow range at high growth rates. In a chemostat with a fixed nutrient supply stoichiometry, phyto-plankton stoichiometry varies with dilution rate nonlinearly, between the supply stoichiometry at low dilution rates and a species-specific optimal ratio at high dilution rates. The flexible-stoichiometry model we study predicts low equilibrium concentrations of two nutrients over a wide range of supply ratios, contrary to the predictions of a traditional fixed-stoichiometry model. The model is in quantitative agreement with experimental data, except at extreme nutrient supply ratios, which require a negative feedback from <b>quota</b> to <b>uptake</b> to fit the data. Our analysis points to the importance of better understanding the regulation of uptake rates in determining phytoplankton stoi-chiometry and incorporating this knowledge into phytoplankton models. Phytoplankton require multiple nutrients for growth. Knowledge of how multiple nutrients interact to limit growth is essential to understanding the causes of variation in phy-toplankton stoichiometry (Rhee 1978; Goldman et al. 1979), the identity of the nutrient(s) limiting biomass and primary production (Smith 1982), and the effect of resource com-petition on community structure (Tilman 1982). Of particular interest are nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), two macro-nutrients that are commonly thought to limit phytoplankto...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to advance understanding of phosphorus regulation of Microcystis aeruginosa growth, phosphorus uptake and storage in changing phosphorus (P) conditions as would occur in lakes. We hypothesized that Microcystis growth and nutrient uptake would fit classic models by Monod, Droop, and Michaelis-Menten in these changing conditions. Microcystis grown in luxury nutrient concentrations was transferred to treatments with phosphorus concentrations ranging from 0 - 256 μg P∙L- 1 and luxury nitrogen. Dissolved phosphorus concentration, cell phosphorus <b>quota,</b> P <b>uptake</b> rate and cell densities were measured at day 3 and 6. Results showed little relationship to predicted models. Microcystis growth was asymptotically related to P treatment from day 0 - 3, fitting Monod model well, but negatively related to P treatment and cell quota from day 3 - 6. From day 0 - 3, cell quota was negatively related to P treatments at < 2 μg∙L- 1, but increased slightly at higher P. Cell quota decreased greatly in low P treatments from day 3 - 6, which may have enabled high growths in low P treatments. P uptake was positively and linearly related to P treatment during both periods. Negative uptake rates and increases in measured culture phosphorus concentrations to 5 μg∙L- 1 in the lowest P treatments indicated P leaked from cells into culture medium. This leakage during early stages of the experiment may have been sufficient to stimulate metabolism and use of intracellular P stores in low P treatments for rapid growth. Our study shows P regulation of Microcystis growth can be complex as a result of changing P concentrations, and this complexity may be important for modeling Microcystis for nutrient and ecosystem management...|$|R
