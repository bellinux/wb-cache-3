2500|$|On September 18, 2015, T.I. {{announced}} his departure from Columbia Records. In {{an interview with}} HitsDailyDouble.com, he addressed his situation: [...] "Having just exited my deal at Columbia, I was a rogue artist, busting creativity, just waiting to put music in the marketplace, so while I'm sorting out my next situation, I'm blessed {{enough to be able}} to control my destiny and put music out as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> want to, and was able to release a Tip album, which I had wanted to do for a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} morning, {{the lead}} {{elements of the}} British 7th Armoured Division entered Villers-Bocage. They {{had been given the}} objective of exploiting the gap in the front line, seizing Villers-Bocage, and capturing the nearby ridge (Point 213) to attempt to force a German withdrawal. The British arrival surprised Wittmann, as he had not expected them so soon. He reported afterwards that he had no time to assemble his company: [...] "Instead I had to act <b>quickly,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had to assume that the enemy had already spotted me and would destroy me where I stood." [...] Having given instructions for the rest to hold their ground, he set off with one tank.|$|E

6000|$|... "This is {{a pretty}} piece of business," [...] cried Harry. [...] "I didn't expect the creek to get up so <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> this. <b>I</b> was down here yesterday, and it hadn't risen at all. I tell you, Harvey, you ought {{to live on the}} other side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, hush!" [...] said Deronda, {{in a tone}} of authority; [...] "quiet yourself." [...] Then to the men {{who were}} {{assisting}} her, [...] "I am a connection of this lady's husband. If you will get her on to the Italia <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> possible, <b>I</b> will undertake everything else." ...|$|R
2500|$|In January 2007, a {{resolution}} was approved in the House of Representatives opposing President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. Bachmann voted [...] "No". However, before supporting the proposed surge, Bachmann {{called for a}} full hearing, saying, [...] "The American people deserve to hear and understand the merits of increasing U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Increased troop presence is justifiable if that measure would bring a swift conclusion to a difficult conflict." [...] She hesitated to give a firm endorsement, calling the hearings [...] "a good first step in explaining to the American people the course toward victory in Iraq". When pressed, {{she said she had}} not come to any conclusion on the matter, saying, [...] "I don't believe we have all of the information in front of us. As a member of Congress that's why I want to go to Iraq as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> can. I want to get the best information in front of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{title track}} was written as an afterthought. [...] As drummer Bill Ward explains: [...] "We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony (Iommi) just played the guitar lick {{and that was}} it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom." [...] In the liner notes to the 1998 live album Reunion, bassist Geezer Butler recounts to Phil Alexander that they wrote the song [...] "in five minutes, then I sat down and wrote the lyrics as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could. [...] It was all done in about two hours." [...] According to Alexander, [...] "Paranoid" [...] "crystallized the band's writing process, with Iommi {{initiating}} the ideas with his charred riffs, Ozzy (Osbourne) working on a melody, Geezer providing drive {{and the majority of}} the lyrics, and Bill Ward locking into a set of often pounding rhythms beneath Butler's bass rumble." [...] The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{shall have}} to clear away for the dance," [...] added Stubby, [...] "so {{we want to get}} the feast over with <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> possible. <b>I</b> hope you are all hungry, for Algy has spread himself on this dinner and we are to have every {{delicacy}} the ranch affords, regardless of expense.

6000|$|... "Please let me speak," [...] he said. [...] "It {{is rather}} important. Mr. Syme," [...] he continued, turning to his opponent, [...] "we are {{fighting}} today, if I remember right, because you expressed a wish (which I thought irrational) to pull my nose. Would you oblige me by pulling my nose now <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> possible? <b>I</b> {{have to catch}} a train." ...|$|R
6000|$|This is explanatory. If Porter, Heintzelman, and Sigel {{were sent}} you, it would sweep {{everything}} {{from the other side}} of the river, because the new troops have been distributed among them, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> understand.

6000|$|... "Do you know, Thurnall, I fancy {{at moments}} that {{my mind is}} not what it was. Fancies flit from me <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> they come. <b>I</b> had twenty verses five minutes ago, and now I cannot {{recollect}} one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's my fault," [...] he declared. [...] "The words {{all seem}} to be {{tumbling}} out anyhow and I don't {{know how to put}} them in the right order. Can't you see that I love you, Geraldine? I want you to be my wife, and I want to get right away <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> can. Why not America?

60|$|Hastening {{away from}} {{the shadows of the}} {{formidable}} pile I made for the first crossroad, intending to strike the central turnpike <b>as</b> <b>quickly</b> <b>as</b> possible.

6000|$|...
