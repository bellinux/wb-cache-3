5|$|Access to {{improved}} sanitation is also universal, either through sewers or on-site sanitation. All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> remarkably good at 3–10mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, {{well below the}} national effluent standard of 20mg/l.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{character}} of Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's play The Rivals, the name Simon Pure soon became a noun for a quality in a person. In Mrs. Malaprop's case, that <b>quality</b> <b>was</b> incorrect usage of a word by substituting a similar-sounding word with different meaning, usually with comic effect. In Simon's case, that <b>quality</b> <b>was</b> authenticity and in Simon's impersonator's case, that <b>quality</b> <b>was</b> hypocrisy.|$|R

5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal. They can become quite attached to their family, regardless of the ages of the family members. Russian Toys are usually very reserved with strangers, but very loyal to their owners, always ready to protect them from any perceived danger.|$|E
5|$|Evolving {{even further}} from metalcore comes mathcore, a more rhythmically {{complicated}} and progressive style {{brought to light}} by bands such as The Dillinger Escape Plan, Converge, and Protest the Hero. Mathcore's main defining <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> the use of odd time signatures, and has been described to possess rhythmic comparability to free jazz.|$|E
5|$|Monster CEO Noel Lee {{claims the}} average {{consumer}} {{may not be able}} to tell the difference on-screen, but that Monster's video cables have higher bandwidth, are future-proofed, are more durable and that they perform better over long distances. Many reviewers stress in turn that Monster cables are not needed for lower-resolution televisions or over short distances and that the difference in audio <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> not substantial enough.|$|E

5|$|The DVD {{includes}} stereo, Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 {{sound and}} presents the video {{in its original}} 1.33:1 aspect ratio. An error in the sound mix on this DVD left much of Peter Frampton's guitar playing scarcely audible. Pegg claimed that as a result, although the picture <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> superior on the DVD release, the original VHS or 1999 DVD remain a superior choice for audio.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquifers}} of shallow wells with depths varying from , yielding {{little more}} than 2 cubic metres/hour (71 cu ft), vary widely in availability. Deeper aquifers offer larger quantities of water, but its <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> generally brackish. The wadis are generally dry, usually only inundated after rainfall.|$|E
5|$|They are a {{hardy breed}} {{due to their}} native environment, the Highlands of Scotland. This results in long hair, giving the breed its ability to overwinter. Bulls can weigh up to 800kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows up to 500kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk {{generally}} has a very high butterfat content, and their meat, regarded as of the highest <b>quality,</b> <b>is</b> gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the urban}} portion of Elliot Lake, the highway is locally {{maintained}} under a Connecting Link agreement. It passes the Nuclear Mining Museum and the Mount Dufour ski resort {{before leaving the}} community and crossing {{the eastern end of}} the geographic Elliot Lake. From this point to the northern terminus of the highway, the route provides access to several mines that dot the surrounding areas. Immediately south of Quirke Mine Road, Highway108 becomes Secondary Highway639; the centre lane ends and the pavement <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> visibly reduced.|$|E
5|$|A {{considerable}} leap in <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> evident here, {{compared to}} the Apostles {{of the church of}} Santa Maria dei Miracoli that had been carved just a few years earlier. The cycle of the Caesars is not only considerably grander in size but also a notable qualitative improvement over the previous production. The presence of these Caesars on the façade of the Loggia in Brescia is testament of an architectural and figurative leap, a full expression of classical art that has climbed from the earlier experiments at the Miracoli. Cairano, through the creation of the cycle and subsequent architectural ornamentation of the Loggia palazzo, becomes the fulcrum of commissions, both public and private, from Brescians keen to show off their descent from ancient Rome and to ride the wave of the local Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|A second {{option is}} to {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{increased}} educational access, enrollment rates more than doubled between 1996 and 2006. However, education <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> weak, producing high rates of grade repetition and dropout. Education policy in Ravalomanana's second term focused on quality issues, including an increase in minimum education standards for the recruitment of primary teachers from a middle school leaving certificate (BEPC) to a high school leaving certificate (BAC), and a reformed teacher training program to support the transition from traditional didactic instruction to student-centered teaching methods to boost student learning and participation in the classroom. Public expenditure on education was 13.4percent of total government expenditure and 2.9percent of GDP in 2008. Primary classrooms are crowded, with average pupil to teacher ratios of 47:1 in 2008.|$|E
5|$|At its widest aperture, the {{sharpness}} {{does not}} meet the 1800 threshold at either 8mm (1572, f/4.5) or 12mm (1356, f/5), but at 16mm (f/5.6) it achieves over 2000 lines per picture height. However, stopping down improves the sharpness at all focal lengths, according to PC Magazine. At 8mm, 1800 is reached at f/8, while at 12mm it is still only at 1509 by f/8. The image <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> asymmetric with better performance on the right side. At 8mm and f/4.5, it has 1 blur unit in the center and 1.5 in the corners. Although the images are slightly sharper at f/5.6, SLR Gear claims sharpness declines significantly at f/11 to almost 2 blur units with further stopping down increasing blur to 3.5 at f/22. At the longer focal lengths for this lens, stopping down to f/29 yields a 5 blur unit result.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{graduation}} all officers are qualified for operational service. However, each employee must undergo 40 hours of yearly training, including firearms practice, to keep their operational certification. Without this, they cannot patrol, use firearms or participate in actions. Forty-four percent of police officers in 2012 lacked such certification. The main {{reason is that the}} police districts see it as a waste of resources to train investigation and administrative staff which do not participate in operative duty, and that a higher <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> achieved through specialization of tasks, such as dedicated investigation personnel.|$|E

5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{measurement}} the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency. Both the area from the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the area from Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality. The area from Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical quality, poor for ecological quality and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate for ecological quality, as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} widely practiced {{treatments}} for speech disorders associated with Parkinson's disease is the Lee Silverman voice treatment (LSVT). Speech therapy and specifically LSVT may improve speech. Occupational therapy (OT) aims to promote health and quality of life by helping people with the disease to participate in as many of their daily living activities as possible. There have been few studies on the effectiveness of OT and their <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> poor, although there is some indication that it may improve motor skills and quality of life {{for the duration of the}} therapy.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have also}} found {{significant}} levels of toxins in fish and the waters they inhabit within the basin. Accumulation of toxins in fish threatens the survival of fish species, and human consumption of these fish can lead to health problems. Water <b>quality</b> <b>is</b> also {{an important factor in}} the survival of other wildlife and plants that grow in the Columbia River drainage basin. The states, Indian tribes, and federal government are all engaged in efforts to restore and improve the water, land, and air quality of the Columbia River drainage basin and have committed to work together to enhance and accomplish critical ecosystem restoration efforts. A number of cleanup efforts are currently underway, including Superfund projects at Portland Harbor, Hanford, and Lake Roosevelt.|$|E
