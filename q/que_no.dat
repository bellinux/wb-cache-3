500|$|However, beyond abolition, {{proposals}} for autonomy were voted down, as were other petitions {{to limit the}} unlimited power the governor general would have upon virtually all aspects of life in Puerto Rico. Once the Junta members returned to Puerto Rico, they met with local community leaders in a famed meeting at the Hacienda El Cacao in Carolina, Puerto Rico in early 1865. Betances was invited by Ruiz and did attend. After listening to the Junta members' list of voted-down measures, Betances stood up and retorted: [...] "Nadie puede dar lo <b>que</b> <b>no</b> tiene" [...] (No one can give others what they don't have for themselves), a phrase that he would constantly use {{through the rest of}} his life when referring to Spain's unwillingness to grant Puerto Rico or Cuba any reforms. He would then suggest setting up a revolt and proclaim independence as soon as possible. Many of the meeting's attendants sided with Betances, to the horror of Acosta.|$|E

500|$|Dónde Están los Ladrones? {{comprises}} Latin pop {{and rock}} en Español styles. The album opens with [...] "Ciega, Sordomuda", which is musically filled by typical Mexican trumpets over a disco dance loop and an electric guitar. Second track [...] "Si Te Vas" [...] lyrically depicts an angry Shakira who tells her lover [...] "Si me cambias por esa bruja, pedazo de cuero, no vuelvas nunca más, <b>que</b> <b>no</b> estaré aquí". The next song, [...] "Moscas en la Casa", {{was inspired by}} the singer's troubled relationship with Puerto Rican actor Osvaldo Ríos. Shakira lyrically expresses the sadness that she feels after a broken relationship. [...] "Mis días sin ti son tan oscuros, tan largos, tan grises, mis días sin ti", she sings. In the next track [...] "No Creo", the singer expresses how she believes in nothing and nobody except her lover. The song references popular socially accepted or non-accepted norms such as herself, luck, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Venus and Mars, and Brian Weiss. The fifth song on Dónde Están los Ladrones? is [...] "Inevitable". Lyrically, in the hard rock ballad, Shakira confesses that she does not know how to prepare coffee, does not understand soccer, that she must have been unfaithful at some point and that she never wears watch. The next track [...] "Octavo Día" [...] is a rock-oriented song that refers to God coming to Earth after finishing his work and discovering everything to be in ruins, and decides to quit his job and become a normal man. She also namechecks Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson.|$|E
