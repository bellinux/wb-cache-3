Policy changes often have to be made without sufficient information about either the current environment or the consequences of change. NATSEM specialises in analysing data and producing models so that decision-makers have the best possible quantitative information upon which to base their decisions. NATSEM has an international reputation as a centre of excellence for the analysis of microdata and the construction of microsimulation models. Such data and models commence with the records of real (but unidentifiable) Australians. Analysis typically begins by looking at either the characteristics of or the impact of a policy change on an individual household, building up to the bigger picture by looking at many individual cases through the use of large datasets. It must be emphasised that NATSEM does not have views on policy: all opinions are the authors ’ own and are not necessarily shared by NATSEM or its core funders...|$|E
40|$|Underpricing {{has become}} a subject for various {{examinations}} in initial public offerings (IPO) context. Underpricing is {{known as one of}} three anomalies surrounding IPO setting. A number of theories have been put forward to explain why such phenomenon occurs. One of them is that underpricing is used as a signal of firm quality, hoping that when the firm is going to reissue stock in the future, namely right issue or seasoned equity offerings (SEO), it will gain positive response from the market. This study aims at examining a sample of 85 IPOs and SEOs whether underpricing could signal firm quality when making right issue during 1990 - 2006 at the Indonesian Stock Exchange. Consistent with other capital market studies, results show that, on average, IPO firms are significantly underpriced as much as 22. 35 percent, whilst for SEOs the average underpricing is 13. 35 percent. The level of underpricing between IPOs and SEOs is not significantly different from zero. IPO firms experiencing higher underpricing will experience lower underpricing in SEO. Overall, the finding does not support the hypothesis that IPO underpricing is used as signal for firm <b>quality</b> <b>undertaking</b> SEO...|$|E

40|$|Background Recent breast implant {{complications}} {{led to a}} UK {{government policy}} review of the evidence concerning cosmetic interventions. We synthesised cosmetic intervention research evidence covering psychosocial factors associated with requesting procedures and psychological outcomes, effects of procedures on psychological outcomes, preintervention assessments for identifying those at risk, alternative therapy effectiveness, and issues in achieving informed consent. Methods Undertaking a systematic rapid evidence assessment, six databases and three journals were searched. Included studies were systematic reviews or primary studies of participants requesting cosmetic procedures; published 2002 – 2012; containing either psychological or psychosocial measures, a psychological outcome, or evaluation of informed consent. Reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed <b>quality,</b> <b>undertaking</b> narrative synthesis. Results Methodological quality of the included 13 systematic reviews and 179 primary studies was low, with wide variation in psychosocial measures. Findings suggest several psychosocial factors (e. g., intimate partner violence) {{may be associated with}} requesting cosmetic surgery. Multiple factors (e. g., unrealistic expectations) may predict poor psychological outcomes. Current psychological screening tools focus predominantly on body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) symptoms. Psychological and pharmacological interventions are effective alternative BDD treatments. Patients and doctors bring different needs to informed consent discussions, inconsistently matched to those required by professional ethics, litigation risk, and facilitating profit. Conclusions Systematically reviewing this literature for UK policy has highlighted that some groups may be at risk of poor post-cosmetic procedure outcomes. Practitioners and patients must explore reasons for seeking cosmetic procedures and discuss all potential results and alternative solutions. Future research should employ more robust methodologies to identify effects in those at risk, led by consensus on a core set of psychological outcomes.

40|$|A new Global Digital Elevation Model {{is being}} {{generated}} at 30 " resolution {{by combining the}} best available ground truth with a unique global database of satellite altimeter derived heights. This model, ACE (Altimeter Corrected Elevations) demonstrates radically improved spatial accuracy and resolution over {{large parts of the}} globe, in particular over Africa and South America. The independent altimeter based dataset, which contains over 100 million individual height estimates, has enabled the identification and correction of gross errors in individual ground truth datasets. Source data of low spatial resolution have been replaced with greatly improved altimeter generated surfaces. Additionally, the use of this satellite derived near-global dataset of very high vertical accuracy, referenced to a single datum, has allowed the identification, measurement and correction of the vertical offsets between adjacent tiles of DTED data, widely reported by users of previous models. The result is a model in which a significant proportion of the earth's land surface is represented by a completely new dataset: {{this is especially true of}} areas for which previous models have drawn on Digital Chart of the World. Adjoining ground based datasets of good quality have also been adjusted for vertical misplacement.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} for {{the award}} {{of the degree}} of Masters in Business Administration Health Care Management (MBA-HCM) Introduction: Purchasing of healthcare services is a critical component of healthcare financing. The purchasing mechanism adopted is the key to making health providers deliver better <b>quality,</b> <b>undertake</b> prevention programs that {{have an impact on the}} health of a population and manage healthcare costs. With serious efficiency challenges facing health systems there has been a greater drive to practice strategic purchasing as an efficiency goal in the use of scarce resources. An emerging agenda is how healthcare services could be purchased more strategically to promote quality in service delivery, manage expenditure growth and promote efficiency in service delivery. The study explored the purchasing arrangements for the teacher‟s medical scheme. Methodology: This was an exploratory qualitative study utilizing purposive sampling for the fund managers of the teachers‟ medical scheme and convenience sampling for the beneficiaries of the scheme. Participants were consented and in-depth interview guides used to collect data. Four fund managers and six beneficiaries were interviewed to a point where data saturation was attained. Data was analyzed using thematic content approach with predetermined themes on purchasing. Purchasing elements were compared against the actions of an ideal strategic purchaser and other purchasing actions. Results: The teachers‟ medical scheme has a well-articulated benefit package, uses limited capitation and fee for service as the provider payment mechanisms, contracts providers based on their regional distribution and through accreditation process and utilizes private providers only. Key strategic actions implemented include use of drug formularies, fraud monitoring and providers performance monitoring. Other practices include irregular payment of providers and lack of benefit updates with changing trends and alignment to populations‟ needs. Conclusion: There is limited strategic purchasing being practiced within the teachers‟ medical scheme especially with regard to the design of the benefit package and provider payment mechanisms...|$|R
