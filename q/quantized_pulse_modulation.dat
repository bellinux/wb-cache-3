However, many instrument or system applications require not only a fixed frequency signal but also various modulation functions ranging from simple pulse, amplitude, frequency and phase modulation to complex digital modulation formats. Although modulators are usually realized as external devices, {{they can also be}} incorporated into a frequency synthesizer core. Inside any synthesizer there are many circuits that can carry multiple functions and be reused to increase the functionality without a significant increase in cost. This results in a more cost efficient and versatile design. The most commonly used modulation schemes are briefly reviewed in this article.
