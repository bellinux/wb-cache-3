60|$|All {{these and}} many more things must be learned slowly {{at the expense of}} many failures, {{especially}} when the cubs took to hunting alone and the old wolves were not there to show them how; but they never forgot the principle taught in that first rabbit drive,--that two hunters are better than one to outwit any game when they hunt intelligently together. That is why you so often find wolves going in pairs; and when you study them or follow their tracks you discover that they play continually into each other's hands. They seem to share the spoil as intelligently as they catch it, the wolf that lies beside the runway and pulls down the game giving up a portion gladly to the companion that beats the bush, and rarely indeed is there any trace of <b>quarreling</b> <b>between</b> them.|$|E

In the 9th century the Varangians from Scandinavia conquered the proto-Slavic tribes on the territory of today's Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia and {{laid the groundwork for}} the Kievan Rus’ state. The ancestors of the Ukrainian nation such as Polianians had {{an important role in the}} development and culturalization of Kievan Rus’ state. The internecine wars between Rus' princes, which began after the death of Yaroslav the Wise, led to the political fragmentation of the state into a number of principalities. The <b>quarreling</b> <b>between</b> the princes left Kievan Rus’ vulnerable to foreign attacks, and the invasion of the Mongols in 1236. and 1240. finally destroyed the state. Another important state in the history of the Ukrainians is Kingdom of Galicia-Volhynia (1199-1349).|$|E

By 1096 the Counts of Dillingen also included Count of Kyburg {{as one of}} their titles. By 1180 the family split into two lines, the Kyburgs and the Dillingens. The county expanded when the male line of the Counts of Lenzburg went extinct in 1173, followed by the Counts of Zähringen in 1218. From the Zähringen lands they inherited the cities of Thun, Burgdorf and Fribourg. Over the following decades they founded a number of towns including; Diessenhofen, Winterthur, Zug, Baden, Frauenfeld, Aarau, Mellingen, Lenzburg, Sursee, Weesen, Laupen, Richensee, Wangen an der Aare and Huttwil. [...] However, in 1250, <b>quarreling</b> <b>between</b> Hartmann IV and his nephew Hartmann V led to dividing the county in half. Hartmann IV (the Elder) received the original County of Kyburg and all the Kyburg lands east of the Reuss river while Hartmann V (the Younger) received everything west of the Reuss as well as Zug and Arth.|$|E

We all know that if we go downtown or to a large apartment building, we can find dozens of open access points to log on to. In fact Philadelphia, San Francisco, and our own Roanoke have rolled out city-wide WiFi services. So even before the wide-scale deployments of 3 G and WiMAX systems high speed data services are already ubiquitous. While WiFi coverage has become less of a problem, external network interference has emerged as a significant problem as the networks fight for access to a limited number of channels (and frequently, the same channel!). In theory, this interference problem could be ameliorated by applying a frequency reuse pattern to the networks – a seemingly easily implemented approach as 802. 11 b has three nonoverlapping channels (1, 6, and 11) and 802. 11 a has eight minimally interfering channels in the US (nineteen in Europe...|$|E
