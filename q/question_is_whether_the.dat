25|$|Assuming that an indeterministic {{interpretation}} {{of quantum mechanics}} is correct, one may still object that such indeterminism is {{for all practical purposes}} confined to microscopic phenomena. This is not always the case: many macroscopic phenomena are based on quantum effects. For instance, some hardware random number generators work by amplifying quantum effects into practically usable signals. A more significant <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> indeterminism of quantum mechanics allows for the traditional idea of free will (based on a perception of free will). If a person's action is, however, only result of complete quantum randomness, and mental processes as experienced have no influence on the probabilistic outcomes (such as volition), this in itself would mean that such traditional free will does not exist (because the action was not controllable by the physical being who claims to possess the free will).|$|E
500|$|Thio Li-ann has {{expressed}} {{the view that}} Phang J.A.'s approach in Eng Foong Ho leaves room for judicial clarification. An important <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> [...] "intentional and arbitrary discrimination" [...] test, which implies {{the lack of any}} rationality, is the sole test for proving that an executive act violates Article 12, or only one possible test. If it is the only test, then the need to prove the absence of rationality is excessively onerous for the plaintiff to satisfy, compared to the [...] "reasonable classification" [...] test. She posits that it is preferable for both the [...] "intentional and arbitrary discrimination" [...] test and the [...] "reasonable classification" [...] test to apply to executive acts.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the moderately negative feedback {{the third and fourth}} seasons received, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said of the fifth season: [...] "Overall, it feels more like the good old days than Grey's Anatomy has in a long time." [...] Misha Davenport from the Chicago Sun-Times said season five [...] "hits on all the things the show does so well", adding: [...] "There is romance, heartbreak, humor and a few moments that will move fans to tears." [...] Brian Lowry of Variety, less impressed, opinionated that the season five displayed the show running out of storylines. Speaking of the sixth season, Bianco of USA Today wrote: [...] "Grey's has always loved grand gestures. You like them or you don't; the only real <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> show pulls them off or it doesn't. This year, it did." ...|$|E
500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment. [...] There are two commonly used methods for assessing the level of consciousness of a patient: a simple procedure that requires minimal training, and a more complex procedure that requires substantial expertise. [...] The simple procedure begins by asking whether the patient is able to move and react to physical stimuli. [...] If so, the next <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> patient can respond {{in a meaningful way}} to questions and commands. [...] If so, the patient is asked for name, current location, and current day and time. [...] A patient who can answer all of these questions is said to be [...] "alert and oriented times four" [...] (sometimes denoted [...] "A" [...] on a medical chart), and is usually considered fully conscious.|$|E
500|$|Legislation for {{a silver}} fifty-cent piece {{and a gold}} one-dollar piece in {{commemoration}} of the 150th anniversaries of the Battle of Bennington and of the independence of Vermont {{was introduced in the}} Senate by that state's Frank Greene on January 9, 1925. Greene had not always been a friend to commemorative coins: when the Monroe Doctrine Centennial half dollar was debated in 1922, he commented, [...] "the <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> United States Government {{is going to go on}} from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." [...] His bill was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. Greene, a member of that committee, reported the bill back to the Senate on January 20, with an amendment and a recommendation that it pass. The amendment deleted the proposed one-dollar piece and increased the mintage of the half dollar from 20,000 to 40,000. On January 24, New Hampshire's George H. Moses, acting on Greene's behalf, moved that the Senate consider the bill, and it passed that body without opposition.|$|E

500|$|Nouns are inflected {{for one of}} {{the eight}} cases and for possession. Verbs are inflected {{for one of the}} eight moods and for the number and person of its subject and object. Both nouns and verbs have complex derivational morphology. Basic word order in {{transitive}} clauses is subject–object–verb. Subordination of clauses is done by the use of special subordinate moods. A so-called fourth-person category enables switch-reference between main clauses and subordinate clauses with different subjects. Greenlandic is notable for its lack of a system of grammatical tense, as temporal relations are normally expressed through context, through the use of temporal particles such as [...] "yesterday" [...] or [...] "now" [...] or sometimes through the use of derivational suffixes or the combination of affixes with aspectual meanings with the semantic aktionsart of different verbs. However, some linguists have suggested that Greenlandic does mark future tense obligatorily. Another <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> language has noun incorporation, or whether the processes that create complex predicates that include nominal roots are derivational in nature.|$|E
500|$|Realizing that Congress {{might not}} pass {{legislation}} for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event {{with a major}} anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin. [...] The obvious candidate was the Boston Tea Party of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode [...] "could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles". On December18, 1922, California Congressman Walter Franklin Lineberger introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks) given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value. [...] Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, {{out of the hands}} of European powers. [...] The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, and in the Senate by Vermont's Frank Greene, who stated, [...] "it seems to me that the question is not one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. The <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> United States government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry." [...] Despite these objections, the bill was enacted on January24, 1923; a mintage of 300,000pieces was authorized.|$|E

2500|$|Qualified {{immunity}} requires [...] "notice" [...] of illegality: The legal <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> official had {{notice of}} the illegality of his actions.

2500|$|Another {{unanswered}} <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> polydendrocyte pool eventually becomes depleted {{after they}} are used to generate remyelinating cells. [...] Clonal analysis of isolated polydendrocytes in the normal mouse forebrain suggests that in the adult, most clones originating from single polydendrocytes consist of either a heterogeneous population containing both oligodendrocytes and polydendrocytes or consist exclusively of polydendrocytes, suggesting that polydendrocytes in the adult CNS are able to self-renew and are not depleted under normal conditions.

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the tribal name is uncertain.
