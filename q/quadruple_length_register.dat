The register file is designed using the low-latency block RAMs found in high-density FPGAs like the Xilinx Virtex- 4. The latency of the register file and its utilization of FPGA resources are evaluated with respect to design parameters that in-clude word <b>length,</b> <b>register</b> file size, and number of read and write ports. Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility, performance, and area efficiency of our proposed register file architecture. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The URINO trial {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} offering treatment to older women with urinary incontinence in the general population, who had not sought help on their own initiative. Study design. In a cluster randomized trial, 14 general practitioners were matched into pairs and randomly allocated to an intervention or a control group. Women aged = 55 years registered in the participating practices were asked about urinary incontinence via a postal questionnaire. Patients in the intervention group were assessed and treated whereas patients {{in the control group}} received standard care. Main outcome measures. Primary outcome was improvement (yes or no) of the severity of symptoms at 12 -month follow-up measured with the Incontinence Severity Index. Secondary outcomes were the number of incontinence episodes per day and quality of life. The primary analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis with multiple imputation of missing data. A logistic regression model with correction for cluster randomization was fitted to estimate odds ratios (ORs). Results. At 12 months, the severity of symptoms had improved in more patients in the intervention group (n <b>quadruple</b> bond; <b>length</b> as m-dash 166) than in the controls (n <b>quadruple</b> bond; <b>length</b> as m-dash 184) (OR 1. 9; 95 % CI 1. 1 – 3. 3). Also, the number of patients with fewer episodes of incontinence had increased (OR 2. 5; 95 % CI 1. 5 – 4. 1). No between-group differences in changes in quality of life were apparent (p <b>quadruple</b> bond; <b>length</b> as m-dash 0. 14). Conclusions. It is recommended to encourage women in the general population aged = 55 years with urinary incontinence to undergo diagnosis and treatment...|$|R

40|$|A {{frequency}} sampling filter {{which is}} a finite impulse response digital filter uses a recursive structure that requires exact pole zero cancellation on the unit circle. When implemented with digital technology, errors due to finite <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> and finite precision arithmetic can prevent exact pole zero cancellation making the filter unstable. To guarantee stability, the poles and zeros on the unit circle are moved to {{a circle of radius}} r where 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1. Most frequency sampling filter design techniques determine optimal frequency responses for r = 1 and then chose a value of r, 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1, near to 1 so that the filter 2 ̆ 7 s frequency response does not differ significantly. Recently, other techniques have been presented that determine optimal frequency responses for 0 3 ̆c r 3 ̆c 1. In this paper, the fixed point roundoff noise of Type 1 and Type 2 frequency sampling filters is determined as a function of <b>register</b> <b>length,</b> time and the value of r.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{designing}} a digital filter, the coefficients of the transfer function are normally evaluated {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. To implement the designed filter in hardware, finite word <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> have to be utilized. This may bring about truncation of the filter coefficients to the limited word <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> employed, which in turn may affect the total response of the digital filter. To remedy this, filters are designed with the finite word length coefficients. In this thesis a review of existing techniques for the design of integer coefficients 1 -D FIR filters is presented. Where possible extension of these techniques to 2 -D are also presented. In this thesis two design methods for 1 -D and 2 -D FIR filter with integer coefficients based on the suboptimal approach of discretization and reoptimization techniques are presented. These two approaches are somewhat modified versions of the well known branch and bound optimization technique. This thesis also presents a technique for the design of 1 -D and 2 -D FIR filters with integer coefficients using Mixed integer linear programming. Delta modulation is also employed for a new filter structure for 1 -D FIR filter with its coefficients being $-$ 1, 0, and + 1. McClallan transformation is used for designing a class of 2 -D FIR filters with integer coefficients and a suitable realization structure. In this thesis, we also present a comparison of various techniques we have proposed in terms of complexity of the design issue, as well as the computational burden for each iteration.

This study analyzed some aspects of the reproductive biology of Poecilia sphenops from the Emiliano Zapata Reservoir, in Central Mexico. Specimens were collected using a 20 m-long seine with a 5 mm mesh size, from January to December 2006. A total of 581 specimens were collected: 407 females (70. 0 %), 83 males (14. 3 %) and 91 individuals with no differentiated sex (15. 7 %). Fish ranged from 20 to 96 mm in total length and 0. 01 to 13. 07 g in body weight. The female to male sex ratio (4. 9 : 1) deviated significantly from the unity (&# 967; 2 = 214. 2, p< 0. 05).
