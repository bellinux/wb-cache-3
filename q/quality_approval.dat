40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has adopted {{the use of}} third party quality management certification as the main <b>quality</b> <b>approval</b> mechanism for its supply base. In addition, most organisations have a system of supplier monitoring to measure their existing supplier's performance and this approach {{makes it difficult for}} suppliers to gain new business because their quality capability is unknown to the customer. Two case studies were conducted {{to determine whether or not}} suppliers certified to one of the automotive quality management standards had improved quality performance compared to those with the generic ISO 9001 / 2 standard. The research concluded that the additional certification requirements and increased costs associated with the automotive standards resulted in no quality benefit. Furthermore, a third case study using second party quality assessment results demonstrated that there was no correlation between these audit results and achieved quality performance. Therefore the research set out to answer the question : How can the current supplier selection practices used within the {{automotive industry}} be improved to ensure effective decision-making? The Supplier Performance Evaluation Datasheet (SPED) process was developed from a synthesis of current practice and input from industry experts. It incorporates adaptations of best practices in non-quality assessment methods. Three key elements of the SPED process are: - Performance reporting - Minimum performance standards - Stakeholder engagement The proposed process was evaluated through two case studies at Cosworth Technology Ltd and from an expert opinion survey of industry experts in the field of supplier management. The conclusion of this study was that the SPED process would enable customers to select new suppliers with high levels of confidence. It would add value to all organisations taking part and it is easy to implement. Ia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Evidence-based {{decision}} making relies on {{easy access to}} trustworthy research results. The Cochrane Library is a key source of evidence {{about the effect of}} interventions and aims to "promote the accessibility of systematic reviews to anyone wanting {{to make a decision about}} health care". We explored how health professionals found, used and experienced The Library, looking at facets of user experience including findability, usability, usefulness, credibility, desirability and value. Methods We carried out 32 one-hour usability tests on participants from Norway and the UK. Participants both browsed freely and attempted to perform individually tailored tasks while "thinking aloud". Sessions were recorded and viewed in real time by researchers. Transcriptions and videos were reviewed by one researcher and one designer. Findings reported here reflect issues receiving a high degree of saturation and that we judge to be critical to the user experience of evidence-based web sites, based on principles for usability heuristics, web guidelines and evidence-based practice. Results Participants had much difficulty locating both the site and its contents. Non-native English speakers were at an extra disadvantage when retrieving relevant documents despite high levels of English-language skills. Many participants displayed feelings of ineptitude, alienation and frustration. Some made serious mistakes in correctly distinguishing between different information types, for instance reviews, review protocols, and individual studies. Although most expressed a high regard for the site's credibility, some later displayed a mistrust of the independence of the information. Others were overconfident, thinking everything on The Cochrane Library site shared the same level of <b>quality</b> <b>approval.</b> Conclusion Paradoxically, The Cochrane Library, established to support easy access to research evidence, has its own problems of accessibility. Health professionals' experiences of this and other evidence-based online resources can be improved by applying existing principles for web usability, prioritizing the development of simple search functionality, emitting "researcher" jargon, consistent marking of site ownership, and clear signposting of different document types and different content quality. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{motivations of}} {{short-term}} and outsized profits lure many entrepreneurs to seek {{inclusion in the}} ever-growing biomass industry in Pennsylvania. This recent growth and the trend among those entrepreneurs that see their projects fail can be attributed mostly to the void of any useful guides on the biomass industry in Pennsylvania. This results in a lack of planning and confusing and contradictory information, which in turn results in a lack of useful information. In {{an effort to make}} more biomass projects successful, the research will result in a guide that will outline numerous environmental considerations for those entrepreneurs planning to start a business in the biomass industry. Often there is confusing and contradictory information about the biomass industry and exactly what the correct process is for obtaining all of the necessary air <b>quality</b> plan <b>approvals</b> and permitting needed for successful biomass projects. The primary focus of this guide will be to obtain a complete understanding of the various definitions of the biomass industry, outline the process and various steps of the air <b>quality</b> plan <b>approval</b> and permitting process and make recommendations for the implementation for successful projects. The criteria applied in evaluating the research included a practical review of the information obtained using professional working experience, a review and investigation of similar guides, textbooks and regulatory websites.

40|$|Flight {{simulation}} {{is widely}} used for pilot training, engineering and research. Full flight simulators are the top level of such training devices and offer the maximum available immersion for their users. Motion platforms create this virtual flight environment by simulating accelerations in three dimensions {{on the basis of}} complex algorithms, so-called motion cueing algorithms. In the past, the validity of motion cueing algorithms was tested and tuned by experienced pilots for the given aircraft type as a prerequisite for a flight simulator’s official <b>quality</b> standard <b>approval</b> and certification. This, is a subjective approach though, exposed to the individual pilots experiences, perceptions and behavior. In order to ensure a more objective process for the validation and certification of flight simulators testing and certification, the Objective Motion Cueing Test – OMCT was developed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The OMCT defines an objective procedure to test and classify motion systems due to their fidelity to a pre-defined pattern. It was designed by ICAOs international working group and is still under development. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) introduced OMCT for the full flight simulator in its Air Vehicle Simulator – AVES as part a of a software supported test environment. Model based software development methods are used, to focus on a requirement driven approach to the OMCT. This leads to an extendible, easy to change system.

40|$|Joining {{processes}} {{are an important}} key factor for the competitiveness of European shipbuilders. They not only represent {{a significant portion of}} the total man hour consumption in hull production and outfitting, but due to heat distortions they also have a significant impact on nonproductive work operations, such as straightening and fitting. Those operations can interfere with on-board outfitting and increase lead time and construction cost. In addition to their contribution to shipyard productivity, joining techniques have a significant impact on material properties and thus on product performance and quality. Those factors become increasingly important for complex structures using comparatively thin and high-strength materials. Considering the importance of efficient joining, European shipbuilders in the past decade have invested significant efforts to develop new joining techniques, such as laser welding, adhesive bonding, and mechanical joining. Based on research re sults, practical industrial applications have been developed recently.
