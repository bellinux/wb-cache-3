40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{relies on}} an {{essential}} Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat for {{survival in the}} mammalian bloodstream. High VSG expression within an expression site body (ESB) is mediated by RNA polymerase I (Pol I), which in other eukaryotes exclusively transcribes ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA). As T. brucei is reliant on Pol I for VSG transcription, we investigated Pol I transcription inhibitors for selective anti-trypanosomal activity. The Pol I inhibitors <b>quarfloxin</b> (CX- 3543), CX- 5461, and BMH- 21 are currently under investigation for treating cancer, as rapidly dividing cancer cells are particularly dependent on high levels of Pol I transcription compared with nontransformed cells. In T. brucei all three Pol I inhibitors have IC 50 concentrations for cell proliferation in the nanomolar range: <b>quarfloxin</b> (155 nM), CX- 5461 (279 nM) or BMH- 21 (134 nM) compared with IC 50 concentrations in the MCF 10 A human breast epithelial cell line (4. 44 μM, 6. 89 μM or 460 nM, respectively). T. brucei was therefore 29 -fold more sensitive to <b>quarfloxin,</b> 25 -fold more sensitive to CX- 5461 and 3. 4 -fold more sensitive to BMH- 21. Cell death in T. brucei was due to rapid inhibition of Pol I transcription, as within 15 minutes treatment with the inhibitors rRNA precursor transcript was reduced 97 - 98 % and VSG precursor transcript 91 - 94 %. Incubation with Pol I transcription inhibitors also resulted in disintegration of the ESB {{as well as the}} nucleolus subnuclear structures, within one hour. Rapid ESB loss following the block in Pol I transcription argues that the ESB is a Pol I transcription nucleated structure, similar to the nucleolus. In addition to providing insight into Pol I transcription and ES control, Pol I transcription inhibitors potentially also provide new approaches to treat trypanosomiasis...|$|E
40|$|G-quadruplexes are {{secondary}} {{structures that}} may form within guanine-rich nucleic acid sequences. Telomeres have received much attention {{in this regard}} since they can fold into several distinct intramolecular G-quadruplexes, leading to the rational design and development of G-quadruplex‑stabilizing molecules. These ligands were shown to selectively exert an antiproliferative and chemosensitizing activity in in vitro and in vivo tumor models, without appreciably affecting normal cells. Such findings point to them as possible drug candidates for clinical applications. Other than in telomeres, G-quadruplexes may form at additional locations in the human genome, including gene promoters and untranslated regions. For instance, stabilization of G-quadruplex structures within the promoter of MYC, KIT, or KRAS resulted in the down-regulation of the corresponding oncogene either in gene reporter assays or in selected experimental models. In addition, the alternative splicing {{of a number of}} genes may be affected for a therapeutic benefit through the stabilization of G-quadruplexes located within pre-mRNAs. It is now emerging that G-quadruplex structures may act as key regulators of several biological processes. Consequently, they are considered as attractive targets for broad-spectrum anticancer therapies, and much effort is being made to develop a variety of ligands with improved G-quadruplex recognition properties. <b>Quarfloxin,</b> a fluoroquinolone derivative designed to target a G-quadruplex within ribosomal DNA and disrupt protein-DNA interactions, has entered clinical trials for different malignancies. This review will provide some hints on the role of G-quadruplex structures in biological processes and will evaluate their implications as novel therapeutic targets...|$|E
40|$|In this review, {{the authors}} {{describe}} a novel mechanism {{for control of}} MYC expression that involves a four-stranded DNA structure, termed a G-quadruplex, amenable to small molecule targeting. The DNA element involved in this mechanism, the nuclease hypersensitive element III 1 (NHE III 1), is just upstream of the P 1 promoter and is subjected to dynamic stress (negative superhelicity) resulting from transcription. This is sufficient to convert the duplex DNA to a G-quadruplex on the purine-rich strand and an i-motif of the pyrimidine-rich strand, which displaces the activating transcription factors to silence gene expression. Specific proteins have been identified, NM 23 -H 2 and nucleolin, that resolve and fold the G-quadruplex to activate and silence MYC expression, respectively. Inhibition of the activity of NM 23 -H 2 molecules that bind to the G-quadruplex silences gene expression, and redistribution of nucleolin from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm is expected to inhibit MYC. The authors also describe the mechanism of action of <b>Quarfloxin,</b> a first-in-class G-quadruplex-interactive compound that involves the redistribution of nucleolin from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. G-quadruplexes have been best known as test-tube oddities {{for more than four}} decades. However, during the past decade, they have emerged as likely players in a number of important biological processes, including transcriptional control. Only time will tell if these odd DNA structures will assume the role of an established receptor class, but {{it is clear from the}} scientific literature that there is a dramatic increase in interest in this little-known area in the past few years...|$|E
