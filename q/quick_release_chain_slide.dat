50|$|Locking skewers {{replace the}} {{existing}} <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewers on a bicycle's wheels and Seatpost clamp (<b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewers enable removal without tools). This reduces {{the need to}} lock these parts of the bike since now their removal requires tools. One type of locking skewer uses the same design as a normal <b>Quick</b> <b>release</b> skewer, except after clamping the skewer the (keyed) handle may be removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{debate over}} <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> use as {{illustrated}} by Brown, has become a national issue due to several lawsuits brought on by various people including a group of mothers who claim their children were injured due to innocently incorrect use of <b>quick</b> <b>releases.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1884 {{the company}} had Murdoch and Murray, of Port Glasgow build the coastal steamer Jessie Darling to carry grain from the ports of South Australia to Adelaide and Melbourne. An image of the ship may be seen here. The Jessie Darling was {{involved}} in a number of marine accidents; the most serious being a bizarre sequence of events on the morning of 21 April 1907. Around 2am the four-masted barque Norma, loaded with wheat, was lying at the Semaphore anchorage off Outer Harbor, awaiting a favourable wind, when it was struck by the steamer Ardencraig, inbound with merchandise from London. Both vessels sank, with one crew member drowned. Hours later, in broad daylight, the Jessie Darling, loaded with wheat from Smoky Bay, struck the wreck of the Norma and sank. On 4 May the inbound steamer Port Chalmers ran into the submerged wrecks and suffered some damage. At the inquest, Capt. Thomas of the Ardencraig asserted that a sudden rain squall had obscured the Norma, and the crew backed his statement. The story was not believed, but couldn't be disproved; Thomas never again had such a responsible position. Years later a story emerged that the lights of the Norma actually had been seen but the Ardencraig could not be halted due to the topping maul (a mallet used for <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> of anchor <b>chains</b> etc.) being misplaced, and the anchors could not be dropped in time.|$|R

50|$|A side-effect is {{that the}} <b>quick</b> <b>release,</b> which was {{developed}} to allow the wheel to be removed without having to unscrew any components, no longer works as designed: the skewer must be unscrewed in order to remove the wheel (although tools do remain unnecessary). This means that the tension on refitting must be adjusted again. Some cyclists file off the lawyer tabs so the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> works as originally intended.|$|R

50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>release</b> {{harnesses}} {{are already}} widely in use, {{and make it}} possible for sailors to unhook themselves from the wire from all angles while it is under tension, thus decreasing the chance of getting trapped underwater or in dangerous conditions. The adoption of <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> harnesses has not been universal due to the reduced reliability of the moving parts; stories of such systems releasing unexpectedly have caused many to shun them in favour of traditional fixed hooks.|$|R

50|$|Lawyer lips or lawyer tabs (a type of {{positive}} retention device) are tabs fitted to the fork ends {{on the front}} fork of bicycles sold in some countries (particularly the U.S.) to prevent a wheel from leaving the fork if the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewer comes undone. They were introduced in response to lawsuits supported by experts including John Howard, in cases where incorrectly adjusted <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> wheels {{came out of the}} forks. Lawyer tabs are designed to compensate for the fact that many riders {{do not know how to}} operate a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> properly: some riders treat them as a folding wing nut, and others do not tighten them enough for fear of snapping them or shearing the skewer (both are not likely given the normal range of human strength, and the mechanical advantages involved, as long as the skewer is not damaged or flawed).|$|R
