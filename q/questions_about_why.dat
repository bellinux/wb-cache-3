Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012.

However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E

That's the rules and that's what we abide by." [...] Featuring live music, beer gardens, and thousands of people, it led to <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the residential Park Blocks were used, rather than a venue such as Tom McCall Waterfront Park.

[...] He noted that accounting scandals were not uniquely Japanese, but that it was [...] "a nice piece of corporate satire to conceal losses by exploiting the widespread habit of paying too much for acquisitions and writing them down [...] the 'advisory fee' was especially creative". Gapper criticised the weakness in governance, particularly how 12 out of 15 directors were either executives or former executives of the company, and that Hideo Yamada, head of the Audit Board, was complicit in the scam. He also noted that auditors KPMG and Ernst & Young would have to answer tough <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>why</b> the manipulation was never discovered or properly questioned.|$|E
500|$|Miliband {{paid tribute}} to Lamont shortly after she {{announced}} that she intended to relinquish the leadership role, saying she had [...] "led the Scottish Labour Party with determination". McLeish and McConnell both indicated that Lamont's sudden departure following weeks of speculation could have implications for Miliband's leadership. McLeish said that Miliband's chance of becoming Prime Minister could be affected if Labour returned fewer Scottish MPs in 2015, something he called a problem of “historic, epic proportions”, while McConnell {{said that he was}} [...] "very, very angry" [...] and suggested Miliband had questions to answer about the circumstances surrounding the resignation. Salmond echoed the views of his predecessor, arguing that Miliband [...] "should be answering <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>why</b> Labour in Scotland is run as an extension of his Westminster office, and why he has effectively forced the resignation of a Labour leader in Scotland." [...] Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, rejected Lamont's claims about UK Labour's treatment of its Scottish counterpart. Ian Davidson claimed that supporters of Murphy, who subsequently announced his intention to stand in the leadership contest to succeed Lamont, had conducted a whispering campaign against her. He further suggested that those on the right of the party had resented her election as leader and ignored her, treating her as a [...] "wee lassie".|$|E

2500|$|Davey Wreden, 22 {{years old}} at the time of the modification's release, was {{inspired}} to create The Stanley Parable about three years prior, after considering the typical storytelling narratives within video games, and thought of what would happen if the player would go against that narration; Wreden also saw this as a means towards his planned career as a game developer. As a video game player, Wreden has found that most major triple-A titles at the time make numerous assumptions about the player's experience and fitting that within the game, and don't provide answers for [...] "what if" [...] questions that the player may consider. Wreden considered that more recent games with more engaging or thought-provoking stories, including the Metal Gear Solid series, Half-Life 2, Portal, Braid, and BioShock, started to approach this void, giving reason for the player to stop and think about the narration instead of simply going through the motions. Though his initial intent was a personal project simply to try to make such a game that asked the <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>why</b> people play video games, he found that there were other gamers that had been considering the same type of questions. He then set out to make a game that would be the subject of discussion for players after they completed it. According to Wreden, his design document for the game was [...] "Mess with the player's head in every way possible, throwing them off-guard, or pretending there's an answer and then kinda whisking it away from in front of them." ...|$|E
