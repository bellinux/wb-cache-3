5|$|The Giants' record rebounded to 9–7 in 1984, and Taylor had {{his fourth}} All-Pro season. He {{got off to}} a <b>quick</b> <b>start,</b> {{recording}} four sacks in a September game. In the playoffs the Giants defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16–13, but lost 21–10 to the eventual champion 49ers.|$|E
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase {{got off to}} a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's head into the exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.|$|E
5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.|$|E

5|$|Raymond had a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> to {{his second}} season in 2008–09, scoring 10 points in his first 13 games, but trailed off to add just 13 points for the {{remainder}} of the campaign. Midway through the season, he was named to the 2009 YoungStars Game in Montreal, helping the sophomores beat the rookie team 9–5. He finished his second NHL season with 11 goals and 12 assists in 72 games. In the ensuing 2009 playoffs, where the Canucks entered as the third seed in the Western Conference, Raymond scored his first NHL post-season goal in game three of the second round against the Chicago Blackhawks, a 3–1 win for the Canucks. Vancouver went on to be eliminated by the Blackhawks in six games. Raymond finished with two goals and an assist in 10 post-season contests.|$|E
5|$|The game, {{like many}} {{previous}} meetings {{between the two}} teams, was dominated by defense. The Pacers {{got off to a}} <b>quick</b> <b>start,</b> opening up a 20-point lead with seven minutes to go before halftime. The Pistons managed to cut into the lead, trailing by 16 points by halftime. The Pistons opened the third quarter with a 9–2 run, but the Pacers ended it with a buzzer-beating three-pointer and a layup from Jamaal Tinsley heading into the fourth quarter. Richard Hamilton and Lindsey Hunter started the last quarter with consecutive three-point field goals, as the Pistons cut into the lead again. But Stephen Jackson's back-to-back field goals pushed the lead back to 93–79 with 3:52 remaining, essentially putting the Pistons away. Despite the lopsided score {{near the end of the}} game, most key players on both teams remained in the game.|$|E
5|$|This season had a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> but a slow end. Overall {{activity}} was below average, with twelve named systems in total. Of these, five were tropical storms, seven were hurricanes, of which three were major (Category 3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale). Just one storm formed in August, {{one of the least}} active Augusts ever in the east Pacific. The season officially started May 15, 1973, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1973, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1973. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern north Pacific Ocean, often off the coast of Mexico. As is usual in the northern hemisphere, most traveled generally westward or northwestward, and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

5|$|Lavender {{got off to}} <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> in 1915, {{pitching}} a complete game victory against St. Louis on April16. He then missed time due to suffering a broken rib attempting {{to climb out of}} a bathtub. His next appearance was not until May7, when he pitched two innings in relief. He regained his starting role on May21, hurling his second complete game victory of the season, this time against Boston. In the first game of a doubleheader on August31, Lavender threw a no-hitter against the New York Giants, a 2–0victory. He struck out eight batters and walked just one. At the conclusion of the season, the Cubs played the Chicago White Sox of the American League in an exhibition series. Lavender pitched a shutout in game two, but the White Sox were declared victors after winning four games to the Cubs' one. His totals for the 1915season included 41games pitched, a 10–16win–loss record, a career-low 2.58ERA, and a career-high 117strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|Nelson Piquet was {{the only}} driver not {{to start with the}} softer {{compound}} dry-weather tyres on a track which was still drying from morning rain, with the Brazilian opting for the harder tyre available. There was a strong chance of showers predicted during the race. Several cars were slow away on the slippery track, most notably Kovalainen. The main beneficiaries off the line were Piquet and Trulli, who each gained five places. Trulli was hit from behind at the first corner by Bourdais, who also had a <b>quick</b> <b>start.</b> The Toyota suffered diffuser and gearbox damage from the incident, spinning later in the lap. Kovalainen and Heidfeld also collided at the start. This allowed Alonso to gain several places. Sebastian Vettel locked his brakes and ran wide, losing two places. Fisichella collided with Nakajima on the first lap and had to pit to fix a broken front wing and punctures. Hamilton led from Räikkönen who managed to pass his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on the Kemmel straight.|$|E

25|$|The 1985 {{season was}} very much a replay of 1984, with the Outlaws {{struggling}} after a <b>quick</b> <b>start.</b> The team jumped out to a 4-2 start, including a 31-13 pounding of the Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie-led New Jersey Generals. However, they proceeded to drop six in a row, and seven out of eight. They rebounded to win three straight, but did not get enough help to make the playoffs, and finished 8-10.|$|E

South Carolina stumbled down the stretch dropping the final five games, including a home loss in the season finale to arch-rival Clemson. The 6-6 (3-5 SEC) season record marked the first non-winning college season for Spurrier since his first season at Duke in 1987.|$|E
50|$|In the final, Campbell-Brown had the <b>quickest</b> <b>start</b> {{and made}} up the stagger very quickly on Allyson Felix, who had been drawn in the lane outside of her.

The ball nevertheless slightly grazed the animal's side.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>started</b> his {{professional}} baseball career in 1902 in the Pacific Northwest League.

Halák had a <b>quick</b> <b>start,</b> going 8–1–1 and would share the starting role with Brian Elliott {{for the remainder of}} the season. In the 2011–12 season, Halák and Elliott were awarded the William M. Jennings Trophy for allowing the fewest amount of goals (165 collectively) in the regular season.|$|E
25|$|Round 5 was the Spanish Grand Prix and Montoya {{needed a}} good result {{but did not}} look like getting it, so, after another poor qualifying, Montoya found himself down in 12th place. He made up for it by making a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> by gaining five places and was up to sixth in the first corner (David Coulthard was {{starting}} {{from the back of the}} grid after stalling on the formation lap). He got ahead of Jacques Villeneuve in the second round of pit stops. He stayed on the track and climbed up to second due to a high attrition rate.|$|E
25|$|In {{the opening}} leg at the Gerland, Lyon {{got off to}} a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> scoring in just the seventh minute with a deceiving free kick, from an odd angle, by Juninho, which {{confused}} Barcelona goalkeeper Víctor Valdés and eventually with into the inside of the side netting. Lyon continued to perform well into the first half, with the defence constantly pressing Barcelona's attack and Lyon's offence missing on a variety of goal chances. Barcelona eventually got its equaliser from the head of Thierry Henry, drawing the match at 1–1. This was the final scoreline as Lyon headed into the second leg at the Camp Nou.|$|E
50|$|Race day {{was cool}} {{with a chance}} of rain. Berger quickly pulled ahead of Martini and moved over in front of him, but Alesi, whose F1 career had begun in his home country of France the {{previous}} summer, made an even <b>quicker</b> <b>start,</b> passed them both and outbraked Berger into the first corner. He immediately began pulling away, and led by 2.4 seconds after one lap.|$|R
50|$|During {{his younger}} years in school, Quick didn't {{have a strong}} {{interest}} in football.

25|$|Gáborík {{got off to}} a <b>quick</b> <b>start</b> {{with his}} new club, scoring 10 goals in his first 12 games.

He missed two games, including what would have been his first game back in Minnesota against the Wild. Gáborík was injured for a second time in the season when his right leg was cut by team goaltender Henrik Lundqvist during a team practice on 9 February 2010. Though the Rangers missed the 2010 playoffs, Gáborík did not disappoint in his first season with the team; he played in 76 games, matching his career high with 42 goals, and set a new career high in points with 86.|$|E
25|$|The Adelaide Oval was {{a ground}} {{which had a}} flat pitch unhelpful for bowlers, and short square boundaries, which helped the Australian Batsmen, who were benefitted by their captain Steve Waugh's {{decision}} to bat first. Langer and Hayden gave their side a <b>quick</b> <b>start,</b> stitching 22 runs from 5 overs, with Hayden scoring a fast 12 off 13 balls, but the 19-year-old fast-bowler Irfan Pathan, making his debut after Zaheer Khan was nursing a strained hamstring, took Hayden's wicket for a dream start to his debut, and he took his first test wicket in only the second ball of his third over. During their relatively short stay, the two Australian openers {{set the tone for}} the day by driving along the line, exploiting a pitch, whose lack of bounce, a fast outfield, and lack of movement, proved to be frustratingly unhelpful for the Indians.|$|E
