40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to develop a method {{that could be used to}} estimate the necessary bore load on a part quenched in a <b>quenching</b> <b>machine</b> with an expanding segmented die. Such a method would be of special benefit to gear manufacturers with little quenching experience; and it could also help to greatly reduce or eliminate the very costly trial and error procedure presently used. The method must be simple enough to be used in a production situation. Such a method has been developed for estimating the expander cylinder force required to produce the greatest amount of correction in the out of round of a ring part with the least expansion of the bore. The theory has been developed for each portion of the procedure. Elastic deflections and stresses of the part, as predicted by the theory, have been compared with a finite element modeled part which agreed with the theory within 8 %. Also, two test cases were made to determine how well the overall procedure compared with actual successful production examples, and it was found that the procedure does quite accurately predict the necessary bore loads.

40|$|The {{technical}} progress has the demand of parts, which withstand longer higher loads. This is fulfilled either by an {{improvement of the}} material or through an optimization of the manufacturing process. These optimizations are chosen to improve specific properties which enhance the life spans of parts. A classical process of improving the life span is the case hardening. Among other things, the case hardening generates compressive residual stresses near the surface. This compressive residual stresses improves the fatigue strength. By hardening parts with high quenching velocities a great martensitic phase occurs near the surface, before the phase transformation begins in the core. The martensitic transformation expands first the surface than the core, which leads to compressive stresses. The great martensitic phase proportion on the surface withstand the resulting tensile stresses due to the phase transformation in the core and after the quenching remains compressive residual stresses at the surface. The knowledge of the necessary quenching parameters to generate compressive residual stresses at the surface exists only for single parts and materials. The goal of this work is to generalize this knowledge with simulation studies. This objective was realized with a newly developed high velocity water <b>quenching</b> <b>machine.</b> With experiments were verified the nearly correctness of the simulation studies. And with this simulations the influence of different material properties were evaluated. In {{the last part of}} this work, the improvement of the life strength due to the high compression was confirmed...|$|E

The objective of this project is to produce and characterize a Pd-based metallic glass, more specifically Pd 77 Si 16. 5 Cu 6. 5, using different techniques. An Arc- Melting device, a setup that produces an electric arc employed to melt the constituent elements into balls, and a Melt-Spinner, a rapidly <b>quenching</b> <b>machine</b> to produce micrometer thick ribbons, were utilized for production of ribbons. In order to test the sample quality, they were analyzed with the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) technique, capable of extract the actual composition with a small error.

The quenching procedure {{was also not}} favored to produce amorphous top layers. However authors made a liquid <b>quenching</b> <b>machine</b> to enhance the cooling speed. Photographs Figs. 4 (b) and 5 are troublesome. Originality as well as scientific significance of the title paper is in question. Summary of the title paper This paper represents a new casting technique and required oxygen level for successful production of Zr 55 Cu 30 Ni 5 Al 10 glassy alloy rod up {{to the size of}} 30 mm in diameter. This casting technique is named as “cap-cast method”, namely, the arc-melting of this particular alloy followed by quick casting into water cooled copper mold. A copper “cap”is utilized to compress the alloy melt at 1 kN from the top surface just after the casting. This cap is needed to prevent the shrinkage of the alloy and to enhance the cooling speed of the alloy melt. Low oxygen level, being less than 45 mass ppm in the starting zirconium metal, has essential importance to obtain homogeneous Zr 55 Cu 30 Ni 5 Al 10 glassy alloy rod. Otherwise, crystalline inclusions are solidified in the glass matrix. It is also stated that “the formation of a single glassy phase in the half topside of master alloy ” was confirmed for the as-arc melted buttoningots, being cooled naturally on the copper hearth. It is concluded that (1) the purity level of alloy component is an important factor to produce glassy alloy rods with large size and (2) the Zr 55 Cu 30 Ni 5 Al 10 glassy alloy rods of up to 30 mm in diameter could be produced by means of the cap-cast technique, though the critical sizes of glassy alloy rods was 20 mm by the conventional cast technique using copper molds.

40|$|A {{combined}} {{experimental and}} analytical approach is undertaken {{to identify the}} relationship between process parameters and fracture behavior in the cutting of a 1 mm thick alumina samples by a hybrid CO 2 laser∕waterjet (LWJ) manufacturing process. In LWJ machining, a 200 W power laser was used for local heating followed by waterjet quenching of the sample surface leading to thermal shock fracture in the heated zone. Experimental results indicate three characteristic fracture responses: scribing, controlled separation, and uncontrolled fracture. A Green’s function based approach is used to develop an analytical solution for temperatures and stress fields generated in the workpiece during laser heating and subsequent waterjet <b>quenching</b> along the <b>machining</b> path. Temperature distribution was experimentally measured using thermocouples and compared with analytical predictions in order to validate the model assumptions. Computed thermal stress fields are utilized to determine the stress intensity factor and energy release rate for different configurations of cracks that caused scribing or separation of the workpiece. Calculated crack driving forces are compared with fracture toughness and critical energy release rates to predict the equilibrium crack length for scribed samples and the process parameters associated with transition from scribing to separation. Both of these predictions are in good agreement with experimental observations. An empirical parameter is developed to identify the transition from controlled separation to uncontrolled cracking because the equilibrium crack length based analysis is unable to predict this transition. Finally, the analytical model and empirical parameter are utilized to create a map that relates the process parameters to the fracture behavior of alumina samples...|$|R

ISO/TR 15510 X 12 CrMnNiN 17 - 7 - 5 is a special grade of austenitic stainless steel, which is developed to conserve nickel and is used in automobile parts such as automotive trim, automobile wheel covers, flat conveyer chains, railroad passenger car bodies. The aim of this project is to explore the low cycle fatigue behaviour and its effect on the tensile properties of the abovementioned non-conventional stainless steel, which is unavailable in literature. Attempts have also been made to understand the microstructural variation due to deformation in the steel, as the structure is austenitic, hence metastable in nature.

40|$|AbstractMachined {{monolithic}} components provide {{the foundation for}} modern aircraft structures requiring high performance designs in terms of weight, strength, and fatigue properties. Part distortions arising from machining-induced stresses and tool deflection resulting from high dynamic cutting forces frustrate manufacturing and assembly processes, necessitating expensive in-process and post-machining corrective measures aimed at eliminating their effects. Component weight and cost requirements are often compromised by adding thicker component section designs or off-machine part flipping processes as a distortion control mechanism. Similarly, small depths of cut are taken to minimize cutting forces and tool deflection. Additional spring passes are also taken to eliminate any undercut errors introduced by unanticipated deflection and distortion problems. The ability to accurately predict and minimize tool deflections and part distortion via simulations can significantly reduce manufacturing and assembly costs. This paper presents physics-based models for predicting tool deflection and part distortions by considering the appropriate physics for each problem. Dynamic cutting forces predicted by physics-based machining models, and tool compliance properties are incorporated into a detailed linear elastic deflection model in order to predict in-process deflections along a computer numerical control (CNC) machining toolpath. Similarly, bulk stress state and machining-induced stresses for large, monolithic part machining {{are taken into account}} for predicting part distortions. Sources of stresses may include heat treatment, <b>quenching,</b> forging, and <b>machining</b> operations. Bulk stress data from heat treatment predictive models can also be imported and mapped onto the workpiece finite element model. CNC part programs, along with stresses arising from corresponding tooling, are processed and analyzed. Results of a validation study for workpiece distortion predictions are presented for a number of monolithic, thin-walled components. Predictions for tool deflection are also compared against experimental measurements for multiple cutting configurations and tool diameters.

The so called threshold comparator (TC) [2] collects, analyzes and compares the data with threshold table. It also gives a dump signal through the combiner card to the beam inter lock system (BIC). The usage of the system, for protection and tuning of the LHC and the scale of the LHC, imposed exceptional specification of the dynamic range and radiation tolerance. The input current dynamic range should allow measurements between 10 pA and 1 mA and it should also be protected to very high pulse of 1. 5 kV and its corresponding current. To cover this range, a current to frequency converter (CFC) is used in the tunnel card, which produces an output frequency of 0. 05 Hz at 10 pA, and 5 MHz at 1 mA. In addition to the output frequency, the integrator output voltage is measured with a 12 bit ADC to improve the resolution. The location of the CFC card next to the detector imposes the placement of the card in the LHC tunnel, exposing the card to radiation.
