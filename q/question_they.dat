The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each <b>question</b> <b>they</b> had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.|$|E
5|$|You Don't Know Jack {{is played}} {{out as a}} fictional trivia game show for one to four players, with the goal to win the most virtual money {{at the end of}} the game. Each game uses a pre-defined set of ten {{questions}} from over seventy episodes, titled by the name of the show's fictional sponsor. Most questions are multiple choice, providing one correct and three incorrect answers, along with a short timer that starts once the question has been completely presented. All players play at the same time, entering their choice of answer before the 20 second timer runs out. If a player is correct, they get a base dollar amount plus a bonus defined by how quickly they answered, while if they miss the <b>question,</b> <b>they</b> lose a similar amount of money. Failing to answer does not cost the player any money.|$|E

5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} {{capstone}} of the nationalist issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein <b>Question,</b> <b>they</b> both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a unified Germany at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The difficulties of the Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E

25|$|Attribute {{substitution}} is {{a psychological}} process thought to underlie {{a number of}} cognitive biases and perceptual illusions. It occurs when an individual {{has to make a}} judgment (of a target attribute) that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated heuristic attribute. This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic intuitive judgment system, rather than the more self-aware reflective system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult <b>question,</b> <b>they</b> may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place. This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show regression toward the mean.|$|E
25|$|Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout generally {{declined in the}} second half of the 20th century due to angler overharvest, competition with exotic fishes, and overzealous egg collection. Populations rebounded in the park after the advent of catch-and-release-only fishing rules in the 1970s, but new and aggressive invaders are causing an increasing threat to these native fish and alarming park fisheries biologists. Nonnative lake trout, an effective fish predator, were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994. Throughout the west {{cutthroat trout}} populations preyed upon by introduced lake trout have typically declined, exhibited lower growth, or have disappeared. Aggressive lake trout control efforts by the National Park Service and no harvest limits have resulted in removing thousands of lake trout from Yellowstone Lake since 1994, including more than 12,000 in 2000. Still, the number of Yellowstone cutthroat trout monitored during the annual fall count in Yellowstone Lake was lower in recent years than at any other time in the 25-year history of the monitoring effort. Whirling disease, which has been implicated in recent years in the decline of trout populations in many western states, was discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1998. So far, it is unclear which of these two nonnative invaders has been the greater factor in the decline of Yellowstone cutthroat trout, but there is no <b>question</b> <b>they</b> are causing it.|$|E

500|$|From 2011 to 2014, certain {{weeks of}} the show were {{designated}} as [...] "Double Your Money" [...] weeks. In those, a pre-selected question in round one was designated the [...] "Double Money Question." [...] When a contestant answered such a question correctly, the monetary value behind the question was doubled and added {{to his or her}} bank, giving him or her the possibility of adding up to $50,000 to his or her bank on a single question; under these special rules, it was possible for a contestant to finish round one with a maximum total of $93,600 in their bank.

500|$|During {{the shuffle}} format era, the show {{introduced}} a new lifeline, [...] "Jump the Question", which {{was able to be}} used twice in a single game for seasons nine through twelve. At any point prior to selecting a final answer, a contestant could use Jump the Question to skip the current question and {{move on to the next}} one, thus reducing the number of questions they had to correctly answer. However, if the contestant used Jump the <b>Question,</b> <b>they</b> did not gain any money from the <b>question</b> <b>they</b> chose to skip (for example, a contestant would not gain the typical $100,000 if they jumped to the $250,000 question). This lifeline could not be used on the $1 million question, since it is the final question in the game. The [...] "Plus One" [...] lifeline, introduced in season thirteen, allows a contestant to bring a companion with him or her to the podium for help in answering a question. The introduction of this lifeline reduced the number of Jump the Question lifelines available from two to one. On occasional specially designated weeks, starting with a Halloween-themed week that aired from October 29 to November 2, 2012, the shuffle format used a special lifeline called [...] "Crystal Ball", which allows the contestant to see the money value of a round one question prior to giving an answer. Jump the Question was removed at the end of the show's thirteenth syndicated season. For the show's fourteenth season, during a special week of college shows, players got another lifeline called [...] "Extra Help", played similarly to [...] "Plus One" [...] and allowing for another companion to help the player; however, it could only be used after [...] "Plus One" [...] was used.|$|E

The book's source recounted the events: [...] "They said 'We are a private group'. I asked them if they voted. It was a testing <b>question.</b> <b>They</b> said they didn't. It was a very short discussion." [...] The organisation's members are instructed that government is controlled by God, and they are told not to vote in elections.

500|$|Soon I Will Be Invincible takes characters, settings, and storylines {{generally}} {{associated with}} the comic book format and re-casts them using the novel's prose format. This use of superhero fiction in an alternate format was compared to other similar, successful attempts, like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films, Brad Bird's The Incredibles, and the TV serial No Heroics. Several reviewers contrasted the novel's elements of realism with Alan Moore's Watchmen and Rick Veitch's Bratpack which portrayed a darker side of more realistic superheroes. Novels cited as being similar included Donald Barthelme's Snow White, Robert Coover's Stepmother, and the works of Michael Chabon and Jonathan Lethem. The novel format allowed for more character development, which Grossman took advantage of by portraying them as [...] "real, human characters, {{with all of the}} foibles that come with the territory" [...] in what one reviewer called a [...] "hybridization of character and genre". Grossman described it as [...] "a book about real people who happen to be [...] or supervillains" [...] and that if it were a comic, it would be [...] "page after page of thought balloons". Compared to comic stories, the reviewer for the Richmond Times-Dispatch wrote [...] "The common denominator for most superhero comic books is that they don't make fun of themselves - the believability of their stories is never called into <b>question.</b> <b>They</b> take the heroes seriously. Not so in literature. When a novel appears with comic books as its focus, its author will undoubtedly believe that his or her theme is far more important - far more serious - than the comic books that inspired them. ... tries to do it all, combining humor and comic-book adventure with a literary sense of character. ...The result is a postmodern, inventive, comic-book plot with literary aspirations, and its only problem is that it isn't entirely successful as either humor or as straight adventure." ...|$|E
