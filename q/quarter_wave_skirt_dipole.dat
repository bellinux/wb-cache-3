40|$|During {{the last}} decades, several {{methods have been}} {{proposed}} to automate photoelastic analyses. Some procedures {{are based on the}} circularly polarised light by using <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plates. However, <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plates are typically matched for a specific wavelength, and an error is introduced at different wavelengths. The error of <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plates affects the measurement of isochromatic and isoclinic data. In this paper, the influence of the errors of <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plates {{in some of the most}} common automated photoelastic methods is reviewed. The errors in the photoelastic data are given and the procedures to reduce, or eliminate, them are also suggested. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{experimental}} {{results on the}} use of a thick aligned Si crystal acting as a <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plate to induce a degree of circular polarisation in a high energy linearly polarised photon beam. The linearly polarised photon beam is produced from coherent bremsstrahlung radiation by 178 GeV unpolarised electrons incident on an aligned Si crystal, acting as a radiator. The linear polarisation of the photon beam is characterised by measuring the asymmetry in electron-positron pair production in a Ge crystal, for different crystal orientations. The Ge crystal therefore acts as an analyser. The birefringence phenomenon, which converts the linear polarisation to circular polarisation, is observed by letting the linearly polarised photons beam pass through a thick Si <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plate crystal, and then measuring the asymmetry in electron-positron pair production again for a selection of relative angles between the crystallographic planes of the radiator, analyser and <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plate. The systematics of the difference between the measured asymmetries with and without the <b>quarter</b> <b>wave</b> plate are predicted by theory to reveal an evolution in the Stokes parameters from which the appearance of a circularly polarised component in the photon beam can be demonstrated. The measured magnitude of the circularly polarised component was consistent with the theoretical predictions, and therefore is in indication of the existence of the birefringence effect.
