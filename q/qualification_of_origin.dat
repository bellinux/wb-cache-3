It questions the <b>qualification</b> schemes <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> with geographical indications (GI’s), dedicated to distant markets. The renewal {{of the relationship between}} urban and rural areas, or issues related to heritage tourism are questioning the foundations of GI trade. The local product inscription in a close commercial sphere leads to modify the socio-technical systems initially built around a domestic model. Quality is revisited through innovations embedded in the local context and its specificities. Lock-in hinders the adoption of these innovations and different types of resources will be mobilized to build a new activity model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{consequences}} of international migration for development in countries <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and destination remain hotly debated. The immigration flows {{could be considered}} an appropriate mechanism {{to contribute to the}} de-velopment <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> countries if host countries recognize the <b>qualifications</b> <b>of</b> immigrants or contribute to the acquisition of skills. Correspondence analysis is used to determine the relation between education level, job position and legal situation of immigrants in Spain. The results indicate that immigrants are occupying non skilled tasks, even in the case of well educated immigrants. Furthermore, these immigrants have no options to increase their skills nor by experience (in the job) neither by theirself (attending a school), since the im-migration police only authorizes very short migration. Hence, Spain is not contributing appropriately to the development <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> countries. 1...|$|R
30|$|In {{political}} science, {{the bases}} of legitimacy are consensus and identity, implying authority and order. That is, legitimacy is based on being the authority and respecting order. The former stresses identity while the latter refers to behavior. To achieve good governance, management bodies and personals are expected to maximize coordination among citizens {{as well as between}} government and citizens, and their legitimacy of public management comes from the maximum consent and approval of citizens (Yu, 2000 : 117). Specifically, the concept of ‘citizen’ includes society and market. This implies that there are in total three subjects of governance, namely society, market and government. The legitimacy of these three subjects’ <b>qualification</b> (the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> this type of legitimacy will not be discussed in this paper) can be constructed during participation processes. Also, order-based legitimacy can be established during participation. Therefore, essentially, the legitimacy of governance infers process-oriented explorations rather than conclusive judgments.|$|R

A central problem {{in this area is}} the cultural divide between the vocational and the academic, and the White Paper proposes to bridge this gulf by introducing new diplomas and by expanding the framework <b>of</b> National Vocational <b>Qualifications.</b> The <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> the cultural chasm between the vocational and the academic are briefly explored, and criticisms of the Government proposals are put forward, particularly the use <b>of</b> National Vocational <b>Qualifications</b> as a means of enhancing vocational education and training.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of workers to access job opportunities abroad can be seriously affected by difficulties in recognising the qualifications acquired {{in their home}} country. Therefore, recognition <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> is a key issue in ensuring wider labour mobility under more equitable conditions. It has consequences for foreigners on two different levels: their ability to enter one country for employment in their chosen vocation and the job they can expect to obtain. Lack <b>of</b> recognition <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> is a particularly acute problem for professionals from developing countries willing to work abroad as employees or service providers. This paper looks at {{what is meant by}} recognition <b>of</b> <b>qualifications,</b> the mechanisms aimed at facilitating recognition <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> at bilateral, regional and global levels, and how pertinent they are in addressing the challenges faced by countries <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> when these are developing countries...|$|R
