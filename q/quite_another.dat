5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|Reports of {{the brutal}} {{policies}} of the organization soon {{made their way to}} Phnom Penh and into the population foretelling the violence that was about to consume the nation. There were tales of the forced relocations of entire villages, of the summary execution of any who disobeyed or even asked questions, the forbidding of religious practices, of monks who were defrocked or murdered, and where traditional sexual and marital habits were foresworn. War was one thing, the offhand manner in which the Khmer Rouge dealt out death, so contrary to the Khmer character, was <b>quite</b> <b>another.</b> Reports of these atrocities began to surface during the same period in which North Vietnamese troops were withdrawing from the Cambodian battlefields. This was no coincidence. The concentration of the PAVN effort on South Vietnam allowed the Khmer Rouge to apply their doctrine and policies without restraint for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{incomplete}} {{texts as}} first found, {{it was assumed}} that Ishtar/Inanna's descent into Kur occurred after the death of Tammuz/Dumuzid rather than before and that her purpose was to rescue Tammuz/Dumuzid. This is the familiar form of the myth as it appeared in M. Jastrow's Descent of the Goddess Ishtar into the Lower World, 1915, widely available on the Internet. New texts uncovered in 1963 filled in the story in <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> fashion, showing that Dumuzi was in fact consigned to the Underworld himself, in order to secure Inanna's release.|$|E
25|$|The immense {{power of}} living emperors, {{on the other}} hand, was {{mediated}} through the encompassing agency of the state. Once acknowledged as paterfamilias to an Empire, a princeps was naturally entitled to genius cult from Imperial subjects of all classes. Cult to a living emperor's numen was <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> matter and might be interpreted as no less than a statement of divine monarchy. Imperial responses to the first overtures of cult to the August numen were therefore extremely cautious. Only much later, probably in consequence of the hyperinflation of honours to living Emperors, could a living emperor be openly, formally addressed as numen praesens (the numinous presence).|$|E

You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
500|$|In 1878 and 1879 Stanford {{worked on}} his first opera, The Veiled Prophet, to a {{libretto}} by his friend William Barclay Squire. It {{was based on a}} poem by Thomas Moore with characters including a virgin priestess and a mystic prophet, and a plot that culminates in poisoning and stabbing. Stanford offered the work to the opera impresario Carl Rosa, who refused it and suggested that the composer should try to have it staged in Germany: [...] "Its success will (unfortunately) have much greater chances here if accepted abroad." [...] Referring to the enormous popularity of Sullivan's comic operas, Rosa added, [...] "If the work was of the Pinafore style it would be <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> matter." [...] Stanford had greatly enjoyed Sullivan's Cox and Box, but The Veiled Prophet was intended to be a serious work of high drama and romance.|$|E

The “sober reality” was twelve to fourteen hours of dreary, exhausting work, which many workers experienced as hostile to intellectual development.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} practical {{obstacle to}} a completely democratically elected and representative UNPA is that, {{in contrast to}} the situation in which the European Parliament functions, a significant number of UN members, including populous countries such as China are not electoral democracies. In the past, bodies such as the United Nations Commission on Human Rights were criticized for being dominated by abusive regimes. If UNPA representatives were to be drawn from member nations' parliaments, it could create legitimacy concerns since some national legislatures are regarded as a rubber stamp for the rulers' decrees. Some global parliament proponents, such as Prof. Lucio Levi, propose starting a federation limited to democracies: [...] "Though the democratization of states all over the world hasn’t been completed, this does not preclude starting the democratization of the UN. Six Western European countries founded the European Community, starting its democratization without waiting for the democratization of the institutions of all the European states." [...] UNA-USA's Jeff Laurenti notes the problems associated with excluding undemocratic countries from membership: [...] "It is one thing to deny membership to a few small [...] "rogue" [...] dictatorships. It is <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> to exclude China, the vast majority of Arab countries, and two-thirds of Africa, and imagine that the resulting body can have a formal consultative or oversight role with United Nations agencies, be part of UN-sponsored negotiations on multilateral conventions (the real work of international legislating), or pass on the resolutions of UN political bodies." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the music video for [...] "Hollywood", Samuel Bourdin, the son of Guy Bourdin, filed a federal lawsuit that accused Madonna of ripping off the work of his father. Bourdin said they are [...] "strikingly similar" [...] to {{pictures}} taken by his father from the 1950s to 1980s decades and published in French Vogue magazine. He accused Madonna of copyright infringement over at least eleven of Bourdin's works, including one of Madonna with her legs spread on top of a TV set. [...] "It's one thing to draw inspiration; it's <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> to simply plagiarize {{the heart and soul of}} my father's work", Bourdin said at the time. Included in Bourdin's federal complaint were side-by-side comparisons of his father's work with images with stills from the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video. According to Dustin Robertson, editor of the [...] "Hollywood" [...] video, the sequences featuring Madonna in a red dress staring into a mirror are the ones which were pointed by Bourdin's estate in the lawsuit. The lawsuit named Madonna, Warner Bros. Records, and Mondino as defendants. The details presented in the lawsuit read as: [...] "Factors such as composition, background, wardrobe, lighting, narrative, camera angle, decor, and objects depicted are strikingly similar... There are very few scenes or sequences in the 'Hollywood' video that are not directly derived from the Bourdin works." [...] Details of the financial settlement are confidential, and Madonna acknowledged no wrongdoing in her liberal appropriation of the images. Bourdin's lawyer, John Koegel, said the parties reached a [...] "very, very successful settlement", adding that terms of the deal did not allow him to discuss exact dollar amounts. In 2011, news website Independent Online disclosed the settled amount by Madonna to be $600,000.|$|E

Liam Tucker, founder of website Watch With Mothers, compared the fire episode {{to the film}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and admired the special effects and performances of the episode, but said that it seemed unlikely that everyone would have escaped safely, especially Stacey and her baby. Roz Laws from the Sunday Mercury wondered if the fire episode was inaccurate {{due to the lack}} of fire alarms, sprinklers and emergency lighting in the pub, but noted that the episode's use of the song [...] "Murder on the Dancefloor", featuring the line [...] "Gonna burn this god damn house right down", was [...] "clever". A writer for Heat said [...] "We knew the Vic fire was coming, but actually seeing it was <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> thing, and knowing that it also marked the end of an era with the departure of [...] Windsor made it that much more emotional." [...] A reporter for the Nottingham Evening Post wrote [...] "Never in the history of soap fires, of which there have of course been legion, have so many hilariously overindulgent explosions been captured on camera." [...] The Mail on Sunday picked the fire episode as the [...] "Soap of the Day", while The People deemed the lack of deaths [...] "a wasted opportunity." [...] Ally Ross wrote in his column in The Sun that the fire episode was [...] "twenty minutes of shouting", questioned why one character was seen flouting the smoking ban and Phil was boarded up behind an inward-opening door, and opined that he was glad to see Peggy leave as she had become [...] "increasingly psychotic" [...] and [...] "vile".|$|E

2500|$|My So-Called Life was {{produced}} before {{the explosion of}} youth and teen programming. The culture of television changed significantly {{in the years that}} immediately followed, most notably with the rise of The WB and UPN, networks that eventually catered to the teenaged audience My So-Called Life sought, in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade) (The WB and UPN launched just two weeks and one week respectively before My So-Called Lifes run on ABC ended). Holzman never intended the show to be exclusively for teens. In the end, not enough viewers of any age were watching the show during its initial network run. ABC was more focused on larger ratings numbers and wider demographics.

2500|$|Although {{leaflets}} {{were seen}} as being an effective tactic in manipulating troops when morale was low, [...] "During {{the early months of}} the war, leaflets or pamphlets were scattered over enemy territory by aircraft and balloons {{but it was more than}} doubtful whether these had any useful effect, their obvious defects being that few can have reached their targets and, being printed, they were sometimes out of date by the time they were ready to distribute. The front-line distribution of leaflets was <b>quite</b> <b>another</b> matter and these were dropped by aircraft or fired by shells, the messages they bore being less careful about the general principles of consistency and frankness and only truthful about matters on which the enemy had contradictory information". It was found that psychological warfare was not effective when distributing surrender leaflets to an enemy which currently had a high morale amongst its troops. Despite the pitfalls to airborne leaflets ineffectiveness on opposing sides with high morale, enemies used this tactic [...] "to cause the men to begin talking to each other about their poor military position, their desire to stay alive for their families' sakes, and the reasonableness of honorable surrender", which often led men to desert their troops.|$|E
