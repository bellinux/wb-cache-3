40|$|Introduction: Childhood obesity has {{increased}} rapidly worldwide. Primary schools {{could play a}} major role in prevention of childhood obesity. sCOOLsport is a method that primary schools can use to implement health policy and interventions promoting a healthy lifestyle. sCOOLsport focuses on four main topics: daily physical activity, healthy weight, physical competence and adequate motor skills. sCOOLsport is a practice-based intervention. Twelve primary schools in The Netherlands already used the method. In order to deserve the title of “sCOOLsport school”, the school has to meet twenty one fixed (minimum) <b>quality</b> <b>marks.</b> The aim of the current study was to investigate to what extent schools comply with the <b>quality</b> <b>marks</b> within a three year period. In addition, factors facilitating and inhibiting implementation were investigated. Methods: A process evaluation was performed at the level of the intervention owner (SportZeeland), the primary schools and the most important collaborating partners. In phase one, SportZeeland was questioned in a face-to-face interview. In phase two, questionnaires were sent to the twelve primary schools. In phase three, group interviews were conducted with teachers and pupils. The three most important collaborating partners of the schools were interviewed by telephone. Results: All schools paid attention to the four main topics of sCOOLsport. Compliance with the <b>quality</b> <b>marks,</b> however, varied strongly between schools. The school that performed best complied to sixteen <b>quality</b> <b>marks,</b> the school that performed worst complied to only eight <b>quality</b> <b>marks.</b> A minority of schools complied to the following quality marks: Four hours per week to devote to sCOOLsport, a program for children who are not meeting physical activity guidelines, parental involvement, a method aimed at physical activity and healthy eating and a program for physical competence in all groups. Important factors facilitating implementation of sCOOLsport were support of SportZeeland, support of sport students and collaboration with partners. No or limited support for sCOOLsport within the school team was the most important inhibiting factor. Discussion: The results indicate that all schools paid attention to the four main topics of sCOOLsport. The results also indicate, however, that it is difficult for schools to comply to all <b>quality</b> <b>marks,</b> even in a period of three years. Therefore, it should be questioned if a school should meet all <b>quality</b> <b>marks</b> to be named a sCOOLsport school. In addition, SportZeeland can use the results to further improve the method and facilitate future implementation. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
