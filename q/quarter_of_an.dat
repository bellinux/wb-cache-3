5|$|Simms {{made his}} Football League debut at Lincoln City {{in place of}} Caesar Jenkyns, who had missed his train. In bitterly cold weather, after snow had been cleared from the pitch, Lincoln took {{advantage}} of winning the toss by choosing to play downhill, and took a 2–1 lead. On change of ends, Small Heath {{came back into the}} game, and scored twice in the last <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour to take the game 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Parallel to his joining New York City FC, Villa was {{announced}} to {{have joined the}} Australian A-League with Melbourne City, following the team's association with Manchester City. Villa was on a guest stint, allowing him to make up to ten appearances for Melbourne City during the 2014–15 season, {{taking advantage of the}} scheduling of the A-League and MLS to maintain match fitness ahead of his debut with New York City. After only joining Melbourne City for pre-season training just over a week before their first game, Villa was brought on in the 48th minute of {{the first game of the}} season against Sydney FC, and scored a debut goal a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour into his appearance. On 19 October 2014, in his second match, Villa scored an 87th-minute equaliser against the Newcastle Jets for a 11 draw.|$|E
5|$|As a Premier League team, Manchester City {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round. Their opening match was an away draw at Leicester City. Following a supporter campaign, Manchester City dedicated the match to former striker Neil Young, who was terminally ill. Young scored the winning goal when Manchester City and Leicester City met in the 1969 FA Cup Final. Manchester City fell behind after 46 seconds when Sol Bamba scored for Leicester following a corner. Manchester City took the lead by half-time through James Milner and Carlos Tevez, but Andy King equalised midway through the second half to make the score 2–2. The tie was replayed at the City of Manchester Stadium the following week. Tevez gave Manchester City the lead after <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour, but the lead was brief. Four minutes later, Paul Gallagher's penalty levelled the score, after Patrick Vieira had fouled Lloyd Dyer. Before half-time, two Manchester City goals in 90 seconds shifted {{the momentum of the}} match. In the second half, Tevez missed a penalty and a goal by Dyer made the score 3–2. Leicester then pushed for an equaliser, but instead Aleksandar Kolarov scored on a counter-attack to make the final score 4–2.|$|E

5|$|The final was {{postponed}} from its scheduled start on Monday at 4p.m. until Thursday, 19 July, at 3:30p.m. because of rain. On Thursday {{it was still}} showery, causing the final to be further delayed by an hour. It began on a dead and slippery court in front of about 200 spectators. There was a temporary three-plank stand {{on one side of}} the court offering seating to about thirty people. Marshall won the toss, elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore. After the first set was won by Gore, it started to rain for a <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play. The final lasted 48 minutes, and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15, 13, and 20 minutes respectively. En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46. Gore, the volley specialist, had beaten the baseline player, at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting. Some tried to outlaw the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in The Field for weeks after the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Feyenoord opened December with a {{home game}} against PSV. The {{visitors}} took an early lead but Boëtius scored an equalizer {{in the first half}} stoppage time. Pellè added a penalty goal in the second half; several minutes later he got another attempt which he missed. Pellè later added another goal to the tally for a 3–1 Feyenoord win. The team moved back into fourth place in the league table after the first 15 games of the season. On 8 December Feyenoord played SC Heerenveen on the road. Feyenoord scored twice within the first <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour; Boëtius opened the score and Immers doubled the lead. The game ended as a 2–1 win after Heerenveen got on the board at the stroke of half-time. The win kept Feyenoord in fourth place in the Eredivisie standings. On 15 December, Feyenoord played FC Groningen at home. Pellè scored the lone goal of the game in the seventh minute of play. This third consecutive win kept Feyenoord in fourth place at the halfway mark of the season with 30 points from 17 matches. Feyenoord played their fourth round KNVB cup match in Almelo against Heracles Almelo on 18 December. Pellè scored after 11 minutes, Heracles equalized midway through the first half. Three minutes into extra time De Vrij received a second yellow card; Feyenoord kept the 1–1 score throughout extra time with ten men. In the penalty shootout all initial ten shooters scored. Clasie scored the sixth Feyenoord penalty before Heracles' Rienstra missed, sending Feyenoord to the quarter-finals of the KNVB Cup. Feyenoord's last game of 2013, at home against PEC Zwolle, marked their 2000th professional league game. They won the game 3–0 due to two first half goals in a seven-minute span by Immers and an early second half goal by Boëtius. This marked the last game before the winter break. Their five-game winning streak led them to fourth place in the league and the quarter-finals of the cup heading into the new year.|$|E
5|$|The {{animosity}} between Taylor and the Giants {{carried over}} into the 1963 preseason, as the second <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> exhibition game between Green Bay and New York began with Taylor drawing a personal foul penalty for roughing up Giants defensive end Andy Robustelli. Taylor had a slow start to the 1963 season as he recovered from numerous injuries and his bout of hepatitis, but still managed another 1,000-yard season. He again eclipsed 1,000yards in 1964, becoming {{the first player to}} record five straight 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also began to see more use as a receiver out of the backfield during his later career. His specialty in the passing game was catching short swing passes from quarterback Bart Starr. His most productive season as a receiver was 1964, as he caught 38 passes for a career-high 354yards and three touchdowns. That season also included an 84-yard touchdown run in a win over the Detroit Lions, the longest run of his career and the longest of any player in the NFL that year. He made his final Pro Bowl appearance after the 1964 season and the last in a string of five straight. Despite the productivity from Taylor, the Packers missed the postseason in 1963 and 1964. They returned to the postseason in 1965, where Taylor carried 50 times for 156yards over two games. He gained 96 of those yards during the Packers' 23–12 win over the Browns in the 1965 NFL Championship Game, second to Hornung's 105. Taylor was named the game's most outstanding player by SPORT magazine and received a Chevrolet Corvette.|$|E

5|$|Heading into Memorial Day Weekend, United {{wrapped up}} May {{with the opening}} match of their two-game West Coast road trip on 29 May at Jeld-Wen Field {{to take on the}} Portland Timbers. The Timbers, who held a 5–3–2 record prior to the match had won every single match at home during MLS play. United {{successfully}} ended that home streak with a 3–2 victory over the Timbers, thanks to goals from Perry Kitchen, his first professional goal in his career, as well as Chris Pontius and Josh Wolff. In the match, Kitchen opened the scoring for United with a 13th-minute half-volley thanks to a redirected header from Dejan Jakovic. While United were able to hold the 1–0 lead well into the second half of play, a chain of contentious decisions from center official Geoff Gamble, but primarily linesmen Eric Proctor. It was only the second MLS match that Gamble officiated, with his first coming on the previous weekend. In the 67th minute of play, United conceded a penalty kick to the Timbers. United goalkeeper, Bill Hamid initially saved Timbers striker Kenny Cooper's first penalty shot, only for the shot to be retaken. Proctor flagged for a retaking of the kick claiming that Hamid stepping off his line before the kick was taken, an infraction of the rules. The contrasting argument from Hamid, as well as other United players, was that Cooper stutter-stepped before taking the ball, which is illegal in the Laws of the Game. Nevertheless, it was ruled that a second retake would be taken, again by Cooper. Hamid consecutively saved the shot, only for Proctor to again rule that Hamid repeated the same original infraction. The ruling caused Hamid to storm over to Proctor in disdain for his decision, consequently earning Hamid a yellow card for dissent. For the third shot on the mark, Timbers captain Jack Jewsbury took the shot and buried it in the bottom left-hand post, leveling the score at 1–1. The stalemate was tentative, as Diego Chara of the Timbers conceded a penalty in the box when he mistimed a slide tackle on Pontius, leading to a handball. Pontius scored his second penalty of the season, and his second consecutive in league play to give United the 2–1 advantage. A <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> hour later, Wolff notched a goal, extending United's lead in the 85th minute. The Timbers' Jorge Perlaza scored a consolation goal in the 88th minute of play, but it would fail to be enough.|$|E

25|$|To {{appreciate}} how this quadrature phase shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates {{while maintaining a}} constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal displacements of the dot, relative {{to the center of}} the circle, vary sinusoidally in time and are out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wavelength.|$|R
