5000|$|Originally, {{the game}} was {{designed}} for teams consisting of at least 10 players, who were divided into several squads. Game zone often included the whole city area of several hundreds square kilometers, so squads were located {{at different points in}} order to ensure <b>quick</b> <b>response</b> <b>time.</b> If level was located at north of city, squads from south were just standing by waiting for their teammates to finish. This meant that out of 10 levels, one squad could only be present at most 4-5 locations during the game, which caused some players to lose the interest. As an attempt to make the game more intense, and exclude full enjoyment into all levels, [...] "lite" [...] version was invented: designed for one squad per team, it ensured that everyone would be able to experience every level personally, without any sorts of standby.

50|$|The NOAA Corps is the {{smallest}} of the seven uniformed services of the United States Government. It has over 300 commissioned officers, but no enlisted or warrant officer personnel. The NOAA Corps today provides a cadre of professionals trained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, meteorology, fisheries science, and other related disciplines. NOAA Corps officers operate NOAA ships, fly NOAA aircraft, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and serve in staff positions throughout NOAA, as well as in positions in the United States Department of Defense, the United States Coast Guard, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the United States Department of State. Like its predecessors, the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps and the ESSA Corps, the NOAA Corps provides a ready source of technically skilled officers which can be incorporated into the U.S. armed forces in time of war, and in peacetime supports defense requirements in addition to its purely civilian scientific projects. While civilian personnel could perform many of its functions, the advantage of the NOAA Corps as a commissioned service is the <b>quick</b> <b>response</b> <b>time</b> of its personnel, which NOAA can shift among projects and to various places around the world as the need arises more quickly and more easily than it could by reassigning or hiring civilian personnel to meet new or changing requirements.|$|E

While the typical size of web document collections is constantly increasing, users have come to expect a very <b>quick</b> <b>response</b> <b>time,</b> and accurate search results.
