When fellow agent Ellis loses contact during a mission in Costa Rica, the top-secret Agency dispatches Gabe and Lian to find him.

5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing to ask <b>questions</b> <b>when</b> they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's name was put forward by liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate. However, Warren repeatedly stated that she was not running for President in 2016. In October 2013, she joined with the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. In response to <b>questions</b> <b>when</b> she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E

5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals that Mary isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his <b>questions.</b> <b>When</b> she arrives, Hancock discovers that Mary also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes that Mary is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E

25|$|The Bureau’s {{creation}} became controversial on Capitol Hill. In December 1920, a U.S. House appropriations subcommittee questioned Van Winkle and District Commissioner Charles W. Kutz. Subcommittee members Rep. George Tinkham (a Republican from Massachusetts) (and Rep. Thomas U. Sisson, a Democrat from Mississippi) objected that Congress had {{not specifically}} appropriated {{funds for a}} bureau of policewomen. Colonel Kutz responded that Congress had specifically appropriated funds for police officers, and “there {{is nothing in the}} law that requires that policemen shall be of the male sex.” During the hearing, Tinkham, an opponent of women’s suffrage, asked Van Winkle dozens of <b>questions.</b> <b>When</b> asked why she was doing this work, she replied, “because I have nothing else to do; it is my job in life.” Ultimately, the Subcommittee did not withhold the Bureau’s appropriation.|$|E
25|$|From 1974 until 1999, {{the exam}} had 30 {{questions}} and was 90 minutes long, scoring 5 points for correct answers. Originally {{during this time}} period, 1 point was awarded for leaving an answer blank, however it was changed in the late 1980s to 2 points for omitted <b>questions.</b> <b>When</b> the exam was shortened {{as part of the}} 2000 rebranding, the value of a correct answer was increased to 6 points (keeping 150 as a perfect score). In 2001, the score of a blank was increased to 2.5 to penalize guessing. The 2007 exams were the first with only 1.5 points awarded for a blank, to discourage students from leaving a large number of questions blank in order to assure qualification for the AIME. For example, on the AMC 12, a student could advance with only 11 correct answers, presuming the remaining questions were left blank. Now, a student must answer at least 14 questions correctly to reach 100 points.|$|E
25|$|Since 2007, Harriet Harman {{has been}} Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, the UK's current {{opposition}} party. Traditionally, being Deputy Leader has ensured the cabinet role of Deputy Prime Minister. However, Gordon Brown {{announced that he}} would not have a Deputy Prime Minister, much to the consternation of feminists, particularly with suggestions that privately Brown considered Jack Straw to be de facto deputy prime minister and thus bypassing Harman. With Harman's cabinet post of Leader of the House of Commons, Brown allowed her to chair Prime Minister's <b>Questions</b> <b>when</b> {{he was out of the}} country. Harman also held the post Minister for Women and Equality. In April 2012 after being sexually harassed on London public transport English journalist Laura Bates founded the Everyday Sexism Project, a website which documents everyday examples of sexism experienced by contributors from around the world. The site quickly became successful and a book compilation of submissions from the project was published in 2014. In 2013, the first oral history archive of the United Kingdom women’s liberation movement (titled Sisterhood and After) was launched by the British Library.|$|E

25|$|The Corleonesi {{were also}} indicted in the Trial of the 114 {{related to the}} First Mafia War that {{resulted}} in the Ciaculli Massacre, that was also prepared by Terranova. During an interrogation preparing the trial, Leggio refused to answer <b>questions.</b> <b>When</b> in response to one of them, Leggio replied that he could not even recall his own name or his parents, Terranova instructed the clerk: “Write that Leggio does not know whose son he is.” Leggio was infuriated with the implication that he was a bastard. The incident {{was the beginning of a}} deep hatred by Leggio for Terranova. “Leggio actually had foam on his lips; he would have killed me on the spot if he could,” Terranova told his wife. The prosecution appealed successfully against the Catanzaro verdict that had acquitted Leggio and had him tried in absentia in 1970. This time Leggio was found guilty, although he had left jail after the Catanzaro trial, given the time they had already spent in detention while awaiting trial, and it was not until 1974 that Leggio was finally captured again and taken into custody.|$|E
25|$|Case 2. This case {{illustrates}} autonomic status epilepticus {{with behavioral}} disturbances {{that would be}} difficult to attribute to seizure activity before the motor focal ictal events. A 6-year-old normal boy had a seizure at 4 years of age while traveling on a train with his parents who vividly described the event: “He was happily playing and asking <b>questions</b> <b>when</b> he started complaining that he was feeling sick, became very pale, and quiet. He did not want to drink or eat. Gradually, he was getting more and more pale, kept complaining that he felt sick, and became restless and frightened. Ten minutes from the onset, his head and eyes slowly turned to the left. The eyes were opened but fixed to the left upper corner. We called his name but he was unresponsive. He had completely gone. We tried to move his head but this was fixed to the left. There were no convulsions. This lasted for another 15 minutes, when his head and eyes returned to normal and he looked better, although he was droopy and really not there. At this stage he vomited once. In the ambulance, approximately 35 minutes from the onset, he was still not aware of what was going on, although he was able to answer simple questions with yes or no. In the hospital he slept for three quarters of an hour and gradually came around, but it took him another half to an hour before he became normal again”. EEG showed occipital paroxysms and MRI was normal. A similar prolonged episode, preceded by behavioral changes, occurred 8 months later at school. He received no medication. Since then he has been well.|$|E
