The possible reasons for the significant intensity differences have been investigated through considerations of the roles of both the resonance fluorescence and the mesospheric chemistry. From deliberations of all the possible factors, it appears that whereas resonance fluorescence, through only the Na abundance variations, plays only a minor role, its the chemistry, through the Na abundance variations and the variations in the collisional quenching of excited NaO (A) due to significant pressure differences, that has played greater role towards the observed significant intensity differences among these days. However, since the direct quantitative measurements of mesospheric Na concentration were not available and also the quantitative detailed data on the dependence of α and RD on pressure were not available in the literature, contributions of resonance fluorescence and chemistry could not be quantitatively established.

Whereas steady-state photosynthetic {{responses to}} environmental {{factors have been}} extensively studied, knowledge of dynamic modulation of photosynthesis remains scarce and scattered. This review addresses this discrepancy by summarizing available data and identifying the research questions necessary to advance our understanding of interactions between environmental factors and dynamic behaviour of photosynthesis using a mechanistic framework. Firstly, dynamic photosynthesis is separated into sub-pro-cesses related to proton and electron transport, non-photochemical <b>quenching,</b> <b>control</b> of metabolite flux through the Calvin cycle (activation states of Rubisco and RuBP regeneration, and post-illumination metabolite turnover), and control of CO 2 supply to Rubisco (stomatal and mesophyll conductance changes). Secondly, the modulation of dynamic photosynthesis and its sub-processes by environmental factors is described. Increases in ambient CO 2 concentration and temperature (up to ~ 35 °C) enhance rates of photosynthetic induction and decrease its loss, facilitating more efficient dynamic photosynthe-sis. Depending on the sensitivity of stomatal conductance, dynamic photosynthesis may additionally be modulated by air humidity. Major knowledge gaps exist regarding environmental modulation of loss of photosynthetic induction, dynamic changes in mesophyll conductance, {{and the extent of}} limitations imposed by stomatal conductance for different species and environmental conditions.

These show a relatively small and amply documented rise in the sub-s time range towards the plateau level Fpl followed by a delayed and S-shaped rise towards a steady state level Fm which is between three and four fold the initial dark fluorescence level Fo. Properties of this retarded slow rise are i) rate of dark recovery is (1 – 6  s) − 1, ii) suppression by low concentration of protonophores, iii) responsiveness to complementary single turnover flash excitation with transient amplitude towards a level Fm which is between five and six fold the initial dark fluorescence level Fo and iv) in harmony with and quantitatively interpretable {{in terms of a}} release of photoelectrochemical <b>quenching</b> <b>controlled</b> by the trans-thylakoid proton pump powered by the light-driven Q cycle.

In Nannochloropsis, thylakoid lipids, including monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), are enriched in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). The need for EPA in MGDG is not understood. Fatty acids are de novo synthesized in the stroma, then converted into very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (FAs) at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The production of MGDG relies therefore on an EPA supply from the ER to the plastid, following an unknown process. We identified seven elongases and five desaturases possibly involved in EPA production in Nannochloropsis gaditana Among the six heterokont-specific saturated FA elongases possibly acting upstream in this pathway, we characterized the highly expressed isoform Δ 0 -ELO 1 Heterologous expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) showed that NgΔ 0 -ELO 1 could elongate palmitic acid.

Cultures of explants of mammary gland were made (Trowell, 1959) from Schneider mice at various stages of their first pregnancy. The length of pregnancy was taken from the time of appearance of a vaginal plug. Insulin (Sigma Chemical Co., 24 =. i. u/mg.) was used at a concentration of 5 =m. /ml. medium.

The tissue was removed and weighed, the acid-insoluble material hydrolysed (Mahin & Lofberg, 1966), and the radioactivity determined in a liquid-scintillation counter (Packard Model No. 3003). Since the degree of quenching was similar for all samples, the radioactivity was expressed as counts/min. /mg. wet weight of tissue without correction for <b>quenching.</b> <b>Control</b> expiants were treated in the same way except that insulin was omitted.
