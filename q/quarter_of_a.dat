While many of her texts were for children, some of her works, such as The Œconomy of Charity, were also for specific adult audiences. Still others were written for both children and adults, such as The Servant’s Friend (1786–7), which was meant to instruct servants of all ages.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the city}} walls, suburbs had sprung up {{providing}} {{homes for the}} craftsmen and tradespeople who flocked to the already overcrowded city.

Other immigrants had taken over fine town houses, vacated by Royalists who had fled the country during the Commonwealth, converting them into tenements with different families in every room. These properties were soon vandalised and became rat-infested slums.|$|E
