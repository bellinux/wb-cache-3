5|$|In {{addition}} {{to improving the}} economy, the lower social classes also had to {{be integrated into the}} new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.|$|E

25|$|The {{period of}} the rishonim, or the First Rabbinic Epoch, {{primarily}} consists of the writings from 11th and 12th century Spanish and French schools.

500|$|From {{mid to late}} 1967, Syd Barrett's erratic {{behaviour}} {{became more}} apparent, and at one performance of the band's first US tour, he slowly detuned his guitar while on stage. The audience, used to the band's experimental performances, seemed to enjoy such antics, and were unaware {{of the rest of}} the band's increasing consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Barrett's reply to Boone's <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "blank and totally mute stare", and kept his lips closed during the mimed performance. Barrett exhibited behaviour in a similar style during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Barrett mimed fairly well for the performance of [...] "Apples and Oranges", but responded to Clark's questions with no interest or enthusiasm.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} primetime payment {{structure was}} also used {{for the first two}} seasons of the syndicated version.

When the [...] "shuffle format" [...] was used, the first ten questions had random amounts from $100 to $25,000, as listed above. In addition, the number of questions needed to win the million was reduced to 14, removing the $50,000 level; the last four values remained the same for round two. When the shuffle format ended {{at the start of the}} 2015–16 season, the switch to 14 <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> retained; the first safe haven was kept at $5,000, but the second was raised to $50,000.|$|E

500|$|The Anekantavada {{premises}} of the Jains is ancient, {{as evidenced by}} its mention in Buddhist texts such as the Samaññaphala Sutta. The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "qualified yes" [...] (syāt). These texts identify Anekantavada doctrine {{to be one of}} the key differences between the teachings of the Mahavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer [...] "it is" [...] or [...] "it is not" [...] to metaphysical questions. The Mahavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both [...] "it is" [...] and [...] "it is not", with [...] "perhaps" [...] qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality. Syādvāda (predication logic) and Nayavāda (perspective epistemology) of Jainism expand on the concept of anekāntavāda. Syādvāda recommends the expression of anekānta by prefixing the epithet syād to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.|$|E
500|$|At {{the next}} court session on July 15, {{prosecutors}} submitted evidence that V.

N.'s original statements and desire to press the charges were valid, and later attempts to recant were in bad faith. Brown then took the stand but refused to answer questions as to why his initial statements to Japanese police were different from what Takaesu later stated in court had actually happened on the night in question. The prosecutor asked Brown, [...] "Your original statement that she made sexual advances was false?" [...] Brown replied, [...] "I am not going to answer that." [...] When asked why he would not answer, Brown replied, [...] "Because I want the opportunity for this court to see publicly the type of corruption and distortion of evidence by the police and the prosecutor." [...] Takaesu later said that another reason for Brown's refusal to answer most of the <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> because his answers could be used by the USMC in separate military justice actions against Brown.|$|E
500|$|When {{the ninth}} {{syndicated}} season began on September 13, 2010, the format was overhauled. Ten {{questions were asked}} in round one, each assigned one of ten different money amounts which were randomized {{at the beginning of}} the game, as were the questions themselves. The difficulty of the <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> not tied to the dollar value. The dollar values for each question remained hidden until a contestant either provided a correct answer or chose to [...] "jump" [...] the question. The value of each question answered correctly was added to the contestant's bank, for a maximum total of $68,600. A contestant who completed the round successfully could walk at any subsequent point with all the money in their bank, or could walk without completing the round with half that amount (e.g., a contestant who banked $30,000 would leave with $15,000). After completing round one, the contestant moved on to a second round of gameplay (the [...] "Classic Millionaire" [...] round), in which four non-categorized questions were played for set non-cumulative values and a correct answer augmented the contestant's winnings to that point, as in the older formats. The shuffle format changes, including the randomization and double-round distribution of questions, were reverted for the fourteenth syndicated season.|$|E

After calling the number, the caller was sent a text message from Weyland Corporation that linked them to a video that was presented as an advertisement for the [...] "David 8" [...] android, narrated by Fassbender. An extended version of the video, released on April 17, 2012, lists the android's features, including its ability to seamlessly replicate human emotions without the restrictions of ethics or distress. A full page [...] "David 8" [...] advertisement was placed in The Wall Street Journal; a Twitter account operated by a David8, that allowed Twitter users to ask the character <b>questions,</b> <b>was</b> included. A partnership with Verizon FiOS was launched, offering a virtual tour of the Prometheus spaceship. Another video, [...] "Quiet Eye", starring Rapace as Shaw, was released on May 16, 2012, and debuted on the Verizon FIOS Facebook page. In a telephone call monitored by Yutani, a fictional company from the Alien series, Shaw requests Weyland's aid to seek out alien life. In France, the Saint-Martin ghost train station was converted to resemble alien architecture from the film, and was visible to passing commuters. The campaign continued after the film's release with a website that was listed during the film's end credits. The site referenced the philosophical novel Thus Spoke Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche, and featured a video of Weyland, who quotes from the book. Another video followed in September 2012, featuring Elba's Captain Janek preparing for a mission.|$|E
500|$|Through late 1967 {{and early}} 1968, Barrett's {{behaviour}} became increasingly erratic and unpredictable, {{partly as a}} consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs, most prominently LSD. There is also much speculation that he suffered from schizophrenia. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and socially withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganized speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of catatonia. Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends including Rick Wright, came back [...] "a completely different person." [...] One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, empty, dead-eyed stare. He was unable to recognize old friends that he had known for years, and often did not know where he was. At one point, while {{on a tour of the}} city of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, [...] "Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!" [...] Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all. At a show at The Fillmore in San Francisco, during a performance of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", Barrett slowly detuned his guitar. The audience seemed to enjoy such antics, unaware of the rest of the band's consternation. Interviewed on Pat Boone's show during this tour, Syd's reply to Boone's <b>questions</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "blank and totally mute stare," [...] according to Nick Mason, [...] "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." [...] Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on Dick Clark's popular TV show American Bandstand. Although surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts of the song competently, during a group interview afterwards, when asked two questions by Clark, Barrett's answers were terse, almost to the point of rudeness (though, Clark noted, they had been flying non-stop from London to Los Angeles). During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and occasionally was unable to hold his pick. Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed Mandrax tranquilliser tablets and an entire tube of Brylcreem into his hair, which subsequently melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting, making him look like [...] "a guttered candle". Nick Mason later disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that [...] "Syd would never waste good mandies".|$|E
