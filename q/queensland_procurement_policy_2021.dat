The policy of purchasing companies is set of individual policies relating to suppliers, the amount of orders and stock, the purchase price, quality, product type and delivery methods. Well-established <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> provides a major opportunity to reduce costs and increase contribution margins. To prove the hypothesis about the logistics cost as a factor governing the creation and management of effective <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> are applied scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction, mathematical methods and method of information modeling.

At {{least part of the}} reason for forming DOD was to coordinate, rationalize, and increase the efficiency of the defense sector's procurement process. Since its inception, DOD's <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> have been studied extensively, a multitude of reforms have been recommended, and many reforms have been implemented. However, after almost 40 years, analysts are still recommending reforms to improve coordination and rationality, and to increase the efficiency of DOD's <b>procurement</b> <b>policies.</b> This paper will trace the evolution of DOD's <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> over the last forty years. It will concentrate on five major reform efforts: the McNamara era; the Packard initiatives; OMB Circular A- 109; the Acquisition Improvement Program (Carlucci); and the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management (Packard Commission). <b>Procurement</b> <b>policy,</b> DoD <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> reform...|$|R

In addition, the way in which this practice exacerbates the existing housing backlog is explored. The article contends that the Provincial Departments of Local Government and Housing in South Africa are largely incompetent when it comes to implementing the preferential <b>procurement</b> <b>policy.</b> Consequently, the question of how the implementation of this policy could be improved is considered.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the implementation of}} the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the reconstruction and development housing programme (RDP) in Limpopo Province. The research objective {{of this study is to}} assess the institutional capacity of the Department of Local Government and Housing (DLGH) in Limpopo Province in implementing the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> in relation to the reconstruction and development housing programme. Further, the monitoring and evaluation mechanisms determined by the Department of Local Government and Housing to oversee {{the implementation of the}} <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses. In realising the research objectives of this study, the qualitative research methodology was adopted as the study seeks to understand the situation in its naturalistic form. Therefore, pre-determined interview questions were used to interview those who interact directly or indirectly with the implementation of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses. The purpose was to solicit relevant information and subjective experience from the agents of <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> implementation as well as the beneficiaries of the RDP houses. Not forgetting that qualitative research, studies phenomenon in its natural occurrence and it avoids simplifying, rather, it observes a subject on its multifaceted form. The data collected through interviews was useful in providing relevant policy information of which was unknown and instrumental for this study’s investigation. The study of Public Administration is regarded as the management of public programmes and as such that is possible through public policy, organising, finance, human resource, work standard and procedure, and control measures. It is therefore, indispensable for the Department of Local Government and Housing in Limpopo Province to embody these functions of public management. Thus this study focused on the institutional capacity in terms of <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> implementation, focusing on whether the Department of Local Government and Housing has sufficient resources such as human capital, equipments and material in implementing the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy.</b> An empirical study was conducted to collect insights and subjective experiences from those who constantly interact with the implementation of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> concerning the effectiveness and success of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses. The interview questions were directed to prospective members of the DLGH those responsible for procuring, implementing and those affected (beneficiaries). From the findings, the study proved that the Department of Local Government and Housing in Limpopo is confronted with many challenges as far as the implementation of the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses is concerned. The study has suggested recommendations for the improvement of the institutional capacity of the Department of Local Government and Housing in implementing the <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> with reference to the RDP houses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a counterexample to the Miyagiwa ((1991) American Economic Review 81, 1320 – 1328) claim that discriminatory government <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> is ineffective as a protectionist device, when the goods are also {{consumed by the}} private sector. The procurement sector is a homogeneous product Cournot–Nash duopoly, with a home and a foreign firm. The <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> {{takes the form of}} an ad valorem premium over the import price. If both the firms play the output game in strategic complements, <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> can lower imports. This possibility arises when the product demand is unit elastic, corresponding to cash limits to public expenditure, and providing the home firm is smaller than the foreign firm. By adding a competitive export sector, the paper also derives sufficient conditions for macroeconomic coordination failures to occur.

40|$|M. A.) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2003 The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> and {{procedures}} at the University of North West. This analysis might assist the university to formulate a <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> that would be effective, efficient and cost effective. There was a need to assess the role that the university of North West <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> and procedure play with regard to the procurement of goods and services so that any gaps or limitations can be addressed. The study was conducted at the University of North West from which the sample for the survey was drawn. This is an institution of higher learning in the Republic of South Africa. It is situated in the Capital of North West Province, Mafikeng. In this study three principal methods of enquiry in investigating or exploring the university of North West <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures were used. These were;. literature survey, document study and an empirical investigation which entailed the development of questionnaires. The questionnaire were constructed and distributed to UNW staff members who are responsible for buying in their respective departments. The questionnaire contained thirty seven (37) questions which attempt to validate the research objectives. A total number of seventy (70) potential respondents were targeted and only forty six (46) staff members returned completed questionnaires to the researcher. The sample size for this study was therefore forty six (46). The results were analysed and the findings reflected that in general university of North West <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures need to be reformulated with full participation of the relevant stakeholders. The researcher recommends that the <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures of the university of North West must be revised and user departments must be involved in the whole process. The policies and procedures should also be formulated in line with the government preferential <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> framework Act no. 5 of 2000. Master...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of a social public <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> in Switzerland that gives firms that train apprentices' a preferential treatment. We estimate {{the effectiveness of}} this social <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> on a firm's training participation, training intensity, and training quality using information from a representative and large firm survey. The results show that although the policy increases the number of training firms, the effect is limited in size, as only small firms and firms operating in sectors where public procurement represents a large share of the business, are affected positively. As a robustness check we further exploit a natural variation in the incidence of public <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> across Cantons and apply a difference-indifferences strategy. The results from this robustness check lie within the range of the effect estimated exploiting the cross-sectional data. Furthermore, we find no evidence that firms offering training due of public <b>procurement</b> <b>policies</b> provide training of a below-average quality...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of public <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> on aid inflows, in Fiji, a small {{developing}} island economy in the Pacific. Prior to 2010, Fiji did not have a strong and detailed public <b>procurement</b> <b>policy.</b> Therefore, in the study, we examine the short-run and long-run impact of adopting an improved (new) public <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> on the aid inflows from the bilateral donors: Australia, United Nations (UN), European Union (EU), Japan, Korea Republic, France, and Germany. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) procedure is used to examine cointegration and the subsequent short-run and long-run effects. Additionally, the model incorporates per capita income, financial development, and crisis as a structural dummy; and the presence of threshold effect on aid inflows is examined. The results show that procurement legislation, financial development, per capita income and crisis have a long-run association with the aid inflows. New public procurement legislation has a positive effect on aid inflows from Australia, EU, Germany and the overall aid. In short-run, procurement legislation has a positive effect on aid inflows from Korea Republic only; and the new <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> and financial development have a long-run positive effect on aid inflows to Fiji. Overall, improved <b>procurement</b> <b>policies,</b> a well-developed financial sector development and a reasonable level of growth will bolster aid inflows whereas political uncertainty and global financial crisis retard aid inflows...|$|R

This research effort explore {{the merit of}} developing a <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> manual for purchasing organizations within the Navy Field Contracting System (NFCS). The structure, content, uses, advantages, and methods for evaluating effectiveness found in the literature, {{as well as the}} generic characteristics of a <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> manual, are identified and discussed. These properties are then applied to Navy purchasing manuals and questionnaires received from participating contracting activities and the differences and similarities analyzed. The research concludes that <b>procurement</b> <b>policy</b> manuals are useful and Navy contracting organizations should be encouraged to develop and use them.
