5|$|Alexander, the {{previous}} MacDonald leader, had made land grants to the eldest and youngest sons of Lachlan MacLean, grandson of Alexander's aunt. John Garbh (the youngest son) now obtained Rùm (possibly, Alexander had quitclaimed it to him); like Hugh's gains, Clan Ranald objected to this transfer. Traditional accounts claim that John Garbh purchased a <b>quitclaim</b> of Clan Ranald rights from their leader, Allan, {{by giving them}} a galley; though the galley looked in good quality, the interior (so the legend says) was rotten, hence explaining Clan Ranald's refusal to accept John Garbh's ownership of Rùm. John Garbh subsequently seized Allan, and held him prisoner on Coll for 9 months; presumably Allan was only released once he had agreed to acknowledge the exchange.|$|E

25|$|Cokayne's {{involvement}} with Cromwell then drew {{him into the}} affairs of Lincolnshire. Walter Tailboys, a neighbour and client of Cromwell, together {{with some of his}} relatives and friends, had initiated an assize of novel disseisin. Eight plaintiffs and four defendants were named, although others were involved, and a number of tenements were at stake on or close to the Lincolnshire coast, at Theddlethorpe, Mablethorpe, Saltfleetby, Strubby, Carlton, Gayton and Withern, suggesting a contest between groups of property speculators. The plaintiffs had triumphed at the initial hearing and the defendants had decided to come to terms. They promised to accept the judgement and make a <b>quitclaim,</b> but wanted to limit their losses. Both sides seem to have recruited guarantors among serving MPs: the 1431 parliament, which was Cokayne's tenth, was assembling as the legal process continued. The defendants obtained recognizances to guarantee their <b>quitclaim</b> from John Culpepper, just elected MP for Rutland, and from Thomas Strange, a Midlands landowner. Cokayne agreed to enter into a recognizance of £1000 in Derbyshire to guarantee that Tailboys would press the issue no further after the judgement had been affirmed. This was matched by Sir Richard Stanhope, then serving as MP for Nottinghamshire, whose wife Maud was Lord Cromwell's daughter. It was later alleged that about this time Cromwell had illegally tried to recruit Cokayne, Vernon and others into his affinity by offering them his livery.|$|E
25|$|In 1354, {{though in}} exile and without {{control of his}} ancestral lands, John, the MacDougall heir, quitclaimed any rights he had over Mull and Iona to the Lord of the Isles (though this had no {{meaningful}} effect at the time). When Robert's son, David II, King of Scotland, became king, he {{spent some time in}} English captivity; following his release, in 1357, he restored MacDougall authority over Lorn. The 1354 <b>quitclaim,</b> which seems to have been an attempt to ensure peace in just such an eventuality, took automatic effect, splitting Mull and Iona from Lorn, and making it subject to the Lordship of the Isles. Iona remained part of the Lordship of the Isles for the next century and a half.|$|E
25|$|John Burley's origins are obscure, {{not least}} because his name was not uncommon. Burley is a toponymic surname signifing a meadow or {{clearing}} by a fortified place and is found fairly widely across the Midlands and the North of England. He has been portrayed as a nephew of Simon de Burley, an influential courtier executed by the Merciless Parliament {{at the behest of}} the Lords Appellant. However, this makes little sense in view of John Burley's political position and apparent social origins. He seems to have been a son of a John Burley of Wistanstow in southern Shropshire and a nephew of John Burnell of Westbury, Shropshire. The lawyer John Burley is known from a <b>quitclaim</b> deed of 1397 to have had at that time three brothers: Nicholas, portioner of the church of Westbury, James and Edmund. There seems to have been pattern of having a lawyer and a cleric in each generation.|$|E
50|$|Soon after, Reavis and {{his agents}} began selling <b>quitclaims</b> to gullible and frightened {{settlers}} {{located within the}} claim boundaries. The prices charged for the <b>quitclaims</b> varied greatly and showed little relation {{to the value of}} a property or the current occupants ability to pay. Some residents received demands for as much as US$1,000 while others obtained a release for free or in exchange for a meal or a couple of drinks.|$|R

25|$|Although Military Road did not close, Congress passed {{legislation}} allowing {{traffic on the}} highway to be stopped. On January 31, 1936, Representative John D. Dingell, Sr. warned Washington-Hoover Airport that Military Road posed a serious flying hazard. On February 14, airport officials (faced with legal action from Arlington County for obstructing traffic), stopped attempting to close the road using traffic guards, chains, or lights, leading the Department of Commerce to announce it would close the airport if traffic were not stopped. Two days later, the United States Post Office Department declared it would suspend airmail operations at Washington-Hoover unless the road were closed, leading both houses of Congress to introduce legislation demanding closure and realignment of the road. A fight {{broke out in the}} United States Senate over payment for the road: Some Senators wanted Washington-Hoover's owners to pay $50,000 in exchange for a <b>quitclaim</b> deed from the War Department. The airport refused, calling this blackmail. Eventually, after several failed compromises, Congress passed and Roosevelt signed federal legislation permitting traffic to be temporarily stopped whenever planes took off or landed, and paying for guards to do the traffic stops.|$|E
25|$|The {{extension}} of his estates through the Harthill inheritance was for long uncertain. At {{the death of}} his grandfather, Richard Harthill, there was still a male heir in the family, a ten-year-old grandson called William, who was intended to inherit the majority of the estates. Richard had appointed feoffees to ease the transition, although there were reports that the tenants had no connection with the feoffees and an inquisition post mortem decided that Pooley and the rest ought to escheat to the king during William's minority. In March 1401 an inquiry was held at Tamworth, Staffordshire, into the age of William and it transpired that he was 21, old enough to take over his estates, although he his wardship was still held by Roger Sapurton. Only with the death of William sine prole in the summer of 1402 could it be certain that his aunt Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, would inherit. However, matters were still far from straightforward. For example, an inquisition at Tamworth on 10 August found that Elizabeth's stepmother, Mary, was still alive and held a third of the estate at Newton Regis. After the death of Edmund Cokayne in 1403, Elizabeth married John Francis (also rendered Franceys and Fraunceys) of Ingleby, apparently in the same year, She and Francis settled the manor of Harthill on Sir John Cockayne at about the time of their marriage but Elizabeth seems to have been in no hurry to hand over any more of her inheritance to her son. The <b>quitclaim</b> dated 21 April 1416 but issued on 5 May 1417, after her death, listed the manors and properties that made up the Harthill inheritance.|$|E

In her book Historic Houses of Athens, Charlotte Thomas Marshall notes that [...] "It was not until 1904, eleven years after Dr. Camak's [...] death, that the first deed {{relating}} to the Camak house lot was recorded. At that time his sons, Louis and James Wellborn Camak, executed a <b>quitclaim</b> deed to their mother, Mary Wellborn Camak, acknowledging that the lot has been given to her by their father without a deed being made." [...] In 1949, the house was purchased to serve as the Mount Vernon Lodge No. 22, F. & A. M (Masonic lodge); then in 1979 by the Athens Coca-Cola Bottling Company.|$|E
500|$|There is {{evidence}} to suggest that Óláfr might have had a fourth son named Guðrøðr. For example, the chronicle relates how the governor of Mann, described as a kinsman of Haraldr, fled from the king [...] in 1238 and set sail for Wales, taking with him his foster-son Guðrøðr Óláfsson. When the fleeing ship reached the Welsh coast it was wrecked and, according to the chronicle, Guðrøðr perished on board. Furthermore, amongst the names of witnesses within a <b>quitclaim</b> between Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (d. 1282) and Ralph de Mortimer (d. 1246), thought to date to about 1241, there is a certain Guðrøðr who appears in Latin as Godredo filio regis Mannie ("Guðrøðr, son of the King of Mann"). Although the possibility has been raised that the two sources may refer to the same man, there is no further evidence to confirm it.|$|E
500|$|Via a <b>quitclaim</b> from Carolco dated March 28, 1995, MGM {{acquired}} 21st Century's {{film library}} and assets, and received [...] "...all rights {{in and to}} all drafts and versions of the screenplay(s) for Spider-Man written by James Cameron, Ted Newsom & John Brancato, Menahem Golan, Jon [...] Michael Paul, Ethan Wiley, Leslie Stevens, Frank Laloggia, Neil Ruttenberg, Barney Cohen, Shepard Goldman and any and all other writers." [...] MGM also sued 21st Century, Viacom, and Marvel Comics, alleging fraud in the original deal between Cannon and Marvel. In 1998, Marvel emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan that merged the company with Toy Biz. The courts determined that the original contract of Marvel's rights to Golan had expired, returning the rights to Marvel, but the matter was still not completely resolved. In 1999, Marvel licensed Spider-Man rights to Columbia, a subsidiary of Sony Pictures Entertainment. MGM disputed the legality, claiming it had the Spider-Man rights via Cannon, 21st Century, and Carolco.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{territory}} residents vehemently opposed Reavis' {{claim and}} {{his efforts to}} sell quitclaims. [...] Leading the opposition were two Phoenix newspapers, the Herald and Gazette. [...] Beginning in July 1883, the papers called upon area residents not to purchase quitclaims from Reavis. [...] The effectiveness of this call was tainted in November 1883 when {{it was revealed that}} Herald owner Homer H. McNeil had purchased a <b>quitclaim</b> for his property. In response to the public backlash, the embarrassed McNeil was forced to publicly cancel the purchase.|$|E
2500|$|About {{the time}} McNeil was {{returning}} his <b>quitclaim,</b> the Surveyor General's office dispatched Spanish language expert Rufus C. Hopkins to Mexico. [...] Reavis {{and one of}} his lawyers followed Hopkins. [...] Upon their arrival in Guadalajara, Reavis made his best effort to become indispensable to the 70-year-old Hopkins. After introducing the Spanish expert to the local archivists, Reavis proceeded to guide him through the archives and point out the location of various documents. [...] In addition to pointing out various bundles that he wished for Hopkins to inspect, Reavis took time to search new sections of the archive. [...] During this effort he discovered a copy of the December 1748 [...] recommending the initial grant.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{construction}} was beginning, Reavis began hiring rent collectors and agents. [...] He also opened negotiations with James M. Barney, {{owner of the}} Silver King Mining Company. [...] After several weeks Barney agreed to pay US$25,000 for a <b>quitclaim.</b> [...] While a considerable sum for the day, this price was small compared to the profits generated by the mine. [...] Reavis then printed and posted notices throughout the claim instructing residents to contact his lawyer [...] "for registering tenancy and signing agreements, or regard themselves liable to litigation for trespassing and expulsion when the Peralta Grant is, as it must be, validated by the U.S. Government." [...] Arrangements for newspapers and hired publicists announcing the land grant were made, proclaiming the title was ironclad and included both water and mineral rights.|$|E

2500|$|In 1871, Holden met James Alexander Patterson (brother of U.S. Senator David T.

Like many Washingtonian bachelors at the time, he had married an American Indian (a young Lummi princess known as Lizzie), building a small cabin in 1860. Patterson treated Lizzie as a slave and left her to run the farm with Ned, a young Indian hand, {{while he was on}} business in Olympia. Lizzie and Ned eloped to Sumas (then the site of another Indian encampment), leaving behind Patterson's two young daughters, Dollie and Nellie. Patterson refused to allow Lizzie see her children again, but was unable to keep up the farm or take care of the children on his own. He convinced the Judsons to foster his daughters and executed a <b>quitclaim</b> deed in favor of Judson for his [...] and 20 cattle.|$|E
2500|$|He {{requested}} Margaret Russell {{to take a}} vow of chastity if {{she wished}} to inherit his moveable goods {{in addition to her}} customary dower of 1/3 of his real estate. She was however remarried within 7 months, possibly under pressure from Sir Edward Stradling of St. Donat's Castle, Glamorgan, who had obtained the wardship of Morys, her son and Denys's heir. [...] Her new husband, much her junior, was [...] John Kemeys of Began, Monmouth, the young nephew of Stradling. 5 years earlier [...] Stradling's [...] uncle, Sir John Stradling had married Joan Dauntsey, the young widow of Margaret's own father, Sir Morys Russell (d.1416). Sir Edward Stradling married his daughter Katherine to Morys his ward, and Katherine Stradling thereby became matriarch of the Denys line. Denys and Stradling were well known to each other in Glamorgan, and in 1421 Denys had made a <b>quitclaim</b> or General Release to Stradling of his interests in Glamorgan [...] following the death of Sir Roger Berkerolles, Lord of Coity, when much re-shuffling of property occurred. Katherine's mother was Joan, the bastard daughter of Cardinal Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, and son of John of Gaunt. Denys must have been known to Beaufort since he named him one of the overseers of his will, together with Bishop Philip Morgan of Worcester. [...] It is possible that Stradling had obtained the wardship of Morys Denys through the influence of his father-in-law Beaufort, possibly as part of the marriage settlement, for in the next year, 1423, the marriage of Joan and Stradling took place. Morys was aged 12 in 1422, and the only son of his marriage to Katherine Stradling, Walter, [...] was born in 1437, aging Katherine at just 14 when she became a mother. She seems to have died shortly thereafter as Morys then remarried to Alice Poyntz.|$|E
