40|$|A {{procedure}} is presented {{for coping with}} the complexities of energy/environment decision processes. A convenient framework based on multiattribute decision analysis has been developed to help a decision maker evaluate energy/environment alternatives {{in terms of the}} degree to which each of a set of objectives is met. The resulting composite environmental impact model links a preference model with a descriptive environmental impact model. The preference model allows one to evaluate alternative strategies by formally incorporating the decision maker's utilities (i. e. preferences) with the <b>quantified</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> (supplied by the descriptive impact model), the unquantified effects, and the conventional costs. Utility assessments were performed for individuals in the Rhone-Alpes region of France, the German Democratic Republic, and the state of Wisconsin in the U. S. A.

40|$|AbstractIndustry {{adoption}} of environmental product declarations (EPDs, an internationally standardized document providing <b>quantified</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> {{over the life}} cycle of a product) is increasing as LEED® v 4 material credits allow reliance on their content. This raises the question as to whether this reliance is appropriate, as well as larger questions about how it is affecting the wider construction industry. A case study is presented to investigate the use of EPDs in construction projects through the experience and perspective of members of three major stakeholder groups: Owner/Client, Designer, and Contractor. This includes the motivations for using EPDs, potential concerns with the methodology and creation of EPDs, the reliance of the information within EPDs and determining appropriateness of this reliance through the various stages of project delivery. Findings indicate that EPD impacts on the timeline is a key concern from the contractors while limited transparency of EPD development processes was a key concern for designers. Stakeholders noted that the integrative design process was {{critical to the success of}} this project, avoiding long lead-times and allowing for close review of specifications...|$|E

40|$|Complying {{with the}} {{carrying}} capacity {{of local and}} global ecosystems is a prerequisite to ensure environmental sustainability. Based on the example of Swiss mountain dairy farms, the goal of our research was firstly to investigate the relationship between farm global and local environmental performance. Secondly, we aimed to analyse the relationship between farm environmental and economic performance. The analysis relied on a sample of 56 Swiss alpine dairy farms. For each farm, the cradle-to-farm-gate life cycle assessment was calculated, and the <b>quantified</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> were decomposed into their on- and off-farm parts. We measured global environmental performance as the digestible energy produced by the farm per unit of global environmental impact generated from cradle-to-farm-gate. We assessed local environmental performance by dividing farm-usable agricultural area by on-farm environmental impact generation. Farm economic performance was measured by work income per family work unit, return on equity and output/input ratio. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed no significant relationship, trade-offs or synergies between global and local environmental performance indicators. Interestingly, trade-offs were observed far more frequently than synergies. Furthermore, we found synergies between global environmental and economic performance and mostly no significant relationship between local environmental and economic performance. The observed trade-offs between global and local environmental performance mean that, for several environmental issues, any improvement in global environmental performance will result in deterioration of local environmental performance and vice versa. This finding calls for systematic consideration of both dimensions when carrying out farm environmental performance assessments...|$|E

Following the stages of LCA, we discuss the main drawback for each stage: a) Goal stage: discussion of the actual function for organic agriculture; b) Inventory stage: lack of specific databases for organic agriculture c) Impact Assessment: importance of local impact categories for agriculture. We briefly summarise recent work that has been conducted addressing local impacts, but there remain some aspects that should be improved. Our recommendation is that further research should focus on: 1) better knowledge of the nutritional quality of organic food; 2) providing homogenised datasets and 3) development of characterisation factors to evaluate intensities of agricultural activity practices...|$|R

Quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is particularly necessary {{as a first step}} to adapting the pork industry to the regulatory requirements of the future. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a powerful tool for <b>quantifying</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> (i. e. global warming potential) and resource usage (i. e. water usage) throughout the whole pork supply chain. This report is a summary of the research and findings for the first pork LCA project conducted in Australia.

Structured and consistent methods for this purpose have experienced a rapid development. The more rigorous and sophisticated these methods become, the greater is the demand for convenient tools.

To date, applications of these programs to <b>quantify</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> have been restricted to straightforward examples of steady-state processes.

We also present a methodology to address the deficit identified from this review for simple, easy-to-use sustainability assessment methods and tools. We suggest a questionnaire-based methodology to provide non-experts with a better understanding of sustainability performance, specifically during the product design phase. An application of the methodology is demonstrated to <b>quantify</b> and compare <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts</b> for the production of two quadcopter upper shell designs.

A key aspect in LCA is the consideration of whole life cycle systems. The application of LCA in product development inherently comprises the quest for optimisations on all system levels. However, as the act of ecodesign conventionally focuses on physical products, the search for potential optimisations is usually directed ‘downwards’, i. e. towards lower system levels, resulting in optimised components within products rather than optimised products within their surrounding systems.

[1] Overview number of previous studies compared the envi-A ronmental performance of specific brownfield redevelopments with similar projects built on undeveloped greenfield sites. These studies examined single brownfield/infill developments and entailed extensive site-specific analysis. The comparison sites generally accommodated {{the same number of}} residential units and commercial square footage, but typically occupied more acreage per employee or residence and were less location efficient. A review of 12 of these studies concluded that brownfield/infill development results in significant environmental benefits when compared to their greenfield counterparts.

However, these benefits come at a cost, particularly emissions from primarily coal power plants and increased lead waste from battery use. Chinese policy makers are struggling with developing appropriate policy that maximizes modal options and mobility and minimizes <b>environmental</b> <b>impacts.</b> Electric bikes use very little electricity and, as a result, emit low levels of pollution per vehicle (passenger) kilometer traveled, even compared to fully occupied buses. The most problematic issue with electric bikes is the use of lead acid batteries that have high lead loss rates during the production, manufacturing and recycling processes. Most other motorized modes also use lead acid batteries, but their rate of use is lower and thus they have lower lead emission rates per kilometer.
