40|$|<b>Q-technique</b> factor {{analysis}} identifies clusters or factors of people, {{rather than of}} variables, and has proven very popular, {{especially with regard to}} testing typology theories. The present study investigated the utility of three different protocols for obtaining data for <b>Q-technique</b> sLdies. These three protocols were: (1) a conventional ipsative 9 -category Q-sort; (2) a normative response format using unnumbered graphic scales subsequently scored on a 1 -to- 15 scale; and (3) a normative 5 -point Likert scale. Subjects were 10 psychologists reacting to 97 variables in each of the 3 protocols. It was found that normative rating data may be useful in <b>Q-technique</b> studies, at least under some circumstances. It is also suggested that aggregating <b>Q-technique</b> data across repeated measurements may also be useful in some studies. Seven tables and five figures present study data.

Faculty members (N= 146) from seven middle schools responded to 61 items taken from an instrument designed to measure aspects of an idealized middle school culture; the instrument is the Middle School Description Survey (MSDS). In three of the schools, the data were collected using conventional Q-sort procedures. In the remaining four schools, data were collected using an unmarked graphic scale. Separate principal components <b>Q-technique</b> factor analyses were used with the data collected in each school, and results were rotated to the varimax criterion.

The Q-analysis of 29 instructors revealed three groups of opinions towards journalism studies: one advocated a professional approach, one preferred a communication arts focus, and one pushed for a theoretical and research-intensive orientation. While the three groups differed on various matters, they all agreed that journalism and media studies in Lebanon urgently needed more qualified faculty, locally oriented research, and relevant academic and technical resources. Student demographic analysis revealed a stable increase in broadcast journalism and public relations (PR) enrolments but a decrease in print journalism; advertising and marketing were the most popular subjects, followed by broadcast journalism and PR; females outnumbered males; and the Lebanese University, the only public university, remained the most prestigious and popular program despite its dire financial situation. The curricula analysis found most programs had either a practical or a liberal-professional orientation, while only one had a liberal emphasis. In addition, most programs required an internship, while only two required a thesis; English and the US academic system dominated; only one program offered online journalism; while none offered media or news literacy.

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The Purpose of the Study The central {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the professional education competencies of selected community college vocational instructors. Respondents in the study included instructors of business and distributive education. Major dimensions were the construction and validation of a questionnaire for community college vocational instructors; the analysis of data to determine if there were differences among the community colleges in their responses to the competencies contained in the questionnaire; a factor analysis of the professional education competencies and the community college respondents; and the formulation of implications to be considered in the development of teacher education curriculums. The Procedures The construction and validation of the instructor questionnaire was accomplished through a review of the literature, an evaluation by a jury of experts, and a field test. A mail survey questionnaire containing 99 professional education competencies together with a five-point Likert-type scale was used to gather data. The dependent variable was the score judgmentally assigned by respondents to denote the level of proficiency they felt was necessary for each of the 99 competencies. The study's population utilized the four western states of California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington and was representative of business and distributive education instructors at the community college level. A random sample of 160 instructors provided data for the study. The Data The F statistic was used to analyze contrasts between the mean scores for each competency with the. 01 level of significance being used to determine differences existing between the community colleges. A test of Least Significant Difference was used to determine where specific differences existed between means of community colleges which were rejected in the analysis of variance tests. Further analysis of the data was accomplished through the use of two factor analytic techniques, the <b>Q-technique</b> and the R-technique. The <b>Q-technique</b> ordered respondents according to the 99 competencies included in the study. The R-technique was used to cluster competencies according to respondents. Factors and subfactor names were assigned after the data were analyzed. Selected Findings Generally, the analysis of variance tests indicated that the community colleges were alike in their responses to the competencies contained in the questionnaire. The factor analysis of data revealed that the business and distributive education instructors resembled one another in their responses and demonstrated that it is possible to generate factors containing clusters of common professional education competencies. Competencies which clustered under the factors of Instructional Management and Teaching-Learning Process were judged by instructors to require the highest level of proficiency.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify, and to group, the professional education competencies common to administrators of vocational education. The technique of factor analysis was used to form logical groups of competencies. The secondary objectives were to: 1. determine, by the method of the analysis of variance, if significant differences existed among the mean scores of the six administrative groups investigated for 70 competencies, 2. determine, by the method of factor analysis, the "alikeness" of the 72 respondents as indicated by the scores they recorded for 70 tasks, 3. determine the product-moment correlation coefficient between this study and that of Ward (1970) over the tasks that were common to both studies. A model, including seven competency areas, was used as a guide to the development of items included in the survey questionnaire. A jury of experts evaluated the questionnaire for content, comprehensiveness, clarity and format. The final questionnaire contained 70 test items. The mailed responses of 72 administrators, from six categories, to the 70 test items in the questionnaire were used as the basis for the study. The data were processed in the Oregon State University computer center using various public programs. A one-way analysis of variance test was used to test the null hypothesis: that there was no significant difference among the groups in the 70 items tested. The data were factor analyzed using both closed and open mathematical models. Squared multiple correlations were used for communalities in the open model. The varimax rotation was used with both the R-technique and the <b>Q-technique.</b> The standard error of factor loading was used as the basis for determining the appropriate factor loading cut-off value. A parallel factor analysis using real and random data sets was used to determine the best factor solution. Seven factors were extracted from the data, using the Rtechnique. They were named: 1. Instruction [...] Staff and Facilities 2. Personnel [...] Student and Staff 3. Program Development and Demonstration 4. Curriculum Development and Evaluation 5. Professional Relations [...] Organized Groups 6. Management of the Educational System 7. Research Projects The highest mean-ranked item was: Work with others in educational administration to initiate and maintain occupational education programs. The lowest mean-ranked item was: Supervise the maintenance of pupil personnel records. One factor was extracted from the data using the <b>Q-technique.</b> It was named Administrators of Vocational Education. The product moment correlation between this study and that of Ward (1970) over 40 common competencies was. 60.

40|$|Q-methodology is a {{technique}} incorporating the benefits of both qualitative and quantitative research. Q-method involves Q-sorting, a {{method of data collection}} and factor analysis, to assess subjective (qualitative) information. The use of Q-sorting and factor analysis has often resulted in the misconception that Q-methodology involves psychometric or quantitative assessment, although Q as a methodology actually enables the systematic assessment of qualitative data. Misconceptions regarding Q have resulted in a heterogeneous collection of Q-applications in the extant literature, which has obscured the fundamental principles of Q-methodology. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a systematic review of Q-based research to investigate the criteria researchers have used to develop Q-studies. Published research studies between January 2008 and December 2008 that employed Q-techniques and methodology were assessed. Data were extracted and synthesized through the development and use of the Assessment and Review Instrument for Q-methodology (ARIQ). Fourteen research studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. The Q-methodological studies were disparate in their application of terminology, instrument development, and factor analysis, although data extraction and synthesis processes revealed two types of studies: those which aimed to apply conventional Q-methodology and those which applied variations of Q-techniques. It is concluded that variations of <b>Q-technique</b> and its methodology are unavoidable. However, this does not obviate the need for researchers to explicitly state their rationale for decisions to deviate from conventional Q-methodology if they are to produce demonstrably valid research.

The sample was randomly divided in half. Each half was separately subjected to two methods of ordination (principal components analysis and <b>Q-technique</b> components analysis), seven hierarchical clustering algorithms (using up to three of four measures of similarity) and four methods of iterative partitioning. While the data were heterogeneous, cluster solutions varied widely across methods. Results were consistent for both halves, and {{it was concluded that}} no reliable LD subgroups could be identified. Hierarchical clustering algorithms and measures of similarity were compared. The most similar methods were Ward's method and within-group average, while Ward's method and average linkage were the most dissimilar methods. Euclidean distance and squared Euclidean distance were found to be the most similar measures, while Euclidean distance and product-moment correlation coefficient were least similar. Iterative partitioning techniques were also evaluated. CLUSTAN (Wishart, 1979, 1982) and BMDPKM were found to be similar, and to generate acceptable partitions when default options were used. SPSSX QUICK CLUSTER was unacceptable, and it was recommended that the program not be used without a partially optimized initial partition.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 For scientists, policymakers, and {{stewards}} of this earth, {{it is critical}} to find ways to recognize human interdependence with life on this planet and live within the boundaries which preserve the balance of global systems. In this research, I provide knowledge about stakeholder perspectives on {{the development of a new}} biofuels industry in the Pacific Northwest. In order to support constructive policy dialogue and program implementation, policymakers, natural resource managers, and communication specialists need to understand how citizens make sense of and contribute to the discourse surrounding environmental issues. A direct way to gain access to meaningful social perspectives is through examining stakeholders’ social discourse. I used Q-methodology to examine stakeholder discourse and a grounded interpretive mixed methods analysis to examine online discourse on the social media site Twitter. Social discourse is often chaotic and difficult to access for purposes of policy analysis. <b>Q-technique</b> and grounded interpretive approaches are both well-suited to systematically structuring social discourse so it can be useful for policymakers in designing effective policy outcomes. Stakeholders included: farmers and growers; refinery, fuel, and/or energy producers; energy associations; bioenergy companies; labor unions; investment companies; research institutions; and advocacy organizations. In addition, I identified relevant information for policymakers about the biofuels issue public, social discourse, and communication structure found in the Twittersphere. Results from the three studies echo other researchers’ findings that social perspectives surrounding biofuels are quite complex. Findings from the two Q-studies indicate frame flexibility across stakeholders: individual stakeholders held multiple perspectives, and some even held conflicting ones. The overall sentiment of the tweet-based biofuels discourse was largely positive, with 60 % of the issue public viewing biofuels positively and 16 % viewing them negatively. However, sentiment was mixed for four of the six stakeholder groups. Some of this complexity may be explained by the overarching finding that there are distinct micro-discourses existing within the broader biofuels discourse. Priming any particular aspect of this discourse may influence how stakeholders conceptualize biofuels development issues. Ultimately, this kind of clarity is crucial to facilitating a constructive policy dialogue, rather than one in which people unwittingly speak past each other...|$|E

The dependent variable in the study was a score judgmentally assigned by respondents to a five-point Likert-type scale for each of the 99 professional education competencies included in the mail-survey questionnaire. The data resulting from the 160 respondences to the questionnaire were analyzed for variance with rejected competencies tested for least significant differences. The major interest in the study was to factor analyze the data using both the R- and Q-techniques. The <b>Q-technique</b> ordered respondents according to competencies, while the R-technique ordered competencies according to factor loadings. The R-technique factor analysis was programmed to compute a six-factor. solution. This procedure yielded five interpretable factors, 54 competencies receiving factor loadings at a significant level for inclusion in the factors (clusters). Analysis of data revealed that there was no significant difference among the mean scores for community colleges and that commonality existed among the vocational instructors in these colleges in terms of responses to competency items. The data further revealed that the most important competencies were those relating to instructional management, such as teaching and guidance strategies. Lowest ranking competencies were those relating to program management, including interpretation of history, philosophy, requirements, and laws dealing with education. The generated commonalities indicate that community college vocational instructors, regardless of program area, state, or college, need proficiency in a common core of performance-based professional education competencies...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Purposes of the Study The {{study had}} several purposes, the major one being to {{determine}} the common professional education competencies needed by community college instructors of trade and industrial education. Two other purposes {{of the study were}} to determine if differences existed among community colleges according to scores trade and industrial instructors assigned to each of 99 professional education competencies and determine if community college trade and industrial instructors resembled one another according to values given the 99 professional education competencies. Procedures A mail survey questionnaire was developed to collect data. The 99 item questionnaire was designed so that instructors could respond to the level of proficiency necessary for each competency in relation to their job. Their responses consisted of indicating whether no, slight, moderate, considerable or complete competency was needed. A total of 40 community colleges, ten in each of four states (California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington), were selected for the study. The sample of 160 instructors was obtained by randomly selecting four trade and industrial instructors from each of the community colleges identified in the population. Data were analyzed by utilizing analysis of variance and factor analytic techniques. Selected Findings A one-way classification analysis of variance revealed that, except for one competency, no differences existed among community colleges according to scores trade and industrial instructors assigned to each of 99 professional education competencies. Teacher educators may consider this community college similarity when developing or revising curricula. The R-technique of factor analysis was used to identify common professional education competencies. A five-factor solution extracted 48 competencies that had factor loadings of ±. 50 or higher. Four of the five factors extracted were identified as follows: 1. Factor I was a general factor with three interpretable sub-factors. Sub-factor 1 a was named History, Philosophy, and Objectives; sub-factor 1 b was named Community Relations; and sub-factor 1 c was named Professionalism and Student Relations. 2. Factor II was identified as Program Operation. 3. Factor III was summarized with the title of Measurement and Course Construction. 4. Factor IV was labeled Instructional Strategies. Nine of the ten highest mean ranked professional education competencies in the study clustered under Factor IV, Instructional Strategies. The highest mean ranked competency in the study was motivate students in the classroom, shop, and laboratory and the lowest mean ranked competency in the study was interpret the history of education. The <b>Q-technique</b> of factor analysis revealed that trade and industrial instructors resemble one another with regard to values assigned to professional education competencies. The high specificity of structure [...] one generated factor [...] strongly suggested that professional education needs of trade and industrial instructors are not as complex or diverse as had been widely assumed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{study had}} four objectives, the major one being the {{identification}} of the common professional competencies for adequate performance as a Baptist clergyman. A second objective was to determine the common professional competencies needed by Baptist pastors and ministers of education. The determination if significantly different competencies were required for the pastor and the minister of education was the third objective. The final objective was to formulate recommendations which would be applicable in developing a curriculum for clergy preparation. A 90 -item mail-administered questionnaire was developed by a jury panel of experts (six pastors, three laymen, two professors, a minister of education and an associational official). A randomly selected population of 188 respondents, 80 ministers of education and 108 pastors equally distributed between two Baptist church associations, were asked to indicate on a five-point Likert-type scale the level of proficiency necessary for each competency in relation to their ministry. Data were analyzed by using a two-way analysis of variance and factor analytic techniques. Selected Findings The two-way analysis of variance revealed that no significant differences existed between the scores assigned by clergy of the two Baptist church associations to 64 of the 90 competencies and that no significant differences existed between the scores assigned by pastors and ministers of education to 75 of the 90 competencies. No significant interaction existed between associations and types of personnel in 89 of the 90 competencies. An R-technique factor analysis was utilized to identify common professional competencies. A three factor solution generated 68 competencies that had factor loadings of ±. 45 or higher. Factors identified were: 1. Factor I, Administration, was a general factor with four subfactors. Sub-factor Ia was named Program Development. Subfactor Ib was named Program Operation. Sub-factor Ic was named Community Relations and Sub-factor Id was named Counseling. 2. Factor II, Leadership, was a general factor with two subfactors. Sub-factor IIa was named Individual Ability and Interpersonal Relations was the name given to Sub-factor lib. 3. Factor III, Management, was a general factor with two subfactors. Sub-factor Ma was named Human Resources and Subfactor Illb was named Financial Resources. Five of the ten highest mean ranked competencies dealt with personal relationships. The highest mean ranked competency was Establish and maintain a meaningful and Biblical relationship with your spouse. The lowest mean ranked competency was Take responsibilities for leadership in civic or community activities. A <b>Q-technique</b> factor analysis revealed a commonality among the respondents to the degree that both pastors and ministers of education could be grouped as clergymen. Recommendations It was recommended that: 1. Baptist clergy recognize the Biblical concept of equipping others for ministry. 2. Baptist clergy become more involved in civic responsibilites. 3. Baptist clergy develop a more balanced ministry including evangelism, preaching, and the training of others for ministry. 4. Clergy preparation could essentially be one program for pastors or ministers of education. 5. Clergy preparation include additional psychology courses to expand self-perception abilities and the establishing of interpersonal relationships. 6. The establishing of a competency based clergy educational program will, of necessity, involve leaders within the local churches. 7.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The Purposes of the Study The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{identify}} common professional education competencies needed by public school district vocational education leaders. Other purposes were to (1) determine if significant differences existed in vocational education leadership competencies among respondents as categorized by state, type of position held, proportion of time devoted to teaching, and number of teaching subordinates, (2) identify the method recommended by respondents for preparing individuals to perform each competency included in the study, and (3) formulate implications to be considered in the development of teaching strategies and curriculum for the preparation of public school district vocational education leaders. The Procedures The data were collected with a mail survey questionnaire developed through a review of literature and a field test. Public school district vocational education leaders responded to the questionnaire regarding the level of proficiency (complete, considerable, moderate, slight, no proficiency) necessary for each of the 98 competencies in relation to their job. Likert-type scale values of 5 to 1 were assigned to the responses. Respondents also selected a method (course work, internship, a combination of course work and internship) for preparing personnel to perform each competency. The study utilized a population from the four western states of Arizona, California, Colorado, and Washington. One hundred and three of the 112 public school districts which met predetermined criteria agreed to participate in the study. A sample of 200 vocational education directors and department heads was randomly selected from the participating districts. Usable data were received from 147 respondents. The data were analyzed with the analysis of variance F statistic and the Q- and R-factor analytic techniques. Selected Findings Statistical comparisons using the one-way classification analysis of variance were made on respondents who were grouped by state, position held, proportion of time devoted to teaching, and number of teaching subordinates. Respondents grouped by state were alike in their rating of all 98 competencies. Differences were detected with the remaining groups, leaving 62 common competencies. The <b>Q-technique</b> factor analysis revealed that all respondents generally resemble one another with regard to values assigned to the professional education competencies in the study. The R-technique factor analysis was used to group competencies for development of teaching strategies and curriculum. A five-factor solution extracted 59 competencies that had factor loadings greater than ±. 50. The five factors were identified as follows: 1. Factor I: Program Management 2. Factor II: Program Planning, Development, and Evaluation 3. Factor III: State Criteria Interpretation 4. Factor IV: Staff Management 5. Factor V: Staff Relations For each of the 98 competencies, a majority of the respondents selected a combination of formal course work and internship as the preferred method of preparing vocational education leaders to perform the competencies in the study. Selected Conclusions The review of literature, the questionnaire, and the results of the statistical analysis provided the basis for the following conclusions: 1. Sixty-two competencies were similar for all respondents and make up the common competencies. 2. Competencies related to Staff Management and Staff Relations received relatively high mean scores and low standard deviations, indicating general agreement that a high level of proficiency is needed. 3. Competencies related to Program Management and Program Planning received relatively low mean scores and high standard deviations, indicating a difference of opinion among the respondents concerning the level of proficiency, but generally it was considered to be low. 4. Respondents grouped by state were alike in their rating of all 98 competencies. 5. A combination of formal course work and internship was the preferred method of preparing vocational education leaders to perform the competencies in the study. Selected Recommendations The following three selected recommendations are offered in view of the findings and conclusions of the study: 1. Where identifiable groups are involved in vocational education leadership training, responses of individuals representing that group in this study should be examined. Those competencies rated high by that group should receive preference in curriculum planning. 2. Experimentation should be conducted with the identified competencies to compare the effectiveness of the individualized, performance-based method of instruction and the traditional method of instruction. 3. A composite data analysis should be completed on the concurrent studies by Baltimore (1972), Martin (1972), and Sundstrom (1972) to ascertain similarity of results. If strong similarities exist, it is recommended that the western states cooperate in establishing vocational education leadership programs with a common competency base...|$|E
