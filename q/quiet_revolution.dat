5|$|A new {{generation}} of more entertainment-oriented movies coming from the Somali film industry has grown increasingly popular among Somalis both within Somalia and in the diaspora. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart cinematic movement has energized the local movie scene, in the process introducing innovative storylines, production techniques and advertising strategies. The latter include cross-media marketing, with tie-in film soundtracks featuring prominent Somali music artists. Popular movies from Somaliwood include the Somali language slasher thriller Xaaskayga Araweelo, the action comedy Rajo, and Warmooge, the first Somali animated film. The young directors Abdisalam Aato of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are {{at the forefront of}} this <b>quiet</b> <b>revolution.</b> In 2010, the Somali director Mo Ali also released Shank, his first feature film set in a futuristic London.|$|E
5|$|In March 1955, Richard was {{suspended}} {{for the remainder of}} the season, including the playoffs, after he received a match penalty for slashing Boston's Hal Laycoe and subsequently punching a linesman who intervened. The suspension touched off a wave of anger toward league president Clarence Campbell, who was warned not to attend a scheduled game in Montreal after receiving numerous death threats, mainly from French-Canadians accusing him of anti-French bias. Campbell dismissed the warnings, and attended the March 17 game as planned. His presence at the game was perceived by many fans as a provocation and he was booed and pelted with eggs and fruit. An hour into the game, a fan lobbed a tear-gas bomb in Campbell's direction, causing fire officials to clear the building. Fans leaving the Forum were met by a growing mob of angry demonstrators who overwhelmed the 250 police officers on the scene and rioted outside of the Forum. Seventy people were arrested, 37 people injured, 50 stores were looted and $100,000 in property damage was reported as a result of the melee, which became known as , or the Richard Riot. The incident highlighted the growing cultural gap between French Quebec and English Canada and the riot is often described as an early manifestation of Quebec's <b>Quiet</b> <b>Revolution.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{review is}} {{the sequel to}} my review of {{graphics}} in text in Volume 5 of this series (Macdonald-Ross, 1978). Together the two chapters survey the field of research relevant {{to the design of}} printed curriculum materials. They also demark an area of applied research, namely, research which helps to develop the practical art of the communicator and hence may improve the quality of texts used for pedagogy. Necessarily, this review has some limitations which ought to be kept in mind. Research into language is being published at an astonishing rate; no one could possibly be familiar with all of it, nor is there space to discuss each paper in detail. Therefore, this review is selective: I have chosen the research which seems to me important for its potential significance to the improvement of curricular texts. Wherever possible reviews and other key sources are quoted, and the reader can get access to the older literature by consulting these key works. The review is based on an extensive bibliography which lists all the sources in detail (Macdonald-Ross & Smith, 1978). Research workers will find this bibliography a source of further information. The 20 th century will doubtless be remembered in many ways—for its wars and its social changes, for atomic physics, for the start of genetic engineering, for the mass media, and for the first intelligent machines.

40|$|Although eutely in {{nematodes}} was known, giant neurons {{in several}} taxa and unique motor neurons to leg muscles in decapod crustaceans, {{the idea that}} many animals have many identifiable neurons with relatively consistent dynamical properties and connections was only slowly established in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s. This {{has to be one}} of the important <b>quiet</b> <b>revolutions</b> in neurobiology. It stimulated a vast acquisition of specific information and led to some euphoria in the degree and pace of understanding activity of nervous systems and consequent behavior in terms of neuronal connections and properties. Some implications, problems and opportunities for new discovery are developed. The distribution of identifiable neurons among taxa and parts of the nervous system is not yet satisfactorily known. Their evolution may have been a case of several independent inventions. The degree of consistency has been quantified only in a few examples and the plasticity is little known. Identified neurons imply identifiable circuits but whether this extends to discrete systems, functionally definable, seems likely to have several answers in different animals or sites. Very limited attempts have been made to extend the concept to cases of two or ten or a hundred fully equivalent neurons, on all kinds of criteria. These attempts suggest a much smaller redundancy and vaster number of types of neurons than hitherto believed. Theory as well as empirical information has not yet interpreted the range of systems from those with small sets of relatively reliable neurons to those with large numbers of parallel, partially redundant units. The now classical notion of local circuits has to be extended to take account and find roles for the plethora of integrative variables, of evidence for neural processing independent of spikes and classical synapses, of spatial configurations of terminal arbors and dendritic geometry, of modulators and transmitters, degrees of rhythmicity (regularity varying several orders of magnitude), and of synchrony. Adequate language and models need to go beyond "circuits" in any engineering sense. Identifiable neurons can contribute to a broad spectrum of issues in neurobiology...|$|R

Abortion was illegal and there were too many health risks involved in most illegal abortions. There was a visible trend in the increasing age of women at first marriage in the decades between 1930 and 1970 after contraception was provided to non-married females. As part of the woman's <b>quiet</b> sexual <b>revolution,</b> pills gave women control over their future.

In contrast, the 20 th century ended with con-tentious argument over the utility of null hypothesis signif-icance testing (NHST). The NHST controversy may have been at least partially irrelevant, because in certain ways the modeling revolution obviated the NHST argument. I begin with a history of NHST and modeling and their relation to one another. Next, I define and illustrate prin-ciples involved in developing and evaluating mathematical models. Following, I discuss the difference between using statistical procedures within a rule-based framework and building mathematical models from a scientific epistemol-ogy. Only the former is treated carefully in most psychol-ogy graduate training. The pedagogical implications of this imbalance and the revised pedagogy required to account for the modeling revolution are described. To conclude, I discuss how attention to modeling implies shifting statisti-cal practice in certain progressive ways. The epistemolog-ical basis of statistics has moved away from being a set of procedures, applied mechanistically, and moved toward building and evaluating statistical and scientific models...|$|R
40|$|Are {{the growing}} oppositions to {{neoliberal}} market globalism (especially {{in the aftermath}} of global economic meltdown) able to develop meaningful alternative ideologies? Is there any substantial alternative to the world capitalist system on the horizon? How would the ideologies and ideas address the dire dilemmas of economy vs. ecology, redistribution vs. recognition, global vs. local, reform vs. revolution etc. ? This book answers such important questions by examining the intellectual structure of the so-called ‘anti globalization’ or ‘global justice’ movement. It explores the formation and transformation of ideas, identities, and solidarities in the movement. The book also develops an analytical model to explain the movement’s ideational novelties and continuities in terms of both activist social experiences and global social changes. Hosseini develops new sociological concepts, integrates opposing theoretical perspectives into one approach, and addresses the gap between critical theories and activist practices. Through this endeavor, he discovers an emerging mode of consciousness which is characterized by its cross-identity and cross-ideological nature.

Plaintiffs prevailed at a higher rate before judges than they did before juries. Comparable data are now available through fiscal 1997 and it is appropriate to reexamine time trends in products liability cases related to judicial decisionmaking. Assessing judicial performance in products liability cases requires reference points. It is natural to compare plaintiff win rates and trial award levels in judge-tried cases with similar statistics in jury-tried cases, and to compare products liability case outcomes to outcomes of other classes of cases.
