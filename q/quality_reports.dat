5000|$|Although public {{reporting}} {{has taken}} {{center stage in}} qualitative and health policy research, {{there has been a}} slow uptake. Barriers identified are related to consumer behaviors and challenges with the conceptual framework. Health literacy is a key component to comprehend and use performance data. However, complexity of the performance data, technicality and presentation of the quality data makes the <b>quality</b> <b>reports</b> difficult to understand. Another impediment to the development of health <b>quality</b> <b>reports</b> is the challenge associated with measuring performance at the individual physician level (due to inadequate sample sizes, difficulty adjusting for the severity of patients medical condition) [...] This has led to group-level reporting which makes these reports less useful for consumers.|$|E

40|$|Context: Poorly written {{radiology}} {{reports are}} common among residents {{and are a}} significant challenge for radiology education. While training may improve <b>report</b> <b>quality,</b> a professionally developed reliable and valid scale to measure <b>report</b> <b>quality</b> does not exist. Objectives: To develop a measurement tool for <b>report</b> <b>quality,</b> the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale, with rigorous validation through empirical data. Methods: A research team of an experienced psychometrician and six senior radiologists conducted qualitative and quantitative studies. Five items were identified for the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale, each measuring a distinct aspect of <b>report</b> <b>quality.</b> Two dedicated training sessions were designed and implemented to help residents generate high-quality reports. In a blinded fashion, the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale was applied to 804 randomly selected reports issued before (n[*]=[*] 403) and after (n[*]=[*] 401) training. Full-scale psychometrical assessments were implemented onto the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale’s item- and scale-scores from the <b>reports.</b> The <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale scores were correlated with report professionalism and attendings’ preference and were compared pre-/post-training. Results: The <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale showed sound psychometrical properties, with high validity and reliability. <b>Reports</b> with higher <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale score were more professional and preferable by attendings. Training improved the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale score, empirically validating the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale further. Conclusion: While succinct and practitioner friendly, the <b>quality</b> of <b>report</b> scale is a reliable and valid measure of radiology <b>report</b> <b>quality</b> and {{has the potential to}} be easily adapted to other fields such as pathology, where similar training would be beneficial...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Quality</b> <b>reporting</b> is {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} tool to encourage health systems, hospitals, and their practitioners to deliver the greatest health benefit. However, <b>quality</b> <b>reporting</b> systems may have unintended negative consequences, such as inadvertently encouraging “cherry-picking” by inadequately adjusting for patients who are challenging to take care of, or underpowering to reliably detect meaningful differences in care. There have been no reports seeking to identify a minimum level of accuracy that ought to be viewed as a prerequisite for <b>quality</b> <b>reporting.</b> Method: Using a decision analytic model, we seek to delineate minimal standards for quality measures to meet, using the simplest assumptions to illustrate what those standards may be. Results: We find that even under assumptions regarding optimal performance of the <b>quality</b> <b>reporting</b> system (sensitivity and specificity of 1), we can identify a minimal level of accuracy required for the <b>quality</b> <b>reporting</b> system to “do no harm”: the increase in health-related quality of life from a higher rather than lower quality practitioner must be greater than the number of practitioners per patient divided by the proportion of patients willing to switch from a lower to a higher quality provider. Conclusion: Quality measurement systems that have not been demonstrated to improve health outcomes should be held to a specific standard of measurement accuracy...|$|R

50|$|Drinking water quality. There {{are several}} aspects of {{drinking}} water quality that are of some concern in the United States, including Cryptosporidium, disinfection by-products, lead, perchlorates and pharmaceutical substances. However, in almost all cases drinking water quality is in conformity with the norms of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which sets Maximum Contaminant Levels for pollutants. In addition, the EPA's Consumer Confidence Rule of 1998 requires most public water suppliers to provide consumer confidence reports, also known as annual water <b>quality</b> <b>reports,</b> to their customers. According to the EPA, each year by July 1 anyone connected to a public water system should receive in the mail an annual water quality report that tells where water in a specific locality comes from and what's in it.
