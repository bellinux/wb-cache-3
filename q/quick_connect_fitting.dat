50|$|A <b>quick</b> <b>connect</b> <b>fitting,</b> {{also called}} a quick {{disconnect}} or quick release coupling, is a coupling {{used to provide}} a fast, make-or-break connection of fluid transfer lines. Operated by hand, quick connect fittings replace threaded or flanged connections, which require wrenches. When equipped with self-sealing valves, quick connect fittings will, upon disconnection, automatically contain any fluid in the line.|$|E
50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed {{compression fitting}} or <b>quick</b> <b>connect</b> <b>fitting</b> that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression fittings work, but use a resilient O-ring for sealing, and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|E

50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>connect</b> <b>fittings</b> (push fittings) {{are used}} {{in a wide variety}} of plumbing, heating, {{electrical}} and fire suppression systems. Quick Fitting, Inc., Warwick Rhode Island has been a prolific inventor of innovations in <b>quick</b> <b>connect</b> technologies. <b>Quick</b> Fitting is the original inventor of <b>quick</b> <b>connect</b> for electrical, fire suppression and plumbing technologies, holding over 20 U.S. and foreign patents on quick connection technology. U.S. Patent & Trademark Office <b>Quick</b> <b>connect</b> works by inserting the tubing into a connection mechanism that deploys fastening teeth onto the tubing surface. When opposing force is applied to the union, the teeth are forced deeper into the tubing, preventing separation of the union. <b>Quick</b> <b>connect</b> <b>fittings</b> offer a significant time saving benefit over traditional technologies and require little skill for their usage. There are a large variety of <b>quick</b> <b>connect</b> <b>fittings</b> in the market and they are found in all industries.

40|$|Most {{pieces of}} case {{furniture}} (kitchen and bathroom furniture, cabinets, wardrobes, tables and etc.) {{are made of}} 18  mm thick wood particle boards finished with various coatings. This three-layered constructional material is obtained by bonding wood particles of different fractions with synthetic resins using heating. The exploitation duration and quality of case furniture {{is determined by the}} mechanical properties of wood particle boards and the construction of joints of wood-based panels. On a frequent basis, pieces of case furniture with non-dismantable and dismantable construction are joined by using multidowel glued joints and cam <b>connecting</b> <b>fittings</b> intended for furniture, respectively. Wood-based panels can be joined with mitre joints whose mechanical properties have not undergone testing and comparison with regular joints when applying insertable wooden dowels or furniture <b>connecting</b> <b>fittings.</b> During the testing of particle board properties it was established that joining wood-based panels in this way ensures most efficient use of mechanical characteristics of the particleboard. In addition to the properties of the mitre joint, the tests also allowed determining the bending strength, tensile strength and bonding strength of the constructional material, and providing an original method for testing board properties, which can be successfully applied to the prediction of properties of the mitre joint. Tests were performed by using a universal tensile testing machine P- 0. 5. Joints were bonded by applying PVA dispersion. The surface of boards was veneered by using mahogany veneer and urea formaldehyde resin. It was found that mitre joints of wood particle boards can withstand loads that are higher from 2 to 4 times, in comparison to glued doweled joints or joints constructed with cam <b>connecting</b> <b>fittings.</b> DOI: [URL] </p...|$|R
