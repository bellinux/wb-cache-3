5|$|Along {{with the}} army, Anitha employs {{a group of}} porters headed by Muthu, to {{transport}} the baggage during the journey. The crew embark on their voyage leading them to an island, Min-gua, near Vietnam. The island borders 3 countries: Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. They face seven traps set by the Cholas: sea creatures, cannibals, warriors, snakes, hunger, <b>quicksand</b> and a village. Many porters and army men are killed by these traps.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a <b>quicksand</b> {{predator}} trap {{was discovered}} containing multiple Utahraptor specimens {{ranging in age}} from fully grown adult to tiny 3 foot long baby. Some scientists have hypothesized this is evidence of family hunting behaviour, however the full sandstone block is yet to be opened and researchers are unsure {{as to whether or not}} the animals died at the same time or not.|$|E

It was digitally released on November 13, 2012 on MOCA YouTube's channel, MOCAtv, {{as part of a}} series of music videos called ART+MUSIC which features collaborations between artists and musicians. The channel also posted a behind-the-scenes video on the same day. The video features glimpses of filming and an interview with the director of the video, who explains the filming process.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the American {{explorer}} Roy Chapman Andrews led a {{well documented}} expedition to China and Mongolia {{sponsored by the}} American Museum of Natural History. Various indricothere remains were found in formations of the Mongolian Gobi Desert, including the legs of a specimen standing in an upright position, indicating that it had died while trapped in <b>quicksand,</b> {{as well as a}} very complete skull. These remains became the basis of Baluchitherium grangeri, named by Osborn in 1923.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Quicksands</b> and Millicent {{are shown}} {{on their wedding}} day, {{in the company of}} Millicent's uncle Testy, an {{irritable}} and capricious old judge. Testy has arranged the marriage against his niece's will, and orders her to [...] "shake off" [...] her [...] "maiden peevishness" [...] and love her husband. Millicent tries to be the obedient female at first, but she is so browbeaten by her uncle that she rebels: she sings bawdy songs to <b>Quicksands,</b> calls him [...] "Chick" [...] among other endearments, and assures him that she can bear six babies in five years — whether <b>Quicksands</b> is up to the task of begetting them or not. The two old men are shocked and embarrassed by her bawdry; <b>Quicksands</b> in particular is at a nonplus, and now feels inhibited from his wedding-night obligations. The discomfort is accentuated when the courtiers, masked and costumed as horned animals, break in with an impromptu wedding masque that strongly suggests inevitable cuckoldry. In the end, <b>Quicksands</b> hopes that a night of undisturbed sleep will restore his bride's modesty; Millicent has the last word with a closing couplet: [...] "... to bed, to bed, / No bride so glad - to keep her maidenhead." ...|$|R

She leaves {{to rescue the}} Pejite pilot Asbel, brother of Princess Lastelle, but both crash through a stratum of <b>quicksand</b> into a non-toxic area below the Toxic Jungle. Nausicaä realizes that the jungle plants purify the polluted topsoil, producing clean water and soil underground.|$|E
5|$|Located on the Atlantic {{coast of}} the Sahara Desert, it lies {{on the west coast}} of Africa. With the {{exception}} of Friendship Port and a small fishing port, the coastal strip is mostly left empty and allowed to flood. The coastline includes shifting sandbanks and sandy beaches. There are areas of <b>quicksand</b> close to the harbour. Nouakchott is largely flat and only a few meters above sea level. It is threatened by the sand dunes advancing from its eastern side which pose a daily problem. There have been efforts to save particular areas, including work by Jean Meunier. Owing to the rapid build-up, the city is quite spread out, with few tall buildings. Most buildings are one-story.|$|E

5|$|The {{upgraded}} engine offered better {{speed efficiency}} and new graphical features. While both the original Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II used a grid system where developers could build the levels {{with a set}} of blocks, Tomb Raider IIIs system incorporated triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex architectural structures. The triangles also allowed developers to implement the game's <b>quicksand</b> and rippling water features. The dynamic lighting system was improved with coloured lighting and better water reflection, making Tomb Raider III more atmospheric than its predecessors. The team also implemented new weather effects such as rain, snow, and wind. The game features more particle effects, offering more realistic explosions and smoke. All the textures used in the game were drawn in true colour before being rendered by the graphics engine, resulting in a better output quality.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through <b>quicksand,</b> but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the kayak helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. Flares may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, flares, and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E
5|$|After Elliott Fitch Shepard's {{death in}} March 1893, Margaret donated the present church {{building}} and manse. The Spanish Renaissance-style church {{was designed by}} Augustus Haydel (a nephew of Stanford White) and August D. Shepard (a nephew of Elliott Shepard and of William Rutherford Mead). The two nephews later designed the 1899 Fabbri Mansion in Manhattan. The church's cornerstone was laid on October 13, 1893. During construction of the building's foundation, workers found <b>quicksand,</b> though Shepard was intent on constructing the church there and had the construction workers dig 30 feet into the ground to find firm ground for the foundation. European workers {{were brought to the}} site to aide in the building's construction. The Italian Renaissance Revival building was of limestone delivered from Indiana by railroad, requiring a special track laid at Scarborough to accommodate the delivery. The completed church was dedicated on May 11, 1895 in memory of Elliott Fitch Shepard. It was briefly known as Shepard Memorial Church. The dedication was attended by Cornelius Vanderbilt II, Frederick W. Vanderbilt, Chauncey Depew, William Sloane of W. & J. Sloane, William Seward Webb, H. Walter Webb, and James A. Burden II.|$|E

50|$|Sandstorm {{describes}} how DMs can create adventures and even campaigns {{set in a}} desert or wasteland environment. The book details many hazards {{that are associated with}} real-life dangers to desert travelers. Furthermore, Sandstorm corrects many false ideas about deserts, such as the belief that <b>quicksands</b> are commonly found in the desert; the book explains that <b>quicksands</b> require water to form, and are usually found near an oasis, although <b>quicksands</b> are still rare even there. The book gives ideas for DMs as well as players in using new prestige classes and new races. In addition, book references several 3rd edition books, such as Deities and Demigods. At the beginning of the book, examples of wasteland areas found in the campaign settings of Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms are given.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did all they could to help rescue those trapped in the flood waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to <b>quicksand</b> and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E
5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes empty, the player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of a}} Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by <b>quicksand</b> or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{principal}} photography {{was expected}} to begin on 26 February 2008, and then on 15 March 2008, but finally began on 19 March 2008 in Rajasthan. Initial shooting occurred for 10 days in Rann of Kutch, Gujarat. Art director Ravinder went to Chennai and gave details of their requirements to a prominent chariot-making specialist. After rejecting the maker's first iron skeletons, Ravinder opted to design them himself, and prepared three models of chariots with different heights to be used, depending on the camera’s location and other technical requirements. He used fibre material for the iron skeleton's exteriors. For {{a scene in which}} neither the hero nor the villain was present on the chariot, Ravinder measured a short person and designed a hidden chamber in which he could sit and secretly control the horses. While the chariot race sequence was shot in Dholavira, the sequence in which the chariot sinks in <b>quicksand</b> was shot at a set comprising three acres in Ramoji Film City.|$|E

5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – they are far more elusive and dangerous than the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the clues to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of <b>quicksand.</b> Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E

25|$|<b>Quicksand</b> forms {{when water}} {{saturates}} {{an area of}} loose sand and the ordinary sand is agitated. When the water trapped in the batch of sand cannot escape, it creates liquefied soil that can no longer support weight. <b>Quicksand</b> can be formed by standing or (upwards) flowing underground water (as from an underground spring), or by earthquakes. In the case of flowing underground water, {{the force of the}} water flow opposes the force of gravity, causing the granules of sand to be more buoyant. In the case of earthquakes, the shaking force can increase the pressure of shallow groundwater, liquefying sand and silt deposits. In both cases, the liquefied surface loses strength, causing buildings or other objects on that surface to sink or fall over.|$|E
