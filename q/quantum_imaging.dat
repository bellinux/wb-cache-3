50|$|<b>Quantum</b> <b>imaging,</b> {{is a new}} {{sub-field}} {{of quantum}} optics that exploits quantum correlations such as quantum entanglement of the electromagnetic field in order to image objects with a resolution or other imaging criteria that is beyond what is possible in classical optics. Examples of <b>quantum</b> <b>imaging</b> are quantum ghost imaging, quantum lithography, and quantum sensing. <b>Quantum</b> <b>imaging</b> may someday be useful for storing patterns of data in quantum computers and transmitting large amounts of highly secure encrypted information. Quantum mechanics has shown that light has inherent “uncertainties” in its features, manifested as moment-to-moment fluctuations in its properties. Controlling these fluctuations—which represent a sort of “noise”—can improve detection of faint objects, produce better amplified images, and allow workers to more accurately position laser beams.|$|E
