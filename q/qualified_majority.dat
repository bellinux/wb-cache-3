40|$|We analyze {{bargaining}} {{over the}} one-dimension {{characteristic of a}} public good among n impatient players when decisions require q favorable votes, q ≥ 2. Stationary subgame perfect equilibrium strategies are characterized for all games with deterministic protocol. We provide a monotonicity condition (satisfied by all single-peak, strictly quasi-concave and concave utilities) that assures uniqueness for every q whenever player's utilities are symmetric around the peak. Without symmetry, the monotonicity condition assures uniqueness for <b>qualified</b> <b>majorities,</b> q > n / 2, provided that agents are sufficiently patient and utilities satisfy an additional regularity condition.

30|$|For many years, the {{authorisation}} {{of genetically}} modified plants [GMPs] in the European Union [EU] has been a controversial issue. Regulation (EC) 1829 / 2003 [2] introduced a centralised procedure of authorisation by the European Commission, which includes the consultation of the European Member States [MS] and a scientific evaluation conducted by EFSA. If a GMO application encompasses cultivation, EFSA nominates a MS to conduct an initial appraisal of the ERA submitted by the applicant. On {{the basis of this}} appraisal and complemented with input from MS, EFSA carries out a scientific evaluation and issues an opinion. Based on this opinion, the European Commission drafts a decision to be voted on by MS. Despite the new legislation [1, 2, 4] and efforts to strengthen risk assessment guidance and to promote exchange among the scientific experts of the EFSA and European MS, no <b>qualified</b> <b>majorities</b> for decisions on import and processing or cultivation of GMPs could be reached so far. With the exception {{of genetically modified}} [GM] carnations, all final decisions have been taken by the European Commission unilaterally.|$|R

Further, a reweighting of votes is introduced that is simpler to implement than the Double Majority, and which represents a redistribution of power that is ‘halfway’ between the voting system of Nice and the massive redistribution of power implied by the Convention proposal. New insights into the source of power and each Member State’s blocking leverage are presented.

40|$|In {{the context}} of Hindu-Muslim {{relations}} in India, the present study (N= 87) utilized Integrated Threat Theory (Stephan and Stephan, 2000) to examine the mediating roles of intergroup anxiety, realistic and symbolic threats and the moderating role of group membership (Hindu vs. Muslim) in the relationships between cross-community contact, relative in-group status and prejudice. Overall, intergroup anxiety and realistic, but not symbolic, threat emerged as proximal predictors of prejudice and partial mediators between the predictor and criterion variables. But these findings were <b>qualified</b> by <b>majority</b> (Hindu) versus minority (Muslim) group membership. As predicted, while symbolic threat was a predictor of prejudice for Hindus, realistic threat was a paramount predictor for Muslims. In-group status was as a significant predictor for low-status minority group only. The results are discussed with reference to their potential implications for future research and interventions aimed at improving intergroup relations. © 2008 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd...|$|R
5000|$|After {{years of}} rising deficits and debt in the 1990s, Switzerland's {{citizens}} adopted the debt brake as {{a constitutional amendment}} in 2001. The rule was implemented starting in 2003. It states that each year, the budget must be in balance, adjusted for economic conditions. This adjustment is made by multiplying expenditures by a cyclical factor (the ratio of trend real GDP to expected real GDP), thus either allowing for deficits during recessions or forcing lawmakers to have surpluses during booms. Essentially, the rule calls for structural balance in each year and absolute balance {{over the course of}} a business cycle. So if lawmakers want to have expansionary fiscal policy during recessions, they need to pay for it by saving up during good economic times. The rule did initially allow for [...] "extraordinary spending" [...] if a <b>qualified</b> parliamentary <b>majority</b> approved, but recent changes have made this spending count as normal expenditures.|$|R

On the other hand, other people argue that the majority was far too small, as there were in fact only 161 more votes for independence, and this side specifically argues that only a <b>qualified</b> <b>majority</b> can be large enough grounds to pass a vote of such social and political consequence.|$|E
40|$|Quality {{control of}} {{traditional}} Chinese medicines (TCMs) used clinically {{is becoming a}} challenge and has limited the development of TCM due to the high variability in concentration levels of active ingredients and markers {{as well as the}} lack of well-established criteria. Using Shengmai injection, which is a well-established TCM, as an example, we developed an integrated profiling approach that simultaneously captures the entire spectrum of ingredients and quantitatively determines the levels of seven key ingredients in the TCM product. A multivariate statistical model was constructed to establish a “seven-marker-” based quality standard that <b>qualified</b> the <b>majority</b> of samples in this study. This newly developed strategy showed that a panel of key ingredients or markers in the TCM product were relatively consistent within a statistically acceptable range. Therefore, this metabolomics-based approach will complement the current quality control standard using the concentration of several key ingredients or their total content and help improve the consistency and clinic efficacy of TCM products...|$|R

40|$|What are the {{similarities}} and {{the differences between the}} failed constitution-making enterprise of the left-wing coalition (1994 - 1998) and the enactment of the Basic Law of Hungary by the right-wing parties (2011 - 2012) ? In my paper, I argue that there is a fundamental difference of political visions underlying the failure of the first enterprise and the controversial nature of the other: the socialists and the liberals represented a consensualist vision of politics that was the heritage of the political culture of the Kádár-regime and the democratic transition; the right-wing coalition, on the contrary, stressed a conflictual vision. The failure of the first enterprise was a result of the weakening of the political culture of political consensus: though no one dared to explicitly refute a consensual way of constitution-making yet, but the rightist parties only half-heartedly participated in the procedure. By contrast to this, the success of the second was a by-product of the <b>qualified</b> (two-thirds) <b>majority</b> of the right-wing parties representing a conflictualist political style in the parliament rather than a result of a capacity (let alone a design) to create a non-partisan agreement on the issue. In my paper, I will describe these two visions, their origins, and their influence on the outcomes of the constitution-making debates...|$|R

40|$|The Law on Fiscal Responsibility adopted late 2008 {{is a new}} {{element in}} Hungarian fiscal policy, {{although}} not without precedent. Under the law, the Parliament and the Government limit themselves to prevent high fiscal deficits and a further increase in public indebtedness, experienced in recent years. Budget planning turns into a three-year process, hardening over time. As a first step, the targeted primary (non-interest) budget balance {{is subject to the}} requirement that the stock of government debt cannot rise in real terms. However, ex post, the law allows for deviations in fiscal performance-including those reflecting the effect of so-called automatic stabilizers-attributable to factors beyond the control of the authorities. This means that the actual deficit is not necessarily equal to the deficit path consistent with the real debt limit, but it may fluctuate around this trend over the medium term. In addition, the law prescribes observance of the pay-go principle. Finally, it provides for the establishment of an independent Fiscal Council entrusted with monitoring compliance with the rules and with transparency standards. We evaluated the law according to the Kopits–Symansky criteria applied in the international literature. In most aspects, the law exhibits favourable properties, consistent with the criteria, although inevitably at the expense of simplicity. The assessment suggests that the law would benefit from extending coverage of the rules to local governments. Moreover, enforceability of the rules would be strengthened if the law were adopted by a <b>qualified</b> legislative <b>majority.</b> fiscal rules, budget planning, Fiscal Council. ...|$|R
