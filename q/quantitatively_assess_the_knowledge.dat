CDA approach consists of in-depth analysis, includes linguistic, social, and cultural analysis. Three related layers of a dynamic analysis compose the CDA: (1) analysis of the text, (2) analysis {{of the practice of}} discursive, and (3) analysis of social practices. In the context of the historical learning based on constructivism paradigm, the third layer used to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> development of the system and the structure of the thinking of learners. CDA approach used to analyze and <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> work of learners. The work of learners that analyzed by the CDA approach is descriptive test. In the learning process, CDA needs a rubric based on the discourse analysis and the level of development of thinking learners. Based on the results of the research, the CDA used to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> historical learning process, particularly in the constructivism paradigm. The learning assessment expected to be an alternative assessment, which is not only <b>quantitatively</b> <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> student <b>knowledge,</b> but also to measure the development of the system and the structure of the thinking of learners...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe study {{variants}} of the α-synchronizer by Awerbuch (J. ACM, 1985) within a distributed message passing system with probabilistic message loss. The {{purpose of a}} synchronizer is to maintain a virtual (lock-step) round structure, which simplifies the design of higher-level distributed algorithms. The underlying idea of an α-synchronizer is to let processes continuously exchange round numbers and to allow a process to proceed to the next round only after it has witnessed that all processes have already started the current round. In this work, we study the performance of several synchronizers in an environment with probabilistic message loss. In particular, we analyze how different strategies of forgetting affect the round durations. The synchronizer variants considered differ in the times when processes discard part of their accumulated <b>knowledge</b> during <b>the</b> execution. Possible applications can be found, e. g., in sensor fusion, where sensor data become outdated and thus invalid after {{a certain amount of}} time. For all synchronizer variants considered, we develop corresponding Markov chain models and quantify the performance degradation using both analytic approaches and Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results allow to explicitly calculate the asymptotic behavior of the round durations: While in systems with very reliable communication the effect of forgetting is negligible, the effect is more profound in systems with less reliable communication. Our study thus provides compu-tationally efficient bounds on the performance of the (non-forgetting) α-synchronizer and allows to <b>quantitatively</b> <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> effect accumulated <b>knowledge</b> has on <b>the</b> performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of solution-phase synthesis of P-doped type-B MnAs nanoparticles has been <b>quantitatively</b> <b>assessed</b> and <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> obtained is extended to independently control nanoparticle size and P incorporation {{in order to}} understand the roles of size and dopant concentration on the magnetostructural properties. During the solution-phase synthesis, the dimensions of the nanoparticles change as the monomer concentration in the bulk solution is depleted and the particles become uniform in size and shape when the temperature stabilizes. The temperature at which the nanoparticles were isolated controls the particle size and polydispersity. High temperature isolation of nanoparticles is required to achieve narrow polydispersity and ultimately leads to a highly reproducible product. Adventitious phosphorus incorporation from the solvent TOPO occurs during nucleation, and P is subsequently lost, likely due to self-purification. The reaction conditions for synthesis of nanoparticles of similar sizes with different P concentrations and different particle sizes with similar P concentrations were established and the effects on magnetic and structural properties were evaluated. Temperature-dependent XRD studies and magnetic measurements suggest that the transformation from β to α structure upon cooling is reversible, but occurs with varying degrees of hysteresis. As a consequence of P-doping, the phase transition temperature has shifted below room temperature and a large region of phase co-existence is observed. The transition temperature depends on the concentration of P concentrations (~ 2 %) resulting in suppression of the phase transition temperature as much as 150 K when probed by XRD vs ca. 50 K by magnetic susceptibility. In contrast, ca 1 % P doping results in suppression of the magnetostructural transition by ca. 50 K with XRD and magnetic measurements producing similar values. Differences in the apparent transition temperature and phase coexistence region are likely a consequence of heterogeneity of P. The magnetic and structural properties appear to be correlated. The conditions for Fe-doping on type-B MnAs nanoparticles are established and the consequence on magnetic and structural properties is probed. The core-shell morphology, %P, particle size and β-MnAs structure are retained upon incorporation of 2. 6 % Fe at relatively lower temperature (100 oC) with a short reaction time (15 minutes). Iron incorporation appears to compress lattice parameters by 0. 6 % with respect to the initial type-B MnAs nanoparticles. The β to α complete structural transition appears to stay same after treatment with iron while hysteresis is increased by ca. ~ 20 K by magnetic susceptibility. The apparent increase in hysresis is likely a consequence of heterogeneity of Fe. Overall, the changes in intrinsic properties observed with doping on the cation and anion lattice may be arising mainly due to volumetric effect in unit cell.

40|$|Levels of {{diabetic}} care {{in primary}} health care settings in South Africa {{have been found to}} be sub-optimal. Knowledge deficits and inadequate practices have been implicated in the poor quality of local diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes and hypertension are commonly associated chronic conditions hence to optimise diabetic care, tight control of blood pressure is essential. Although guidelines for the overall management of diabetes in a {{primary health care}} setting have been published (Working Group of the National Diabetes Advisory Board, 1997; Society for Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes of South Africa, 2002 a), adherence to these guidelines has not yet been optimised in the primary health care setting. The objectives of the study were: to design and implement an educational intervention aimed at nursing staff, based on the South African guidelines for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, at a public sector primary health care clinic; to determine the impact of the educational intervention on <b>the</b> level of <b>knowledge</b> and attitudes of the nursing staff, and on the level of diabetic and blood pressure control achieved in the patient population, and to determine the impact of the educational intervention on pharmacological management of patients. A questionnaire was used to <b>quantitatively</b> <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> nursing staffs’ <b>knowledge</b> of <b>the</b> management of type 2 diabetes and hypertension at a primary health care level. A qualitative evaluation of the nursing staff attitudes was obtained using focus group interviews. The educational intervention, in the form of lectures and based on national diabetes and hypertension guidelines (Working Group of the National Diabetes Advisory Board, 1997; Society for Endocrinology, Metabolism and Diabetes of South Africa, 2002 a; Milne et al., 2003), was then implemented and directed at the nursing staff at a primary health care clinic. A post-intervention evaluation was performed after four months by repeating the questionnaire and focus group interviews. Comparisons between the pre- and post-intervention questionnaire and focus group interviews evaluated the impact of the educational intervention on <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> and attitudes of nursing staff towards the management of type 2 diabetes. Pre- and post-intervention patient data was collected from patient medical files and compared to determine if the management of diabetes and hypertension improved in the patient population after the implementation of the educational intervention. The patient population consisted of 103 patients. The educational intervention resulted in an extremely significant improvement in <b>the</b> level of <b>knowledge</b> of <b>the</b> nursing staff [93 correct responses (28. 3 percent; n = 329 (pre-intervention)) vs 223 correct responses (67. 8 percent; n = 329 (post-intervention)); p 8 percent) decreased by 2 [51; 49. 5 percent, n = 103 (pre-intervention) vs 49, 47. 5 percent, n = 103 (post-intervention) ] which was not a significant improvement. Ideal blood pressure control improved by one from 38 patients [36. 9 percent; n = 103 (pre-intervention) ] to 39 patients [37. 9 percent; n = 103 (post-intervention) ] which was not significant. Optimal change of pharmacological management following the referral of an uncontrolled diabetic patient was only noted for 18 patients (20. 2 percent, n = 89) referred in the post-intervention phase. Clinical inertia was identified as a major limitation to the optimisation of diabetes care. Implementation of an educational intervention based on the South African diabetes and hypertension guidelines at a public sector primary health care clinic was successful in improving <b>the</b> <b>knowledge</b> levels and attitudes of nursing staf...|$|R
