This paper reviews three frameworks currently informing the analysis of classroom talk, or more specifically, the <b>qualitative</b> <b>microanalysis</b> of the turn-by-turn talk that occurs in naturally-occurring unfolding exchanges between teachers and students, and amongst students themselves. Findings from studies working within (1) language socialization, (2) critical discourse analysis, and (3) conversation analysis are explored, with particular attention paid {{to the ways in which}} these frameworks complement and complicate one another. The paper also attempts to identify areas of classroom discourse that have yet to be fully explored, and highlights the need for further research along those lines...|$|E

First, descriptive quantitative data related to language-related episodes (LREs) and other contextual data from four focal learners and their partners (N = 8) in two oral presentation tasks were quantified to provide {{insights into the}} amount and effectiveness of learner-generated focus on form in a Japanese university context. Next, a <b>qualitative</b> <b>microanalysis</b> of one learner 2 ̆ 7 s interaction with partners of similar proficiency on two similar tasks, separated by a period of seven months, was conducted to investigate influences of context. Much as in previous studies, there was little focus on form in interaction and there was much variability across dyads. Qualitative analysis revealed that the effectiveness of FOF in interaction and performance may {{have been influenced by}} the learners 2 ̆ 7 shared background (including L 1 use), individual differences in terms of engagement in LREs, learners 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of each other 2 ̆ 7 s language proficiency, and other interpersonally negotiated features of the interaction.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of different etching times on demineralized dentin surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy and <b>qualitative</b> line <b>microanalysis</b> of chemical structure. Two sample groups, consisting of 30 first premolar teeth in each group, were established. Teeth were cut at the half-distance between the enamel-dentin junction and the pulp. The first group of specimens was etched for 10 seconds and the second group for 30 seconds. 37 % ortophosphoric acid was used. SEM (scanning electron microscopy) was utilized to observe the following parameters: number and diameter of dentinal tubules, dentinal and intertubular dentinal surface percentage, appearance of the dentin surface porous zone containing smear layer and demineralized residual collagen particles with dentin demineralization products in acid globules, and dissolved peritubular dentin cuff. After calculating measurements of central tendency (X,C, Mo, SD), Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Student t-test were performed to confirm the quantitative results, and the c²-test was run to produce qualitative data. In contrast to the 10 -second etching time, the increased etching time of 30 seconds resulted in the following findings: (1) an increased number of dentinal tubules (p< 0. 05), (2) an increase in dentinal tubule diameter (p< 0. 05), (3) an increase in dentinal tubule surface percentage (p< 0. 001), (4) a decrease in intertubular dentinal surface percentage (p< 0. 001), (5) appearance of dentin surface porous zone containing smear layer and demineralized residual collagen particles with dentin demineralization products in acid globules (p< 0. 001), and (6) completely dissolved peritubular dentin cuff (p< 0. 001). Therefore, different etching times using the same phosphoric acid concentration result in different morphological changes in demineralized dentin surface. Moreover, based on a comparison with current studies, prolonged etching time causes morphological changes to dentin surface. Such changes, have, in turn, negative effects on the dentin hybridization process...|$|R

Design/methodology/approach: Analysis of the mechanical and functional properties: surface roughness, microhardness tests, scratch tests, cutting tests. X-ray <b>qualitative</b> <b>microanalysis</b> of elements. Findings: Deposition of (Ti,Al) N coating onto high-speed steel matrix composites (HSSMC), cemented carbides, cermet and Al 2 O 3 type oxide tool ceramics substrate causes increase of wear resistance as well as reduces the exceeding of steady stresses critical levels. It causes multiple (up to 800 %) increase of tool life. As a result of metallographic observations it was stated that linear and uniform character of wear was achieved in case of all deposited samples. Practical implications: Employment of the hard coatings deposited onto sintered tool materials is reckoned {{as one of the}} most important achievements last year in the area of improvement of functional properties of cutting tools.

I then applied <b>qualitative</b> <b>microanalysis</b> of the videotaped data to determine patterns and meanings of individual and group actions to the participants and to determine any interactional changes over the time of the study. Finally I applied the Vygotskian concepts of Other- and Self-regulation to these changes to determine if mentors released their regulation of the science activities and if students appropriated any release of that regulation. I have found that the mentors released responsibility for the activities and students appropriated the release mentor 2 ̆ 7 s release of regulation of those activities. As time progressed, the students needed less mentor control to conduct the science activities, as evidenced by their requiring increasingly simplified rules for carrying out certain actions; by their increasing participation in the setup of the mentoring activities; and by the students 2 ̆ 7 increasing participation in the initiation and continuation of these activities. These progressions in student and mentor actions are taken as evidence of increasing student self-regulation and internalization of the mentoring activities. I have also found the science mentoring activities to be structured similarly in the two groups.

40|$|Previous electron-microscopic {{studies on}} the liver have shown that {{following}} excessive administration of iron to experimental animals, small particles believed to represent ferritin and/or hemosiderin (electron-dense iron-containing particles [IPs]) accumulate in membrane-bound bodies [...] many with a lysosome-like structure [...] in liver parenchymal and Kupffer cells. Further identification of the IP-containing bodies has been facilitated by the application of histochemical techniques for the demonstration of acid phosphatase. The results have shown that reaction product was deposited over organelles similar in appearance to the IP-containing ones, indicating that they were lysosomes. However, the granular nature of the reaction product makes it difficult or impossible to decide whether IPs are present simultaneously with reaction product in the organelle. In order to clarify this <b>qualitative</b> aspect, x-ray <b>microanalysis</b> has been utilized to identify iron and lead (reaction product) in the various structures thought to represent lysosomes. The results indicate that all IP-containing bodies also show the presence of reaction product, and thus {{can be regarded as}} lysosomes.

Design/methodology/approach: The laser treatment of magnesium alloys with alloying SiC and TiC powders with the particles size below 75 μm and over 6. 4 μm was carried out using a high power diode laser (HPDL). The resulting microstructure in the modified surface layer and was examinated using scanning electron microscopy. The X-ray <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative <b>microanalysis</b> and the analysis of a surface distribution of cast elements in the examined magnesium cast alloy was examined. The measurements of hardness and roughness of the modified surface layer was also studied. Findings: The alloyed region has a fine microstructure with hard carbide particles. Hardness of laser surface alloyed layer was dropped as compared to alloy without laser treatment. The roughness of layer surface increased after laser alloying and values are bigger for SiC alloying particles.

Design/methodology/approach: The following results concern {{scanning electron microscopy}} investigations in the SE as well BSE observation mode, for better phase contrast results, also <b>qualitative</b> <b>microanalysis</b> was applied for chemical composition investigations of the surface. Pitting corrosion resistance was carried out using the potentiodynamic electrochemical method (direct current), based on anodic polarisation curve. Based on the achieved anodic polarisation curves, using the Tefel extrapolation method near to the corrosion potential, the quantitative data were determined, which describe the electrochemical corrosion process of the investigated alloys: value of the corrosion potential Ecor (mV), polarisation resistance Rp (kΩ/cm 2), corrosion current density icor (μA/cm 2), corrosion rate Vp (mm/year) as well the mass loss Vc (g/m 2). Findings: Surface morphology of the samples after corrosion test performed after and before heat treatment show irregular shaped pinholes and numerous cracks on the material surface layer. Research limitations/implications: The applied cooling rate and alloy additions {{seems to be a}} good compromise for properties and microstructures, nevertheless further tests should be carried out in order to examine different cooling rates and parameters of solution treatment process and aging process. Practical implications: Investigation results concerning the surface layer presents some interesting findings connected to the layer morphology, which can be of high interest for practical application for the reason of better layer quality as well as surface layer properties. Limitation of surface damage including irregular shaped pinholes and numerous cracks is of very high importance for decreasing the influence of pitting corrosion onto the surface layer corrosion resistance in very width range o applications.

40|$|The underrepresentation {{of women}} in physics has been well {{documented}} and a source of concern for both policy makers and educators. My dissertation focuses on understanding the role self-efficacy plays in retaining students, particularly women, in introductory physics. I use an explanatory mixed methods approach to first investigate quantitatively the influence of self-efficacy in predicting success and then to qualitatively explore the development of self-efficacy. In the initial quantitative studies, I explore the utility of self-efficacy in predicting the success of introductory physics students, both women and men. Results indicate that self-efficacy is a significant predictor of success for all students. I then disaggregate the data to examine how self-efficacy develops differently for women and men in the introductory physics course. Results show women rely on different sources of self-efficacy than do men, and that a particular instructional environment, Modeling Instruction, has a positive impact on these sources of self-efficacy. In the qualitative phase of the project, this dissertation focuses on the development of self-efficacy. Using the <b>qualitative</b> tool of <b>microanalysis,</b> I introduce a methodology for understanding how self-efficacy develops moment-by-moment using the lens of self-efficacy opportunities. I then use the characterizations of self-efficacy opportunities to focus on a particular course environment and to identify and describe a mechanism by which Modeling Instruction impacts student self-efficacy. Results indicate that the emphasizing the development and deployment of models affords opportunities to impact self-efficacy. The findings of this dissertation indicate that introducing key elements into the classroom, such as cooperative group work, model development and deployment, and interaction with the instructor, create a mechanism by which instructors can impact the self-efficacy of their students. Results from this study indicate that creating a model to impact the retention rates {{of women in}} physics should include attending to self-efficacy and designing activities in the classroom that create self-efficacy opportunities. ...|$|R

The characterization of the supported complexes has been achieved in most cases by in situ infrared spectroscopy, surface <b>microanalysis,</b> <b>qualitative</b> and quantitative analysis of evolved gases during surface reactions with labeled surface, solid state H- 1 and C- 13 NMR using C- 13 -enriched compounds, and EXAFS. 1 and 2 react with silica(500) and silica-alumina(500) by simple protonolysis of one Zr-Me bond by surface silanols with formation of a single well-defined neutral compound. In the case of silica-alumina, a fraction of the supported complexes exhibits some interactions with electronically unsaturated surface aluminum sites. 1 and 2 also react with the hydroxyl groups of gamma -alumina(500), leading to several surface structures. Correlation between EXAFS and 13 C NMR data suggests, in short, two main surface structures having different environments for the methyl group: [Al](3) -OZrCp*(CH 3) (2) and [Al](2) -OZrCp*(CH 3) (mu -CH 3) -[Al] for the monoCp series and [Al](2) -OZrCp 2 (CH 3) and [Al]-OZrCp 2 (mu -CH 3) -[Al] for the bisCp series. Ethylene polymerization has been carried out with all the supported complexes under various reaction conditions. Silica-supported catalysts {{in the absence of any}} cocatalyst exhibited no activity whatsoever for ethylene polymerization. When the oxide contained Lewis acidic sites, the resulting surface species were active. The activity, although improved by the presence of additional cocatalysts, remained very low by comparison with that of the homogeneous metallocene systems.

The results obtained by search electronic microanalysis of sludge samples led to identification of particles of average diameter ranging from d ~ 1 to 200 µm of predominantly angular in shape. <b>Qualitative</b> search electron <b>microanalysis</b> of sludge samples identified the presence of Ca, Fe, S, O and C. Furthermore, the analysis of the distribution of these elements in sludge samples and the analysis of cluster shapes of individual elements have shown that they correspond completely, which indicates that they occur together in the observed sample particle. This indicates that the sludge sample contained compounds of the Ca–S–O and Fe–O type and their exact bonding form is defined by the x-ray diffraction technique. The identified phases appearing in all samples and their fractions are: CaSO 4 · H 2 O – gypsum;CaSO 4 · 0, 5 H 2 O – basanite and Fe 3 O 4 – magnetite. Results of quantitative chemical analysis of sludge samples and their fractions obtained by colour separation indicate that the samples mostly contain calcium (w = 15. 55 – 17. 33 %), sulfur (w = 13. 38 – 15. 63 %), iron (w = 9. 48 – 11. 04 %), followed by Al (w = 5. 00 – 5. 26 %), K, Ti, Mn, Zn, Cr, Sr, Ni, Co, Pb and Zn – all in concentrations below 0. 1 %. Examination of physical-chemical properties of eluates thereof has proven that there is no risk of admixtures present in this waste and the sludge can be disposed of on the ground in compliance with legal regulations. The obtained results provide grounds for the conclusion that the basic component of the analysed neutralisation sludge is gypsum (w ~ 85 %). Referring to the good agro-technical practice of agriculturally developed countries, it is justified to consider its possible application for calcification ofagricultural soil. The purpose of this paper was to identify the physical-chemical properties of this type of waste and use its valuable components to find new options for its use in other branches of economy and to stop its uncontrolled accumulation in the environment, improving thus the management of this and similar types of non-hazardous industrial waste...|$|R
