40|$|Previous {{research}} {{investigating the}} effect of delay type has generated mixed results. To reconcile such findings, this study maps two competing theories, the field theory and the expectancy model, on to regulatory focus, and it examines the joint effects of regulatory focus and delay type on consumers’ reactions to a service delay. We argue that the field theory is more suitable for predicting promotion-focused consumers’ responses, whereas the expectancy model is more appropriate for explaining prevention-focused customers’ responses. The results lend support to our arguments and suggest that promotion-focused consumers generate more intense negative emotions and lower service <b>quality</b> <b>evaluations</b> after a pre-process delay than after an in-process delay. On the contrary, prevention-focused consumers exhibit more intense negative emotions and lower service <b>quality</b> <b>evaluations</b> after an in-process delay than after a pre-process delay...|$|R

40|$|End {{users and}} service {{customers}} today want to perform <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> for multimedia services and distributed applications. In this undertaking, they need assistance and appropriate procedures and tools. Unfortunately, today's Quality of Service frameworks and Quality of Service management {{products on the}} market do not help. This thesis fills the gap. It argues {{that it is possible to}} find a common simple <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> procedure for end users and that a corresponding evaluation process can be automated. This thesis proposes a new <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> framework that is suited to end user interests and needs, that is application-oriented and networkindependent, that is open and extensible, and that has the potential to complement today's Quality of Service frameworks. It encompasses: 1. A new 5 -step <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> procedure Its purpose is to identify those few quality characteristics that are decision-relevant and that have a major influence on service quality as perceived by an end user. In a first step, all quality characteristics are identified from related international standards or specifications ("identification"). Those that are essential and decision-relevant for end user perception are chosen next ("rating"). They have to be selected for evaluation ('selection') and quantified ("quantification") before simple, objective, and cost-effective evaluation methods can be used ("evaluation") in the last step. 2. A <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> architecture <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> has to be automated to be successful and to provide usable results. An appropriate architecture involving end users, evaluation meth-ods, and the applications and services under test is designed. The usage of intelligent agents is proposed to do automated <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> for applications and services. The architecture introduced includes single agent building blocks and communication and coordination models for <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> agents. 3. A <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> infrastructure A <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> infrastructure is needed to establish a trusted environment in which end users can do <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation.</b> Its first design introduces certification authorities and agent registries as infrastructure prerequisites for standardized and authenticated <b>Quality</b> of Service <b>evaluation</b> agents.

40|$|Reduced-reference {{image quality}} {{assessment}} (RR-IQA) provides {{a practical solution}} for automatic image <b>quality</b> <b>evaluations</b> in various applications where only partial information about the original reference image is accessible. Here we propose an RR-IQA method by estimating the structural similarity (SSIM) index, which is a widely used full-reference (FR) image quality measure {{shown to be a}} good indicator of perceptual image quality. Specifically, we extract statistical features from a multi-scale, multi-orientation divisive normalization transform and develop a distortion measure by following the philosophy in the construction of SSIM. We found an interesting linear relationship between the FR SSIM measure and our RR estimate when the im-age distortion type is fixed. A regression-by-discretization method is then applied to normalize our measure across image distortion types. We use six publicly-available subject-rated databases to test the proposed RR-SSIM method, which shows strong correlations with both SSIM and subjective <b>quality</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Finally, we introduce the novel idea of partially repairing an image using RR features and use deblurring as an example to demonstrate its application...|$|R
