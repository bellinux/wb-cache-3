During all the tests, the oxygen at the chimney was kept constant (around 3 %) by adjusting the position of the burner air damper and thus the air combustion mass flow rate. The combustion chamber has two <b>quartz</b> <b>windows</b> through which the flame emission was registered by using a photodiode sensible in visible range.

50|$|An EPROM is an {{erasable}} ROM {{that can}} be changed more than once. However, writing new data to an EPROM requires a special programmer circuit. EPROMs have a <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> {{that allows them to}} be erased with ultraviolet light, but the whole device is cleared at one time. A one-time programmable (OTP) device uses an EPROM chip but omits the <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> in the package; this is less costly to manufacture. An electrically erasable programmable read-only memory EEPROM uses electrical signals to erase memory. These erasable memory devices require a significant amount of time to erase data and to write new data; they are not usually configured to be programmed by the processor of the target system. Data is stored by use of floating gate transistors which require special operating voltages to be applied to trap or release electric charge on an insulated control gate for storage sites.|$|E
50|$|The 8751 was an 8051 with 4 KB EPROM {{instead of}} 4 KB ROM. They were {{identical}} {{except for the}} non-volatile memory type. This part was available in a ceramic package with a clear <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> {{over the top of}} the dice so UV light could be used to erase the EPROM memory. Related parts are: 8752 had 8 KB EPROM, 8754 had 16 KB EPROM, 8758 had 32 KB EPROM.|$|E
50|$|Its UV {{transparency}} {{also finds}} uses in the semiconductor industry; an EPROM, or erasable programmable read only memory, {{is a type}} of memory chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off, but which can be erased by exposure to strong ultraviolet light.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to describe the ongoing projects in diesel engine combustion research at Sandia National Laboratories' Combustion Research Facility and to detail recent experimental results. The approach we are employing is to assemble experimental hardware that mimic realistic engine geometries while enabling optical access. For example, we are using multi-cylinder engine heads or one-cylinder versions of production heads mated to one-cylinder engine blocks. Optical access is then obtained through a periscope in an exhaust valve, <b>quartz</b> <b>windows</b> in the piston crown, windows in spacer plates just below the head, or quartz cylinder liners. We have three diesel engine experiments supported by the Department of Energy, Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies: a one-cylinder version of a Cummins heavy-duty engine, a diesel simulation facility, and a one-cylinder Caterpillar engine to evaluate combustion of alternative diesel fuels...|$|R
50|$|The lander had {{cameras to}} take {{pictures}} of the ground and spring-loaded arms to measure the compressibility of the soil.

5000|$|Semiconductor {{packages}} {{may include}} special features. Light-emitting or light-sensing devices {{must have a}} transparent window in the package; other devices such as transistors may be disturbed by stray light and require an opaque package. [...] An ultraviolet erasible programmable read-only memory device needs a <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> to allow ultraviolet light to enter and erase the memory. Pressure-sensing integrated circuits require a port on the package that can be connected to a gas or liquid pressure source.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> is {{expensive}} to make, OTP (one-time programmable) chips were introduced; here, the die is mounted in an opaque package so it cannot be erased after programming - this also {{eliminates the need}} to test the erase function, further reducing cost. OTP versions of both EPROMs and EPROM-based microcontrollers are manufactured. However, OTP EPROM (whether separate or {{part of a larger}} chip) is being increasingly replaced by EEPROM for small sizes, where the cell cost isn't too important, and flash for larger sizes.|$|E
50|$|An EPROM (rarely EROM), or {{erasable}} programmable read-only memory, {{is a type}} {{of memory}} chip that retains its data when its power supply is switched off. Computer memory that can retrieve stored data after a power supply has been turned off and back on is called non-volatile. It is an array of floating-gate transistors individually programmed by an electronic device that supplies higher voltages than those normally used in digital circuits. Once programmed, an EPROM can be erased by exposing it to strong ultraviolet light source (such as from a mercury-vapor light). EPROMs are easily recognizable by the transparent fused <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> {{in the top of the}} package, through which the silicon chip is visible, and which permits exposure to ultraviolet light during erasing.|$|E

40|$|High {{quality and}} purity Pt thin films were {{deposited}} using, as precursors, both platinum (II) acetylacetonate, and methylcyclopentadienyl-(h 3 -allyl) platinum.

The XRD (X-ray powder diffraction) spectra, obtained using both precursors, reveal the characteristic peaks of metallic platinum deposit. The depositions were performed on CaF 2 and <b>quartz</b> <b>windows</b> only in some well localised areas using a special brass mask prepared in our laboratory (Fig. 3).

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} at various temperatures of braids impregnated with polymer {{can be measured}} by using the braid as the suspension of a torsion pendulum. This report describes the electronic and mechanical design of a torsional braid pendulum displacement transducer which is an advance {{in the state of}} the art. The transducer uses a unique optical design consisting of refracting <b>quartz</b> <b>windows</b> used in conjunction with a differential photocell to produce a null signal. The release mechanism for initiating free torsional oscillation of the pendulum has also been improved. Analysis of the precision and accuracy of the transducer indicated that the maximum relative error in measuring torsional amplitude was approximately 0. A serious problem inherent in all instruments which use a torsional suspension was analyzed: misalignment of the physical and torsional axes of the torsional member which results in modulation of the amplitude of the free oscillation...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{experiment}} onboard STS-85 was the Southwest Ultraviolet Imaging System (SWUIS-01) {{from the}} Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) along with scientific collaborators from JPL, APL, and the University of Maryland. SWUIS (pronounced, [...] "swiss") is a wide-field UV imager to {{which was used}} to observe comet Hale-Bopp. It is based around an 18-cm Maksutov UV telescope and a UV-sensitive, Xybion image-intensified CCD camera that frames at video rates (30 Hz). Each SWUIS observation period lasted approximately 3 hours, and garnered approximately 10^5 images in up to 7 filter bandpasses. SWUIS was operated from a 2-axis mount inside the Shuttle mid-deck cockpit, and looked out of the Shuttle through a <b>quartz</b> <b>window.</b> SWUIS can be pointed anywhere in a 4.5 deg cone around the centerline of the comet.

5000|$|Most {{microcontrollers}} at {{this time}} had concurrent variants. One had an erasable EPROM program memory, with a transparent <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> in {{the lid of the}} package to allow it to be erased by exposure to ultraviolet light, often used for prototyping. The other was either a mask programmed ROM from the manufacturer for large series, or a PROM variant which was only programmable once; sometimes this was signified with the designation OTP, standing for [...] "one-time programmable". The PROM was of identical type of memory as the EPROM, but because {{there was no way to}} expose it to ultraviolet light, it could not be erased. The erasable versions required ceramic packages with quartz windows, making them significantly more expensive than the OTP versions, which could be made in lower-cost opaque plastic packages. For the erasable variants, quartz was required, instead of less expensive glass, for its transparency to ultraviolet - glass is largely opaque to UV - but the main cost differentiator was the ceramic package itself.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA 100 -kWth receiver-reactor {{designed}} for the thermal dissociation of ZnO into metallic Zn is separated from atmosphere by use of a transparent <b>quartz</b> <b>window,</b> through which concentrated solar radiation is admitted. Protection of such windows from reactant and product particle deposition is critical for successful reactor operation. Usingin-situ visualization techniques, the effectiveness of an auxiliary flow of inert gas in aerodynamically protecting a 600 -mm-diameter <b>quartz</b> <b>window</b> mounted on the receiver-reactor has been directly assessed during high-temperature experimentation. This work has shown that: (i) high-temperature, in-situ flow visualization is possible and effective in assessing flow patterns developed inside the reactor;(ii) there exist three characteristic flow patterns inside the reactor that can be dynamically controlled by use {{of a set of}} tangential and radially oriented jets; and (iii) a region of stable protective flow, under a wide range of experimental and operational conditions, is capable of repeatedly and fully suppressing detrimental particle depositions on the <b>quartz</b> <b>window...</b>|$|E
2500|$|Examining the Bathysphere in {{preparation}} for resumed dives, Beebe {{found that it was}} in need of considerable repair. [...] The steel body of the Bathysphere was as strong as ever, but the <b>quartz</b> <b>windows</b> had developed minute fractures which would prevent them from withstanding the pressure of the deep sea, and one of the copper bolts for the hatch was found to be damaged due to the explosive decompression after the failed test dive in 1932. [...] In addition to replacing these parts of the Bathysphere, Beebe also had it installed with a new system of valves which could regulate the release of oxygen much more precisely than before, and a barometer to show the increase in pressure if oxygen was flowing too quickly. [...] The palm-leaf fans to circulate air past the chemical trays were replaced with a small electric fan, powered by the same cable that powered the searchlight, and the searchlight itself was replaced with a far more powerful one.|$|R
30|$|The {{samples of}} the Si ND array were placed on a cold finger cooled by a closed He {{compressor}} in a vacuum cryostat with <b>quartz</b> <b>windows.</b> The time-resolved PL spectra were observed at various temperatures by combining the excitation of second harmonic femtosecond pulses with the wavelength of 400 nm, pulse width of 150 fs, and repetition rate of 76 MHz of a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser, with the detection of a synchroscan streak camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). A spot diameter of the laser light focused on the sample surface was 100 μm. The excitation power density was 8.4 mJ cm− 2. The number of electron–hole pair generated per one ND was calculated {{to be less than}} 1, taking the sheet density of ND into account. Therefore, the multiple exciton generation or Auger process were not induced. The time width of the instrumental response curve was less than 15 ps, and the time resolution of 5 ps was obtained after deconvolution with the instrumental response.|$|R
40|$|Segmented <b>quartz</b> <b>windows</b> are {{a concept}} to build larger windows for {{receivers}} {{that require a}} closed aperture. Reflection losses are a significant loss factor for such solar receivers. Without any additional measures, the reflection loss can reach about 12 %. One important measure to improve transmission is the application of anti-reflective coatings, which is beneficial in any case. Another option is modifying the window geometry, especially the edge surfaces of the glass segments. A certain fraction of the reflection losses are caused by a light-guide effect in the glass body, for rays entering through the front surface. Changing the cut surfaces in a way reducing the light-guide effect can significantly improve transmission of a segmented window. Several possible configurations are evaluated and discussed. The results of raytracing simulations verify the improvement. The final selection of the window configuration depends on the optical properties and on mechanical strength, anufacturing and cost considerations. This has to be evaluated for any specific receiver design...|$|R
