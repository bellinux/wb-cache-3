I investigate {{this in the}} context of trucking. <b>Quasi-rents</b> in trucking are generally smaller than in the contexts studied in the previous empirical literature. They vary with hauls' distance and the thickness of local markets. I find that doubling the thickness of the market increases the likelihood that simple spot arrangements govern transactions by about 30 % for long hauls. I find weaker evidence of relationships between local market thickness and contractual form for short hauls [...] hauls for which <b>quasi-rents</b> are particularly small. Contracts' role as protectors of <b>quasi-rents</b> becomes less important as <b>quasi-rents</b> decrease, but exists over a surprisingly large range. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper investigates whether {{innovations}} generate <b>quasi-rents</b> {{and whether}} the size of those <b>quasi-rents</b> are affected by market conditions. Using a panel data of Spanish manufacturing firms during the period 1990 - 93 we answer affinnatevely to both questions. Product, process and both innovations generate quasi rents and such quasirents appears to be higher for process innovations. The size of innovation <b>quasi-rents</b> seems to be affected positively by demand growth, by product standarisation, and by low product market concentration. The three empirical results are {{in agreement with the}} theoretical predictions such as the Schmoockler' s theory of demandpool innovation, the price-elasticity of demand effects of Kamien and Schwartz and the replacement effect of Arrow. Process innovations are more affected by market conditions than the rest of innovations, at the tine of generating <b>quasi-rents...</b>|$|R
30|$|A final {{possible}} reason why formal sector wage employees may {{earn more than}} similar self-employed workers is that formal sector employees may successfully bargain {{for a portion of}} the <b>quasi-rents</b> earned by firms. Several studies have identified non-competitive rents as an important determinant of inter-industry wage differentials. 2 Most recently, Abowd et al. (2012) find that shared <b>quasi-rents</b> account for a large percentage of inter-industry wage differentials in the United States and France. Based on wage bargaining models that allow for on the job search (i.e. Cahuc et al. (2006)), they posit that the wage formal sector firms pay employees is the sum of the opportunity cost of wage employment plus the workers’ share of <b>quasi-rents.</b> Under the assumption that earnings in self-employment or the informal sector is an approximation of comparable formal sector wage workers’ opportunity cost, the self-employment and informal employment earnings penalties will be determined by the bargaining power of workers {{and the size of the}} <b>quasi-rents.</b> That is, the self-employment and informal sector earnings penalty will increase if the relative bargaining power of formal sector employees increases or if firms’ <b>quasi-rents</b> increase.|$|R

The central exogenous variable in the analysis is the quantity of <b>quasi-rents</b> per worker available to be split between unions and employers. We measure available <b>quasi-rents</b> per worker as the difference per worker between total industry revenues net of raw materials costs and labor costs evaluated at the opportunity cost of the workers. Using two-digit industry level data for thirty-five U. S. industries for the period 1955 through 1986, we find that both organizing activity and employer resistance to unionization are positively related to available <b>quasi-rents</b> per worker. However, there is still a strong negative trend in union organizing activity and a strong positive trend in employer resistance after controlling for <b>quasi-rents</b> per worker. Thus, the explanation for the decline in union organizing activity and the increase in employer resistance to unionization since the mid 1970 's lies elsewhere. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{bargaining}} power of formal sector employees, and therefore self-employment and informal sector wage penalties, could be increased {{by the presence}} of efficiency wages or labor market institutions such as unions. Van Reenen (1996) focuses on the role of innovation and increased labor productivity in generating <b>quasi-rents,</b> which firms can then “share” with workers as efficiency wages. That study presents strong evidence that workers in British firms that adopt more innovative and productive technologies earn more than identical workers in other firms. It argues that more productive firms allocate part of their “quasi-rents” from innovation to workers in the form of higher wages. To the extent formal sector firms share <b>quasi-rents</b> with workers, this would contribute to a self-employment and informal sector wage penalty. These penalties would be larger in countries where firms are more productive, and therefore have more <b>quasi-rents</b> to share, and/or in countries in which labor market institutions favor workers in the wage bargaining process.|$|R

40|$|Is {{there any}} glue that may tie {{together}} {{the future of}} US unionism and the trend towards disintegration of the firm? This paper addresses this question by investigating the effect of outsourcing on US unionisation. Using a new dataset for the US manufacturing sector from 1973 to 1994, we quantify the effect of outsourcing on 3 -digit industries <b>quasi-rents,</b> employment, union wage premia and union densities. Instrumental Variables estimation techniques show that outsourcing has contributed to higher <b>quasi-rents</b> and increased <b>quasi-rents</b> per plant and industry employment. While the premium of substitutable workers is not affected by the extent of outsourcing, we find evidence that unionised workers employed in jobs that are not substitutes of the tasks being outsourced gain from outsourcing. Finally, we find no support to the claim that outsourcing reduces union density. This set of results sharply contrasts with the dominant view according to which internal labour markets (and unionisation) have little to gain from market mediated employment arrangements. ...|$|R

The possibility that the weak industrial union presence in the U.S. vis‐à‐vis France permits far less mutual protection of the <b>quasi‐rents</b> by the two sides and allows individual bargaining to distribute more of the firm effect to older or better educated workers. In France, where the industry‐wide collective bargaining agreements permeate all sectors, there is simply much less scope for individual bargaining to target the <b>quasi‐rents.</b>|$|R

Noncontingent career-long, fixed-wage contracts do not induce efficient levels of training because they award all the <b>quasi-rents</b> from training to the firm, leaving no incentive for trainee effort.

40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with studying the economic content of the categories of «rent» and «quasi-rent», classification of their main forms arising in terms of relationships in the science and innovation sphere, and analyzing the specificity of formation of these incomes in conditions of contemporary innovation economy. The content of the category of «rent» {{as a form of}} income arising from the relationship of at least three entities has been revised; {{in the case of a}} scientific-innovation rent, it is the holder of a patent or a license holder, an industrial capitalist or an employee who creates a new or improved product; in some cases, the fourth entity of rent may be a hired researcher. In this relationship, the additional income earned by entrepreneurs in the event of commercial success has been defined as technological (innovation) <b>quasi-rent,</b> which can change inversely proportional to the scientific-innovation rent.

30|$|Our {{evidence}} is thus {{consistent with the}} view that earnings gaps between the self-employed, informal employees and formal employees are due to efficiency wages and the sharing of <b>quasi-rents</b> in formal sector firms. Because {{it is likely that}} formal sector firms in low income countries are less productive than those in more developed countries, and offer fewer resources that boost worker productivity, these firms earn fewer rents that can be shared with workers. As countries develop and firms gain access to innovative technologies, the productivity of employees in firms increases, allowing firms to share more of their <b>quasi-rents</b> with workers. This increases the wages of formal employees relative to the self-employed and informal employees. It is also reasonable to expect that the bargaining power of formal employees will also increase as countries develop, due to the increasing prevalence of unions and the better enforcement of labor regulations. If the bargaining power of workers is positively correlated with level of development and labor productivity, then the correlation between the employee’s share of <b>quasi-rents</b> and development and productivity will be even stronger.|$|R

30|$|In all {{specifications}} and as expected, the <b>quasi‐rent</b> is {{much more}} highly correlated (i.e., explains a larger fraction of the variance) with the firm effects than with the person effects. This difference is more marked in the French regressions than in the American regressions. This result supports the idea that bargaining is more prevalent in France than in the United States, an unsurprising feature when comparing the wage‐setting institutions. Indeed, union strength is highly correlated to the firm effect and not the person effect in both countries.|$|E

40|$|We study optimal capital-income {{taxation}} in {{an economy}} in which search frictions in physical capital markets give rise to flows of economic profit. These profit flows are necessary compen-sation for sunk search costs of entry into the capital market. Viewed in this way, profits are quasi-rents. At any point in time, however, profit flows from existing matches can also be viewed as pure rents. Whether a Ramsey government considers profit flows as pure rents or as quasi-rents is crucial for whether {{and to what extent}} capital-income taxation should be used to tax profits. We prove that if the government treats profits as quasi-rents, the canonical long-run zero-capital-tax prescription arises. If profits are instead treated as pure rents, the long-run optimal capital-income tax is non-zero, with a calibrated version of this economy featuring a capital-income tax rate of over 30 percent. The sharply contrasting results are not due to any lack of commitment. Rather, because profit flows are explicitly linked to free-entry conditions, a Ramsey government has an economic basis for adopting either the pure-rent view or the <b>quasi-rent</b> view. In the long run, however, the <b>quasi-rent</b> equilibrium is welfare-superior. ∗The views expressed here are solely those of the authors and should not be interpreted as reflecting the views o...|$|E

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} discussion, whether a {{theoretical}} perspective focussing exclusively on Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) is sufficient to generate valuable insights to research on business relationships. Recently integrating Transaction Cost Economic (TCE) and Resource Based View (RBV) arguments {{has become one of}} the most prominent theoretical approaches in research on business relationships. This dissertation questions this evolution and strengthens an exclusive TCE perspective by recalling two of the core TCE constructs in order to achieve full exploitation of TCE reasoning. It discusses the transaction attributes “asset specificity” and “uncertainty” and identifies conceptual gaps that lead to ambiguous results regarding the test of TCE guided hypotheses in prior research on business relationships. The constructs are discussed extensively from a theoretical perspective. According hypotheses are derived and tested empirically in a cross-sectional online-survey setting by using means of Structural Equation Modelling. This procedure results in a refinement of TCE thinking concerning the transaction itself as well as in a better understanding of interdependencies between uncertainty and specificity. It can be shown that different forms of uncertainty are interdependent if specific investments are conducted. These interdependencies have almost never been considered explicitly in prior research. Results also show that the appropriable <b>Quasi-rent</b> determines transaction parties’ behaviour strongly if it is not symmetrically distributed either concerning the amortization horizon and/or the amount of the <b>Quasi-rent...</b>|$|E
