5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday practice sessions were held in dry and hot weather conditions. Barrichello set the fastest time in the first practice session, at 1 minute and 41.953 seconds, which was three-tenths of a second <b>quicker</b> than Pedro de la Rosa of Arrows. Coulthard was third fastest despite going off the circuit at the Clark chicane. Michael Schumacher went off at the Senna chicane en route to recording the fourth quickest lap, ahead of Ralf Schumacher. Häkkinen, Montoya, Irvine, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. In the second practice session, Irvine was running <b>quicker</b> by setting the fastest {{time of the day}} of 1:41.424, ahead of Montoya in second. Häkkinen was third quickest, in front of Barrichello in fourth. Michael Schumacher took fifth place, running wide at the circuit's chicanes which prevented him from setting a <b>quicker</b> lap. de la Rosa, Coulthard, Jean Alesi, Trulli and Ralf Schumacher, who collided with the Sudkurve tyre barrier, followed in the top ten.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{study by}} Ragna Redelstorff e.a. {{concluded}} that the bone histology of Kentrosaurus indicated {{that it had a}} higher growth rate than reported for Stegosaurus and Scutellosaurus, in view of the relatively rapid deposition of highly vascularised fibrolamellar bone. As Stegosaurus was larger than Kentrosaurus, this contradicts the general rule that larger dinosaurs grew <b>quicker</b> than smaller ones.|$|E

5|$|In flight, the red-throated loon has a {{distinctive}} profile; its small feet do not project far past {{the end of}} its body, its head and neck droop below the horizontal (giving the flying bird a distinctly hunchbacked shape) and its thin wings are angled back.

5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} <b>quicker</b> {{and more}} {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the articular bone.|$|E

5000|$|The basic Salsa dance rhythm {{consists}} of taking three steps for every four beats of music. The odd {{number of steps}} creates the inherent syncopation to the Salsa dancing and ensures that it takes 8 beats of music to loop back to a new sequence of steps. Different styles employ this syncopation differently. For [...] "On1" [...] dancers this rhythm is described as [...] "quick, <b>quick,</b> slow, <b>quick,</b> <b>quick,</b> slow." [...] For [...] "On2" [...] dancers this rhythm is [...] "quick, <b>quick,</b> <b>quick,</b> pause, <b>quick,</b> <b>quick,</b> <b>quick,</b> pause."

This can be combined with notations for interruptions, e.g. I.U.Q. for interrupted ultra <b>quick,</b> or grouping, e.g. V.Q.(9) for a very <b>quick</b> group of nine flashes. <b>Quick</b> characteristics can also be followed by other characteristics, e.g. V.Q.(6)+L.Fl. for a very <b>quick</b> group of six flashes, followed by a long flash.|$|R

5|$|The top six {{drivers were}} split evenly by engine; half running Honda engines, {{and the other}} half Chevrolet.

Dixon set the fastest time; 1:10.3162: just four thousandths of a second <b>quicker</b> than Power. Tagliani was third, joined on the second row by Pagenaud, while Viso and Hunter-Reay qualified on the third row of the grid. Rahal and Simona de Silvestro were both subject to ten-place grid penalties for engine changes made in mid-May, dropping them to 17th and 25th on the grid respectively. Rubens Barrichello was also given a ten-place penalty for changing his chassis between qualifying and the race, placing him 24th.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{remained}} dry and hot for the Saturday morning practice sessions. Coulthard set {{the fastest}} {{time of the}} third practice session, a 1:15.965.

Both Jaguars continued to be quick with Irvine fifth and Herbert eighth. The two were separated by Michael Schumacher and Button. Barrichello and de la Rosa rounded out the top ten. In the final practice session, Coulthard was unable to improve his time because of an engine failure though he remained fastest. Häkkinen managed to set a <b>quicker</b> time and remained with the second quickest lap. Barrichello ran <b>quicker</b> and was third fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher. The Jordan drivers remained fastest–Trulli was fifth and Frentzen sixth–their best times two thousands of a second apart. Irvine was seventh quickest, ahead of Michael Schumacher who concentrated on qualifying set-up. Button and Herbert completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
