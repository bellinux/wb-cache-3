40|$|ABSTRACT: Major {{advantage}} of micromechanical models for prediction of two basic types of fracture, ductile fracture and cleavage fracture, should be non-dependence of model parameters on geometry. In this {{way it is}} possible to determine fracture parameters on limited quantity of material using small specimens. In this paper, ductile fracture of structural steel has been analysed on specimens without initial crack and precracked specimens. A part of investigation was carried out through participation in ″Numerical Round Robin on Micro-Mechanical Models ″ organised by European Structural Integrity Society (ESIS). Additional <b>quantitative</b> <b>metallurgical</b> analysis was made in order to determine volume fraction and mean free path of non-metallic inclusions in tested steel. Finite element calculations on different geometries were performed. Based on non-coupled (the Rice-Tracey model) and coupled (modified Gurson model) micromechanical approaches, crack initiation and onset of growth on tensile specimens have been analysed. Simplified procedure for determination of critical values of model parameters corresponding to ductile fracture initiation was proposed.

The size of possibly deleterious iron-rich precipitates was reduced, and the morphology of such precipitates changed to a possibly less deleterious form without further alloy additions of manganese.

40|$|Abstract. The {{industrial}} production of aluminium strip comprises a rather long process chain. One {{of the characteristics}} of aluminium alloys is that a number of final strip properties are influenced considerably already at very early process stages.

40|$|It {{is known}} that {{tailoring}} a hot stamping part, to achieve locally graded properties, can improve the crash behavior. Depending {{on the role of}} the structural part (carrying either bending or axial crash load), the best position for the local regions with lower strength and higher ductility can be different. The distribution of these local regions and their mechanical properties affects the crash behavior of the part in each loading case and therefore can be effectively designed to improve the crash performance. To investigate these effects and examine the improvement possibilities, a numerical thermalmechanical-metallurgical model of a hot stamping process and a representative side impact crash model were created and analysed. The hot stamping model was used to predict the consequent phase fractions and mechanical properties of tailored hot stamping parts produced with different tailoring scenarios.

These deposits have many distinct attributes, including multiple events in their formation, which affect the reaction series between the hydrothermal fluid and its host rock. This, in turn, defines the alteration and main causes of ore formation. Many porphyry copper deposits are hosted in quartz feldspar porphyries, where the alteration–mineralisation is zoned from barren early sodic–calcic, through potentially ore-grade potassic, chlorite–sericite, and phyllic, to advanced argillic. Chalcopyrite ± bornite mineralisation in many porphyry copper deposits is largely confined to potassic zones (Sillitoe, 2010).

Having tools which can predict at least the final grain size distribution for these materials is strongly required. It is in this frame that ACF worked for several years with other industrial and academic partners such as INDUSTEEL CRMC, Aubert & Duval, Ascometal, CEA Valduc and CEMEF Mines ParisTech on the simulation of the recrystallization (ReX) of 304 L austenitic stainless steel. Recent developments allowed simulation in a full-field context of the static recrystallization (SRX) of 304 L stainless steel including a crystal plasticity formulation in a finite element (FE) context in order to model precisely the grain deformation anisotropy. This crystal plasticity model includes a decomposition of the dislocation density in SSDs (Statistically Stored Dislocations) and GNDs (Geometrically Necessary Dislocations). Including the GNDs gave better results on the localization of the strain but also allowed to define more relevant nucleation criteria. During and after ReX, the grain growth phenomenon due to capillarity effects is also modelled. To take into account capillarity effects enables to reproduce precisely the final microstructure morphology (shape of the grains, equilibrium angles at multiple junctions [...] .). This full-field approach gives very good results for the modelling of 304 L stainless steel SRX. In parallel, at plants, forging and rolling processes need to be simulated in order to optimize fabrication sequences in terms of material distortion capability versus rheological properties of these materials and in terms of grain size with potential impact on ultrasonic inspection performance.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{experiments to}} separate the effects of temperature, pressure and metal composition on the metal-silicate partitioning of V, Ni, Co, Mn and Si in order to refine the 'deep magma ocean' model of core formation. Interactions in the liquid metal were accounted for by using a well-known <b>metallurgical</b> <b>model</b> combined with data from the literature. Temperature effects were calculated using free energy data for liquid metals and liquid oxides. This approach enabled us to separate pressure effects {{from those of the}} other two variables. If we assume that the core formed by a single-stage process then we find that the mantle concentrations of the refractory elements can be matched at a temperature of 3750 K and a pressure of 40 GPa. These values are in good agreement with recent estimates based on other partitioning data. The calculated temperature is, however, 700 °C above the peridotite liquidus at 40 GPa, and is therefore physically implausible. The base of the magma ocean, at which metal would pond during accretion must be saturated in crystals and should, therefore lie at or below the silicate liquidus. We find that dynamic accretion models, in which pressure increased as the earth grew, do not improve the match to the peridotite liquidus so long as the oxygen fugacity is fixed by the current Fe content of the mantle. If, however, we force temperature to lie on the peridotite liquidus as the earth grew, the mantle concentrations of refractory elements can be matched provided oxygen fugacity increased during accretion. To illustrate this we use accretionary models in which, as the earth grew, the base of the magma ocean was at half the mantle depth and applied gradual or step-changes in oxygen fugacity. If we apply a 2 log unit increase in oxygen fugacity, the siderophile element contents of the mantle are matched, the Si content of the core is 5 to 7 wt. % and the average core segregation temperature is 2990 K, within the experimental range. Oxidation during accretion is an important component of heterogeneous accretion models, but the mechanisms proposed are generally untestable. Here we propose that an increase in oxidation state is a natural consequence {{of the size of the}} earth. Magnesium silicate perovskite is the principal phase in the earth's lower mantle. This phase forces the disproportionation of ferrous iron into ferric iron plus metal. When perovskite started to grow at the base of the magma ocean, dissolution and reprecipitation acted as an 'oxygen pump' injecting oxidized ferric iron into the upper mantle. As the earth continued to grow, infalling metal was oxidized by the ferric iron into ferrous iron, raising the iron content of the magma ocean and the oxygen fugacity of metal-silicate equilibration. This process did not occur to any great extent on Mars because of the limited stability of perovskite in the smaller planet. © 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The goal of this multi-partner R&D project is to develop energy-efficient and optimized thermomechanical processing for the production of continuous cast 5000 series aluminum sheet alloys. Full scale implementation of the proposed effort by the year 2015 could lead to yearly energy savings of 23 trillion Btu and related energy cost savings of $ 96 million per year for the U. S. aluminum rolled products industry. The major achievements of this project based on the goals and objectives of the project are given...|$|R
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the <b>metallurgical</b> and fatigue <b>modelling.</b> A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. The Concorde airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|R
40|$|MODELLING OF LARGE-SIZE INDUSTRIAL FLOTATION EQUIPMENT The main {{objective}} of this project was the hydrodynamic and metallurgical characterization of large-size flotation cells. As industrial equipment, the work was focused mainly on rougher flotation cells of 130 m 3 located at the concentrating plant of the El Teniente Division, Codelco-Chile. The liquid and solid DTR was measured in three types of sizes (- 45, + 45 + 150, - 150 microns) in self-priming flotation cells of 130 m 3. The mean residence times observed in each cell ranged from 4. 5 to 6 minutes for different tonnages for operation of the plant. The DTR measurements were conducted through the radioactive tracer technique and allowed confirming that the operation of these equipments is different to the perfect mixing condition. In this regard, DTR for each individual cell was appropriately characterized through a LSTS (large and small tank-in-series) model. Moreover, the individual hydrodynamic behavior of all the cells in the bank was compared, detecting a high consistence in the operation with exceptions where short-circuits were observed. Complementarily, the transient modeling of the mixing process in industrial flotation cells was developed. In this regard, it was detected that the mixing time in a cell of 130 m 3 is about 60 - 80 seconds, comparable {{to the time of}} a pulp circulation in the rotor. Also, it was determined that pulp circulates about 5 times in the rotor before it abandons the cell. A new experimental technique was developed to determine DTR and the mean residence time of the liquid and solid through the large cell foam by using radioactive tracer and processing data through discrete deconvolution of time signals. A new <b>metallurgical</b> <b>model</b> with analytical solution for the collection zone of flotation columns was developed. A rectangular distribution for the kinetic constant and a LSTS (large and small tank-in-series) -type mixing model are considered in this model. A new technique was developed that allows identifying the kinetic constant for modeling an industrial flotation bank from a reduced experimental design, which consists in the solution of only two mass balances (first cell and global bank). Moreover, a methodology was developed that enables separating the scaling factor of flotation equipments, considering the independent kinetic component of hydrodynamics. A new system was developed for determining bubble load, a key element for measuring foam recovery in industrial cells. In this regard, the bubble load was measured in industrial flotation cells of 130 m 3 through capturing bubbles in a new prototype developed in the Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria. This measuring together with the direct measuring of gas flow and mass balance allowed directly evaluating foam recovery in large industrial cells. A phenomenological model was developed to describe foam, of the CFD-type, which enabled describing the trajectory of liquid, air and solid flows, and also the composition spatial profiles (in two dimensions). The model was calibrated for the condition of real foam in the 130 m 3 industrial cell. The recovery of liquid and solid mineral by dragging in the foam, (in types of sizes) was determined. Results were appropriately compared to the determination of dragging by material balance, from the direct measuring of bubble load. This result enabled validating the assumption set out for calculating recovery of floatable mineral in foam. A methodology was developed for production and storage of Br- 82 radioactive gas, which allows studying transport and mixing of gases in industrial flotation equipments. The system was applied in the El Teniente mine for the characterization of the gas phase in 130 m 3 cells. The gas tracer enabled confirming that there is no gas dragging to the tails in large self-priming cells, and that inner gas recirculation is minimal. The mean gas concentration observed in the cell’s upper zone was of about 14 %. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R
40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} {{solar panels}} on the International Space Station (ISS) track the Sun through continuous rotating motion enabled by large bearings {{on the main}} truss called solar array alpha rotary joints (SARJs). In late 2007, shortly after installation, the starboard SARJ had become hard to turn {{and had to be}} shut down after exceeding drive current safety limits. The port SARJ, of the same design, had been working well for over 2 years. An exhaustive failure investigation ensued that included multiple extravehicular activities to collect information and samples for engineering forensics, detailed structural and thermal analyses, and a careful review of the build records. The ultimate root cause was determined to be kinematic design vulnerability coupled with inadequate lubrication, and manufacturing flaws; this was corroborated through ground tests, <b>metallurgical</b> studies, and <b>modeling.</b> A highly successful recovery plan was developed and implemented that included replacing worn and damaged components in orbit and applying space-compatible grease to improve lubrication. Beyond the technical aspects, however, lie several key programmatic lessons learned. These lessons, such as running ground tests to intentional failure to experimentally verify failure modes, are reviewed and discussed so they can be applied to future projects to avoid such problems...|$|R
40|$|Spray forming is a {{relatively}} new manufacturing process for near net shape preforms {{in a wide variety of}} alloys. Spray formed materials have a characteristic equiaxed microstructure with small grain sizes, low levels of solute partitioning, and inhibited coarsening of secondary phases. After consolidation to full density, spray formed materials have consistently shown properties superior to conventionally cast materials, and comparable to powder metallurgy equivalents. The reduction of processing steps for spray forming in comparison with powder metallurgy and conventional cast/forge routes offers potential economic advantages. However, serious economic barriers to the widespread commercialisation of spray forming remain. These include the high cost of inert gases for atomization, significant losses from overspray, bounce-off and machining, poor process reproducibility and problems of implementing robust on-line control for <b>metallurgical</b> quality. Extensive <b>model</b> experiments with process monitoring and numerical simulation have been used to understand the underlying process physics and the development of preform shape and microstructure in an effort to enable full process control and so reduce losses. However, despite considerable progress, the cost of spray forming has not yet reduced significantly to compete broadly with existing technologies. © 1995...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of Response Surface Methodology {{as a way}} to model multiple responses of a process while changing multiple variables in one study, and its application for optimization of the process, has been successfully applied in the chemical and mining industries. A small amount of required tests combined with the capability to make predictions from the obtained models make the methodology attractive for the use in several stages of a concentrator plant: from design and sizing of equipment to continuous improvement on mature operations. This thesis was developed with the aim to evaluate the applicability of Response Surface Methodology as a tool to perform <b>metallurgical</b> process <b>modelling</b> and optimization on site operations. The proposed methodology was selected due to its flexibility in the selection of multiple variables and responses at once, which allowed gathering sufficient data from a total of 20 batch flotation experiments for copper rougher flotation where pH, collector and depressant dosages were varied to provoke changes in the responses of copper recovery and grade, iron and nickel recoveries. The obtained results were utilized for the generation of four regression models from which contour line and surface plots were generated for an optimization and determination of feasible region by superimposition of contours. The optimal set-points were determined at values for pH of 10. 5, collector dosage of 26 g/t and depressant dosage of 65 g/t. The accuracy of the prediction for the optimal point was assessed with a series of three confirmation tests with such values kept constant. The result for copper recovery was 82. 5 %, deviating - 2. 4 % from the predicted point. For copper grade the result was 9. 16 %, deviating + 0. 56 % from prediction. For iron recovery the result was 6. 4 %, deviating 0. 1 % from prediction. For nickel recovery the result was 38. 8 %, with a deviation of + 8. 4 from the prediction. In comparison to base-case settings, the optimal point represents comparable relative costs of reagents with expected improvement in results with a particular focus on increased copper recovery by 2 % on average. It was concluded that the methodology is worth exploring further in the different stages of process design, commissioning and working processes. It was demonstrated that with as few as 20 tests it was possible to obtain relevant models and their surface plots, which helped to make a decision for the selection of a new optimal, according to process requirements. It is advised that a future expansion in the methodology for future studies would be for the inclusion of variable screening...|$|R
