40|$|Powder Metallurgy (PM) is a net- {{shape and}} cost {{effective}} technology {{used for the}} production of steel parts having good mechanical properties and geometrical precision. In the conventional press and sinter process, the voids among the powder particles cannot be completely eliminated, and the as sintered microstructure contains a certain amount of residual porosity. Mechanical properties are consequently lower than those of the corresponding wrought steels [1]. In particular, the fatigue resistance is significantly affected by porosity; crack tends to nucleate in correspondence of clusters of pores, and to propagate along the network of interconnected pores [2, 3]. Fatigue resistance can be improved on increasing the density, reducing pore size and pore clustering and enlarging the sintered ligaments between pore, or, similarly to wrought steels, by thermochemical (carburizing and nitriding) or mechanical treatments (shot peening). Carburizing consists in a surface carbon enrichment, which gradually decreases towards the core. After quenching high carbon martensite is formed at the surface, characterized by high hardness and a compressive residual stresses suitable for wear and fatigue resistance. Low pressure carburizing is a variant of the conventional gas carburizing performed under sub-atmospheric pressure with pressurized gas quenching. It is quite attractive for carburized PM sintered steels, for two main reasons. 1. Porosity increases the surface exchange area, enhancing the risk of oxidation mainly in Cr and Cr-Mn steels. Low pressure carburizing uses propane or acetylene, as carburizing gas, which does not contain oxidizing agents. 2. <b>Quenching</b> <b>oil</b> remains entrapped in the open porosity, and has to be eliminated. The possibility to combine low pressure carburizing with gas quenching results in clean parts as well as lower distortion. However, the combination between the very high carburizing potential of LPC and the large surface area of porous steels results in overcarburizing, with the precipitation of grain boundary carbides in Cr steels, and the formation of retained austenite in the case in Cr free ones [4, 5]. This problem can be solved by either increasing density, to close the residual porosity, or rolling and shot peening, to eliminate the surface porosity. Nitriding is based on the nitrogen enrichment of the surface layers of steel. On the base of nitrogen content the surface microstructure can be divided in two zones: the compound and the diffusion layer. The former is in principle a ceramic layer, whilst the latter consists in the base matrix hardened by solid solution and by the precipitation of nitrides. The nitride precipitation induces a compressive residual stress field which offers a resistance to the nucleation and propagation of the fatigue crack, improving the fatigue resistance. In order to obtain a hardened and deep diffusion layer the steel has to contain alloying elements with a high affinity for nitrogen, as chromium and molybdenum. Nickel and manganese have a negligible interaction with nitrogen. Among the different nitriding processes, plasma nitriding is recommended for sintered steel. Plasma nitriding is less sensitive to porosity than gas nitriding due to the particular mechanism of nitrogen diffusion (volume diffusion) which allows a uniform diffusion front on the steel surface and a homogeneous nitrogen distribution [6, 7]. Therefore, a preliminary surface densification is not necessary. Shot peening is a flexible and cost effective solution to improve the fatigue performances of mechanical parts, as gears and springs, thanks to the compressive residual stress generated below the surface and the surface work hardening. The improvement in fatigue resistance is more effective if shot peening is applied on case hardened steels, because of the more stability of the compressive residual stresses. Since the fatigue strength of sintered steels strongly depends on the material density, shot peening is a useful technique to improve such property, owing to the densification of the surface layer [8, 9]. The fatigue cracks nucleates beneath this layer and since it cannot propagate in a compression field, it moves towards the core.

This work focuses on the effects of carburization process on the mechanical properties of carburized mild steel, at constant temperature, 850 °C with different time, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours and <b>quenched</b> in <b>oil.</b> The objectives of this project are to study the influence of carburization process for mild steel and to study the material performance after carburization process. After carburization process, the test samples were subjected to standard test and form the data obtained, ultimate tensile strength and Young’s modulus were calculated. The case hardness of the carburized samples were measure. It was observed that the mechanical properties of mild steels were found to be strongly influenced by the process of carburization. It was conclude that the sample carburized at 850 °C soaked for four hours followed by <b>oil</b> <b>quenching</b> were better because they showed the higher ultimate tensile strength at 541. 41096 MPa...|$|R

40|$|Malleable iron {{lost the}} {{interest}} and the development stopped in the turbulent seventies of tremendous developments of new technologies. The personal computer, emission spectrometer, thermal analysis, cold-box core system and automatic vertical moulding were introduced into the foundry industry. Experience shows that these new technologies do not always match up with malleable iron. Solidification and mould filling simulation programs are not always capable to handle a low carbon equivalent iron like malleable iron. Recent developments show however by using these new technologies and combined with practical experience, {{it is possible to}} increase the casting yield of malleable iron to the same level as ductile iron. The mechanical properties, especially the yield strength of malleable iron according to the standard are equivalent to those of ductile iron, however the yield strength of <b>oil</b> <b>quenched</b> malleable iron is significantly higher than that of ductile iron. An extensive investigation is made between ductile iron, air <b>quenched</b> and <b>oil</b> <b>quenched</b> malleable irons based on the properties of more than 350 test bars produced under the same conditions. The results are compared with the existing international standards and discussed. Other properties like fatigue strength and response to surface treatments as induction hardening are also discussed. The costs of malleable iron are reviewed and compared with other ferro alloys. These recent developments in increasing the casting yield, the understanding of the strength, makes malleable iron competitive with ductile iron and cheaper than the first grade of ausferritic ductile iron, or steel qualities. It is possible to design lighter and save weight which is essential in the automotive industry. An example of “green cast” development for typical applications, used in automotive transmissions and engines are shown...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of controlling parameters in carburization, there has been relatively little work on process variables during the surface hardening process. This work focuses on the effects of the carburizing temperature and time on the mechanical properties of mild steel carburized with activated carbon, at 850, 900 and 950 °C, soaked at the carburizing temperature for 15 and 30 minutes, <b>quenched</b> in <b>oil,</b> tempered at 550 °C and held for 60 minutes. Prior carburization process, standard test samples were prepared from the as received specimen for tensile and impact tests. After carburization process, the test samples were subjected to the standard test and from the data obtained, ultimate tensile strength, engineering strain, impact strength, Youngs’ moduli were calculated. The case and core hardness of the carburized tempered samples were measured. It was observed that the mechanical properties of mild steels were found to be strongly influenced by the process of carburization, carburizing temperature and soaking time at carburizing temperature. It was concluded that the optimum combination of mechanical properties is achieved at the carburizing temperature of 900 °C followed by <b>oil</b> <b>quenching</b> and tempering at 550 °C...|$|R
