40|$|Background Commercially {{available}} convenience rice such as retorted, <b>quick</b> cooking or <b>frozen</b> rice {{suffers from}} sensory deficiencies compared to home cooked rice. The mechanisms causing deterioration in texture and flavour during convenience rice processing are, in many cases, poorly understood. Scope and approach This review describes pre-cooking methods including washing and soaking, cooking methods including cooking in excess water, by absorption and by high pressure, and post-cooking technologies including cooling, freezing, retorting, canning, drying and storage, {{as well as}} the influence of each process on physical properties and sensory attributes of cooked rice. Key findings and conclusions Water diffusion and starch leaching, which occur in many processing steps, are important factors affecting cooked rice quality. Soaking saves energy by reducing cooking time. Cooking by absorption increases stickiness, but does not ensure uniform moisture distribution compared to cooking in excess water, thus is not applicable for rice manufacturers. Amylose leaching during soaking and cooking affects hardness and stickiness of cooked rice significantly. Non-thermal treatments such as high pressure soaking and cooking have potential to improve rice sensory properties compared to high temperature treatments, which change colour and flavour of convenience rice. Drying and freezing results in a porous structure resulting in spongy texture after rehydration and thawing, respectively. During storage, starch retrogradation deteriorates texture, but can be retarded by high pressure processing or storage below the glass transition temperature. Much is known about processing factors that affect freshly cooked rice, but more substantial knowledge of how processing steps affect the structure property relationships and sensory properties of convenience rice will assist manufacturers to specifically design products to meet the ever growing consumer demands for convenience food...|$|R

50|$|Raspberries {{are grown}} for the fresh fruit market and for {{commercial}} processing into individually <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> (IQF) fruit, purée, juice, or as dried fruit {{used in a}} variety of grocery products. Traditionally, raspberries were a midsummer crop, but with new technology, cultivars, and transportation, they can now be obtained year-round. Raspberries need ample sun and water for optimal development. Raspberries thrive in well-drained soil with a pH between 6 and 7 with ample organic matter to assist in retaining water. While moisture is essential, wet and heavy soils or excess irrigation can bring on Phytophthora root rot, {{which is one of the}} most serious pest problems facing the red raspberry. As a cultivated plant in moist, temperate regions, it is easy to grow and has a tendency to spread unless pruned.

30|$|The {{moisture}} {{retention capacity}} of phosphates could improve the weight and volume of CSB significantly, while the hardness of steamed bread was reduced as the water absorption increased [55]. Besides, the leaven function was enhanced due to the sequestration of minerals and enhanced protein–starch interactions caused {{by the addition of}} phosphates [56]. It has been reported that the phosphate also contributed to the whiteness of steamed bread, which mainly due to a more intense and uniform crumb was formed after the addition of phosphate [57]. Phosphates are commonly used in the quality improvement of <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> foods. <b>Quick</b> <b>frozen</b> dumplings accounts for 33 % of the total <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> foods in China [58], however, the common problems, such as frost cracking, outflow of stuffing juice, sticky texture, poor elasticity, browning and cooking loss, appeared in the practical production retarded its industrialization [59]. Therefore, phosphates were used as additives to alleviate the above-mentioned challenges in production. Phosphates added in frozen dumplings gave cracking resistance and good appearance for frozen dumplings due to their water-holding capacity, in which STPP showed the best performance in all the applied phosphates [59]. For the browning inhibiting, the function of phosphates can be explained in two ways. First, the enzymatic browning was delayed by the sequestering of metal ions [60]. Second, the water-holding rate was increased by the phosphates, which prevented the browning reaction caused by the outflow of stuffing [61].|$|E

40|$|Abstract We {{started to}} use virtual slide (VS) and virtual {{microscopy}} (VM) systems for <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> intra-operative telepathology diagnosis in Kyoto, Japan. In {{the system we}} used a digital slide scanner, VASSALO by CLARO Inc., and a broadband optic fibre provided by NTT West Japan Inc. with the best effort capacity of 100 Mbps. The client is the pathology laboratory of Yamashiro Public hospital, {{one of the local}} centre hospitals located in the south of Kyoto Prefecture, where a fulltime pathologist is not present. The client is connected by VPN to the telepathology centre of our institute located in central Kyoto. As a result of the recent 15 test cases of VS telepathology diagnosis, including cases judging negative or positive surgical margins, we could estimate the usefulness of VS in intra-operative remote diagnosis. The time required for the frozen section VS file making was found to be around 10 min when we use × 10 objective and if the maximal dimension of the frozen sample is less than 20 mm. Good correct focus of VS images was attained in all cases and all the fields of each tissue specimen. Up to now the capacity of best effort B-band appears to be sufficient to attain diagnosis on time in intra-operation. Telepathology diagnosis was achieved within 5 minutes in most cases using VS viewer provided by CLARO Inc. The VS telepathology system was found to be superior to the conventional still image telepathology system using a robotic microscope since in the former we can observe much greater image information than in the latter in a certain limited time of intra-operation and in the much more efficient ways. In the near future VS telepathology will replace conventional still image telepathology with a robotic microscope even in <b>quick</b> <b>frozen</b> intra-operative diagnosis. </p...|$|E
