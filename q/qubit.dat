40|$|A {{suitable}} {{method to}} characterize the stability of pairwise entanglement in quantum computation was introduced by considering the echo of an initially maximally entangled pair of <b>qubits.</b> A forward-backward evolution of an initial state in which two <b>qubits</b> are in a maximally entangled Bell state was performed. It was shown that noise destroys the entanglement {{of a pair of}} <b>qubits</b> and produces entanglement between these two <b>qubits</b> and the other <b>qubits</b> of the quantum computer.

40|$|If we {{distribute}} n <b>qubits</b> {{between two}} parties, which quantum pure states and distributions of <b>qubits</b> would allow all-versus-nothing (or Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like) proofs of Bell's theorem using only single-qubit measurements? We show a necessary and sufficient {{condition for the}} existence of these proofs for any number of <b>qubits,</b> and provide all distinct proofs up to n= 7 <b>qubits.</b> Remarkably, there is only one distribution of a state of n= 4 <b>qubits,</b> and six distributions, each for a different state of n= 6 <b>qubits,</b> which allow these proofs.

5000|$|The {{algorithm}} {{operates on}} {{an array of}} equally (and independently) biased <b>qubits.</b> After the algorithm transfers heat (and entropy) from some <b>qubits</b> to the others, the resulting <b>qubits</b> are rearranged in increasing order of bias. Then this array {{is divided into two}} sub-arrays: [...] "cold" [...] <b>qubits</b> (with bias exceeding a certain threshold chosen by the user) and [...] "hot" [...] <b>qubits</b> (with bias lower than that threshold).

25|$|Quantum-enhanced machine {{learning}} refers to quantum algorithms that solve tasks in {{machine learning}}, thereby improving a classical machine learning method. Such algorithms typically require one to encode the given classical dataset into a quantum computer, {{so as to}} make it accessible for quantum information processing. After this, quantum information processing routines can be applied and the result of the quantum computation is read out by measuring the quantum system. For example, the outcome of the measurement of a <b>qubit</b> could reveal the result of a binary classification task. While many proposals of quantum machine learning algorithms are still purely theoretical and require a full-scale universal quantum computer to be tested, others have been implemented on small-scale or special purpose quantum devices.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} scheme to realize quantum {{networking}} of superconducting <b>qubits</b> based on the opto-mechanical interface. The superconducting <b>qubits</b> interact with the microwave photons, which then couple to the optical photons through the opto-mechanical interface. The interface generates a quantum link between superconducting <b>qubits</b> and optical flying <b>qubits</b> with tunable pulse shapes and carrier frequencies, enabling transmission of quantum information to other superconducting or atomic <b>qubits.</b> We show that the scheme works under realistic experimental conditions and it also provides a way for fast initialization of the superconducting <b>qubits</b> under 1 K instead of 20 mK operation temperature.

40|$|First, {{we present}} a Bell type {{inequality}} for n <b>qubits,</b> assuming that m out of the n <b>qubits</b> are independent. Quantum mechanics violates this inequality by a ratio that increases exponentially with m. Hence an experiment on n <b>qubits</b> violating of this inequality sets a lower bound on the number m of entangled <b>qubits.</b> Next, we propose a definition of maximally entangled states of n <b>qubits.</b> For this purpose we study 5 different criteria. Four of these criteria are found compatible. For any number n of <b>qubits,</b> they determine an orthogonal basis consisting of maximally entangled states generalizing the Bell states.

40|$|We {{consider}} two entangled accelerating <b>qubits</b> {{coupled with}} real scalar fields, each {{described by the}} Unruh-Wald model.

We also consider three entangled accelerating <b>qubits</b> in GHZ state and in W state, with equal acceleration-frequency ratio, and found that in either state, the tripartite entanglement suddenly dies at a certain value of acceleration-frequency ratio. The equivalence between the Rindler metric and the Schwarzschild metric {{in the vicinity of the}} horizon of a black hole implies that for two entangled <b>qubits</b> outside a black hole, the entanglement suddenly dies when one or both of the <b>qubits</b> are close enough to the horizon, while the three entangled <b>qubits</b> in GHZ or W state, the tripartite entanglement suddenly dies when these <b>qubits</b> are close enough to the horizon...|$|R
