5|$|Rosenberg left a will {{in which}} he {{requested}} that his body be cremated using <b>quicklime.</b> Most of his estate was left to his children; the will stated that his Torah and yad were {{to be given to}} his son Adolph, but this was not done as they remained in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Under the Act, {{regulations}} and rules came into force on 2 December 1802 {{and applied to}} all mills and factories employing three or more apprentices (unless the total workforce was less than twenty). It stated that all mills and factories should be cleaned at least twice yearly with <b>quicklime</b> and water; this included ceilings and walls. There was a requirement that the buildings have sufficient windows and openings for ventilation.|$|E
5|$|The Grand Western Canal ran between Taunton in Somerset and Tiverton in Devon in the United Kingdom. The canal had {{its origins}} in various plans, going back to 1796, to link the Bristol Channel and the English Channel by a canal, {{bypassing}} Lands End. An additional purpose of the canal was the supply of limestone and coal to lime kilns along with {{the removal of the}} resulting <b>quicklime,</b> which was used as a fertiliser and for building houses. This intended canal-link was never completed as planned, as the coming of the railways removed the need for its existence.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century {{good quality}} {{limestone}} {{and a small}} amount of lead ore were quarried in the village. Jasper was mined at Carreg; granite was quarried at Porth y Pistyll; and there was a brickworks at Porth Neigwl. The main source of income, however, was herring fishing. A regular shipping service was operated to Liverpool, exporting pigs, poultry and eggs; the vessels returned laden with coal for the neighbourhood. Limestone was also imported and offloaded into the water at high tide, then collected from the beach when the tide went out. Lime was needed to reduce the acidity of the local soil, and lime kilns were built on the beaches at Porthor, Porth Orion, Porth Meudwy, Aberdaron and Y Rhiw to convert the limestone to <b>quicklime.</b> There was shipbuilding at Porth Neigwl, where the last ship, a sloop named the Ebenezer, was built in 1841; and at Porthor, which came to an end with the building of a schooner, the Sarah, in 1842. Aberdaron's last ship, the sloop Victory, had been built in 1792, and the last ship to come out of Porth Ysgo had been another sloop, the Grace, in 1778.|$|E
5|$|The Ustaše {{used the}} mysterious deaths {{of two of}} their local {{followers}} as a pretext for the killings. The victims were drawn from Gudovac and its surroundings on 28 April. Most were arrested under the guise that they were Serb rebels loyal to the ousted Yugoslav government. They were taken to a nearby field and collectively shot by a firing squad of up to 70 Ustaše guards. Five of the prisoners managed to survive the initial volley and crawled away to safety. The Ustaše forced Gudovac's surviving inhabitants to dig a mass grave for the victims and pour <b>quicklime</b> on the bodies to speed up decomposition. The following day, relatives {{of one of the}} victims informed the Germans of what had transpired. The Germans ordered a partial exhumation of the mass grave, and had 40 suspected perpetrators arrested. Mladen Lorković, a senior Ustaše official, used his influence to have the detained men released and promised German ambassador Siegfried Kasche that the Croatian authorities would carry out a thorough investigation. No investigation took place.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of Greek fire is unknown. It remains {{a matter of}} speculation and debate, with various proposals including combinations of pine resin, naphtha, <b>quicklime,</b> calcium phosphide, sulfur, or niter.|$|E
25|$|Young made {{significant}} discoveries in rustproofing ships in 1872, which were later {{adopted by the}} Royal Navy. Noticing that bilge water was acidic, he suggested that <b>quicklime</b> {{could be used to}} prevent it corroding iron ships.|$|E
25|$|Calcium oxide (<b>quicklime)</b> will absorb CO2 from {{atmospheric}} air mixed with steam at 400°C (forming calcium carbonate) and release it at 1,000°C. This process, proposed by A. Steinfeld, {{can be performed}} using renewable energy from thermal concentrated solar power.|$|E
25|$|The sodium {{bicarbonate}} (NaHCO3) that precipitates out in reaction (I) is filtered {{out from the}} hot ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) solution, and the solution is then reacted with the <b>quicklime</b> (calcium oxide (CaO)) left over from heating the limestone in step (II).|$|E
25|$|At first, Petiot {{dumped the}} {{bodies in the}} Seine, but he later {{destroyed}} the bodies by submerging them in <b>quicklime</b> or incinerating them. In 1941, Petiot bought a house at 21 Rue le Sueur. He purchased the house the same week that Henri Lafont returned to Paris with money and permission from the Abwehr to recruit new members for the French Gestapo.|$|E
25|$|In 1817, bare flame gaslight had {{replaced}} the former candles and oil lamps that lighted the Covent Garden stage. This was an improvement, but in 1837 Macready employed limelight in the theatre for the first time, during a performance of a pantomime, Peeping Tom of Coventry. Limelight used a block of <b>quicklime</b> heated by an oxygen and hydrogen flame. This allowed the use of spotlights to highlight performers on the stage.|$|E
25|$|Casement's {{body was}} buried in <b>quicklime</b> in the prison {{cemetery}} {{at the rear of}} Pentonville Prison, where he was hanged. During the decades after his execution, many formal requests for repatriation of Casement's remains were refused by British Governments. Finally, in 1965 Casement's remains were repatriated to the Republic of Ireland. Despite the annulment/withdrawal of his knighthood in 1916, the 1965 UK Cabinet record of the repatriation decision refers to him as Sir Roger Casement.|$|E
25|$|The {{burning of}} harder, older {{anthracite}} and bituminous coal typically produces Class F fly ash. This fly ash is pozzolanic in nature, and contains less than 7% lime (CaO). Possessing pozzolanic properties, the glassy silica and alumina of Class F fly ash requires a cementing agent, such as Portland cement, <b>quicklime,</b> or hydrated lime—mixed {{with water to}} react and produce cementitious compounds. Alternatively, adding a chemical activator such as sodium silicate (water glass) to a Class F ash can form a geopolymer.|$|E
25|$|Dornford Yates, {{a novelist}} {{who was a}} junior {{barrister}} at the trial, records that the remains were placed in lime {{so that they would}} be destroyed, but suggests that Crippen failed to realize that while dry <b>quicklime</b> destroys, if water is added, it becomes slaked lime and preserves. Yates used this fact in the plot of his novel The House That Berry Built and told the story of the trial from his viewpoint in his memoirs As Berry and I Were Saying.|$|E
25|$|A second view, {{based on}} the fact that Greek fire was inextinguishable by water (some sources suggest that water {{intensified}} the flames) suggested that its destructive power was the result of the explosive reaction between water and <b>quicklime.</b> Although <b>quicklime</b> was certainly known and used by the Byzantines and the Arabs in warfare, the theory is refuted by literary and empirical evidence. A quicklime-based substance would have to come in contact with water to ignite, while Emperor Leo's Tactica indicate that Greek fire was often poured directly on the decks of enemy ships, although admittedly, decks were kept wet due to lack of sealants. Likewise, Leo describes the use of grenades, which further reinforces the view that contact with water was not necessary for the substance's ignition. Furthermore, C. Zenghelis pointed out that, based on experiments, the actual result of the water–quicklime reaction would be negligible in the open sea. Another similar proposition suggested that Kallinikos had in fact discovered calcium phosphide, which can be made by boiling bones in urine within a sealed vessel. On contact with water, calcium phosphide releases phosphine, which ignites spontaneously. However, extensive experiments with it also failed to reproduce the described intensity of Greek fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{byproduct of}} the Solvay process is calcium chloride (CaCl2) in aqueous solution. The process has other waste and byproducts as well. Not all of the limestone that is calcined is converted to <b>quicklime</b> and carbon dioxide (in reaction II); the residual calcium carbonate and other components of the limestone become wastes. In addition, the salt brine used by the process is usually purified to remove magnesium and calcium ions, typically to form carbonates; otherwise, these impurities would lead to scale in the various reaction vessels and towers. These carbonates are additional waste products.|$|E
25|$|Sulfur sticks are burnt {{to detect}} small leaks in {{industrial}} ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities {{can be detected}} by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with <b>quicklime,</b> when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent. Ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration; the permissible exposure limit is 25ppm, and lethal above 500ppm. Higher concentrations are hardly detected by conventional detectors, the type of detector is chosen according to the sensitivity required (e.g. semiconductor, catalytic, electrochemical). Holographic sensors have been proposed for detecting concentrations up to 12.5% in volume.|$|E
25|$|Calcination of {{limestone}} using charcoal fires to produce <b>quicklime</b> has been practiced since antiquity by cultures {{all over the}} world. The temperature at which limestone yields calcium oxide is usually given as 825°C, but stating an absolute threshold is misleading. Calcium carbonate exists in equilibrium with calcium oxide and carbon dioxide at any temperature. At each temperature there is a partial pressure of carbon dioxide that is in equilibrium with calcium carbonate. At room temperature the equilibrium overwhelmingly favors calcium carbonate, because the equilibrium CO2 pressure is {{only a tiny fraction}} of the partial CO2 pressure in air, which is about 0.035 kPa.|$|E
25|$|Most {{victims were}} buried in Gacy's crawl space, where he would {{periodically}} pour <b>quicklime</b> to hasten the decomposition of the bodies. In January 1979, {{he had planned to}} further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete. Gacy stated he had lost count of the number of victims buried in his crawl space and had initially considered stowing bodies in his attic before opting to dispose of his victims off the I-55 bridge into the Des Plaines River. Thus the final five victims—all killed in 1978—were disposed of in this manner: because his crawl space was full.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the San Martinian Society {{requested}} to fence the monument {{after it was}} repeatedly vandalized. The request was dismissed by the city council, that considered that it would affect the aesthetics of the monument. In 2012, the municipal government of Neuquén made renewals on the monument. The Public Buildings and Transit Secretariat replaced the <b>quicklime</b> tiles of the roundabout for porphyr ones, that formed a sun-and-star shape. The National University of Comahue {{was in charge of}} the new illumination of the monument. On each of the twelve pointers of the star, metal cilynders were built to house lights that pointed toward the pedestal. Additional reflectors were placed on the top of the base to illuminate the statue.|$|E
25|$|Annery limekiln has a ramp {{facing the}} river, three kilns (or burning 'pots'), seven {{entrance}} doorways and nine lower apertures {{for the removal}} of the calcined limestone. The arrangement of the kilns gives an L-shaped compact structure. Some of the entrances led to arched lobbies or 'eyes', at the back of which were the grates and separate 'poking holes' to insert metals rods for 'working' the charge and helping with aeration. A 'lean-to' slated roof may have slotted beneath part of the drip course of projecting stones, which runs around the exterior walls of the kiln. The arched entrances to the kiln allowed for the sheltered and safe collection of the <b>quicklime,</b> which reacted violently to water.|$|E
25|$|Gibraltar's first tunnels were {{constructed}} by {{hand in a}} slow, backbreaking but remarkably long-lasting method of excavation. The first task was to fragment the limestone rock. This was done by {{using a variety of}} methods, including gunpowder blasting, fire setting (building a fire against the face of the rock to heat it, then quenching it with cold water to cause it to shatter), <b>quicklime</b> (used to fill boreholes which were then slaked with water, causing it to expand and so shattering the surrounding rock) and hammering in wooden wedges which were expanded by soaking them with water, again causing the rock to shatter. The fragments were then removed with crowbars and sledgehammers.|$|E
25|$|Portland cement {{is by far}} {{the most}} common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating {{limestone}} (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as clay) to 1450°C in a kiln, in a process known as calcination, whereby a molecule of carbon dioxide is liberated from the calcium carbonate to form calcium oxide, or <b>quicklime,</b> which then chemically combines with the other materials that have been included in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make 'ordinary Portland cement', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC).|$|E
25|$|The Walsh Brothers, Thomas and John, {{moved to}} Kobe {{as soon as}} the port opened and {{established}} a branch of their trading business Walsh and Co. (later Walsh, Hall, and Co.). Walsh, Hall, and Co. purchased cotton, which was at the time used in the West to make paper, in Japan and then sold it abroad. They then used <b>quicklime</b> to harden the cotton before exporting it, but the traces of lime in the cotton afterwards would heat up when exposed to water, in a chemical reaction that frequently caused fires. Walsh, Hall, and Co. then switched to exporting the cotton as pulp, which brought in great profits. The Walsh Brothers also established the Kobe Paper Mill (the future Mitsubishi Paper Mills) in Sannomiya, thereby extending their reach into paper production as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notorious}} {{criminal}} {{of the period}} (aside from the Nazis and their collaborators) was Doctor Marcel Petiot. Petiot purchased a house at 21 rue Le Sueur in the 16th arrondissement, and {{under the name of}} Docteur Eugène, pretended to be the head of a Resistance network that smuggled Jews from France to Argentina. He collected a large advance from his clients and then instructed them to come to his house, bringing their gold, silver and other valuables with them. After they arrived, he brought them to his consulting room, and, convincing them vaccination was required in order to enter Argentina, gave them a lethal intravenous injection, then watched their slow death in an adjacent room through a spyhole in the door. Afterwards, he cut up their bodies, put the pieces in the well, and dissolved them with <b>quicklime.</b> His activities attracted the attention of the Gestapo, which arrested him in 1943, thus allowing him to claim later that he had been a real member of the Resistance. His crimes were discovered after the Liberation in 1944, and he was charged with the murders of twenty-seven persons, tried in 1946, and sentenced to death. He went to the guillotine on May 25, 1946. The gold, silver and other valuables were not found when he was arrested. In search of the treasure, the house was carefully demolished in 1966, but no trace of it was ever found.|$|E
25|$|The {{rescue work}} was {{hampered}} {{both by the}} level of destruction and by the weather – temperatures were unusually high for the time of year, reaching 104 degrees F (40 deg C) in the shade. Rapid putrefaction {{of the thousands of}} corpses created a foul and unhealthy atmosphere, and adherence to the Ramadan fast caused further strain on rescue workers. Many victims also refused medical treatment, believing that to accept it would constitute breaking their fast. Rescue workers were equipped with gas masks, and <b>quicklime</b> was spread over areas where rescue was considered hopeless, to destroy the rotting corpses – the risk of killing buried survivors as well being accepted. Disinfectant and DDT were sprayed over the ruins from lorries and helicopters to control disease and kill the swarms of flies which were attracted to the scene. The ruins also became infested by rats from the destroyed sewer network and rat poison was spread to kill them; larger animals, such as stray dogs and cats which fed on the human corpses, were shot. Looters were also attracted to the destruction; they were shot on sight and their bodies dumped in mass graves along with those of the victims. These measures were viewed as callous and brutal by those remote from the scene, but given the scale of the destruction and the rapid infestation of the ruins by potential carriers of disease, drastic measures were necessary in order to prevent still further loss of life from epidemic.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. Sometimes she would wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform her sleeping victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with <b>quicklime.</b> Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E
500|$|The 15th-century {{engineer}} Taccola recommended <b>quicklime,</b> [...] {{although its}} use {{went back to}} ancient times, and {{might well have been}} a component of Greek fire. <b>Quicklime</b> reacts violently with water, and can cause blindness and burns. [...] While <b>quicklime</b> was used in some naval battles, it {{does not appear to have}} been standard issue on board ships, due to the danger of the <b>quicklime</b> blowing back and burning the user.|$|E
500|$|According {{to another}} theory, the area {{specialised}} {{in the production}} of <b>quicklime</b> or koli chun [...] (...) and coir or kata [...] (...) hence, it was called Kolikata [...] (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|Explosive devices {{include the}} [...] "flying-sand divine bomb {{releasing}} ten thousand fires", {{which consisted of}} a tube of gunpowder placed in an earthenware pot filled with <b>quicklime,</b> resin, and alcoholic extracts of poisonous plants.|$|E
500|$|Chemical warfare {{had been}} experimented with {{during the early}} period with sulfur, <b>quicklime</b> (calcium oxide), and others, and {{developments}} continued. [...] World War I saw many gases used, including the extremely effective sulfur mustard (mustard gas).|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common thermal projectiles were {{boiling water and}} hot sand, which could be poured over attacking personnel. [...] Other anti-personnel weapons included the use of hot pitch, oil, resin, animal fat and other similar compounds. [...] Smoke was used to confuse or drive off attackers. [...] Substances such as <b>quicklime</b> and sulfur could be toxic and blinding.|$|E
500|$|Kvaternik and the Ustaše never {{attempted}} {{to conceal the}} killings, which were deliberately carried out in a relatively public space so as to cause terror among the Serb population. Local Croats were fully aware of what had transpired. Following the massacre, the Ustaše forced Gudovac's remaining inhabitants to dig a [...] mass grave and cover {{the remains of the}} victims with <b>quicklime</b> to speed up decomposition. Once the dead had been buried, the villagers were permitted to return to their homes.|$|E
500|$|Some thermal weapons (such as <b>quicklime</b> or oil) {{could not}} be {{extinguished}} or eased by water, [...] in which case sand or earth could be used. Wooden structures were frequently soaked in alum to increase their fire resistance. The Romans covered their tortoises (mobile siege sheds) with raw hides packed with vinegar-soaked seaweed or chaff, to serve as protection against regular and incendiary missiles. [...] Throughout the period, sacks or nets might be filled with vinegar-moistened chaff, seaweed or wet moss and hung on the exterior. The wooden siege engines of the Crusaders were vulnerable to attack from the Byzantine and Muslim fire-weapons, so the troops inside siege towers kept stores of water and vinegar.|$|E
500|$|The short drop {{method of}} hanging meant that those {{executed}} {{were killed by}} slow strangulation, and so Turpin was left hanging until late afternoon, before being cut down and taken to a tavern in Castlegate. [...] The next morning, Turpin's body {{was buried in the}} graveyard of St George's Church, Fishergate, opposite what is now the Roman Catholic St George's Church. [...] On the Tuesday following the burial, the corpse was reportedly stolen by body-snatchers. [...] The theft of cadavers for medical research was a common enough occurrence, and was likely tolerated by the authorities in York. [...] The practice was however unpopular with the general public, and the body-snatchers, together with Turpin's corpse, were soon apprehended by a mob. [...] The body was recovered and reburied, supposedly this time with <b>quicklime.</b> [...] Turpin's body is purported to lie in St George's graveyard, although some doubt remains as to the grave's authenticity.|$|E
500|$|Sailors {{that did}} not escape, over 600 of them, were imprisoned on Ilha das Cobras, where João Cândido and {{seventeen}} others were transferred to an isolation cell. Of the eighteen, only two were left alive the next morning—the victim of a heat-producing chemical reaction between <b>quicklime,</b> used to disinfect the cell, and carbon dioxide. On the same day, a steamship named Satelite left Rio de Janeiro for the rubber plantations in the Amazon with over a hundred former sailors and nearly three hundred [...] "vagabonds" [...] on board. Nine were executed by the crew along the way, {{and many of the}} rest died shortly after while working in the hot tropical climate, conditions described by Rui Barbosa as [...] "a place where one only dies." [...] Meanwhile, João Cândido—stricken by hallucinations from his traumatic night—was sentenced to a mental hospital. It took eighteen months before he and nine sailors faced trial for their supposed anti-government actions taken during the December 9–10 revolts; the judges found them not guilty, and all were discharged from the navy.|$|E
