The vector-predictive multi-mode <b>matrix</b> <b>quantization</b> approach is shown to achieve higher quantization accuracy than the conventional approaches at the expense of a modest increase in complexity...|$|R

The MQ scheme, to which we add the embedded property, {{is based on the}} split <b>matrix</b> <b>quantization</b> (SMQ) of the line spectral frequencies (LSFs) [15]. By exploiting the SMQ, both the computational complexity and the memory requirement of the quantization are significantly reduced.

40|$|In current dental practice, x-rays of {{completed}} {{dental work}} are often {{sent to the}} insurer for verification. It is faster and cheaper to transmit instead digital scans of the x-rays. Further economies result if the images are sent in compressed form. DCTune is a technology for optimizing DCT (digital communication technology) <b>quantization</b> <b>matrices</b> to yield maximum perceptual quality for a given bit-rate, or minimum bit-rate for a given perceptual quality. Perceptual optimization of DCT color <b>quantization</b> <b>matrices.</b> In addition, the technology provides a means of setting the perceptual quality of compressed imagery in a systematic way. The purpose of this research was, with respect to dental x-rays, 1) to verify the advantage of DCTune over standard JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group), 2) to verify the quality control feature of DCTune, and 3) to discover regularities in the optimized matrices {{of a set of}} images. We optimized matrices for a total of 20 images at two resolutions (150 and 300 dpi) and four bit-rates (0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1. 0 bits/pixel), and examined structural regularities in the resulting matrices. We also conducted psychophysical studies (1) to discover the DCTune quality level at which the images became 'visually lossless,' and (2) to rate the relative quality of DCTune and standard JPEG images at various bitrates. Results include: (1) At both resolutions, DCTune quality is a linear function of bit-rate. (2) DCTune <b>quantization</b> <b>matrices</b> for all images at all bitrates and resolutions are modeled well by an inverse Gaussian, with parameters of amplitude and width. (3) As bit-rate is varied, optimal values of both amplitude and width covary in an approximately linear fashion. (4) Both amplitude and width vary in systematic and orderly fashion with either bit-rate or DCTune quality; simple mathematical functions serve to describe these relationships. (5) In going from 150 to 300 dpi, amplitude parameters are substantially lower and widths larger at corresponding bit-rates or qualities. (6) Visually lossless compression occurs at a DCTune quality value of about 1. (7) At 0. 25 bits/pixel, comparative ratings give DCTune a substantial advantage over standard JPEG. As visually lossless bit-rates are approached, this advantage of necessity diminishes. We have concluded that DCTune optimized <b>quantization</b> <b>matrices</b> provide better visual quality than standard JPEG. Meaningful quality levels may be specified by means of the DCTune metric. Optimized matrices are very similar across the class of dental x-rays, suggesting the possibility of a 'class-optimal' matrix. DCTune technology appears to provide some value in the context of compressed dental x-rays...|$|R

5000|$|A typical {{video codec}} works by {{breaking}} the picture into discrete blocks (8×8 pixels {{in the case}} of MPEG).

The <b>quantization</b> <b>matrix</b> is designed to provide more resolution to more perceivable frequency components over less perceivable components (usually lower frequencies over high frequencies) in addition to transforming as many components to 0, which can be encoded with greatest efficiency.
