25|$|Every {{four years}} sees a jump of an {{additional}} day because the four six-hour periods sum to a full day. This is somewhat similar to a solar leap year occurring every 4 years {{to account for the}} four quarter days that accrued at a rate of a <b>quarter</b> <b>day</b> per year.|$|E
25|$|Further {{calendar}} reforms {{occurred during}} the later Sassanid era. Ever since the reforms under Ardashir I {{there had been no}} intercalation. Thus with a <b>quarter</b> <b>day</b> being lost each year, the Zoroastrian holy year had slowly slipped backwards, with Nowruz eventually ending up in July. A great council was therefore convened and it was decided that Nowruz be moved back to the original position it had during the Achaemenid period - back to spring. This change probably took place during the reign of Kavad I in the early 6th century. Much emphasis seems to have been placed during this period on the importance of spring and on its connection with the resurrection and Frashegerd.|$|E
25|$|The front dial has two {{concentric}} circular scales {{that represent}} {{the path of the}} ecliptic through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day Egyptian civil calendar. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the Zodiac, with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the Julian calendar reform, but the Sothic and Callippic cycles had already pointed to a 365Â¼-day solar year, as seen in Ptolemy III's abortive calendrical reform of 238. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed leap day (Epag. 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra <b>quarter</b> <b>day</b> in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.|$|E

5000|$|Scottish {{term and}} <b>quarter</b> <b>days</b> are the four {{divisions}} of the legal year, historically used as the days when contracts and leases would begin and end, servants would be hired or dismissed, and rent, interest on loans, and ministers' stipends would become due. The Term Days are Whitsunday and Martinmas, and together with Candlemas and Lammas they constitute the <b>Quarter</b> <b>Days.</b> Although they were fixed by the Term and <b>Quarter</b> <b>Days</b> (Scotland) Act 1990 as falling on the 28th day every three months, they originally occurred on holy days, corresponding roughly to old <b>quarter</b> <b>days</b> used in both Scotland and Ireland, thus: ...|$|R

50|$|The Term and <b>Quarter</b> <b>Days</b> (Scotland) Act 1990 is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom which {{defined the}} dates of the Scottish Term and <b>Quarter</b> <b>Days.</b> These are {{customary}} divisions of the legal year when contracts traditionally begin and end and payments are due. It received Royal Assent on 13 July 1990 and immediate commencement, with {{the dates of}} the days changing twelve months later.

60|$|I {{was at a}} farm-house {{once when}} some high holiday was being celebrated. I don't {{remember}} what the occasion was, {{but it was something}} festive, a May Day or <b>Quarter</b> <b>Day,</b> or something of that sort, and they put a garland of flowers round the head of one of the cows. Well, that absurd quadruped went about all day as perky as a schoolgirl in a new frock; and when they took the wreath off she became quite sulky, and they had to put it on again before she would stand still to be milked. This is not a Percy anecdote. It is plain, sober truth.|$|E
60|$|Before {{many months}} had elapsed a great bustling street {{passed through the}} very centre of the Webber garden, just where Wolfert had dreamed of finding a treasure. His golden dream was accomplished; he did indeed find an unlooked-for source of wealth; for, when his {{paternal}} lands were distributed into building lots, and rented out to safe tenants, instead of producing a paltry crop of cabbages, they returned him an abundant crop of rents; insomuch that on <b>quarter</b> <b>day,</b> it was a goodly sight to see his tenants rapping at his door, from morning to night, each with a little round-bellied bag of money, the golden produce of the soil.|$|E
60|$|The Mr Tite Barnacle who at {{the period}} now in {{question}} usually coached or crammed the statesman {{at the head of}} the Circumlocution Office, when that noble or right honourable individual sat a little uneasily in his saddle by reason of some vagabond making a tilt at him in a newspaper, was more flush of blood than money. As a Barnacle he had his place, which was a snug thing enough; and as a Barnacle he had of course put in his son Barnacle Junior in the office. But he had intermarried with a branch of the Stiltstalkings, who were also better endowed in a sanguineous point of view than with real or personal property, and of this marriage there had been issue, Barnacle junior and three young ladies. What with the patrician requirements of Barnacle junior, the three young ladies, Mrs Tite Barnacle nee Stiltstalking, and himself, Mr Tite Barnacle found the intervals between <b>quarter</b> <b>day</b> and <b>quarter</b> <b>day</b> rather longer than he could have desired; a circumstance which he always attributed to the country's parsimony. For Mr Tite Barnacle, Mr Arthur Clennam made his fifth inquiry one day at the Circumlocution Office; having on previous occasions awaited that gentleman successively in a hall, a glass case, a waiting room, and a fire-proof passage where the Department seemed to keep its wind. On this occasion Mr Barnacle was not engaged, as he had been before, with the noble prodigy {{at the head of the}} Department; but was absent. Barnacle Junior, however, was announced as a lesser star, yet visible above the office horizon.|$|E
