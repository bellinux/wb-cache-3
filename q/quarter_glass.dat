25|$|The Mexican government-owned automaker Vehiculos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of models in Mexico under license from AMC. The made in Mexico vehicles had {{to have at least}} 60% locally sourced parts. The cars came with different trim, interiors than the equivalent AMC-made models. It was sold as the VAM American. In addition to rebadged Concords, VAM developed model was the VAM Lerma that was based on the 2- and 4-door Concord sedan platform with the addition of the AMC Spirit's hatchback and rear design with unique Lerma <b>quarter</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E
2500|$|It {{appeared}} in two versions. At the New York International Auto Show in April 1968 it was red {{with a white}} stripe on the sides that ran across the roof. It also had plain, flush wheel covers, generic all-black tires, a side-mounted exhaust, a ram-air intake hood, integrated roof spoiler and fixed rear side windows (<b>quarter</b> <b>glass)</b> with no support (or [...] "B") pillar.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1975 and 1977, a Buick Special coupe was {{marketed as}} part of the Century model lineup as an entry level vehicle. Called the [...] "Century Special" [...] in Buick literature, the coupe was based on the 2-door {{fastback}} body style but had a special landau roof that covered most of the <b>quarter</b> <b>glass,</b> giving it the appearance of the higher-level formal roof cars. 1976 and 1977 models had a unique body-color header panel.|$|E

5000|$|In 1976, {{the first}} prototypes were shown {{and under the}} new Soviet {{automobile}} numbering system, the car was christened as the GAZ-3101. Visually the vehicle included a completely new fascia, reminiscent of the more muscular fashion of North America, framed by East German built square headlights with water jet washers, a more angular chromed bumper with resin lining, fog lamps suspended below and the trademark [...] "Baleen" [...] grille. At the same time, conservative European influence can also be traced in the new rear panels, with a large tail-light cluster. As a measure of additional security, the fuel tank migrated behind the rear seat from its position under the boot, allowing the spare wheel to occupy its space. From the side, GAZ-24's profile remained, but doors now void of <b>quarter</b> <b>glasses</b> and featured sunken door handles in accordance to new standards of passive safety to pedestrians. Although the traditional chrome door mounted mirrors were retained, a provision was made for internal adjustment.|$|R

On the base GT, it [...] get a front splitter conversion with a GT500 rear spoiler and <b>quarter</b> <b>glass</b> covers. The hood is made of fiberglass to save weight and the Le Mans stripes add some style. A separate wide body conversion with the option of rear-only or full all-around wide body wheel arches is also available to spicy up {{the exterior of the}} 2014 Shelby GT. Among other accessories, Shelby GT front fascia, carbon laminated hood louvers, billet upper grille with Ford running pony emblem and [...] "Powered by Ford" [...] badges on the sides complete the exterior package.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{extensive}} redesign in its 10-year history marked the 1973 Chevelle. Due to concern over proposed Federal rollover standards, convertible and 4-door hardtop models were discontinued, while the 2-door hardtop {{was replaced by}} a pillared coupeâ€”named [...] "Colonnade Hardtop". This body style featured a semi-fastback roofline, frameless door glass and fixed, styled [...] "B" [...] pillars, structurally strong enough to contribute to occupant safety of a roll-over type accident. This move was somewhat controversial with the buying public as hardtops had been a staple of American cars for over 20 years and their presence almost taken for granted. Once the initial surprise was overcome however, the Colonnade models became a huge sales success. The Monte Carlo coupe was the biggest seller of the Chevrolet A-body line, although the bread-and-butter sedans and station wagons also sold well. Distinctive rear <b>quarter</b> <b>glass</b> on 2-door coupes and new side windows with styled center pillars were featured on 4-door models. Rear windows on coupes no longer opened. In addition to the new roofline, front and rear ends looked markedly different this year as 1973 was the year of the federally mandated [...] front bumper, adding to the car's length. Additional new body features were an acoustical double-panel roof, tighter-fitting glass and flush style outside door handles. Wheelbase dimensions were retained; [...] a sporty [...] for coupes and [...] for sedans and station wagons, but bodies were five inches (127mm) [...] longer and an inch wider with a [...] wider wheel track. The station wagon, available in 6 or 9 passenger seating, featured a new counterbalanced liftgate which allowed for easier entry and loading up to 85 cubic feet.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Quarter</b> <b>glass</b> or {{quarter light}} on {{automobiles}} and closed carriages {{may be a}} side window {{in the front door}} or located {{on each side of the}} car just forward of the rear window of the vehicle.

50|$|Broadfield House Glass Museum, Compton Drive, {{was housed}} in a splendid grade II listed {{building}} set in its own grounds and located in the historic Stourbridge <b>Glass</b> <b>Quarter.</b> It had a notable collection of British glass, much of it made locally, from historic 18th century pieces to contemporary works from Britain's leading glass artists.

5000|$|Each round {{starts off}} with a glass filled with beer {{in the middle of}} the table and two people on {{opposite}} ends of the table having a <b>quarter</b> and a <b>glass.</b> Each player shoots his or her <b>quarter</b> at his/her <b>glass</b> until he makes it in, then the player passes the glass to the player to his left. If the player to his left still has a glass as well, the player taps that glass with his, and the player who has been tapped must drink the glass of beer {{in the middle of the}} table, refill it, then make the quarter into his or her glass before she gets tapped again, with play still going around the table. If a player makes his or her first shot, s/he can choose to pass the glass to any player who does not currently have a glass. If there are enough people at the table, the group can add more shot glasses and position them equally spaced around the outside of the circle.|$|R

There are also designs that incorporate two quarter windows (see bottom left image) one {{that is part of}} the door and the second mounted in the roof pillar. This arrangement may help to increase driver visibility. In this case, the <b>quarter</b> <b>glass</b> in the C-pillar would not be called an [...] "opera window". Non-opening, fixed quarter windows are installed like windshields in that they are bonded to the body with urethane.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the only}} year of the 1971-1976 models the Impala had a {{different}} front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two. The rooflines of the Impala coupes were revised. For 1974 the Custom Coupe {{was no longer a}} hardtop, with large fixed rear <b>quarter</b> <b>glass</b> and a thick B-pillar. The Sport Coupe, still a pillar-less hardtop, now used larger roll-down <b>quarter</b> <b>glass</b> like that of the 1971-73 Custom Coupe, and had a narrower, fastback style, flat back window similar to the 1966-68 Caprice coupes. The four-door sedan, four-door hardtop Sports Sedan and station wagons used carryover rooflines from 1973.|$|E
50|$|The main Corona {{brand is}} Corona Extra, a 4.5% alcohol by volume pale lager. It {{is the top}} selling beer from Mexico {{and is one of}} the top five selling beers worldwide. Available in over 150 countries, it is also Mexico's leading export brand. It was first brewed in 1925 by CervecerÃ­a Modelo on the tenth anniversary of the brewery. In 1926 the brewery decided to package the beer in clear <b>glass</b> <b>quarter</b> bottles. In 1997, Corona Extra became the top-selling {{imported}} beer in the United States, surpassing Heineken.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of {{left-hand-drive}} Atkinsons were built for export to mainland Europe in the late 1960s, with pressed-steel cabs bought from Krupp after that company had ceased commercial vehicle production. Most were sold eventually in the U.K., via Comberhill Commercials of Wakefield. A different design of glass-fibre cab, launched in prototype form at the 1966 Commercial Motor Show, and named View-Line, had a deep single-piece main windscreen with wrap-around <b>quarter</b> <b>glasses.</b> The prototype had three separate chrome radiator grilles, but lacked {{the character of the}} exposed radiator models. Thereafter, although the Krupp Cabs, introduced in 1969, and View-Line cabs had concealed radiators, they carried a fibreglass replica of the Atkinson radiator outline with the 'Big A' device centred upon it. Both were available until 1970 and the merger with Seddon. Notable Atkinsons of the era were a fleet of 6x6 gritters built in 1962-73 on the orders of various U.K. highway authorities for use on the motorway network. These had Cummins NHK engines installed, rather than the more popular Gardner power units, due ostensibly to the use of steel in their construction, which didn't suffer salt corrosion to the same degree as the alloy-constructed Gardners. Early examples had AEC engines.From 1968 the standard Mk I glass-fibre clad cab was revised, with stronger ash framing, larger dimensions and wider, deeper windscreens. The traditional Withnell-tubed, exposed radiator was replaced with the more imposing enclosed version, which was concealed behind a glass-fibre shrounded metal grille - again carrying the Knight's Head, circular A logo and additional adornments in the form of engine manufacturer plates.This cab featured on the final Atkinson haulage models, the naming of which originated from an idea by Frank Whalley, the company publicity officer at the time. The most famous of the range were Two-axle tractor units were carried the name 'Borderer'. Three-axle rear-steer tractor units carried the name 'Leader'. Three-axle haulage chassis carried the name 'Searcher'. Four-axle chassis carried the name 'Defender'. Three-axle heavy haulage tractor units carried the name 'Venturer'. The two-axle haulage chassis were never given an official name, but was planned to carry the name 'Raider', although factory grille plates were never produced for this model.|$|R

5000|$|The 1981-1982 compact two-door {{hatchback}} {{version of}} the AMC Eagle was also named a Kammback.

5000|$|While all cars {{built by}} Premier {{themselves}} were four-door sedans, small companies also offered other bodywork, {{mainly in the}} form of estates.

25|$|The Mk III was {{the first}} attempt to improve the basic Spitfire design and {{introduced}} several features which were used on later marks. Powered by a Rolls-Royce RM 2SM, later known as the Merlin XX, developing 1,390hp (1,036kW) due to its two-speed supercharger, the wingspan was reduced to 30ft 6 in (9.3 m) and the area reduced to 220 square feet (20.4 sq m) while the overall length was increased to 30ft 4 in (9.2 m). The strengthened main undercarriage was raked forward two inches, increasing ground stability and had flaps to fully enclose the wheels when retracted. The tailwheel was also made fully retractable. The windscreen was redesigned, with a built-in, internal laminated glass, bulletproof panel and optically flat, laminated <b>glass</b> <b>quarter</b> panels.|$|R
5000|$|In 1842, {{craftsmen}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{formed a}} glass blowers' union that represented workers throughout the region. John Samuels was elected the first president.

The union represented workers who made soda-lime glass (or [...] "green glass"). The new national union slowly disintegrated {{over the following}} <b>quarter</b> century, but <b>glass</b> blowers met again in 1866 and affirmed their affiliation to the Glass Blowers' League and its 1842 constitution.

5000|$|Kyle {{remembered that}} he was born 10 years before Michael Jackson and on the same day, giving him a {{possible}} birth date of August 29, 1948. Genetic testing suggested {{that he may have}} had the surname Powell or Davidson or have relatives with these names. Through hypnosis, he recalled a partial Social Security number 3X5-44-XXXX, consistent with numbers assigned in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana during the 1960s. Hypnosis suggested that Kyle had two or three brothers, whose names or faces he did not remember, but otherwise did not remember any other people from his life. Kyle had memories of Indianapolis as a child, including the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, the Woolworth's on the Circle, and the Indiana Theater showing movies in Cinerama. He remembered Crown Hill Cemetery, although not its name, the Scottish Rite Cathedral, and the White River when [...] "it was mostly just a dumping ground". He also remembered grilled cheese sandwiches for a <b>quarter</b> and <b>glasses</b> of milk for a nickel at the Indiana State Fair. Based on his reactions to the mention of nuns during hypnosis, he may have been raised Catholic and may have attended Catholic schools. Searching through Indianapolis area high school yearbook records came up empty, although records from that era are often incomplete.|$|R

50|$|In 1974, {{the rear}} bumper was {{redesigned}} with shock absorbers {{to meet the}} upgraded standards and new tail lights were featured. The front end was also freshened as in previous years, with a new grille and headlight bezels, a new header panel, and a bumper with a drop down center section. The marker lights moved back up beside the headlamps once again. This was the only year of the 1971-1976 models the Impala had a different front end design than the Caprice Classic, as other years used either a grille insert or previous year Caprice front to distinguish the two.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} method of gameplay {{is that one}} glass is positioned {{in the center of}} the table. Participants take turns attempting to bounce the <b>quarter</b> into the <b>glass.</b> If the shooter succeeds, they pass the glass to anyone at the table, and that person must then chug the beverage and catch the quarter in their teeth. Play then passes to the person on the shooter's left. Should the shooter fail to make the shot, they have the option of passing the quarter to the left, or shooting a second time. If the shooter succeeds on his second shot, he passes the glass as usual. If the shooter fails on their second shot, they must drink the beverage. In either case, the person on their left becomes the next shooter.|$|R

But the Secretary was a vegetarian, and he spoke earnestly of the projected murder over half a raw tomato and three <b>quarters</b> of a <b>glass</b> of tepid water. The old Professor had such slops as suggested a sickening second childhood. And even in this President Sunday preserved his curious predominance of mere mass. For he ate like twenty men; he ate incredibly, with a frightful freshness of appetite, so that it was like watching a sausage factory. Yet continually, when he had swallowed a dozen crumpets or drunk a quart of coffee, he would be found with his great head on one side staring at Syme.|$|R
