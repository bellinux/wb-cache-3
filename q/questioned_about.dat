5|$|During {{the ensuing}} {{assassination}} investigation, suspicion naturally focused on deposed governor Taylor, who fled to Indianapolis, Indiana under the looming threat of indictment. The governor of Indiana refused to extradite Taylor, {{and he was}} thus never <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> {{his knowledge of the}} plot to kill Goebel. Taylor became a successful lawyer in Indiana, and was pardoned in 1909 by Beckham's successor, Republican Augustus E. Willson.|$|E

Senator Sorenson threatens to hold Scully in contempt of Congress.|$|E
50|$|The Beckham Challenge, {{where the}} teams are asked an on-the-buzzer <b>question</b> <b>about</b> David Beckham and his family. The first team to get the answer right gets further bonus questions, similar to University Challenge. This was later changed to having {{separate}} questions for each team. Variants to this round include Sven-Mania (with <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> then-England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson), Rooney-Mania (with <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> Wayne Rooney) and Gaffer-Mania (with <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> football managers in general).|$|R
30|$|Our {{questionnaire}} further included <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{stress and}} motivation. The <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> stress {{were inspired by}} the Norwegian Time Use Study (Rønning 2002) and Thomas and Ganster (1995) (questions 15 and 16), and Hansen and Andersen (2008) (questions 17 and 18). The <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> motivation included <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> intrinsic motivation (<b>questions</b> 19 – 21), taken from the Norwegian formulation used by Kuvaas and Dysvik (2009), and extrinsic motivation (question 22) used by Kuvaas and Dysvik (2011).

40|$|We {{propose a}} unified theory of {{intentions}} as neural processes that integrate representations of states of affairs, actions, and emotional evaluation. We show how this theory provides answers to philosophical <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{the concept of}} intention, psychological <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> human behav-ior, computational <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the relations between belief and action, and neuroscientific <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> how the brain produces actions. Our theory of intention ties together biologically plausible mechanisms for belief, planning, and motor control. The computational feasibility of these mechanisms is shown by a model that simulates psychologically important cases of intention...|$|R
5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson.

On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood, though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen. Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, {{though he did not}} go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience. When <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway. The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.|$|E
5|$|Law {{enforcement}} officials <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> 500 people across several Texas cities, including known sex offenders and Garza's family members, co-workers and ex-boyfriends. They carried out almost 50 polygraph examinations, and they offered a $2,500 reward {{for information about}} her death, which was larger than any amount of money previously offered in a Rio Grande Valley murder case. South Texas businessmen later posted $10,000 of reward money. The priest who heard Garza's last confession, Father John Feit, came under suspicion soon after her disappearance. The 27-year-old priest {{had been at the}} church since completing seminary training in San Antonio.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} open <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{weighing}} matrices. The main <b>question</b> <b>about</b> weighing matrices is their existence: for which values of n and w does there exist a W(n,w)? A {{great deal about}} this is unknown. An equally important but often overlooked <b>question</b> <b>about</b> weighing matrices is their enumeration: for a given n and w, how many W(n,w)'s are there? ...|$|R

5|$|Ruby is then {{seen in a}} {{hospital}} bed, with Kevin by her side. When <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> her experience, {{she says she was}} told by an unnamed group not to say anything. Darlene also refuses to cooperate any further, given the ridicule that she faced after her experiences. Back in Washington, Scully listens to a tape of hypnotic sessions in which Mulder recalls the night his sister vanished. Mulder, meanwhile, sits in a church, crying as he looks at a picture of his sister.|$|E
5|$|Soona {{gives the}} digital {{cassette}} to Mulder at a discreet {{meeting in a}} park. An excited Mulder returns to FBI headquarters, {{only to find that}} the cassette is encrypted. Scully believes the encryption is based on the Navajo language and takes the tape in order to investigate. When Skinner calls Mulder to his office to question him about the tape, Mulder physically attacks him. Scully is brought before an FBI panel led by Skinner and is <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> Mulder's actions. Scully is told that Mulder faces dismissal from the FBI, and that she will suffer a similar punishment if she has lied to them.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed {{upon entering the}} NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in nationally televised hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of the questions from the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation on psychological well-being among healthy participants. In a randomized controlled study, 301 participants completed the same 4 questionnaires on psychopathology. The experimental group additionally answered 21 items of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. The control group answered 19 items on Quality of Life. The experimental group showed a significantly smaller decrease of negative affect compared to the control condition. When analyzing participants with an increase in distress, 80 % were part of the experimental group. For most participants, answering <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide does not affect their mood. A small group of participants did react with some distress to the <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide. As the <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide were administered immediately before the <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> negative affect, the <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide could have worked as a negative mood challenge. Future experimental research should further investigate the effect of <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> suicide among healthy participants, especially on the long term. (aut. ref. ...|$|R
5|$|The Scottish estate {{job offer}} fell through and Mitchell became unemployed. He later stated that {{giving up his}} seat in Parliament had been a {{disastrous}} mistake. He {{spent much of the}} next 10 years trying to get back into Parliament. He applied to several Conservative associations (for example, Bournemouth East in August 1977). But at every selection interview he was <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> his reasons for giving up Aberdeenshire West in 1974. No winnable constituency would adopt him.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} prompted Pakistan {{to ask the}} two Australian {{players to}} appear {{in front of their}} own judicial inquiry into corruption; Australia responded by granting the Pakistanis permission to hold hearings in Australia with full privileges. The players were <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> their accusations against Malik, and whether their dealings with John detracted from their credibility. Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that they were among the leading players in those games.|$|E
5|$|Todd is briefly <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> his {{relationship}} with Dussander, but he manages to convince the police that he knew nothing of the old man's true identity. At the hospital, Dussander hears a group of Neo-Nazis demonstrating outside the hospital; realizing his identity has been hopelessly compromised, he commits suicide by giving himself an air embolism. When French learns {{that the man who}} met Todd at school was not Todd's grandfather but a war criminal, he confronts Todd, who then blackmails him into silence by threatening to accuse him of making inappropriate sexual advances towards him, and to thereby expose him publicly as a homosexual and pederast.|$|E

5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> any {{significant}} signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., intensive care unit) or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E
5|$|David and Millie {{arrive in}} Rome, though {{he keeps his}} ability a secret. After talking, they share a kiss and have sex. They visit the Colosseum, where David meets Griffin (Jamie Bell), another Jumper. A group of Paladins appear, and Griffin casually kills them, then jumps away. David tries to leave with Millie, but he's {{detained}} by Italian police and <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> the deaths.

Rajab was detained and his files and a computer were confiscated. He reported that they blindfolded and handcuffed him and put him {{into the back of a}} vehicle before verbally abusing, beating and threatening to rape him. He claimed that they kicked him when he refused to say that he loved the prime minister. He was taken to a Ministry of Interior detention facility in Adliya, a suburb of Manama. After being briefly <b>questioned</b> <b>about</b> someone he did not know, he was released.|$|E
50|$|The {{participants}} are not asked <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{what is true}} or how things really are. Instead, they are asked <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{what other people think}} is true. As such, a perfectly logical answer may be considered incorrect because it failed to make the survey (e.g.: for the <b>question</b> <b>about</b> Georges, George Jones was a popular country singer, but if his name was not given by at least two people it would be considered wrong).|$|R
50|$|It {{is usually}} helpful to ask oneself <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> the speaker's message. If the {{listener}} is mentally asking <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> {{what is being}} said, {{it is a good}} sign that he/she is actively involved in effective informational listening.|$|R
