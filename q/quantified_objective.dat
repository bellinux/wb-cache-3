Design, Setting, and Participants Individual records were supplied on 302 430 people without initial vascular disease from 68 long-term prospective studies, mostly in Europe and North America. During 2. 79 million person-years of follow-up, there were 8857 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 3928 coronary heart disease [CHD] deaths, 2534 ischemic strokes, 513 hemorrhagic strokes, and 2536 unclassified strokes. Main Outcome Measures Hazard ratios (HRs), adjusted for several conventional factors, were calculated for 1 -SD higher values: 0. 52 loge triglyceride, 15 mg/dL high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), 43 mg/dL non–HDL-C, 29 mg/dL apolipoprotein AI, 29 mg/dL apolipoprotein B, and 33 mg/dL directly measured low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).

However, {{the magnitude of this}} effect on plasma lipoproteins and lipids has not been adequately <b>quantified.</b> <b>Objective</b> To estimate the changes in plasma lipoproteins and triglycerides occurring within 12 months of initiating PI-based antiretroviral therapy among HIV/AIDS afflicted subjects. Methods We included all antiretroviral naïve HIV-infected persons treated at St-Paul's Hospital, British Columbia, Canada, who initiated therapy with protease inhibitor antiretroviral (ARV) drugs between August 1996 and January 2002 and who had at least one plasma lipid measurement. Longitudinal associations between medication use and plasma lipids were estimated using mixed effects models that accounted for repeated measures on the same subjects and were adjusted for age, sex, time dependent CD 4 + T-cell count, and time dependent cumulative use of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and adherence. The cumulative number of prescriptions filled for PIs was considered time dependent. We estimated the changes in the 12 months following any initiation of a PI based regimen. Results A total of 679 eligible subjects were dispensed nucleoside analogues and PI at the initiation of therapy. Over a median 47 months of follow-up (interquartile range (IQR) : 29 – 62), subjects had a median of 3 (IQR: 1 – 6) blood lipid measurements. Twelve months after treatment initiation of PI use, there was an estimated 20 % (95 % confidence interval: 17 % – 24 %) increase in total cholesterol and 22 % (12 % – 33 %) increase in triglycerides. Conclusions Twelve months after treatment initiation with PIs, statistically significant increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides levels were observed in HIV-infected patients under conditions of standard treatment. Our results contribute to the growing body of evidence implicating PIs in the development of blood lipid abnormalities. In conjunction with the predominance or men, high rates of smoking, and aging of the treated HIV-positive population, elevated lipoproteins and triglycerides may mean that patients such as these are at elevated risk for cardiovascular events in the future. </p...|$|E
40|$|Study Design. We {{implemented}} {{a pilot study}} in a growing animal model. The macroscopic permeability of the vertebral endplates was measured. The influence of location, tissue maturity, and fluid flow direction was <b>quantified.</b> <b>Objective.</b> We hypothesized that the macroscopic permeability of vertebral endplate may decrease with maturity of the vertebral segment. of Background Data. The alternation of loading induced by the diurnal cycle generates convective flux into the vertebral segment with the dominant flow path through the vertebral endplates. The alteration of mass transport at the disc-vertebrae interface may interrupt the mechanobiologic balance, and have an effect such as degenerative changes or scoliosis. Methods. A previously validated method for measuring permeability, based on the relaxation pressure caused by a transient-flow rate was used. Three specimens were extracted from each L 1 to L 5 endplate. Seventy-one specimens were frozen, and 64 were stored fresh in a standard culture media. A microscopic analysis completed the biomechanical analysis. Results. At 2, 4, and 6 months, the mean permeability (10 - 14 m 4 /N *s, flow-in/flow-out) of the central zone was respectively: 1. 23 / 1. 66, 1. 03 / 1. 29, and 0. 792 / 1. 00. Laterally, it was 1. 03 / 1. 19, 1. 094 / 1. 001, and 0. 765 / 0. 863. For all groups, cartilage endplate and growth plate were both thinner {{in the center of}} the plate. Weak differences of the vascular network were detected, except for a small increase of vascular density in the central zone. Conclusion. The results from this animal study showed that the central zone of the vertebral endplate was more permeable than the periphery and the flow-out permeability was up to 35 % greater than the flow-in permeability. Increase of permeability with decrease of cartilage thickness was noticed within the same age group.

Although expectations of mild adverse effects have been observed to be independent predictors of reduced motivation to use NRT, adverse effects associated with NRT have not been precisely <b>quantified.</b> <b>Objective</b> A systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of NRT versus inert controls and all observational studies to determine the magnitude of reported adverse effects with NRT. Methods Searches of 10 electronic databases from inception to November 2009 were conducted. Study selection and data extraction were carried out independently in duplicate. RCTs were pooled using a random effects method with Odds Ratio [OR] as the effect measure, while proportions were pooled from observational studies. A meta-regression analysis was applied to examine whether the nicotine patch is associated with different adverse effects from those common to orally administered NRT. Results Ninety-two RCTs involving 32, 185 participants and 28 observational studies involving 145, 205 participants were identified. Pooled RCT evidence of varying NRT formulations found an increased risk of heart palpitations and chest pains (OR 2. 06, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 1. 51 - 2. 82, P < 0. 001); nausea and vomiting (OR 1. 67, 95 % CI 1. 37 - 2. 04, P < 0. 001); gastrointestinal complaints (OR 1. 54, 95 % CI, 1. 25 - 1. 89, P < 0. 001); and insomnia (OR 1. 42, 95 % CI, 1. 21 - 1. 66, P < 0. 001). Pooled evidence specific to the NRT patch found an increase in skin irritations (OR 2. 80, 95 % CO, 2. 28 - 3. 24, P < 0. 001). Orally administered NRT was associated with mouth and throat soreness (OR 1. 87, 95 % CI, 1. 36 - 2. 57, P < 0. 001); mouth ulcers (OR 1. 49, 95 % CI, 1. 05 - 2. 20, P < 0. 001); hiccoughs (OR 7. 68, 95 % CI, 4. 59 - 12. 85, P < 0. 001) and coughing (OR 2. 89, 95 % CI, 1. 92 - 4. 33, P < 0. 001). There was no statistically significant increase in anxiety or depressive symptoms associated with NRT use. Non-comparative observational studies demonstrated the prevalence of these events in a broad population. Conclusion The use of NRT is associated with a variety of side effects.

40|$|Assessment of {{intrinsic}} vulnerability to groundwater contamination takes part in evaluation the groundwater potentiality to contamination risk. However, popular assessment methods estimate vulnerability only qualitatively but not quantitatively. This study aims to enhance vulnerability assessment by quantification of subjective intrinsic vulnerability index. Therefore, a combined approach for quantification {{of intrinsic}} vulnerability classes index through modeling of contaminant mass transport scenario using the Emission-Transmission-Immission (ETI) concept was developed. This approach resulted in <b>quantified,</b> <b>objective</b> and measurable specific vulnerability scores. A new contribution {{of this study}} is considering the results of specific experimental unit called ‘Diffusion Cell setup’, for applying the ETI concept, as a basis in modeling process for quantification. The widely applied quantitative assessments at present use theoretical and literature data for running the modeling software, which however can not describe the contaminant sorption mechanism to reach groundwater in nature. An integrated methodology was set up, which consists of four main steps: (1) determination of sorbed amount of nitrate as a result of mass balance analyses of Diffusion setup (2) utilizing of maximum sorbed amount of nitrate determined by Freundlich sorption isotherm in the ETI Excel Tool program (runs based on iteration concept) to determine the mean required lifetime for nitrate (of mineral and manure sources) to reach groundwater (3) mapping of intrinsic vulnerability using DRASTIC model and mapping of specific attribute; mean required lifetime for nitrate to reach groundwater, divided by depth to groundwater. Thereafter, the map of total required lifetime for nitrate to reach groundwater was developed and (4) integration between the intrinsic vulnerability maps and the resulted specific attribute map. Eight representative undisturbed soil samples were collected from Schwalmtal/Nettetal (part of the region Viersen, Germany). This study area was chosen because it is a region of intensive agriculture, reduced protection capacity to pollutants loaded at the soil surface and has a shallow and porous aquifer system. The existing Diffusion setup was optimized by creating adjustments such as neglecting the effect of advection in order to enhance nitrate sorption property by sandy soils. However, this effect was mainly determined by performing soil permeability tests to obtain the values of hydraulic head. For interpretation of sorption behavior for soils of different grain sizes, investigation of soil properties was performed. The concentrations of applied nitrate solutions in the experimental unit were 25, 100 and 250 mg/L based on the amounts of added fertilizers, described in literature, of the study area. Statistics analyses of DRASTIC parameters maps were conducted. It is found that the highest risk of contamination is caused essentially by soil media. Furthermore, the map removal sensitivity analyses showed a poor correspondence between the sensitivity variation index and the theoretical weight for all DRASTIC parameters except depth to groundwater. Two modified DRASTIC approaches were configured using the sorbed ratio of each soil sample. The soil media was chosen for modification due to the results of map removal sensitivity analysis. More significantly, maps integration resulted in specific/integrated vulnerability maps display new vulnerability classes of quantified scores. As final results, specific vulnerability maps of quantified index for nitrate contaminant were developed for Schwalmtal/Nettetal. The developed method of quantification is generally applicable for vulnerability assessment to contamination of shallow groundwater as long as the maximum sorbed amount of contaminant and other essential hydrogeological input data for ETI Excel Tool program are available...|$|E
40|$|Mastitis is {{the most}} {{significant}} disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle and is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare concern. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. This study examined the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment in the prevention of mastitis and quantified the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had on the number of clinical cases of mastitis on somatic cell counts within herds. Context and background Organic dairy farming is a significant industry with milk being the largest single organic product in the UK. Organic milk is produced to defined standards which meet the Advisory Committee on Organic Standards (ACOS) criteria. These standards ‘emphasise animal welfare and, by avoiding artificial fertilisers, pesticides and other non-natural chemicals, and prohibiting the routine use of antibiotics and other conventional drugs, also ensure care for the environment, and promote the highest standards of food quality and safety’ (Omsco 2005). As part of the management of organic dairy cattle with reduced use of conventional pharmaceutical treatments, many organic farmers use homeopathic and other complementary therapies on their animals. Mastitis is recognised as the main animal health problem in organic milk production systems (Bennedsgaard et al 2003). Whilst mastitis levels appear to be similar to those found in conventional production (Hovi and Roderick, 2000) specific problem areas in mastitis control under organic management standards have been identified. One of the overall goals of organic animal husbandry is to avoid disease through management, husbandry, breeding and feeding. According to the EC-Regulation No. 1804 / 1999 governing organic livestock production, animal health management should be based on disease prevention. However, the preventive use of chemically synthesised allopathic medicinal products like dry cow antibiotics is not permitted. In organic units, phytotherapeutic and homeopathic products and trace elements are to be used in preference to antibiotic and prolonged withdrawal periods need to be observed after conventional medicine use. As a consequence of these requirements, organic dairy farmers look for alternatives to conventional therapy and prophylaxis (Hektoen 2004). Homeopathy is widely used for the treatment of mastitis within UK organic dairy herds and prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes, either continuously or just during housing, is practised on many organic dairy farms and is thought to offer general protection against mastitis and to reduce somatic cell counts (SCC). Research into the effectiveness of homeopathic treatments {{was one of the most}} important research requirements identified in a recent MAFF review of animal health within organic herds (Hovi & Roderick 1999). The range of homeopathic treatments used on farm today is wide, with treatment practices either focussing on the needs of the individual animal, which is known as constitutional treatment and which employs individual remedies, or aimed at groups of animals using specific remedies, or ‘nosodes’, which are considered to be a very specific form of homeopathy - isopathy (iso - all the same, pathy – treatment/exposure). Unlike specific remedies, nosodes do not account for the individual needs of each animal, but create the potential for protective treatment for a herd or group, they are generally applied in drinking water, and may be used on individual animals, usually by vulval spray. Benefit for the sector and for Defra Mastitis {{is the most}} significant disease affecting the health, welfare and economic productivity of dairy cattle, and management and control of mastitis is an important facet of practical dairy herd management. Mastitis is recognised by Defra as a major economic and welfare problem in dairy cattle. Research into the efficacy of homeopathic treatments and of management control of mastitis on organic dairy farms have both been identified as research priorities in recent Defra funded reviews of organic dairy farming. The Study Ninety-six farms participated in a double-blind trial to compare a homeopathic nosode and an inactive control treatment (carrier alone). Treatments were at the farm level and took place over a period of 12 months or 24 months (some farms were swapped to the opposite treatment during a second year). The treatments were randomised to each farm by a third party. During the trial, where available, records were collected of farm monthly bulk tank somatic cell count (BMSSC), a monthly cell count based on National Milk Recording data (NMR) and the annual number of cases of mastitis as recorded by the farmer. Additional farm level data were collected and their relationship to the level of mastitis on the farms investigated. Objectives of the Study The study described in this report explores the use of a specific mode of homeopathic treatment, a nosode, in the prevention of mastitis and quantifies the effect that the year-round, prophylactic use of nosodes, supplied to the cattle in the drinking water, had in reducing the number of clinical cases of mastitis and also quantifying any effect that the use of a nosode has on somatic cell counts within herds. •	To quantify the effectiveness of the prophylactic use of homeopathic nosodes for the treatment of mastitis in reducing the incidence of clinical mastitis and the concentration of somatic cells in milk. •	To survey management practices on organically managed farms. •	To investigate associations between the homeopathic treatment, farm management practice and the incidence of different types of mastitis and to provide guidance for mastitis control in organic dairy herds. Materials and methods In testing the efficacy of a homeopathic nosode it was determined that the study should: •	Look at a nosode already being commonly used and commercially available. •	Not ask for new recording systems to be used for data collection but to use the existing systems which are in place. •	Not interfere in the ‘normal’ practises carried out by the farms, by, for example, repeated prompting of farmers to carry out treatments, or ask them to adopt prescribed ways for describing, recording or treating mastitis. There are three commonly used measures of the udder health of milking cows: a) 	The bulk tank milk somatic cell count (BMSCC, commonly referred to as SCC) gives a count (in 000 ’s cells / ml) of white cells and desquamated cells shed by the udder. The BMSCC is not an accurate indicator for the presence of clinical mastitis, but may give information on sub-clinical (undetected) mastitis. b) 	Somatic cell counts for individual cows from farms which subscribe to commercial milk recording services (ICSCC). c) 	The number of cases of mastitis. The incidence rate for clinical mastitis (IRCM) is the number of distinct cases of mastitis in 100 cows in a year. The response variables that were measured were: •	Farmers’ own record of mastitis cases. •	Bulk milk SCC. •	Individual cow somatic cell records (ICSCC) if the farms were on a milk recording service. •	Farmer’s opinion of his/her success in controlling mastitis. •	A large number of variables, recorded using a questionnaire at the farm visits, which could influence mastitis and the effectiveness of the treatment. After visiting a number of homeopathic pharmacies, an agreement was made with Crossgates homeopathic pharmacy 1, and Freemans Homeopathic Pharmacy 2 (Appendix D) to make the individual herd specific nosode remedies for the farms. The trial was double-blinded, with blinding carried out by the creation of a randomly generated list of A and B’s. As each new farm was recruited, it was allocated to the next A or B in the sequence, the farms being allocated to either nosode treatment or control, one by one, in chronological order. Articles were written in the organic press, Organic Farming, and The Turning Worm, inviting farms to take part in the study. It was clear that farms should only join the study voluntarily and would not be ‘cold called’ or pressurised to join. One hundred and four farms responded to the call, and 96 of these farms went on to take part in the study. The 8 farms which declined to take part either went out of milk production before the study started, or changed their minds about inclusion in the trial before the start of the study. The 96 farms were visited and the study introduced. Farmers were issued with a kit to collect milk from high cell count cows for preparation as a nosode. An 80 part questionnaire (Appendix A) was used to gather the information needed to understand the possible factors that may influence mastitis. During visits the farmers were also asked whether they were willing to fill in a self assessment of their personality type. Number of farms recruited 			= 96 Total farms completing the study period	= 88 Number of farm years followed		= 206 Average herd size			= 101 cows Number of cows followed in the study 	= 9, 680 Number of cows receiving remedy (R) 	= 4, 734 Number of cows receiving control (P) 	= 4, 946 Total cow years followed			= 21, 580 cow years (Some farms two years, some 3 years) Farms lost during study			= 8 (due to sale of the herd, or going out of milk production and into, for example, heifer rearing) Results The data collected were subject to a number of different analyses:- 1. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the cell count in milk. 2. A test for an effect of the homeopathic nosode in reducing the annual cases of mastitis. 3. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with increased cell count in milk. 4. An analysis to identify risk factors associated with higher levels of mastitis. No effect of nosode in reducing either the incidence of cases of mastitis or the somatic cell counts in the milk were detected. The following risk factors were found to be associated with composite cell counts:- •	A decrease in cell count with increased culling of high cell count cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use complementary therapies on dry cows •	A decrease in cell count for farms which use dry cow therapy, including teat sealants, on dry cows •	An increased cell count for farms which did not pre-wipe before milking or pre-wiped the teats with a cloth before milking •	An increase in cell count for farms which pre-wipe only the udders of cows which are visibly dirty before milking The following risk factors were found to be associated with the number of cases of mastitis:- •	Increasing herd yield is associated with increased mastitis case numbers •	Increased calving of cows indoors in a calving box was associated with increased numbers of mastitis cases •	Use of an in line clot filer was associated with reduced numbers of mastitis cases •	Having an abreast parlour (as opposed to a herringbone or rotary parlour) was associated with a reduced numbers of mastitis cases The extent to which the objectives set have been achieved The effectiveness of homeopathic nosodes in treating mastitis and lowering cell count is quantified and described (Objective 1) and the survey results of management practices on organically managed dairy farms are described (Objective 2). Additionally, the associations between homeopathic treatment, farm management practices, mastitis incidence and cell count are <b>quantified</b> (<b>Objective</b> 4) and management controls which show a reduction in mastitis cases or cell counts are identified as risk factors and described in the report (Objective 5). Conclusions •	There was no significant effect of the herd specific nosode on either the cell count of milk or the number of cases of mastitis. •	That there were strong ‘within farm’ correlations of cell count and cases i. e. between farms, farms tend to stay at the same level of cases and average cell count from year to year. •	That there was a characteristic pattern of seasonal change in cell counts (this is already widely recognised). •	The study provides useful and interesting statistics on organic dairy farm production. •	The study identified an association between decreased cell count and culling for high cell count, the use of complementary dry cow therapy and the use of traditional dry cow therapy. •	The study identified an association between increased cell count and not pre-wiping the udder, pre-wiping using a cloth and only pre-wiping dirty cows. •	The study identified an association between higher numbers of mastitis cases and higher average yield and also with higher percentage of cows calving in a calving box. •	An association was identified between decreased numbers of mastitis cases and the use of an in-line clot filter and also with farms with an abreast parlour (rather than a herring-bone parlour). •	Eighty five per cent of farmers in the survey responded that they did believe in non-conventional remedies, and 62 per cent of farmers responded that they used non-conventional remedies on their own family. ...|$|E

Christian Nold’s Biomapping method then used the galvanic skin response of volunteers as an indicator of emotional arousal in conjunction with their geographical location. The resulting maps visualize points of high and low arousal [17].|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{is presented to}} approximate the Pareto optimal front (POF) by a response surface approximation. The data for the POF is obtained by multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Improvements to address drift in the POF are also presented. The approximated POF can help visualize and <b>quantify</b> trade-offs among <b>objectives</b> to select compromise designs. The bounds of this approximate POF are obtained using multiple convex-hulls. The proposed approach is applied to study trade-offs among objectives of a rocket injector design problem where performance and life objectives compete. The POF is approximated using a quintic polynomial. The compromise region <b>quantifies</b> trade-offs among <b>objectives.</b> © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

From the images anatomical parameters were identified that correlated with obstructive urodynamic findings and urethral resistance parameters based on pressure-flow analysis. This study gives support for further clinical investigations {{to determine the}} value of TRUS for male patients with dysuric disorders. It also illustrates the anatomical basis of prostatic obstruction as <b>quantified</b> by <b>objective</b> urodynamic parameters...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Intermittent drying is an {{alternative}} technology to continuous drying that improves the product quality as result of diminishing the average material temperature and the heating time. In this study, {{the application of the}} intermittent drying technology to mango drying (Mangifera indica L.) was analyzed and optimized. To formulate the optimization problem, an objective function was proposed in order to improve the product quality and decrease the energy consumption. To <b>quantify</b> the <b>objective</b> function, a mathematical model for a cubic shape was formulated and validated, considering diffusional mass and heat transfer with non-negligible external resistances...|$|R

40|$|Central {{banks have}} become remarkably more {{transparent}} {{over the last}} few decades. In this paper, we study the effects of this evolution, focusing on whether enhanced central bank transparency lowers dispersion among professional forecasters of key economic variables. We use a large set of proxies for central-bank transparency in 12 advanced economies. We find evidence for a sizeable effect (e. g., by announcing a <b>quantified</b> inflation <b>objective,</b> or by publishing inflation and output forecasts). However, there are decreasing marginal effects to increases in transparency, and the disagreement among the expectations of the general public is not affected. This suggests that there are possible limits to transparency...|$|R

The current economic climate has intensified activity within this field with particular interest being paid to any potential cost savings and other financial benefits that may be obtained. Further the creation of a realistic representation of the demands present within a system can lead to a better understanding of system behaviour; this then may facilitate the identification of elements that are likely to allow improvement to system performance through their perturbation. Within this thesis a model is constructed for the demands upon front line Police officers that {{are used in}} response to high importance calls to service from the public. Tabu search and genetic algorithms are optimizing search techniques developed and applied across a wide variety of fields. They are particularly well suited to combinatorial problems in which the ordering or arrangement of system elements has an impact upon the quality of solution as assessed by some <b>quantifying</b> <b>objective</b> function. In this thesis both of these methods are applied to the staff resource allocation problem as posed by Leicestershire Police with the strengths and weaknesses of each evaluated.

Both search algorithms are shown to be well suited to the target problem and each result in the generation of solutions of similar quality.

These indicators should serve as the basis for defining performance indicators in subordinated sectoral and territorial development policies. Such unified performance indicator system would significantly increase the quality of strategic planning in public administration. Moreover it would raise the quality of public administration in general because the actions of public institutions could be related to <b>quantified</b> policy <b>objectives</b> and results thus creating preconditions for an effective performance-based budget planning in Latvia...|$|R
