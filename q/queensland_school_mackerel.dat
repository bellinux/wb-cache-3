50|$|The <b>Queensland</b> <b>school</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Scomberomorus queenslandicus) is {{a species}} of fish in the family Scombridae. It is found in {{tropical}} waters of the western Pacific, largely confined to inshore coastal waters of southern Papua New Guinea and northern and eastern Australia, from Shark Bay and Onslow, Western Australia to Sydney, New South Wales. <b>Queensland</b> <b>school</b> <b>mackerel</b> commonly occur in waters down to 100 m, usually to 30 m, in depth. Specimens have been recorded at up to 100 cm in length, and weighing up to 12.2 kg.|$|E

QSAAV  recommendations: 	Urge all <b>Queensland</b> <b>schools</b> to adopt a cyber safety strategy. 	Promote and maintain existing resources, and develop additional resources.   	Commission an external review within 18 months, using an independent anti-bullying expert to assess the progress of <b>Queensland</b> <b>schools</b> in implementing the work of QSAAV. 	Engage an independent anti-bullying expert to provide ongoing advice to government on issues and policy options as needed. 	Develop a promotional campaign focused on improving the awareness of parents and students about bullying and cyber bullying. 	Endorse {{the annual meeting of}} representatives from the three schooling sectors and associated stakeholders to continue collaborative action against bullying and violence in <b>Queensland</b> <b>schools.</b> 	Develop a strategy for communicating with students about the issues of bullying and violence, including the use of social media options. 	Raise, through the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs, national support and effort for: 	the development of nationally recognised high quality online professional development for school staff on bullying, cyber safety and violence 	a process for the evaluation of anti-bullying and anti-violence programs that assists schools to determine the right program for their school’s needs 	a mechanism for the ongoing identification of high quality research in the areas of bullying and violence to assist all schools in implementing evidence-based practice.

40|$|Fisheries {{independent}} monitoring of widely distributed pelagic fish species which conduct large seasonal migrations is logistically complex and expensive. One of the commercially most important {{examples of such}} a species in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean is mackerel for which up to recently only an international triennial egg survey contributed to the stock assessment. In this study, we explore whether fisheries acoustic data, recorded opportunistically during the English component of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey, can contribute to an improved understanding of mackerel distribution and provide supplementary data to existing dedicated monitoring surveys. Using a previously published multifrequency acoustic mackerel detection algorithm, we extracted the distribution and abundance of <b>schooling</b> <b>mackerel</b> {{for the whole of}} the North Sea during August and September between 2007 and 2013. The spatio-temporal coverage of this unique dataset is of particular interest because it includes part of the unsurveyed summer mackerel feeding grounds in the northern North Sea. Recent increases in landings in Icelandic waters during this season suggested that changes have occurred in the mackerel feeding distribution. Thus far it is poorly understood whether these changes are due to a shift, i. e. mackerel moving away from their traditional feeding grounds in the northern North Sea and southern Norwegian Sea, or whether the species’ distribution has expanded. We therefore explored whether acoustically derived biomass of <b>schooling</b> <b>mackerel</b> declined in the northern North Sea during the study period, which would suggest a shift in mackerel distribution rather than an expansion. The results of this study show that in the North Sea, <b>schooling</b> <b>mackerel</b> abundance has increased and that its distribution in this area has not changed over this period. Both of these findings provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence in support of the hypothesis that mackerel have expanded their distribution rather than moved away...|$|R

40|$|This report investigates {{lessons learned}} by {{educators}} in the United States when providing a standards-based curriculum for all students including Students with Disabilities (SWD). Assumptions about implementation of these lessons are then made to the <b>Queensland</b> <b>school</b> system. <b>Queensland</b> mainstream <b>schools</b> currently provide a standards-based curriculum for over sixteen thousand-four hundred students with mild-moderate disabilities and appear to be challenged by this new educational reform and its implications to school and teacher practices, beliefs and attitudes. The analysis of US research, literature and educational policy for this report, has provided some implications for <b>Queensland</b> <b>schools</b> {{in the areas of}} student participation, achievement and curriculum planning to provide an “education for all”. The analysis and comparison of legislation and policy, which demonstrates some significant similarities, provides greater validity for the application of lessons learned in the United States to the Queensland context. The key findings about lessons learned provides <b>Queensland</b> <b>schools</b> with some assumptions as to why and how they need to refocus school leader and teachers’ practices, beliefs and attitudes to provide an “education for all”. These lessons infer that school leaders and teachers to explicitly focus on equity, expectation, accountability, performance, alignment and collaboration so that effective curriculum is provided for SWD, indeed all students, in the Queensland standards-based curriculum environment...|$|R

To document ways in which the Early Years Curriculum Guidelines underpin teachers’ planning, teaching and assessment of students. c.
