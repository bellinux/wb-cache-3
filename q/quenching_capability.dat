40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{modeling}} of components and calculation of transient overvoltages that build up on the trans-former primary terminals after the transformer has been switched off by a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB). The transformer is con-nected to the circuit breaker by a cable. The transient overvoltages are calculated for different cable lengths, and the cumulative prob-ability of different arc angles is investigated. In this study two cases are considered: transient overvoltages due to steady-state magnetizing current switching, and transient overvoltages due to inrush current switching. It is shown that the case of inrush current switching is worse, as virtual current chop-ping is possible. The cable is modeled by pi sections, whereas the transformer model {{is based on a}} terminal impedance.

In this work, we investigate the underlying mechanism behind luminescence quenching {{by measuring the}} reduction in Alq 3 photoluminescence due to SnO 02. Using an analytical model and a Monte Carlo simulation for exciton dynamics in amorphous organic solids, {{we find that the}} exciton diffusion length in bulk Alq 3 is in the range of 70 [...] 80 A. We also find that for SnO 2 films deposited without oxygen in the sputtering ambient, resonant energy transfer from Alq 3 to SnO 2 is the dominant quenching mechanism. By varying the oxygen content in the Ar/C) 2 sputtering gas mixture, we find that the energy transfer distance decreases from 10 [...] 25 A for 0 % 02 to less than 2 A for 10 % 02. Our experimental results suggest that because excess oxygen reduces oxygen vacancies and defect electronic states in SnO 2, it leads to a smaller spectral overlap between the emission of Alq 3 and the absorption of SnO 2, thereby shortening the energy transfer distance and reducing the <b>quenching</b> <b>capability</b> of SnO 2. by Jun Mei.

This research not only concerns the modeling of main components in collector grids of an OWF for transient analysis (including VCBs, wind turbine transformers (WTTs), submarine cables), but also compares the effectiveness between several mainstream switching overvoltage (SOV) protection methods {{and a new}} mitigation method called smart choke. In order to accurately reproduce such HF switching transients considering the current chopping, dielectric strength (DS) recovery capability and HF <b>quenching</b> <b>capability</b> of VCBs, three models are developed, i. e., a user–defined VCB model, a HF transformer terminal model and a three-core (TC) frequency dependent model of submarine cables, which are validated through simulations and compared with measurements.

The quantum yield of the ground state I(52 P 32) amounts to (±) % • In terms of a three—level kinetic model, we have furthermore determined the fine—structure branching ratio of the resultant nascent K 52 P doublets {{in the presence of}} Ar, He, H 2, CH 4 and CO 2 to be 0. 800, 0. 798, 0. 791, 0. 797 and 0. 785, respectively, with 1 % accuracy. This model takes into account the rapid energy transfer between the 52 P doublets and the relevant collisional quenching, thereby leading to a more accurate value than the measurement of fluorescence intensity at low pressure. Since a variety of foreign gases that cause different energy transfers and <b>quenching</b> <b>capabilities</b> have been considered in the system, the resulting branching ratios derived at the zero—pressure are identical, thus confirming reliability of our kinetic model. The relevant fine—structure mixing rate coefficients and the collisional quenching rate coefficients are also evaluated. In addition, the kinetic model has been extended to the case of photodissociation at 248 nm; given the appropriate mixing rate coefficients reported elsewhere, the average branching ratio of K(42 P 3, 2) photofragment are then determined to be 0. 610 in the presence of Ar, 112 and N 2.

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented by}} Pol Nadal Jimenez in his thesis investigates {{the role of}} the quorum quenching acylase PvdQ in fluorescent pseudomonads. PvdQ is an Ntn-hydrolase member capable of degrading N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), the major group of molecules used for cell-to-cell communication in Gram-negative bacteria (quorum sensing). One of the most relevant actions coordinated by quorum sensing in bacteria is infection. By assessing their population density, bacteria invading a host are capable of determining the optimal moment to start producing virulence factors with a chance to overcome the host severely compromising the outcome of the infection. On one hand, the work of Nadal Jimenez has aided to the structure elucidation of PvdQ, a quorum quenching acylase produced by fluorescent pseudomonads capable of degrading long chain (AHLs). This work provides valuable insights into the mechanism that PvdQ uses to recognize and degrade communication signals and strengths the potential in the use of these enzymes against infections. On the other, his research has aimed to solve the question: “why does P. aeruginosa produce an enzyme capable of disrupting its own communication systems?” The results provided in his work revealed that the major role of PvdQ is likely to be participating in the biosynthesis of pyoverdine, the major siderophore in fluorescent pseudomonads. Supporting this hypothesis there is the fact that while bacteria generally produce AHLs constitutively, PvdQ is only produced when iron availability is low. In that context, P. aeruginosa is {{the exception rather than the}} rule being the only member of its group exploiting the quorum <b>quenching</b> <b>capabilities</b> of this enzyme for regulation of its own communication systems. ...|$|R

40|$|Due to its {{excellent}} arc <b>quenching</b> <b>capability,</b> SF 6 -gas {{is widely}} used for medium voltage switchgear. Because it is a highly potent greenhouse gas, {{it is expected to}} be many restrictions for the allowed use of this gas in near future. It is therefore important to conduct research on development of more environmental friendly switchgear. The challenge is to keep both the interruption capability and volume, of todays SF 6 insulated switchgear. One of the most promising solution to this challenge, is to use ablation material to improve the current interruption capability. Experimental work with an ablation-assisted circuit breaker, is the foundation for the work in this thesis. The primary aim of this thesis is to evaluate the arc voltage distribution inside an ablation tube during ablation-assisted current interruption, using air as the insulation medium. This is performed by gathering the readouts from three high voltage resistive probes placed at different key locations in the plasma arc. The first part of the thesis contains work performed to weed out any large sources of measurement error. From previous work, {{it was found that the}} experimental setup used in this work contained one or more of these sources. The second part of this work contains the experimental portion of this work. This part explains how the tests were conducted, and lists the results together with a discussion around their significance and wider implications. By applying the corrections suggested in this work, the probes gave valuable results for conductivity measurements in switching arcs. The results are considered valid for measurements from contact separation and until 100 μs after current interruption. The results show clearly that the field strength was significantly higher where the gas outlet was located, when the pressure inside the ablation tube was low. When acting as a "self-blast" switch, which increased the pressure, gave the system an increase in field strength. Additionally, there was also a change in the position of the field strength peaks. With an increase in pressure, the field strength changed from being largest over the gas outlet to being largest over the first few millimeters of the arc...|$|E

Fifty six diverse compositions have been used with numerous incorporations (MWCNTs, nanokaolinite, nanomontmorillonite, fine natural cork, phenolic resin, carbon fiber, Kevlar fiber, glass fiber, Spectra fiber, and ceramic fiber) and elastomeric matrices (ethylene propylene monomer, styrene butadiene, silicon, and nitrile butadiene rubber) to fabricate polymer ablative composites for hyperthermal/hypersonic environment encountered during the space vehicle and ballistic missiles re-entry missions. The reinforcements have been impregnated into the elastomeric matrices using internal dispersion kneader and two-roller mixing mill. Three types of mold geometries have been used according to ASTM standards to fabricate the composites on the hot isostatic press to evaluate in-situ back-face temperature elevation, linear/radial ablation resistance, and mechanical properties. High temperature (≈ 3000 o Thermal stability and heat absorbing capability investigations {{have been carried out}} on the TG/DTA equipment. Mechanical properties have been executed using Universal Testing Machine (UTM) and rubber hardness tester. Scanning electron microscopy coupled with the energy dispersive spectroscopy was performed to demonstrate the reinforcement’s dispersion, interface quality, char morphology, char–reinforcement interaction, and compositional analysis of the composites. C) oxy–acetylene torch coupled with the temperature data logging system was used to execute the ablation measurements of the ablative composites. The ablation, thermal, and mechanical properties of the fabricated composites have been positively influenced with increasing the concentration of the nanoclays/synthetic fibers/nanotubes in the host rubber matrices. The least backface temperature evolution under 200 s flame exposure, best linear/radial/mass ablation resistance, and the utmost improvement in tensile strength and elongation at break have been observed for 30 wt% nanokaolinite and 7 wt% chopped Kevlar fiber impregnated ablative composites. High thermal stability, heat <b>quenching</b> <b>capability,</b> low thermal conductivity, mechanical strength, and remarkable reinforcement–matrix adhesion are identified as the most prominent factors for enhanced ablation performance. The novelty of this research work is the fabrication of new ablative formulations with augmented ablation resistance (linear ablation rate of ~ 0. 002 mm/s) and back-face temperatures in the vicinity of 55 oC. This compares with the ablation rates of 0. 01 mm/s and back-face temperatures 130 o C for contemporary work using elastomeric composites under similar conditions. A host of ablators have been ranked in terms of linear and radial ablation rate, backface temperature, and mechanical strength following head-on impingement, or radial flow conditions of oxyacetylene flame.

40|$|DNA-functionalized {{nanomaterials}} {{have shown}} versatile applications in biosensor development, biomedical diagnostics, therapy, and catalysis. DNA is attractive {{for this purpose}} for its programmable structure, molecular recognition function, and ease of modification. Various nanomaterials, including noble metals, carbons, metal oxides, soft polymeric nanostructures, and metal organic frameworks have been conjugated with DNA. Among them, metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) exhibit unique magnetic, catalytic, and surface properties. Most previously reported DNA/MONP conjugates were prepared {{with the help of}} surface coating layers or linkers. While such conjugation provides stable hybrid materials, the intrinsic surface properties of MONPs are often masked. The primary focus of this thesis is to interface DNA oligonucleotides with pristine MONPs to provide critical insights into the fundamental understandings at these bio-nano interfaces and to design functional biosensors towards environmentally and biologically important analytes. In Chapter 2 the interaction between indium-doped tin oxide nanoparticles (ITO NPs) and fluorescently labeled single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) is systematically studied. While electrochemical and photochemical biosensors based on ITO for DNA detection have been developed, {{little is known about the}} biointerface chemistry. The DNA adsorption and fluorescence <b>quenching</b> <b>capability</b> of ITO NPs is first confirmed. Salt concentration, pH, DNA sequence and length affect DNA adsorption. The adsorption mechanism is found to be through the phosphate backbone using displacement assays. ITO NPs but not In 2 O 3 can discriminate ssDNA and double stranded DNA (dsDNA) based on the difference in their chain flexibility. In Chapter 3, the interaction between fluorescently labeled DNA and iron oxide nanoparticles is investigated. Fe 3 O 4 NPs adsorb DNA via the phosphate backbone and quench the fluorescence. With the strong affinity between arsenate and Fe 3 O 4, a highly sensitive arsenate sensor is demonstrated based on the displacement of fluorescently labeled DNA by arsenate. Arsenate displaces adsorbed DNA to increase fluorescence, allowing the detection of arsenate down to 300 nM. The sensor design represents a new way of using DNA: analyte recognition relying on metal oxide while DNA is used only as a signaling molecule. In Chapter 4, following the work in Chapter 2 and 3, a total of 19 MONPs are screened for their ability to adsorb DNA, quench fluorescence, and release adsorbed DNA in the presence of a few common anions. These MONPs have different fluorescence quenching properties, DNA adsorption affinity, and different sensitivity toward anions probed by DNA desorption. Finally, CeO 2, Fe 3 O 4, and ZnO are used to form a sensor array to discriminate phosphate, arsenate, and arsenite from the rest using the linear discriminant analysis method. The study not only provides a solution for anion discrimination using MONPs and DNA but also insights into the interface of metal oxides and DNA. In Chapter 5, a fluorescently labeled DNA is used as a probe to investigate the interaction between a biologically important molecule, H 2 O 2, and a nanozyme, nanoceria. Nanoceria has been previously reported to bind DNA strongly. I demonstrate that the adsorbed DNA can be readily displaced by H 2 O 2, resulting in over 20 -fold fluorescence enhancement. The displacement mechanism instead of oxidative DNA cleavage is confirmed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and surface group pKa measurements. This system can sensitively detect H 2 O 2 down to 130 nM. When coupled with glucose oxidase, glucose is detected down to 8. 9 µM in buffer. Detection in serum is also achieved with results comparable with that from a commercial glucose meter. With an understanding of the ligand role of H 2 O 2, new applications in rational materials design, sensor development, and drug delivery can be further exploited. In Chapter 6, I demonstrate the feasibility of using DNA in promoting the peroxidase activity of iron oxide nanoparticles. The effect of DNA length, sequence, surface coating are systematically studied. The rate enhancement is more significant with longer DNA. The negatively charged phosphate backbone and bases of DNA can increase the substrate binding, thus facilitating the oxidation reaction in the presence of H 2 O 2. The role of DNA in modulating the peroxidase activity of iron oxide provides insights into the mechanism the nanozymes. Overall, the adsorption mechanism of DNA by various oxides, the controlling of the catalytic activity of oxides, and the related biosensor applications have been extensively studied in this thesis...|$|E

The accumulation of nanoparticles at the liquid-vapor interface was found to reduce the vapor removal rate from the film, creating a thick vapor film barrier which reduced the minimum film boiling heat flux. Experiments by Narayan et al. [43] showed that surface orientation has an influence on pool boiling heat transfer in nanoparticle suspensions. A smooth heated tube was suspended at different orientations in nanofluids to study the pool boiling performance. The pool boiling heat transfer was found to be maximum for the horizontal inclination. Al 2 O 3 -water nanofluids of 47 nm particles and 1 % by weight concentration showed enhancement in pool boiling heat transfer performance, over that of water. With increase in concentration and particle size, the performance decreased for nanofluids. For vertical and 45 ° inclination orientations, nanofluids showed inferior performance compared to pure water. Coursey and Kim [44] investigated the effect of surface wettability on the boiling performance of nanofluids. In the experiments, heater surfaces altered to varying degrees by oxidization or by depositing metal were investigated by measuring the surface energy measurements and boiling heat transfer (CHF). It was found that the CHF of poorly wetting systems could be improved by up to 37 % by the use of nanofluids, while surfaces with good wetting characteristics showed less improvement.|$|R
40|$|For an optimum charge/energy {{transfer}} {{performance of}} hybrid organic-inorganic colloidal nanocrystals for {{applications such as}} photonic devices and solar cells, the determining factors are {{the distance between the}} nanocrystal and polymer which greatly depends upon nanocrystal size/nanocrystal ligands. Short chain ligands are preferred to ensure a close contact between the donor and acceptor {{as a result of the}} tunnelling probability of the charges and the insulating nature of long alkyl chain molecules. Short distances increase the probability for tunnelling to occur as compared to long distances induced by long alkyl chains of bulky ligands which inhibit tunnelling altogether. The ligands on the as-synthesized nanocrystals can be exchanged for various other ligands to achieve desirable charge/energy transfer properties depending on the bond strength of the ligand on the nanocrystal compared to the replacement ligand. In this work, the constraints involved in post-synthesis ligand exchange process have been evaluated, and these factors have been tuned via wet chemistry to tailor the hybrid material properties via appropriate selection of the nanocrystal capping ligands. It has been found that both oleic acid and oleylamine (OLA) -capped cadmium selenide (CdSe) quantum dots (QDs) as compared with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) -passivated CdSe QDs are of high quality, and they provide better steric stability against coagulation, homogeneity, and photostability to their respective polymer:CdSe nanocomposites. CdSe QDs particularly with OLA capping have relatively smaller surface energies, and thus, lesser <b>quenching</b> <b>capabilities</b> show dominance of photoinduced Forster energy transfer between donors (polymer) and acceptors (CdSe nanocrystals) as compared to charge transfer mechanism as observed in polymer:CdSe (TOPO) composites. It is conjectured that size quantization effects, stereochemical compatibility of ligands (TOPO, oleic acid, and oleyl amine), and polymer MEH-PPV stability greatly influence the photophysics and photochemistry of hybrid polymer-semiconductor nanocomposite...|$|R
40|$|Chirality {{is a major}} {{field of}} {{research}} of chemical biology and is essential in pharmacology. Accordingly, approaches for distinguishing between different chiral forms of a compound are of great interest. We report on an efficient and generic enantioselective sensor that is achieved by coupling reduced graphene oxide with γ-cyclodextrin (rGO/γ-CD). The enantioselective sensing capability of the resulting structure was operated in both electrical and optical mode for of tryptophan enantiomers (D-/L-Trp). In this sense, voltammetric and photoluminescence measurements were conducted and the experimental results were compared to molecular docking method. We gain insight into the occurring recognition mechanism with selectivity toward D- and L-Trp as shown in voltammetric, photoluminescence and molecular docking responses. As an enantioselective solid phase on an electrochemical transducer, thanks to the different dimensional interaction of enantiomers with hybrid material, a discrepancy occurs in the Gibbs free energy leading to a difference in oxidation peak potential as observed in electrochemical measurements. The optical sensing principle {{is based on the}} energy transfer phenomenon that occurs between photoexcited D-/L-Trp enantiomers and rGO/γ-CD giving rise to an enantioselective photoluminescence quenching due to the tendency of chiral enantiomers to form complexes with γ-CD in different molecular orientations as demonstrated by molecular docking studies. The approach, which is the first demonstration of applicability of molecular docking to show both enantioselective electrochemical and photoluminescence <b>quenching</b> <b>capabilities</b> of a graphene-related hybrid material, is truly new and may have broad interest in combination of experimental and computational methods for enantiosensing of chiral molecules.

40|$|NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has {{developed}} a novel directional solidification furnace prototype for processing metals and alloys experiments in a microgravity environment. The BUNDLE (Bridgman Unidirectional Dendrite in Liquid Experiment) furnace is intended to accommodate the science requirements of Flight Definition Principle Investigators studying cellular/dendritic growth in aluminum and lead alloys at processing temperatures up to 1200 C. The furnace implements a number of innovative features to achieve high thermal gradients and quench rates in a low-power, light-weight design. These include a pyrolytic boron nitride/graphite composite heating element surrounded by layers of self-supporting refractory metal shielding, and a graphite fiber enhanced cold zone allowing high levels of heat extraction from the sample crucible. Novel to the BUNDLE design is an in-situ helium gas <b>quench</b> <b>capability</b> that ensures rapid freezing of the solidifying region (mushy zone) of the metal sample within the furnace without sample disturbance prior to quenching; this is a stringent requirement for subsequent analysis and understanding of microstructural development. The experiment hardware concept features multiple furnaces that may be "bundled" together so many samples, currently up to eight, can be processed at one time. The design of BUNDLE is flexible enough to be implemented on the Shuttle and Space Station {{in a number of}} locations (SpaceHab, Express Rack, MPESS, ISPR, etc). BUNDLE prototype furnaces have directionally solidified and quenched 1 cm diameter lead - 5. 8 weight percent antimony and aluminum - 4 weight percent copper alloys. Quenching of the mushy zone, as recorded by in-situ thermocouples, occurred on the order of 0. 5 seconds or less, a rate within the PI's requirements. Subsequent metallographic examination revealed the solidified microstructure to be, as expected, unidirectional. Both the dendrite tips and the eutectic reaction were planar in nature indicating uniform axial heat flow. Delineation between the growing dendrites and eutectic structure with the "quenched-in" liquid was sharp, attesting to the efficacy of the helium quench. BUNDLE's conception, development, capability, and adaptability are presented (in view of Flight PI's needs and science requirements) through viewgraphs depicting actual hardware, generated thermal analysis, and micrographs prepared from BUNDLE processed, flight-like samples...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{electrostatic}} nanocomposite from Rhodamine 6 G (R 6 G) and GO for the cost-effective, label-free, facile, {{sensitive and}} selective detection of DNA was constructed. Upon {{the interaction between}} positively charged dye and negatively charged GO, the charge-transfer complex R 6 G+GO- formed and significantly fluorescence quenching was observed. Due to the high electrostatic and non-covalent interactions between R 6 G and DNA, in the present of DNA, the interaction between R 6 G and GO was disturbed, which will turn on the fluorescence of R 6 G. The key advance of this R 6 G+GO- biosensor platform is attributed to the high <b>quenching</b> and absorbing <b>capabilities</b> of GO, which make it an effective candidate for DNA detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{forthcoming}} {{operation of}} the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at 13 - 14 TeV requires a deep understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms in the most critical superconducting magnets. This is aimed at determining their steady-state quench limits and constitutes an input to compute the magnets stability in transient conditions as well, to prevent beam induced <b>quenches.</b> Heat extraction <b>capability</b> of the LHC Nb-Ti magnets relies on the significant contribution provided by superfluid helium (He II). Due to {{lack of knowledge of}} the He II distribution in the cable and in the compressed insulation, experimental investigations are necessary. In this work we present an experimental study aimed at reproducing the thermal behavior of superconducting coils using short length samples. With respect to previous studies, a new instrumentation technique was developed and an in-situ calibration of the thermocouples was performed. The study was conducted on different types of instrumented cables-stack reproducing the main bending dipole (MB), the main quadrupole (MQ), and the MQXA, {{which is one of the}} two low-β interaction region quadrupoles. The heat extraction was determined as a function of the cable temperature, of the bath temperature and of the beam loss scenario...|$|R
40|$|Single photon {{avalanche}} detectors (SPADs) {{have attracted}} increasing attention {{because of their}} critical roles in many important applications such as quantum cryptography, optical time-domain reflectometry, time-resolved spectroscopy, non-line-of-sight optical communication, space communication and light detection and ranging. Although Silicon SPADs are limited to wavelength below 1. 1 um, III-V based SPADs with Separate Absorption and Multiplication (SAM) structure are of special interest in the telecommunication wavelengths, exhibiting superior performance with high single photon detection efficiency and low dark count rate. Conventionally, due to the self- sustaining nature of avalanche, operation of SPADs requires integration of external quenching circuit to achieve both <b>quenching</b> and recovering <b>capabilities.</b> Integration of external quenching circuit with III-V SPADs, however, adds substantial complexity to device fabrication, especially for array detectors when each individual detector requires an external quenching circuit. Here, we present single photon avalanche detectors featuring a Transient Carrier Buffer (TCB) layer to form an energy barrier which can tentatively stop avalanche-generated carriers, demonstrating self-quenching and self-recovering capabilities. For this self-quenching and self-recovering SPAD, the escape rate of those stopped avalanche carriers from the barrier determines the self-recovery time and thus count rate of the single-photon detector. A physical model has been developed to simulate the dynamic characteristics of the detector. The simulation results agree well with the experimental data, and the self- recovery time {{is found to be}} reduced with increasing temperature, the magnitude of overbias, the dosage in the charge layer and the barrier height. In addition, thermionic emission shows a stronger dependence on temperature and a weaker dependence on device bias and charge layer dosage than tunneling. The model contains no fitting parameters and therefore can be used to model and predict the device behavior...|$|R
