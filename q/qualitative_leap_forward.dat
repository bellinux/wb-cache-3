Optical fibers underlie high-speed communication in access, metro, and long-haul networks, making the use of the Internet possible over intercontinental distances. Light is also at the heart of integrated optoelectronic devices for data modulation and routing, CDs and optical data storage, and all types of displays.ICFO conducts research in classical communications, covering areas such as integrated optics, optoelectronics, and optical fiber devices. ICFO also investigatesdisruptive approaches based on nanophotonics and quantum technologies. Nanophotonics offers an unprecedented miniaturization potential. As for quantuminformation systems, they represent a <b>qualitative</b> <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> in the design of specialized communication systems for applications like high-security transactionsof commercial or strategic interest.Ongoing research programs focus on areas as diverse as transparent and advanced displays, plasmonic-based devices, light emission and detection by nanoantennas, wide-scope transparent ultrathin-film electrode technologies, novel micro and nanofabrication technologies, compact quantum cryptography, quantum satellite communications (sponsored by the European Space Agency), quantum memories, quantum computation, and advanced quantum information protocols.|$|E
40|$|Initiation of {{the modern}} era of surface science, {{generally}} acknowledged as starting in the late 1960 s, {{was made possible by}} two distinct <b>qualitative</b> <b>leaps</b> <b>forward.</b> One was the Sputnik-inspired development of ultra-high vacuum and electron-optical technologies. The other was the recognition and development of theoretical and measurement techniques for studying surface properties and processes on the (single!) atomic level. The field emission spectroscopy result reported in this 1969 NBS paper [1] was the first work in which the electronic energy level spectra of adsorbed atoms was observed and theoretically interpreted. All subsequent electron energy level spectroscopy of adsorbed atoms and molecules, whether based on tunneling processes such as in this work or on photon-induced processes, can legitimately be considered as logical consequences of this pioneering study. The spectroscopic information so obtained is the essential ingredient required in all quantum mechanical modeling of chemical bonding, catalysis, dynamics, and reactivity at solid surfaces, and {{it is for this reason}} that the advances reported in this paper have had lasting and historical significance. The situation at NBS at the time was particularly well suited for the laboratory to become one of the three or four pre-eminent international centers of excellence leading the transformation of then-existing surface studies from a qualitative mystical art into a quantitative and intellectually stimulating hard science in which the basic systems and processes under study could be understood at the most fundamental atomic level. Major efforts in atomic and electron physics were focused on the development of monochromatic electron sources and energy analyzers (of special importance here, the work of John Simpson and Chris Kuyatt) and in their utilization for basic atomic physics studies, particularly those theoretically inspired by Ugo Fano (discussed elsewhere in this volume). A major direction in electron beam production relied upon field emitted/ tunneled electrons as a promising source, and it was within this context that Russ Young came to NBS in 1961 and soon was attracting world-wide attention for his measurements and interpretation of field emission energy distributions as a new probe of the electroni...|$|R

It {{became one of the most}} advanced sectors of the Kazakh economy, which was equipped with advanced aviation technology. By the early 1980s more than one hundred thousand kilometers of air lines were opened in Kazakhstan. The capital of Kazakh SSR Alma-Ata was linked to all the capitals of Soviet republics. Also, Alma-ata was linked with all regional centers of Kazakhstan and various major cities and resort areas of the Soviet Union. More than fifty percent of Kazakhstan's population each year used these air transport services of Aeroflot Soviet Airlines. Up to fifteen million hectares of farmland were served by agricultural special airplanes. Seventeen airports were built during this time, as well as ten airports having their own hotels. Even in small villages of Kazakhstan people were able to purchase airflight tickets to any point of destination of the Soviet Union. The appearance of a new airplanes for civil and cargo usage such as models An-24, An-26, An-30, Il-18, Il-62, Il-86, Tu-134, Tu-154, Yak-40, Mi-2, and Mi-8 required the presence of highly qualified crew, engineering, and dispatch teams. All pilots of large airplanes had higher education. One out of every seventh employee of the technical aviation base had engineering degree.Under Kuznetsov’s leadership many professional aviators were trained, as well as flight operators, and other aviation related professionals. The Academy of Civil Aviation was founded in Alma-Ata. At the same time the Flight School was founded in Aktobe. The Ministry of Civil Aviation of the USSR founded a flight operations school in Burunday village. With the development of new aircraft in Domodedovo and Sheremetyevo airports in Moscow the flight personnel of Kazakhstan were predominantly selected.|$|E

An armed thinking in dialogue, which is a welcome and a synthesis-oriented reject Hegel, Heidegger notoriously Nietzschean inspiration, whose expression is what he calls [...] "dialectical existentialism. (Existentialism dialectical, 1958) dialectical Existentialism is a correction of Hegel, the slogan deslogizar because the dialectic {{is based on the}} existence whose principle is freedom.In Hegel's Logic (1932), argues that the Hegelian dialectic prefix a field of possibilities that makes the spirit where mechanized activity becoming, rather than an open possibility, diluted as a closed circle of eternal return, and excludes any desire to affair and conquering one's virtue is philosophical. Against this stands the active nature of the spirit that is always right and will, vital impulse of life but does not deny the claims, but does not repress the instincts that leads to full empowerment. But unlike Nietzsche who agrees with this reassessment of the vital forces, proposed ranking them according to their greater or lesser contribution to the implementation of the spirit and therefore the reverse, [...] "he says of what is happening in contemporary society. This understanding of the dialectical method allows you to recover the right of difference that {{can not be reduced to}} the formalism of the synthesis of opposites. While on the ground the outline of competitions, you can not capture the richness of difference.This requires that thought out of itself, requires the intuition that takes the concept of the static tautological. (The metaphysical intuition, 1965) From this perspective the dialectic of opposites becomes existential dialectic, then march toward the concrete, the existence, in which the overcoming of opposites is impossible. In this area, the contradictions are insoluble when overcome in Hegel appears as reconciliation of opposites guaranteed by the necessary evolution, is given here as hiatus, the <b>qualitative</b> <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> is the land of paradox where opposites coexist, land and carved by Kierkegaard. (Freedom, existence and being, 1942) Thus anchor their thinking in Heidegger for whom consciousness is not something theoretical but emotional. [...] "temple of spirit", [...] "pre-understanding" [...] original predisposition to anxiety, which is not form but content and not of conscience but of existence. But here again Virasoro corrected: the original is not anxiety born of the awareness of finitude, that which in Sartre and Kierkegaard is expressed as limited awareness of this in every election. Anxiety is just another aspect of the deeper phenomenon that contains: the thirst for being, [...] "anxiety", force or impulse that is being itself as an abstract possibility. A conception of being as opposed substance as the impetus, a pure will to be where he does not play any type of need. Freedom, but freedom to be held in permanent tension and implies a sense of being as pure possibility that is actualized in the form of a quota want individual and limited, as the abstract universal being as impotent and needs the body to perform.

40|$|During {{the last}} 22 years, the Region of the Americas has seen an upward trend in dengue incidence, with {{epidemics}} peaking ever higher and recurring every 3 - 5 years, almost regularly. A {{major factor in}} the spread of the disease has been the diminished capacity of national programs to respond with dengue prevention and control. This paper evaluates the Integrated Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control-approved by the 44 th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization in September 2003 -and its preliminary results. The Integrated Strategy for Dengue is a management model designed to strengthen national programs, with a focus on reducing morbidity, mortality, and the societal and economic burdens produced by outbreaks and epidemics. Currently, 11 of the countries in the Region have developed a plan for or implemented a national strategy. In addition, a sub-Regional plan has been developed for Central America and the Dominican Republic. The Integrated Strategy for Dengue is expected to produce a <b>qualitative</b> <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> in prevention and control through stronger partnerships among the State, its various ministries, and governing bodies, at all levels; private companies; and the range of community and civil groups. Once implemented, this strategy will reduce risk factors for dengue transmission, establish an integrated epidemiological surveillance system, decrease Aedes aegypti mosquito populations, prepare laboratories to better detect and identify the virus, optimize diagnosis and treatment, and, as a result, decrease the frequency, magnitude, and severity of dengue outbreaks and epidemics...|$|E

40|$|Connecting {{genotype}} to phenotype {{is a grand}} challenge of biology. Over the past 50 years, {{there have been numerous}} and powerful advances to meet this challenge, including next-generation sequencing approaches (Jackson et al. 2011), molecular genetic mapping techniques, computational modeling, and the integration of evolutionary theory and tools. In plants, the long history of domestication and breeding has provided multiple insights into the genotype–phenotype equation (Meyer and Purugganan 2013; Olsen and Wendel 2013). Domestication and breeding provide unique systems with which to study the evolution of traits and adaptation to new environments. At present, agriculture faces unprecedented challenges, with the need to continue to increase food quality and food production for a population that will likely exceed 9 billion by 2050, combined with the urgent need to make agriculture more sustainable in an environment that will be altered by climate change (Diouf 2009). Crop wild relatives, however, have evolved under ecological settings that often are more extreme than those under cultivation and thus represent a reservoir of useful adaptive traits. This genetic diversity has mostly been untapped {{because of a lack of}} appropriate tools, both at the genetic level and in describing plant phenotypes and adaptation (Mace et al. 2013). In this context, crop improvement needs to undergo a <b>qualitative</b> <b>leap</b> <b>forward</b> by exploiting the knowledge from the interface of the fields of molecular evolution, bioinformatics, plant physiology, and genetics.

The meeting was divided into three scientific sessions.
