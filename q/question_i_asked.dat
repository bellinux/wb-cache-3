25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the family, I honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start {{at the top of your}} head, or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E
2500|$|After harming his own National Football League lineman {{career by}} {{overtraining}} and focusing {{too much on}} weight and bulk, Marv studied Eastern Bloc training methods and was hired by Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis as the NFL's first strength-and-conditioning coach. Marv later opened his own athletic research center and applied the techniques to his young son, introducing athletic training before Marinovich could leave the crib and continuing it throughout his childhood and adolescence. Marv saw an opportunity to use techniques, focusing on speed and flexibility, that later {{formed the basis for}} modern core training. During her pregnancy, Trudi used no salt, sugar, alcohol, or tobacco; as a baby, Marinovich was fed only fresh vegetables, fruits, and raw milk. Marv Marinovich commented [...] "Some guys {{think the most important thing}} in life is their jobs, the stock market, whatever. [...] To me, it was my kids. The <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> myself was, How well could a kid develop if you provided him with the perfect environment?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Had she {{surprised}} our secret? That was the <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{myself as}} I {{went away to}} light {{the fire in the}} Red Room.

6000|$|... "What's your name, little one?" [...] I began, in as soft a {{voice as}} I could manage. And, by the way, {{why is it}} we always begin by asking little {{children}} their names? Is it because we fancy a name will help to make them a little bigger? You never thought of as king a real large man his name, now, did you?

60|$|The temple {{steps were}} of black lacquer, and the frames of the sliding screens red. That money, lakhs and lakhs of money, had been lavished on the wonder {{impressed}} me but little. I wished {{to know who}} were the men that, when the cryptomerias were saplings, had sat down and spent their lives on a niche or corner of the temple, and dying passed on the duty of adornment to their sons, though neither father nor child hoped to see the work completed.

60|$|The first <b>question</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> of the {{landlord}} was, whether two gentlemen (friends of mine, of course, whom I expected to meet) had driven into Crickgelly, {{a little while}} before me.

Either I had beaten the spies on the road, or they were not bound to Crickgelly. Any way, I had first possession of the field of action. I paid the man who had driven me, and asked my way to Zion Place. My directions were simple--I had only to go through the village, and I should find Zion Place {{at the other end of}} it.|$|E

Who was the Count expected to find {{in the course of his}} studious morning rambles at Blackwater Park? A woman, it was to be presumed, from the terms of Sir Percival's inquiry.

It was neither a confirmation nor a denial, just that helpless smile of his. It as the same with all the <b>questions</b> <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> about Ludwick's murder. Only a shrug of the shoulders.
