5|$|The {{choice of}} method often depends largely on what the {{researcher}} intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or 'triangulate', <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> methods {{as part of a}} 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency.|$|E
5|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} {{nature of}} the study has resulted in information being gathered on subjects ranging from urban planning to gender studies. By using both <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> analyses, and by including considerable amounts of oral history, it has allowed for a vivid recreation of the society of early urban New Zealand. Several books have resulted from the project, among them Sites of Gender: Women, Men and Modernity, 1890–1939, edited by B. Brookes, A. Cooper, and R. Law (Auckland University Press, 2003) and Class and Occupation: The New Zealand Reality by E. Olssen and M. Hickey (University of Otago Press, 2005).|$|E
25|$|I/O {{psychologists have}} also {{employed}} qualitative methods, which largely involve focus groups, interviews, and case studies. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed ethnographic techniques and participant observation. A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique. I/O psychologists sometimes use <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> methods in concert.

The best quantitative studies involve randomized trials where students or classes are randomly assigned different methods {{in order to test}} their effects.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this dissertation are to (1) look at {{gender differences in}} perceptions of stressor events in a family and (2) compare a quantitative study with a qualitative study, both of which look at the {{gender differences in the}} perception of stressors in a family. The dissertation is composed of three separate articles. The first article surveys 1470 families in order to complete a quantitative study examining disturbance from life stressor events and the impact of daily stressors on their lives. The second component of the dissertation uses video-taped interviews of 11 families to look at gender differences in perceptions of stressor events in a family. The third component of this dissertation compares the <b>quantitative</b> study <b>and</b> the <b>qualitative</b> study to understand how each contributes uniquely to the knowledge on family stress. In the <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> the <b>qualitative</b> study, gender differences were reported in perceptions of stressor events, with wives generally rating the events as more disturbing than the husbands.

25|$|Coagulopathy {{is another}} {{cardinal}} feature of ALF. The liver has {{the central role}} in the synthesis of almost all coagulation factors and some inhibitors of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Hepatocellular necrosis leads to impaired synthesis of many coagulation factors and their inhibitors. The former produces a prolongation in prothrombin time which is widely used to monitor the severity of hepatic injury. There is significant platelet dysfunction (with both <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> platelet defects). Progressive thrombocytopenia with the loss of larger and more active platelets is almost universal. Thrombocytopenia with or without DIC increases risk of intracerebral bleeding.|$|E

In the preparation of pre-breeding population and hybrid production, selection of convenient parents that are efficiently distant, is so important. In order to precise description for the sunflower genetic stocks of the Oilseed Department (Seed and Plant Improvement Institute, Karaj, Iran), morphological traits and oil percentage of 49 promising inbred lines including 18 R-lines and 31 B-lines were studied using sunflower descriptor.

25|$|The {{test can}} be scored two ways.

The major categories for these errors are omissions, distortions, perseverations, rotations, misplacements, and size errors. These scores are then be compared to several sets of normative data available in the manual, each representing different demographic characteristics, and conclusions can be drawn by the examiner.

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{human remains}} in the Plymouth area are {{from a number of}} caves around Plymouth Sound. The 'bone caves', located at Cattedown, Oreston, Turnchapel and Stonehouse, contain extensive Upper Palaeolithic deposits, including those of Homo sapiens, some of the earliest such evidence in England. A reindeer bone from one of the Cattedown caves is dated 15,125 ± 390 years B.P. There is no public access to the caves, and they are not easily locatable or visitable. However their archaeological importance is very great, owing to both the geographical location of the Cattedown discovery, in a European context, and to the <b>quantitative</b> <b>and</b> <b>qualitative</b> nature and physical disposition of the human remains; {{this is one of the}} most important discoveries for the early history of anatomically modern humans in Europe.

25|$|Easton {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the “first generation of behavioral revolutionaries” in the discipline of political science.

Easton argued for development of a proper science of political studies that would produce reliable, universal knowledge about social phenomena, and that the purpose of scientific rules of procedure was to make possible the discovery of a highly generalized theory of politics. Easton’s vision was one of a “general theory” of political science that would consist of a deductive system of thought so that a limited number of postulates, as assumptions and axioms, a whole body of empirically valid generalizations might be deduced in descending order of specificity and provide predictive causal explanations of political behavior.|$|E
