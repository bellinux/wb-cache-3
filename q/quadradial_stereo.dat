40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project was the design, {{installation}} and refinement of a fully-automated, six-slide projector, multi-image, multi-media presentation system for the electronic response (ER) instructional component of the general studies biology course (Biology 100) at Ball State University. Secondary emphasis was on the development, production and evaluation of three software programs that would utilize and test {{the capabilities of the}} hardware system. Modular design was used in the fabrication of the multi-image system. Major electronic components used were: one custom-modified Sony <b>Quadradial</b> <b>Stereo</b> Tapecorder Model 854 - 4, one Dynaco Stereo Preamplifier PAT- 4 A, one Dynaco Stereo Amplifier Model 120 A, two Acoustic Research Speakers Mcdel AR- 3 a, one Tandburg Tape-Slide Synchronizer Model 3, one custom-modified Motiva Twelve-Channel Programmer, three custom-modified Kodak Carousel Dissolve Controls Model 2, and six Kodak Ektagraphic Slide Projectors Model E- 2. The system was installed in a custom-designed multi-media cabinet which was located for forward projection onto a custom-built twelvefoot wide screen. Special features of the system included: (1) remote start, (2) control of room lights, (3) independent control of projector lamps within piggyback groups, (4) control of projectors via dissolve controls, (5) integration of half-screen with full-screen visuals, (6) fast recycle of slide projectors at program end, and (7) automatic tape recorder stop and rewind at program end. The software developed for use with the multi-image system consisted of three, group-paced, linear, student response programs titled: Aggression, Territoriality and Survival; Time, Adaptation and Change; and Man, Communication and Behavior. Major steps in the software development process were: (1) program narrative writing and editing; (2) program question writing and editing; (3) identification of visuals, music, and special effects; (4) chartographic and photographic production of visuals; (5) synchronization flowsheet preparation; (6) preparation of paper synchronization tape; (7) preparation of narrative tape with musical background; and (8) synchronizatior of narrative tape with visuals for automated presentation and recycle. Evaluation of the multi-image system involved five, regularlyscheduled sections of Biology 100 classes (approximately 120 students) during Autumn Quarter 1975. A fifteen question, multiple-choice pretest was administered prior to interaction with each student response program; and an identical post-test was administered immediately following each program. Hence, student immediate short-term learning vas measured. Results were computer tabulated and t ratios for non independent means of the pre- and post-tests were determined. The frequency and percentage of students selecting the preferred responses on the preand post-tests, and the percentage increase or decrease were also determined. Analysis of data indicated that there were significant gains in short-term cognitive learning as demonstrated by the results of the t values for the non independent means of the pre- and post-tests which were: 23. 949 for Aggression, Territoriality and Survival; 23. 064 for Time, Adaptation and Change; and 22. 194 for Man, Communication and Behavior. These t values were significant at beyond the. 001 level. Gains in percentage increase resulted on forty-four of the forty-five post-test questions. These results indicate that a well-designed and properly functioning multi-image projection system in conjunction with well-designed software and an independent student response system can be used as an effective instructional tool. Rapid advances in the electronics equipment field preclude the exact duplication of this multi-image system. However, the solid-state equipment currently available will probably circumvent certain equipment shortcomings identified {{during the course of this}} project. More in-depth research studies are recommended to identify those factors within multi-image presentations which cause or reinforce student learning. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
