40|$|Abstract Purpose:The {{challenges}} of cytology for accurate diagnosis {{of breast cancer}} arewell recognized. Wepreviously showed that normal and tumor tissue canbe distinguishedusing a technique called quantitative multiplex methylation-specific PCR (<b>QM-MSP).</b> We hypothesized that quantitative analysis of methylated genes will provide enhanced detection of cancer cells present in cytologic specimens. Experimental Design:QM-MSPwas done on ductal lavage cells from a set of 37 ductal lavage samples from women undergoing mastectomy (27 with cancer and 3 without). Duct histology information was available for each lavaged duct. <b>QM-MSP</b> data was assessed by measuring cumulative methylation index and by receiver operating characteristic threshold analysis. To deter-mine the baseline level of methylation for each gene in this population, cells from 60 ducts of women {{at high risk of}} developing breast cancer were analyzed. Results: <b>QM-MSP</b> findings on a panel of nine genes were correlated to duct histology and ductal lavage cytology. Cytology detected cancer in 33 % (7 of 21 ducts) with a specificity of 99 % (92 of 93). <b>QM-MSP</b> detected cancer as calculated by cumulative methylation index wit...|$|E
40|$|Background Using {{quantitative}} methylation-specific PCR (<b>QM-MSP)</b> is {{a promising}} method for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis from stool samples. Difficulty in eliminating PCR inhibitors of this body fluid {{has been extensively}} reported. Here, spermidine is presented as PCR facilitator {{for the detection of}} stool DNA methylation biomarkers using <b>QM-MSP.</b> We examined its effectiveness with NPY, PENK and WIF 1, three biomarkers which we have previously shown to be of relevance to CRC. Results We determined an optimal window for the amplification of the albumin (Alb) gene (100 ng of bisulfite-treated stool DNA added of 1 mM spermidine) at which we report that spermidine acts as a PCR facilitator (AE[*]=[*] 1680...|$|E
40|$|Women known with a {{familial}} predisposition or {{a personal}} history {{of breast cancer}} bear an up to 85 % lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Despite regular screening, up to 50 % of these women develop “interval malignancies” that are discovered in between screening visits. Therefore, novel ways of screening that could improve the accuracy of imaging-based screening methods are needed. This thesis describes the studies that we have performed {{in order to establish}} the potential role of methylation alterations in nipple fluid as a way of early breast cancer detection in women at increased risk. DNA methylation describes the addition of a methyl group to the cytosine base of the DNA. In tumorigenesis, hypermethylation of gene promoters is associated with silencing of transcription and in this way contributes to cancer initiation and progression. Methylation alterations frequently occur in early stages of tumor development and may therefore serve as valuable biomarkers for breast carcinogenesis. We showed that nipple aspiration is feasible in the majority of healthy volunteers and high-risk women. Previously reported success rates were only 27 - 66 %, which prohibited the clinical application of this method. Using oxytocin nasal spray, we were the first to show success rates of 90 % in high-risk women, including women that previously underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery of the breast. We demonstrated that, using Quantitative Multiplex Methylation-Specific PCR (<b>QM-MSP),</b> a quantitative sodium-bisulfite (NaBi) based methylation assay, we were able to analyze methylation of multiple genes in > 99 % of nipple aspirates. In a side-by-side comparison, <b>QM-MSP</b> proved to be much more sensitive than other commonly used methylation assays and enabled reproducible methylation analysis i...|$|E
40|$|Background: DNA {{methylation}} is {{a well-known}} epigenetic mechanism involved in epigenetic gene regulation. Several genes were reported hypermethylated in CRC, althought no gene marker was proven to be individually of sufficient sensitivity or specificity in routine clinical practice. Here, we identified novel epigenetic markers and assessed their combined use for diagnostic accuracy. Methods: We used methylation arrays on samples from several effluents to characterize methylation profiles in CRC samples and controls, as established by colonoscopy and pathology findings, and selected two differentially methylated candidate epigenetic genes (NPY, PENK). To this gene panel we added WIF, {{on the basis of}} being reported in literature as silenced by promoter hypermethylation in several cancers, including CRC. We measured their methylation degrees by quantitative multiplex-methylation specific PCR (<b>QM-MSP)</b> on 15 paired carcinomas and adjacent non-cancerous colorectal tissues and we subsequently performed a clinical validation on two different series of 266 serums, subdivided in 32 CRC, 26 polyps, 47 other cancers and 161 with normal colonoscopy. We assessed the results by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), using cumulative methylation index (CMI) as variable threshold. Results: We obtained CRC detection on tissues with both sensitivity and specificity of 100 %. On serum CRC samples, we obtained sensitivity/specificity values of, e. g., 87 %/ 80 %, 78 %/ 90 % and 59 %/ 95 %, and negative predictive value/positive predictive value figures of 97 %/ 47 %, 95 %/ 61 % and 92 %/ 70 %. On serum samples from other cancers we obtained sensitivity/specificity of, e. g, 89 %/ 25 %, 43 %/ 80 % and 28 %/ 91 %. Conclusions: We showed the potential of NPY, PENK, and WIF 1 as combined epigenetic markers for CRC diagnosis, both in tissue and serum and tested their use as serum biomarkers in other cancers. We optimized a <b>QM-MSP</b> for simultaneously quantifying their methylation levels. Our assay can be an effective blood test for patients where CRC risk is present but difficult to assess (e. g. mild symptoms with no CRC family history) and who would therefore not necessarily choose to go for further examination. This panel of markers, if validated, can also be a cost effective screening tool for the detection of asymptomatic cancer patients for colonoscopy...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Nipple fluid {{aspiration}} provides direct non-invasive {{sampling of}} fluid from the mammary ductal system, {{where the majority}} of breast cancers originate. DNA promoter hypermethylation ("methylation") occurs early and at high frequency in breast carcinogenesis, bearing the potential as a biomarker for cancer detection at its earliest stages. We assessed methylation in nipple fluid from breasts of healthy women, of women with sporadic breast cancer and of their contralateral breasts. Our goal was to investigate whether nipple fluid {{can be used as a}} reliable methylation biomarker source. METHODS: Methylation levels of 13 genes were analysed by quantitative multiplex-methylation specific PCR (<b>QM-MSP)</b> in nipple fluid samples from breasts of healthy women, and from the affected and contralateral breasts of breast cancer patients. RESULTS: Methylation analysis of the low-volume nipple fluid samples was feasible. Despite the generally low methylation levels, cancerous and healthy breasts nipple fluid could be discriminated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0. 64 (p< 0. 01) based on a multivariate model including AKR 1 B 1, ALX 1, RASSF 1 A and TM 6 SF 1. Within-patient differences between cancerous and contralateral nipple fluid samples were less prominent. CONCLUSIONS: Cancerous nipple fluid contains increased levels of methylation of tumor suppressor genes that potentially could serve as a biomarker for early breast cancer detection...|$|E
