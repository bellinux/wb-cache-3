40|$|Eight {{field trials}} were {{conducted}} from 2006 to 2008 at various locations in Ontario {{to evaluate the}} co-application of postemergence herbicides with cyhalothrin-lambda or dimethoate insecticides in cranberry and white bean. At 2 weeks after treatment, the addition of cyhalothrin-lambda or dimethoate insecticides to sethoxydim, <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl,</b> bentazon, fomesafen and bentazon plus fomesafen did not increase injury at the Exeter and Ridgetown locations except for bentazon plus dimethoate which caused greater injury than bentazon alone (2. 9 % vs 0. 2 %) in 2006. However at Harrow, the addition of dimethoate to <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> increased injury (0 % vs 4. 9 %) in 2007 and the addition cyhalothrin-lambda or dimethoate to sethoxydim increased injury in 2008 in dry bean. The addition of cyhalothrin-lambda to <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> also increased injury (0 % vs 4. 5 %) in 2008. There was no adverse effect on dry bean injury with other treatments at Harrow in 2007 or 2008. The addition of cyhalothrin-lambda or dimethoate to the herbicides evaluated {{did not have any}} adverse effect on plant height, shoot dry weight or yield of dry bean except for bentazon plus dimethoate which decreased shoot dry weight 20 % compared to bentazon alone at Harrow in 2008. Based on these results, cyhalothrin-lambda or dimethoate can be tank-mixed with sethoxydim, <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl,</b> bentazon, fomesafen and bentazon plus fomesafen when the optimum application timing of these herbicides and insecticides coincide...|$|E
40|$|Herbicides {{adversely}} affect both the target plant and its environment. In this study, Helianthus annuus L. cv. “Oliva CL ” was treated post-emergence with 0. 3 to 3. 1 mM <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl.</b> The peroxidase activity (POD), ascorbate peroxidase activity (APX), lipid peroxidation, pigment sys-tem and total phenolic content were then determined on the 1 st, 5 th, 10 th and 15 th days following treatment. The POD activity increased on all application days, and the APX activity increased on the 5 th day and decreased on the 10 th and 15 th days. In addition, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was increased on the 1 st, 5 th, 10 th and 15 th days, {{except for the}} in H. annuus plants treated with 1. 6 to 3. 1 mM <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl.</b> The total chlorophyll, carotenoid and total phenolic content were important and changed in a time dependent manner. In the present study, we also investigated the possible role of salicylic acid (SA) in protecting H. annuus seedlings from herbi-cide toxicity. The plants were first treated with 0. 5 mM SA pre-emergence and then treated with 0. 3 to 3. 1 mM <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> herbicide post-emergence. In general, increases in the POD activity and MDA content were observed in the treatment groups on all application days. In the treate...|$|E
40|$|Three {{populations of}} {{silky bent grass}} (Apera spica-venti L.) were tested – one that is {{susceptible}} and two that are resistant to sulfonylureas. This study assessed the efficacy of control by different herbicides in a pot experiment and estimated the molecular status of resistance to sulfonylureas in analysed populations {{and its effect on}} the efficacy of different chemical treatments. The three most effective herbicide rotation schemes were: 1) chlorsulfuron + isoproturon, ethametsulfuron + metazachlor + quinmerac, chlorsulfuron + isoproturon; 2) prosulfocarb + diflufenican, ethametsulfuron + <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl,</b> prosulfocarb + diflufenican; 3) diflufenican + flufenacet, <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl,</b> diflufenican + flufenacet. In most cases it was more difficult to destroy 100 % of the resistant population from Modgarby where the majority of plants had no mutation in the als gene. In the resistant population from Babin there were significantly more individuals with mutation in the als gene, therefore exhibiting target-site resistance...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{evaluated}} the selectivity of herbicides applied post-emergence on ornamental plants of Alpinia purpurata, Strelitzia reginae and Heliconia psittacorum. The {{study was conducted}} in two seasons. The experimental design was completely randomized with four replications. The treatments were: fluazifop-p-butyl (87. 5 g ha- 1), <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> (75. 0 g ha- 1), sethoxydim (184. 0 g ha- 1), quinclorac (375. 0 g ha- 1), chlorimuron-ethyl (15. 0 g ha- 1), clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (37. 5 + 37. 5 g ha- 1), bentazon (720. 0 g ha- 1), fomesafen (225. 0 g ha- 1), and a control without any herbicide. In general, all tested herbicides and doses were selective for the three studied species. Although plants of A. purpurata and H. psittacorum have shown symptoms of phytotoxicity, recovery occurred with subsequent satisfactory visual appearance {{at the end of the}} evaluations. However, the S. reginae plants showed the smallest dry mass values when the sethoxydim and <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> herbicides were sprayed...|$|E
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, Spain, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received from Nissan Chemical Europe an application to modify the existing MRLs of quizalofop-P in rapeseed, sunflower, cotton and soybean. Spain drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. The submitted residue trials lead to MRL proposals of 0. 3 mg/kg for rapeseed and 0. 4 mg/kg for sunflower. These proposals are already covered by the existing EU MRL of 0. 5 mg/kg for rapeseed and by the proposals of 0. 7 mg/kg made by EFSA for sunflower in an application related to the ester variant quizalofop-P-tefuryl. EFSA is therefore of the opinion that the uses of <b>quizalofop-P-ethyl</b> on oilseed rape and sunflower do not necessitate any change to the existing EU MRLs or to the proposals done in a previous MRL application. The extrapolations to cotton and soybean are not recommended, since not in line with the rules defined in the current EU guideline. An enforcement method referenced AN 34 validated to control <b>quizalofop-P-ethyl</b> residues in oily matrices has been submitted. This method is however an outdated method using techniques no longer in use in laboratories for routine analyses. Considering that a LC-MS/MS method corresponding to the current analytical standards has been developed to analyse the samples from the trials performed from 2007, EFSA is of the opinion that validation data, including an ILV, have to be requested for such an analytical method. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed uses of <b>quizalofop-P-ethyl</b> on oilseed rape and sunflower will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference value and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|E
40|$|Alfalfa(Medicago sativa) {{is one of}} {{important}} legume forages worldwide. However, weed is the main factor limiting alfalfa production. Biomass quality and yield and stability of dry matter production during cultivation are directly associated with the interference of weeds which compete with alfalfa for water, light and nutrients. The use of herbicides is a good alternative for weed control. In order to control weed in alfalfa field with suitable herbicide in Yellow River delta, the effect of four herbicides(imazethapyr, <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl,</b> haloxyfop-r-methyl and oxyfluorfen) with different concentration on afalfal yield and weed community characteristics were studied. The results showed that both imazethapyr and haloxyfop-r-methyl treatments could increase alfalfa yield, and the best herbicide application concentration was imazethapyr with 2 000 mL·hm- 2 and haloxyfop-r-methyl with 700 mL·hm- 2, but oxyfluorfen treatment would limit alfalfa growth significantly. Weed species numbers in the treatments of imazethapyr, <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> and oxyfluorfen decreased significantly. Digitariasanguinalis, Portulacaoleracea and Echinochloacrusgalli were more difficult to control from specie important value in all treatments. Species diversity index decreased with higher herbicide concentration in all treatments. From this study, herbicide imazethapyr with 2 000 mL·hm- 2 application concentration was the best weed control method, and the second one was haloxyfop-r-methyl with 700 mL·hm- 2 application concentration...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} biostimulants such as Crop Booster and RR SoyBooster on dry bean under Ontario {{environmental}} conditions is not known. A total of 12 field experiments (6 in cranberry bean “Etna” and 6 in white bean “OAC REX”) were conducted at two locations (Ridgetown and Exeter, Ontario, Canada) {{to evaluate the}} effect of Crop Booster and RR SoyBooster on visible injury, shoot dry weight, height and yield of cranberry and white bean. Visible injury ranged from 0 % to 7. 3 % in white bean and 0 % to 9. 4 % in cranberry bean with <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl,</b> bentazon, fomesafen, ben-tazon plus fomesafen, imazethapyr and imazethapyr plus bentazon alone or in combination with Crop Booster and RR SoyBooster. The addition of Crop Booster or RR SoyBooster to herbicides evaluated had no significant effect on shoot dry weight, height, seed moisture content and yield of white or cranberry bean except {{with the addition of}} RR SoyBooster to <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> which increased height 3. 7 % and the addition of the Crop Booster to bentazon which decreased shoot dry weight 12 % and the addition of Crop Booster to bentazon plus fomesafen which increased shoot dry weight 17 % in white bean. Based on these results, there were minimal effects from the addition of Crop Booster or RR SoyBooster to commonly used herbicides in white and cranberry bean...|$|E
40|$|Objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar a eficácia de herbicidas inibidores da ACCase, aplicados isoladamente ou em associações, no controle das espécies de plantas daninhas pertencentes à família das gramíneas Brachiaria decumbens, Digitaria ciliaris, Eleusine indica, Brachiaria plantaginea e Cenchrus echinatus, na cultura da soja. O experimento foi conduzido em campo, em delineamento de blocos ao acaso com quatro repetições. Os tratamentos avaliados foram: {{clethodim}} (84 g ha- 1), clethodim + <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> (48 + 40 g ha- 1), [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] (50 + 50 g ha- 1), sethoxydim (230 g ha- 1), tepraloxydim (100 g ha- 1), fluazifop-p-butyl (125 g ha- 1), haloxyfop-methyl (60 g ha- 1) e testemunha sem herbicida. A convivência das plantas de soja com as gramíneas infestantes resultou em perda significativa na produtividade de grãos. Os melhores níveis de controle de B. decumbens foram verificados com a utilização de haloxyfop-methyl. Tepraloxydim pode ser considerado seletivo a B. decumbens. Nenhum tratamento proporcionou controle final de D. ciliaris superior a 90 %, porém menor eficiência foi verificada quando se aplicaram sethoxydim e fluazifop-p-butyl. Apenas os tratamentos sethoxydim e [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] não mostraram controle satisfatório de E. indica. B. plantaginea foi a espécie mais facilmente controlada pelos herbicidas avaliados; no entanto, haloxyfop-methyl, tepraloxydim, clethodim e [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] se destacaram no controle dessa invasora. A adição de <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> ao clethodim proporcionou incremento significativo no controle de C. echinatus. Também os herbicidas haloxyfop-methyl e tepraloxydim apresentaram controle satisfatório dessa espécie daninha. The {{objective of}} this work was to evaluate the efficacy of ACCase-inhibitors (ariloxyfenoxypropionates and cyclohexanodiones), applied alone or in combination, in controlling the grass weed species Brachiaria decumbens, Digitaria ciliaris, Eleusine indica, Brachiaria plantaginea and Cenchrus echinatus in soybean crop. The study {{was carried out in}} the field in a randomized block design with four replicates. The following treatments were evaluated: clethodim (84 g ha- 1), clethodim + <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> (48 + 40 g ha- 1), [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] (50 + 50 g ha- 1), sethoxydim (230 g ha- 1), tepraloxydim (100 g ha- 1), fluazifop-p-butyl (125 g ha- 1), haloxyfop-methyl (60 g ha- 1) and control (no herbicide). In the presence of the infesting weeds, soybean grain yield was significantly reduced. The highest efficiency of B. decumbens control was observed with the application of haloxyfop-methyl. Tepraloxydim was quite selective to B. decumbens. No treatment promoted a final control of D. ciliaris higher than 90 %; nevertheless, the lowest efficiencies were verified with the application of sethoxydim and fluazifop-p-butyl. The only treatments that did not present a satisfactory control of E. indica were sethoxydim and [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl]. The species most easily controlled by the herbicides evaluated was B. plantaginea. However, haloxyfop-methyl, tepraloxydim, clethodim and [clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl] presented the highest efficiency rates for controlling this weed. The addition of <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> to clethodim significantly increased C. echinatus control The herbicides haloxyfop-methyl and tepraloxydim also presented a satisfactory control of this grass weed...|$|E
40|$|Herbicides are an {{efficient}} weed-control method, and herbicide selectivity {{with regard to}} palm species is an important subject of agricultural research. Owing {{to a lack of}} studies in the literature regarding the use of herbicides on palm trees, especially during the early stages of growth, the present study aimed to evaluate the selectivity of some herbicides during the early development of Alexander palm (Archontophoenix alexandrae) and peach palm (Bactris gasipaes) seedlings. The study was conducted in two seasons in a completely randomized design with eight treatments and four repetitions. The herbicide treatments and dosages (g i. a. ha- 1), were as follows: fluazifop-p-butyl (93. 8), sethoxydim (184. 0), <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> (75. 0) clethodim + fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (50. 0 + 50. 0), fomesafen (225. 0), lactofen (168. 0), and nicosulfuron (50. 0), and a no-herbicide control was included. The seedlings of both types of trees were transplanted into 3. 1 -L plastic containers. In the first study, herbicide was applied to Alexander palm seedlings of 25 – 30 cm in height. In the second study, herbicide was applied to Alexander palm seedlings of 30 – 40 cm in height. Herbicide was applied to peach palm tree seedlings of 40 – 55 cm in height in both studies. In peach palms only, the herbicides caused slight visible damage during early development. Collectively, the results suggested that all herbicides used are selective and can be used on peach palms during the various stages of development when there are one to four leaves. For Alexander palms, fluazifop-p-butyl, <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl,</b> and lactofen were the only herbicides that did not affect early development during the stages when the plant had one to four leaves...|$|E

40|$|The strain JPL- 2, {{capable of}} {{degrading}} fenoxaprop-P-ethyl (FE), was {{isolated from the}} soil of a wheat field and identified as Rhodococcus ruber. This strain could utilize FE as its sole carbon source and degrade 94. 6 % of 100 mg L− 1 FE in 54 h. Strain JPL- 2 could also degrade other aryloxyphenoxy propanoate (AOPP) herbicides. The initial step of the degradation pathway is to hydrolyze the carboxylic acid ester bond. A novel esterase gene feh, encoding the FE-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase (FeH) responsible for this initial step, was cloned from strain JPL- 2. Its molecular mass was approximately 39 kDa, and the catalytic efficiency of FeH followed the order of FE > <b>quizalofop-P-ethyl</b> > clodinafop-propargyl > cyhalofop-butyl > fluazifop-P-butyl > haloxyfop-P-methyl > diclofop-methy, which indicated that the chain length of the alcohol moiety strongly affected the hydrolysis activity of the FeH toward AOPP herbicides...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the occurrence of weeds {{and the performance of}} common bean grown on different types of plant residues managed with herbicides, in a no-till system. The treatments were arranged in split plots in a randomized block design with three replications. Prior to sowing common bean in the no-till system, plant residues of sorghum, maize, jack bean, sunflower, stylosanthes, rice, soybean and weeds were spread on the plots. Common bean was sown after chemical drying of the cover species. The two secondary treatments in split plots after bean sowing consisted of herbicide absence and the use of a mixture of the herbicides fomesafen (applied at a rate of 100 g ha- 1, 20 days after bean emergence-DAE) and <b>quizalofop-p-ethyl</b> (applied at a rate of 70 g ha- 1, 25 DAE). Sorghum produced highest amounts of straw as well as the best soil cover. The plant residues did not influence the establishment of common bean. Herbicide application controlled weeds efficiently.
