Residual traces in the raw synthesis gas after quench could bring about the poisoning of catalysts and corrosion effects on plant facilities. The objective of this work is to investigate the effects of quenching operation on the trace components during test campaigns of the autothermal non-catalytic reforming of natural gas (Gas-POX) mode in the HP POX (high pressure partial oxidation) test plant. In order to achieve this, Aspen Plus simulation model of the <b>quench</b> <b>chamber</b> of the HP POX test plant was developed to re-calculate the <b>quench</b> <b>chamber</b> input amount of different trace compounds from their output amount measured during test points of the Gas-POX campaigns. Variation in quench water temperatures from 130 °C to 220 °C and pH value of quench water as well as the resulting variation in Henry´s and Dissociation constant of the traces (CO 2, H 2 S, NH 3 and HCN) changed the distribution of traces calculated in the quench water. The formation of traces of organic acid (formic acid and acetic acid) and traces of BTEX, PAHs and soot in the quench water effluent were discussed. The discrepancies between equilibrium constant and reaction quotient (non-equilibrium or real) for the formation of NH 3 and HCN at the exit of the gasifier were discussed. The assessment of the results in this work should lead to the improvement in the understanding of trace components and concepts that could be employed to influence their formation and reduction...|$|E

This paper uses high speed optical arc imaging to investigate arc motion in a LVSD as the vent aperture conditions are varied.

40|$|The King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing Wastewater Treatment Plant treats {{industrial}} sewer wastewater {{from nearly}} 200 manufacturing buildings for Eastman Kodak Company located at Kodak Park in Rochester, NY. The average throughput for {{the facility is}} 28 million gallons of wastewater per day (MGD) and discharges the resulting effluent into the Genesee River. Through a series of physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes, materials are removed from the wastewater and sludge is produced. The sludge is conveyed through a belt press for dewatering prior to incineration. The dewatered sludge is sent to a multiple hearth incinerator with a secondary combustion chamber/afterburner for thermal treatment. From the combustion and incineration process, off-gases are produced. Therefore, air pollution control equipment is needed to treat the gas stream. At King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing, an induced draft fan creates negative pressure through the hearth along {{with a series of}} air pollution control equipment (APCE) consisting of a <b>quench</b> <b>chamber,</b> condenser/scrubber, venturi, entrainment separator, and a wet electrostatic precipitator (WESP). This equipment captures the components in the air stream through processes such as gas saturation, caustic neutralization, and electron particle collection. The WESP is a device that is used for fine particle collection in the range of 1 micron or less. Upon entereing the unit, the particles in the gas stream are given a charge. The particles accumulate {{on the surface of the}} WESP and are periodically flushed out and collected in the wash water. The efficiency of particles removed from the WESP can be indirectly correlated by the power value measured in KVA (kilovolt amps). As the power decreases, the particulate collection efficiency is lowered. This is due to the increased resistance in the system. Although there is system variability, the King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing multiple hearth incinerator and associated air pollution control equipment operates in accordance with all relevant environmental standards. The purpose of this thesis is to use statistical analysis tools to determine the significant variables that affect the performance and efficiency of the WESP. The WESP is the last unit in the air pollution control equipment (APCE) system at King 2 ̆ 7 s Landing. Since the WESP is the final air-polishing device in the system, its optimal performance is critical. The WESP is subject to the most variability from the upstream APCE as well as the combustion process because it is the final unit in the system.

40|$|Gas {{quenching}} {{has been}} known for centuries as a convenient, affordable method to heat treat ferrous alloys. Heated parts are taken out of the furnace and quenched at ambient pressure, casually using a blower to increase the heat exchange. Technical developments in the metal industry, over the last decades, have seen a constant improvement of the ratio of heat exchange, e. g. by using pressured chambers, specific blowers, and a variety of gases and gas mixtures. The current gas quenching technologies are adapted to heat treatable metals found in the automotive industry, requesting a minimum heat exchange ratio, also depending on the part geometry. Little has been however investigated concerning the quenched batch, defined as the arrangement of the heated parts onto a single- or multiple-layer charge carrier. The present work, through a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, provides guidelines to adapt the batch to a specific gas flow pattern (spatial fitting), and to adapt the gas flow pattern to the batch structure (temporal fitting). Measurement techniques have been developed to assess the flow patterns inside industrial <b>quenching</b> <b>chambers.</b> Evaluated flow structures have been converted to numerical boundary conditions for extended simulations tools. Simulations have helped implementing technical solutions for flow correction in industrial gas <b>quenching</b> <b>chambers.</b> Furthermore, simulations have served the design of batches of various geometries, to improve both quenching homogeneity and intensity. Both experimental and numerical results confirmed the advantages of gas quenching for the homogeneous heat treatment of automotive steel grades, and demonstrated the potential of various flow correcting devices, such as perforated plates and cylindrical flow ducts. Heat treatment gas and spray quenching has also been integrated into the forging and the turning process chains of single components, successfully optimizing the lean process flow (automation, quality, and time), for various high-performance materials and part geometries...|$|R

By great agitation and velocity of quenchant, the vapor blanket is reduced or prevented during water quench, allowing uniform hardening of the surface. In this study, the cooling severity of a spray quenching system and a high-speed <b>quenching</b> <b>chamber</b> are studied. Cylindrical samples of AISI 304 stainless steel (20 mm in diameter and 100 mm length) were employed to characterize the cooling severity. Thermal data was acquired through K-type thermocouples placed in the sample at three positions, 1 mm below surface, mid-radius and at center of the specimen, connected to a data acquisition system. High thermal gradients were observed in both systems, being the high-speed chamber the severest cooling. The maximum cooling rate obtained at the surface was 470 and 300 °C/s for the high-speed chamber and the spray system, respectively. In addition, 5160 spring steel samples were quenched for short times in both systems; the cooling was interrupted to avoid through transformation and to produce a case-core type microstructure.

To {{make sure that the}} chambers and syringes are filled correctly, a NASA representative may assist the customer. The data needed is the approximate growth time, the growth temperature, and the desired crystal size, but this data can be changed anytime from the ground, if needed. The chambers are gathered and placed into numbered slots in special drawers. Then, data is entered into a computer for each of the chambers. Technicians map out when each chamber's growth should be activated so that all of the chambers have enough time to grow. All of this data is up-linked to the space station when the previous growth session is over. Anti-vibrational containers need to be constructed for the high forces encountered during the lift off and the landing of the space shuttle, and though our team has not designed these containers, we do not feel that there is any reason why a suitable one could not be made. When the shuttle reaches the space station, an astronaut removes a drawer of <b>quenched</b> <b>chambers</b> from the growth facility and inserts a drawer of new chambers. All twelve of the drawers can be replaced in this fashion. The optical disks can also be removed this way. The old drawers are stored for the trip back to earth. Once inside the growth facility, a chamber is removed by the robot and placed in one of 144 active sites at a time previously picked by a technician. Growth begins when the chamber is inserted into an active site. Then, the sensing system starts to determine the size of the protein crystal. All during the crystal's growth, the customer can view the crystal and read all of the crystal's data, such as growth rate and crystal size. When the sensing system determines that the crystal has reached the predetermined size, the robot is told to pick up a syringe filled with the correct quenchant solution and inject it into the chamber to stop the crystal growth. The chamber is then removed from the active site and placed into its original storage slot. Another chamber is then placed into the active site and the process is repeated in all of the active sites until all of the chambers have complted their growth. After ninety days (the scheduled time between shuttle visits), the crystal growth is completed, and the old drawers are replaced with new ones. Once the customer extracts the crystals, the chambers are retrieved for future customers...|$|R
