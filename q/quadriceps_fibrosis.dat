30|$|In {{surgery for}} {{dislocation}} of the patella, {{it is difficult}} to obtain a normal position of the patella in children using soft-tissue balancing procedures alone. In our cases of pediatric dislocation of the patella caused by iatrogenic <b>quadriceps</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> the three-part surgical procedure combining capsulorrhaphy, quadricepsplasty, and transfer of the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) to the superior border of the patella showed great success in restoring the realignment mechanism of the patella.

30|$|Since 2004, our {{surgical}} {{team has}} treated dislocation of the patella in children using a three-part surgical procedure that combines capsulorrhaphy and quadricepsplasty with transferring the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) to the superior {{border of the}} patella. This paper’s objective was to evaluate the clinical and functional results of a surgical treatment of patellar dislocation whose etiology was iatrogenic <b>quadriceps</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in children. This technique has the benefits of simplicity and effectiveness in restoring the realignment mechanism of the patella.|$|E
30|$|Patellar {{dislocation}} {{is common}} in children, and many operations have been described for its treatment [1, 2, 3]. Surgical treatments include both proximal and distal realignment of the extensor mechanism, and most involve considerable surgical trauma, a large scar, and prolonged rehabilitation. Many factors contribute to patellar dislocation, including (1) congenital mechanisms (i.e., generalized ligamentous laxity, dysplasia of the patella or the femoral condyles, genu valgum, tight lateral bands, and patella alta [1, 2, 3]) and (2) a secondary mechanism, due to iatrogenic <b>quadriceps</b> <b>fibrosis</b> after intramuscular antibiotic(s) injections changed vector pull quadriceps, and fibrous vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and lateral retinacular patella; degeneration and contracture of the rectus femoris and vastus medialis.|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the clinical and functional {{results of a}} surgical treatment of patellar dislocation whose eti-ology was iatrogenic <b>quadriceps</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in children. Materials and methods A prospective study was under-taken from February 2004 to December 2009. The study included 54 pediatric patients (56 knees) that had devel-oped dislocation of the patella after repeated intramuscular injections of antibiotic(s) into the quadriceps muscle. There were 11 males (20. 4 %) and 43 females (79. 6 %). The patients ’ mean age at surgery was 7 years, 9 months (range 6 years, 4 months to 12 years, 6 months). A complete history of each patient was recorded. The affected knees were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively {{on the basis of}} the symptoms, signs, and roentgenographic find-ings. Patellar dislocation was classified according Bensa-hel’s criteria. All patients had a three-part surgical procedure that combined capsulorrhaphy, quadricepsplasty, and transfer of the vastus medialis oblique to the superior border of the patella. Results There has been no poor postsurgical result or recurrence so far; we have noted an ugly scar in nine knees (16. 1 %), limitation of the knee flexion in five knees (8. 9 %), and loss of extension of 5 – 20 in four knees (7. 1 %). Overall, we attained excellent results in 39 knees (69. 7 %), good results in 13 knees (23. 2 %), and fair results in four knees (7. 1 %). Conclusion In our cases of pediatric dislocation of the patella caused by iatrogenic <b>quadriceps</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> the intro-duced three-part surgical procedure has shown great suc-cess in restoring the realignment mechanism of the patella. The technique is simple, safe, and effective in skeletally immature children...|$|E
40|$|Habitual {{dislocation}} of the patella (HDP) {{is a rare}} condi-tion. It presents as {{a lateral}} dislocation of the patella each time the knee is flexed, returning to the midline with extension of the knee. Habitual dislocation of the patella in children with open growth plates has usually been regarded as vastus lateralis fibrosis following multiple injections in the thigh, 5, 35 <b>quadriceps</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> 1, 17 or medial laxity of the patella. 3, 5, 14 Many surgical procedures have been reported 5, 14, 35 to treat it using wide lateral release, lengthening of the rectus femoris, and medial augmenta-tion, with around 80 % satisfactory results. For HDP in adults, several predisposing factors will aggravate the patel-lar instability, including trochlear dysplasia, 10, 21, 33, 34 insuffi-ciency of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL), 8, 9, 32 patella alta, 2, 10, 31 abnormal Q-angle, 18, 30 and genu valgum. 16 There are currently several surgical options to correct the pathophysiology of patellar dislocations, including lat-eral retinaculum release, MPFL reconstruction, trochleo-plasty, and distal realignment.

40|$|Background: In {{tropical}} countries, iatrogenic retractile <b>quadriceps</b> <b>fibrosis</b> (IRQF), {{the cause}} of walking handicap in children, is often the result of intraquadricipital injection of quinine salts. The aim of this review was to analyse the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic aspects and outcome of IRQF in children admitted in three hospitals in Benin Republic. Patients and Methods: It was a 10 -year retrospective, descriptive and analytic survey of IRQF, involving 81 children aged from 8 months to 15 years. Iterative mobilization of the knee (IMK) or modified distal quadriceps plasty by Thompson-Payr′s technique (MDQTPT), with a POP on the knee in flexion position, was performed with additional functional rehabilitation. The results were evaluated on knee flexion gain and walking quality. Data were processed using Epi Info 3. 2 software. Results: Patients′ average age was 7. 60 years. Children of 6 - 10 years were most affected; sex ratio was 1. 02. Lesions were unilateral (71. 6 %) and bilateral (28. 4 %). The knees′ stiffness was in flexion (10. 57 %), rectitude (64. 42 %) and recurvatum (25 %). The amyotrophy of the thigh was found in 79. 42 %. The IMK was successful in eight cases (7. 69 %) and the MDQTPT was done in 98 cases (94. 23 %) associated with femoral osteotomy in 13 cases (12. 50 %). In post-surgical period, skin necrosis and fractures occurred respectively in 15. 31 % and 5. 10 %. Results were good in 92. 31 % of cases. Conclusions: IRQF in children do exist in our settings. The treatment {{that is based on}} MDQTPT associated to rehabilitation leads to acceptable outcome...|$|E
