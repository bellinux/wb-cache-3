2500|$|The {{extent to}} which tooth decay is likely, known as cariogenicity, depends on factors such as how long the sugar remains in the mouth. Contrary to common belief, {{it is not the}} amount of sugar {{ingested}} but the frequency of sugar ingestion that is {{the most important factor in}} the causation of tooth decay. [...] When the pH in the mouth initially decreases from the ingestion of sugars, the enamel is demineralized and left vulnerable for about 30 minutes. Eating a greater <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> in one sitting does not increase the time of demineralization. Similarly, eating a lesser <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> in one sitting does not decrease the time of demineralization. Thus, eating a great <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> at one time in the day is less detrimental than is a very small quantity ingested in many intervals throughout the day. For example, in terms of oral health, it is better to eat a single dessert at dinner time than to snack on a bag of candy throughout the day.|$|E

At first, the United States was {{concerned}} about Batista's intentions; whether he would align his country with the Axis cause, or that of the Allies. Batista, shortly after becoming president, legalized a pro-fascist organization linked to Francisco Franco and his regime in Spain, but fear of any Nazi sympathies was dispelled when Batista sent the British a large <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> as a gift. Later, fear of Batista's possible sympathy for Franco was also dispelled when the president suggested to the United States that it launch a joint US-Latin American invasion of Spain, in order to overthrow Franco and his regime.

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1864, Blackwell sold a large {{property}} whose proceeds allowed him to pay off all his debt, including the mortgage on a house he and brother George had purchased for their mother, as well as purchase property on Martha's Vineyard and invest a large sum in government bonds. Additional land [...] trades {{over the next few}} years and the rental income they produced gave Blackwell, as his daughter termed it, a [...] "competence" [...] that enabled him [...] "to devote himself fully to the progressive causes which he always had at heart." [...] Around 1872, Stone told Francis J. Garrison in confidence that she and Blackwell could live on their income and thus [...] "cheerfully give" [...] their time and effort to the Woman's Journal. Blackwell continued to dabble in business that interested him. In 1871 he was part of a presidential committee sent to Santo Domingo to explore commercial ramifications of a possible annexation, and even after annexation failed he continued to promote a model commercial base in the country. Blackwell continued to be keenly interested in developing a successful alternative to cane sugar as a means of combating slavery in the West Indies. After obtaining a patent for a new refining method, he established the Maine Sugar Beet Company in 1878. Although early in its operation he telegraphed Stone: [...] "Beet sugar manufacture a success. Slavery in Cuba is doomed," [...] he and his partners found it impossible to obtain the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> beets to keep the enterprise going, and shut the operation down in 1882.|$|E

60|$|A {{little further}} on {{we stopped at}} a village to refresh the horses. The auberge where we stopped was built like a great barn, with an earth floor, desolate and comfortless. The people looked poor and ground down, {{as if they had}} not a thought above the {{coarsest}} animal wants. The dirty children, with their hair tangled beyond all hope of combing, had the begging whine, and the trick of raising their hands for money, when one looked at them, which is universal in the Catholic parts of Switzerland. Indeed, {{all the way from the}} Sardinian frontier we had been dogged by beggars continually. Parents seemed to look upon their children as valuable only for this purpose; the very baby in arms is taught to make a pitiful little whine, and put out its fat hand, if your eye rests on it. The fact is, they are poor--poor because invention, enterprise, and intellectual vigor--all that surrounds the New England mountain farmer with competence and comfort--are quenched and dead, by the combined influence of a religion and government whose interest it is to keep people stupid that they may be manageable. Yet the Savoyards, as a race, it seems to me, are naturally intelligent; and I cannot but hope that the liberal course lately adopted by the Sardinian government may at last reach them. My heart yearns over many of the bright, pretty children, whose little hands have been up, from time to time, around our carriage. I could not help thinking what good schools and good instruction might do for them. It is not their fault, poor little things, that they are educated to whine and beg, and grow up rude, uncultured, to bring forth another set of children just like themselves; but what to do with them is the question. One generally begins with giving money; but a day or two of experience shows that it would be just about as hopeful to feed the locusts of Egypt on a loaf of bread. But it is hard to refuse children, especially to a mother who has left five or six at home, and who fancies she sees, in some of these little eager, childish faces, something now and then that reminds her of her own. For my part, I got schooled so that I could stand them all, except the little toddling three-year olds--they fairly overcame me. So I supplied my pocket with a <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sugar</b> lozenges, for the relief of my own mind. I usually found the little fellows looked exceedingly delighted when they discovered the nature of the coin. Children are unsophisticated, and like sugar better than silver, any day.|$|E
