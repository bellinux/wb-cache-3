The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believed at the time that Speaker was suffering from extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). The incident sparked a debate in Congress on the failure of federal customs agents to stop him. Upon Speaker's return to the United States, the CDC placed him under involuntary isolation (similar to <b>quarantine)</b> using a <b>provision</b> of the Public Health Service Act. With this action, Speaker became the first individual subjected to a CDC isolation order since 1963.|$|R
