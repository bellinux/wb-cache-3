50|$|The crowd {{remained}} in President Knight’s residence {{for two days}} and then marched to the main Duke quadrangle in front of Duke Chapel. The action, later known as the Silent Vigil at Duke University, {{was one of the}} earliest of the mass student protests that emerged around the world in the weeks following King’s assassination. In a matter of days, the demonstrators’ numbers grew to two thousand, nearly half of the undergraduate student body. Students occupied the <b>quad</b> <b>around</b> the clock, bringing the university to a near standstill. They protested university injustices as well as national ones; students pushed for living wages and university recognition of an employee labor union.|$|E
5000|$|The {{burning of}} Academic Hall {{ushered in a}} time of great change for the University. There was much support in the Missouri Legislature to move the University to Sedalia. The Governor of Missouri, David R. Francis, sent a {{telegram}} to the students of the University assuring them that he would fight to keep the campus in Columbia. He later traveled to Columbia to address the citizens, faculty, and students. After calling for a special session of the Missouri Legislature he was able to appropriate $250,000 for the rebuilding. The University of Missouri was rebuilt in a <b>quad</b> <b>around</b> the columns, with [...] "New Academic Hall" [...] later renamed Jesse Hall on the south, and the Avenue of the Columns on the North.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} that Dodgson {{abruptly}} ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio {{on the roof of}} Tom <b>Quad,</b> created <b>around</b> 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming. He used the wet collodion process; commercial photographers who started using the dry-plate process in the 1870s took pictures more quickly. Popular taste changed with the advent of Modernism, affecting the types of photographs that he produced.|$|R

50|$|The {{idea of a}} trilateral axis {{on foreign}} policy issues was {{proposed}} by French President Charles de Gaulle to his British and American counterparts (see Fouchet Plan). However, that plan was never implemented. Meetings between the foreign ministers of these three countries and West Germany became known as <b>Quad</b> meetings <b>around</b> 1980. They were largely symbolic and led to no real decision. The Quint {{in its current form}} seems to have begun as the Contact Group excluding Russia. Nowadays, Quint leaders discuss all major international topics participating in video conferences once every two weeks or meeting one another in various forums such as NATO, the OSCE, the G20 and the UN. The Quint meets also at ministerial and experts' level.|$|R
50|$|The Quad {{is located}} in the center of Lafayette's campus and served as the venue of the first Lafayette-Lehigh in 1884 and other games through 1893. Baseball was also played on the Quad. Sources from the period {{indicate}} that games were played on the level ground between McKeen Hall and college buildings to the south (known today as the Quad). Since football was a new sport and organized by the undergraduates, games were played on the open field in the central area of campus. Small, but manageable crowds would attend the games, mostly consisting of students, alumni, and faculty. Spectators stood or sat alongside the unenclosed field, while undergrads watched the games from their dormatories that flanked the <b>Quad.</b> <b>Around</b> 1888 and 1889, crowds at Lafayette football games began to surge. Attempts were made to collect money for ticket revenues to offset the costs of athletic equipment, a trainer, and a training table. Policemen would be stationed at the entrances of the College to enforce the new ticket policies, however, it was not difficult to avoid paying the small fee. Young boys and many citizens of Easton would easily gain admittance, with only alumni wishing to support the new, informal athletic association paid for tickets. The need to raise revenue from ticket sales, as well as growing crowds, a few spectator incidents, and the persistent destruction of the Quad's grass, {{led to the formation of}} the Alumni Advisory Committee that soon raised funds for the new enclosed March Field.|$|E
5000|$|The {{focal point}} of York College's 190-acre park-like campus is the mall, a grassy <b>quad</b> <b>around</b> which many of the College's {{academic}} buildings are located. The Evelyn and Earle Wolf Hall is the center for artistic activity on campus. It includes three art studios, a photography facility, rehearsal and practice rooms, multi-track recording studio and mixing control room, music library, edit suites, studios, two video production facilities coordinated by a high-tech computer assisted control room, and DeMeester Recital Hall, a venue that hosts various speakers as well as performances {{by many of the}} College's musical ensembles. Also located in Wolf Hall are the York College Galleries. Comprising two adjacent galleries, the Cora Miller Gallery and the Brossman Gallery, this exhibition space serve the College, the City of York, and the communities of southcentral Pennsylvania and northern Maryland. The Galleries feature a varied program of nationally touring exhibitions and invitational shows, as well as faculty and juried student shows, artist and curator lectures, workshops, book signings, and other events.Located adjacent to Wolf is Campbell Hall, home to Academic Services, which includes the Academic Advising Center, the Center for Professional Excellence, the Career Development Center, and Disability Support Services. Campbell also includes chemistry instrumentation to support majors in Chemistry, Forensic Chemistry and Pre-Med.Next to Campbell is the Appell Life Sciences Building, which features modern laboratory spaces, multiple specialty spaces (tissue culture suite, microscopy lab, walk-in cold room), research and preparation spaces, and student and faculty conference rooms for the departments of Biological Sciences, Behavioral Sciences and Education. Connected to Appell is the Willman Business Center, which opened in 2013 and is home to the Graham School of Business, the largest academic department on campus. Willman features Weinstock Lecture Hall, a 150-seat tiered auditorium, the NASDAQ Trading Laboratory, which provides students with direct access to real-time financial data from stock and commodities exchanges, and Yorkview Hall, a glass-enclosed corporate training center that offers fantastic views atop the Center.|$|E
50|$|The college owns land on {{both sides}} of the River Cherwell and has a private {{footbridge}} bridge across the river. It has one of the most modern buildings of all the Oxford colleges. The construction of the main building of the college was completed in 1974. It was designed by the Powell and Moya Architects. The college's main building has three quadrangles: the central quadrangle named the Berlin Quad after Isaiah Berlin, as well as the Tree <b>Quad</b> built <b>around</b> established trees, and the River Quad into which the Cherwell has been diverted to form a punt harbour. One of the distinctive features of the grounds is the preservation of mature trees around and within the buildings. The main buildings and bridge were grade II listed in June 2011.|$|R

Gravitational lensing {{has proven to}} be a very valuable tool as a probe to better understand our universe. Parametric modeling of one multiple image gravitational lens system at a time is a common practice in the field of lensing. Instead of individual lens modeling, an alternative approach is to use symmetries in different spaces to make conclusions about families of lenses. The latter method is the focus of this thesis. Three types of lenses are defined based on whether they do or do not obey two-fold and double mirror symmetries. The analysis concentrates on quadruply imaged systems, or quads, and uses only the relative polar angles of <b>quads</b> <b>around</b> the center of the lens. The analysis is statistical in nature, and model-free because its conclusions relate to whole classes of models, instead of specific models. The work done here is twofold. Firstly, exploratory analysis is done to check for possible existence of degeneracies. Type I lenses which obey both symmetries mentioned above are found to form a nearly invariant surface in the 3 D space of relative image angles. In the same space, lenses that break the double mirror symmetry, grouped as Type II, form two distinct surfaces. In addition, degeneracy in this class of lenses is discovered. A preliminary study of the last group of lenses, Type III, that break both symmetries, is done. Secondly, quad distributions in the 3 D space from each of the three families were compared to observed galaxy-lens quads. Three quarters of observed quads were inconsistent with the distribution of quads of Type I lenses. Type II lenses reproduce most individual lens systems but fail to reproduce the population properties of observed quads. Preliminary exploration of Type III lenses shows a very promising agreement with observations. Examples of Type IIIs are lenses with substructure (with clump masses larger than those responsible for flux ratio anomalies in quads), and lenses with luminous or dark nearby perturber galaxies, or line of sight structures...|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, the Quad 4 {{engine was}} {{developed}} and became available in a special limited edition of the Calais called the [...] "GMO Quad 4". Early television ads touting the new engine's abilities showed video of the Calais GMO <b>Quad</b> 4 racing <b>around</b> city streets (the submodel was dropped, however the Quad 4 engine continued to be available for several years afterward). Another, later special Cutlass Calais model was the 1990 to 1991 Quad-442. It used a high-output version of the four-cylinder coupled to a 5-speed manual transmission. This same High Output version was also available in the top-of-the-line Cutlass Calais International Series.|$|R
5000|$|Friends Academy is a Quaker, coeducational, independent, college preparatory school serving {{students}} from nursery school through the twelfth grade, located in Glen Cove, New York, United States. The school {{was founded in}} 1876 by 78-year-old Gideon Frost for [...] "The children of Friends and those similarly sentimented". The school was originally named Friends College. The campus covers 65 acre. The school is organized <b>around</b> <b>quad</b> with buildings surrounding it. Recent additions to the school include the Helen A. Dolan Center (2000), the Kumar-Wang Library (2000), the renovation of the Upper School (2004), the renovation of the Lower School (2010), {{the construction of the}} gym and field house (2007), and the current renovation of the Middle School.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Downhill" [...] portion can be {{accessed}} with the memorial stairs. Designed by the Olmsted Brothers in the 1920s, the memorial stairs form {{one of the main}} entrances to the university and allows direct access to the engineering school from the academic <b>quad.</b> Notable buildings <b>around</b> the engineering school include Bromfield-Pearson Hall (1893), Robinson Hall (1899), and Curtis Hall (1894). Boston architect George Albert Clough is responsible for the design of Curtis Hall and Goddard Hall. Additionally Arland Dirlam is responsible for the designs of many buildings downhill. These include Cohen Auditorium (1950), Hodgdon Hall (1954), and Jackson Gymnasium (1947). Administrative offices also occupy the surrounding neighborhoods and nearby Davis Square, where Tufts makes payments in lieu of taxes on some of its tax-exempt (educational) properties.|$|R
40|$|Multiple image {{gravitational}} lens systems, and especially quads are invaluable {{in determining the}} amount and distribution of mass in galaxies. This is usually done by mass modeling using parametric or free-form methods. An alternative way of extracting information about lens mass distribution is to use lensing degeneracies and invariants. Where applicable, they allow one to make conclusions about whole classes of lenses without model fitting. Here, we use approximate, but observationally useful invariants formed by the three relative polar angles of <b>quad</b> images <b>around</b> the lens center to show that many smooth elliptical+shear lenses can reproduce {{the same set of}} quad image angles within observational error. This result allows us to show in a model-free way what the general class of smooth elliptical+shear lenses looks like in the three dimensional (3 D) space of image relative angles, and that this distribution does not match that of the observed quads. We conclude that, even though smooth elliptical+shear lenses can reproduce individual quads, they cannot reproduce the quad population. What is likely needed is substructure, with clump masses larger than those responsible for flux ratio anomalies in quads, or luminous or dark nearby perturber galaxies.

5000|$|The Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions had {{a drought}} during 2002, which was {{accompanied}} by dry conditions, wildfires and hot temperatures over the Western US and Midwest areas. The U.S. drought of 2002 turned a [...] "normal" [...] fire season into a very dangerous, treacherous and violent season. Denver was forced to impose mandatory limits regarding water {{for the first time}} in twenty-one years, as Colorado and other states in the Southwest were hit particularly hard by the severe drought conditions in 2002. The <b>Quad</b> Cities had <b>around</b> 8 in below average rainfall during 2002 (normal precipitation is 38.06 in every year, during 2002 30.00 in were recorded).

40|$|Given the {{advanced}} state of operational plans for late Run II (132 nsec bunch spacing) the C 0 IR insert {{should be designed}} to operate such {{that it does not}} impact nominal Tevatron parameters. This implies an entirely localized insert [...] one which is completely transparent {{to the rest of the}} machine. This condition has several important design implications, some of which are pointed out below. An IR design similar to that employed at CDF and D 0 is unacceptable as a C 0 candidate. The addition of such a (single) low-{beta} region to the machine raises the tune by a half-integer in each plane, moving them far from the standard operating point and right onto the 21. 0 integer resonance. The nominal (fractional) operating point is most elegantly maintained by adding 2 local low-{beta} in each plane, thereby boosting the tunes by a full integer. The B 0 and D 0 IR's are not optically-isolated entities. Progression through the low-{beta}squeeze involves adjusting, not only the main IR quadrupoles, but also the tune <b>quad</b> strings distributed <b>around</b> the ring. The result is that the nominal lattice functions at any point in the ring, and the phase advances across any section of the ring, are not fixed, but vary with each stage of the squeeze. A new insert must be sufficiently flexible to track these elusive matching conditions. Without collisions at C 0 the unit transfer matrix added by the insertion ensures that the incoming and outgoing helices are automatically matched to their nominal Run II values. To maintain this match with collisions at all 3 IP's, however, requires that additional separators be added in the arcs. Space for these separators can only be generated through replacing standard Tevatron arc dipoles by new magnets with enhanced strengths. In the following sections two design variations for an interaction region are presented. The first of these, which incorporates stronger dipoles, meets all of the ideal design criteria outlined above. The result is a truly independent 3 rd Tevatron IR capable of supporting simultaneous collisions at all 3 IP's. The second, stripped-down, version includes neither stronger dipoles nor new arc separators. While this insert is still optically transparent to the machine, collisions can only occur at B 0 & D 0, or just C 0, but not all three. The weaker dipoles also result in a significant reduction in the space available for a detector. However, as is demonstrated near the end of this report, if all the B- and C-Sector separators are freed to assist in C 0 orbit control, it might be possible to support collisions at B 0 and D 0, plus C 0, with the second design...|$|R
