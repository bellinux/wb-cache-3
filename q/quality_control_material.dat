50|$|Laboratory {{quality control}} is {{designed}} to detect, reduce, and correct deficiencies in a laboratory's internal analytical process prior {{to the release of}} patient results, in order {{to improve the quality of}} the results reported by the laboratory. Quality control is a measure of precision, or how well the measurement system reproduces the same result over time and under varying operating conditions. Laboratory <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> is usually run at the beginning of each shift, after an instrument is serviced, when reagent lots are changed, after calibration, and whenever patient results seem inappropriate. <b>Quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> should approximate the same matrix as patient specimens, taking into account properties such as viscosity, turbidity, composition, and color. It should be simple to use, with minimal vial to vial variability, because variability could be misinterpreted as systematic error in the method or instrument. It should be stable for long periods of time, and available in large enough quantities for a single batch to last at least one year. Liquid controls are more convenient than lyophilized controls because they do not have to be reconstituted minimizing pipetting error.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a methodology for a reference material preparation {{to be used}} for the determination of the production date (i. e. the time elapsed since the last chemical processing) of uranium materials based on the 230 Th/ 234 U radiochronometer. The reference material was prepared from highly enriched uranium by a complete separation of thorium decay products, thus zeroing the initial daughter nuclide concentration at known time. The complete elimination of thorium from the starting material was verified by gamma spectrometric measurements and by addition of a 232 Th tracer to the material and its remeasurement in the final product after the separation. The validation of the methodology was carried out subsequently by comparing the ingrown daughter nuclide 230 Th and the measured 230 Th/ 234 U ratio after recorded times following the last chemical separation with the calculated values obtained {{on the basis of their}} respective half-lives.

Yet, {{a lack of}} precision has been an issue for fibrinogen measurement. A control material derived from plasma comprises many proteins, inhibitors and fatty acids, {{any or all of}} which can interfere in the fibrinogen assay. This study has attempted to develop a <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> <b>material</b> using purified human fibrinogen and has compared measurement precision between both purified and plasma materials. Purified fibrinogen was prepared using Cohn fraction 1 and glycine precipitation. Purified fibrinogen clottability was greater than 95 %, with no main plasma proteins, lipids or fibrinogen degradation products observed. Two purified control materials were lyophilized at normal (2. 30 g lm 1) and abnormal (1. 20 g lm 1) levels of fibrinogen concentration. Precision was evaluated using a liquid-type reagent, Thrombocheck Fib(L), on automated coagulation analysers. Coefficient of variation for within-run, intraday and between-day precision of the purified materials was 0. 7 - 3. 5 %. In comparison, the coefficient of variation for plasma materials ranged from 1. 2 to 5. 3 %.

In define phase we determine the type of product to be investigated using Critical to Quality, as well as the problems and objectives. In measure phase we calculate DPMO value and sigma level; sigma value of 3. 520 is obtained. Then we calculate P control chart to see the production process control.

40|$|Abstract-Many common sheet {{materials}}, {{ranging from}} natural {{materials such as}} wood to modern composites, possess approximately orthotropic symmetry. Within the approximations of thin-plate bending theory, the linear vibrational properties of such sheets are governed by four elastic constants and four damping constants (at any given frequency). A simple procedure is presented whereby all four elastic constants may be determined, quickly and with reasonable accuracy, from measurements of the resonant frequencies of low-frequency modes of thin rectangular plates with free edges. Also, {{at least three of}} the four damping constants may be determined by measuring the damping factors of the same modes-it turns out that the fourth damping constant does not usually have sufficient influence on the low-frequency modes for a reliable value to be found by this approach. The procedure is illustrated with measurements on a range of different sheet materials: wooden plates cut at different angles from the solid timber, plywood, and two very different fibre-reinforced composites. The discussion of these experimental results suggests that this simple procedure could form a valuable part of any programme of <b>quality</b> <b>control,</b> <b>material</b> selection or non-destructive testing involving orthotropic sheet materials.

40|$|Background Oral anticoagulation {{monitoring}} {{has traditionally}} {{taken place in}} secondary care {{because of the need}} for a laboratory blood test, the international normalised ratio (INR). The development of reliable near patient testing (NPT) systems for INR estimation has facilitated devolution of testing to primary care. Patient self-management is a logical progression from the primary care model. This study {{will be the first to}} randomise non-selected patients in primary care, to either self-management or standard care. Method The study was a multi-centred randomised controlled trial with patients from 49 general practices recruited. Those suitable for inclusion were aged 18 or over, with a long term indication for oral anticoagulation, who had taken warfarin for at least six months. Patients randomised to the intervention arm attended at least two training sessions which were practice-based, 1 week apart. Each patient was assessed on their capability to undertake self management.

Little guidance exists on how to verify if an out-of-control situation in the AoN chart {{is due to a}} shift in analytical performance, or underlying patient characteristics. DESIGN AND METHODS: Through simulation based on clinical data, we examined 1) the location of the last apparently stable period in the AoN control chart after an analytical shift, and 2) an approach to verify if the observed shift is related to an analytical shift by repeat testing of archived patient samples from the stable period for 21 common analytes. RESULTS: The number of blocks of results to look back for the stable period increased with the duration of the analytical shift, and was larger when smaller AoN block sizes were used. To verify an analytical shift, 3 archived samples from the analytically stable period should be retested. In particular, the process is deemed to have shifted if a difference of 3 ̆e 2 analytical standard deviations (i. e. 1 : 2 s rejection rule) between the original and retested results are observed in any of the 3 samples produced. The probability of Type- 1 error (i. e., false rejection) and power (i. e., detecting true analytical shift) of this rule are 0. 9, respectively.
