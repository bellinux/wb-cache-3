5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> about a musical career for his son. While {{impressed}} with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Ortega-Hernandez {{arrived in}} Washington on November 9 with 180 rounds of {{ammunition}} and a Romanian-made Cugir semiautomatic rifle that he had purchased from a gun shop in Idaho. On {{the morning of the}} shooting, he was reported for suspicious behavior in a local park. Police <b>questioned</b> <b>him,</b> but he refused to let police search his car. After photographing him, police officers let him go as they had no cause to make an arrest.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion, {{with whom}} Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg joined. Breyer {{disagreed}} with the majority's holding that fair-minded jurists could disagree on whether Alvarado was in custody, holding that the facts compelled the single conclusion that Alvarado was in custody. Breyer held that the actions the police did not do, such as arrest Alvarado or threaten him, were {{not as important as}} what the police did do. Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> for two hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{respondent}} Michael Alvarado {{agreed to}} help his friend Paul Soto steal a truck {{in the parking lot}} of a shopping mall in Santa Fe Springs, California. Soto pulled out a gun and approached the driver of the truck, demanding the keys, while Alvarado hid by the driver's side door. The driver refused and was shot and killed by Soto. Afterwords, Alvarado helped hide the gun. Los Angeles County Sheriff's detective Cheryl Comstock led the investigation of the crime. During the investigation Comstock contacted Alvarado's parents, saying that she wished to speak with Alvarado. Alvarado's parents brought him to the police station to be interviewed. Comstock brought Alvarado into an interview room and <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> for two hours. Alvarado's parents asked to be present during the interview but were not allowed in by police. Alvarado admitted during questions that he had helped his friend try to steal the truck and that he had helped hide the gun.|$|E
5|$|Wheelbarrow: The {{earliest}} wheelbarrows with {{archaeological evidence}} {{in the form of}} a one-wheel cart come from 2nd century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 CE. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 CE. And then there is the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 CE). However, there are even earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BCE. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 CE) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCE23 CE), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who <b>questioned</b> <b>him,</b> and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife was terribly ill.|$|E

5|$|On 24 April, {{the first}} {{prisoner}} {{escaped from the}} main camp; {{the same day that}} the injured second prisoner was taken in by Machuca and his men. Interrogation of the new prisoner, {{who turned out to be}} an Itza nobleman, revealed that the Itza kingdom was in a state of high alert to repel the Spanish. Friar Cano met with his fellow Dominicans to discuss what should be done, having had information from both Machuca and his prisoner that the Itza were ready for war. The Dominicans were highly critical of the Spanish soldiers' readiness to open fire on poorly armed natives who offered no real threat to them, and suspected that President Barrios was nowhere near the lake; furthermore the Spanish were beginning to succumb to sickness, and the Verapaz Indian recruits were deserting daily. Díaz agreed with the Dominicans; two muleteers had already died from sickness, and he recognised that the size of his expedition was not sufficient for a full confrontation with the Itza nation. The expedition almost immediately withdrew back to Cahabón. The new prisoner, AjK'ixaw was later taken back to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, where the Dominicans <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> in detail. In Guatemala AjK'ixaw learnt Spanish and returned to Petén in 1696 as a guide and interpreter for another expedition, before turning on his captors. After the Spanish retreated to Guatemala, rumours ran rife among the Itza and Kowoj that they would return to engage in wholesale slaughter of the Maya population; large tracts of territory were abandoned in response, including many towns in an area stretching from Lake Petén Itzá eastwards to Tipuj and southwards to Mopán.|$|E
25|$|When Crocco {{heard about}} these events {{he was angry}} and decided to avenge his sister. Knowing the habits of Peppino, who {{generally}} attended a particular club to gamble in the evening hours, Crocco awaited his return at Peppino's home. When Don Peppino arrived, Crocco <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> but the discussion ended in a fight, after Peppino hit Crocco with a whip.|$|E
25|$|Gandalf grew {{suspicious}} of the ring belonging to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, which was later discovered to be Sauron's One Ring. Gandalf asked Aragorn to track Gollum, who had previously possessed the Ring. This hunt led Aragorn across Rhovanion, and he finally captured Gollum in the Dead Marshes northwest of Mordor and brought him captive to King Thranduil’s halls in Mirkwood, where Gandalf <b>questioned</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|At about 2:30 pm on 27 September, {{police arrested}} Adrian Ernest Bayley, then 41, at his address in Coburg, and then <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> at great length. It transpired {{that he had}} been the man in the blue hoodie. During the interrogation, Bayley ended up {{breaking}} down and admitting that he had strangled her with his hands in a lane off Hope Street, Brunswick. He had then buried her.|$|E
25|$|Miller's combative {{reaction}} to post-speech media interviews received {{almost as much}} attention as the speech itself. First, in an interview with CNN, Miller had a dispute with Judy Woodruff, Wolf Blitzer, and Jeff Greenfield when they <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> on his speech, particularly on whether he had misinterpreted the context and full content of Kerry's votes, and the fact that Dick Cheney, as Defense Secretary, had opposed some of the same programs he attacked Kerry for voting against.|$|E
25|$|Polanski was {{informed}} of the murders and returned to Los Angeles where police, unable to determine a motive, <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> about his wife and friends. On Wednesday, August 13, Tate was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City, California, with her son, Paul Richard Polanski (named posthumously for Polanski's and Tate's fathers), in her arms. Sebring's funeral took place later the same day; the funerals were scheduled several hours apart to allow mutual friends to attend.|$|E

25|$|In August 2017, a {{grand jury}} filed four new charges against Bo Dukes: two counts of making false statements, one count of {{hindering}} apprehension of a criminal and one count of concealing the death of another. These additional charges {{are based on a}} Wilcox County indictment stating that Bo Dukes lied to a GBI official who <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> in 2016 concerning the disappearance of Grinstead. As of September 7, 2017, no trial date has been scheduled for either Dukes or Duke.|$|E
25|$|At about 2 p.m., Oswald {{arrived at}} the Police Department building, where {{homicide}} detective Jim Leavelle (1920–) <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> about the shooting of Officer Tippit. When Captain J. W. Fritz heard Oswald's name, he recognized it {{as that of the}} book depository employee who was reported missing and was already a suspect in the assassination. Oswald was formally arraigned for the murder of Officer Tippit at 7:10p.m., and by early the next morning (shortly after 1:30a.m.) he had also been arraigned for the assassination of President Kennedy.|$|E
25|$|As {{this was}} happening, Karl Wilhelm Naundorff {{came into her}} life, pretending to be the now adult Louis XVII. For over a year, he lived at her home as she <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> at length, testing him with old keepsakes. She also {{verified}} his birthmarks which seemed identical to those she noted on the young Dauphin {{at the request of}} Marie Antoinette. She fought a long battle to attest to his rights, enduring searches of her home where police seized a number of documents, files, and even presents presented to her from the Royal family.|$|E
60|$|The servant had returned. Dr. Wybrow {{was ashamed}} to <b>question</b> <b>him.</b> The man {{reported}} {{the result of}} his errand, without waiting to be asked.|$|R

25|$|Kerviel's initial 24-hour {{detention}} {{was extended}} to 48 hours while French law enforcement <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> about possible accomplices. The investigation later widened to encompass his personal cell phone records, and to explore possible links to other individuals working at rival banks and private investment firms who may be involved. The police were investigating whether he worked alone, and whether any investors outside of Société Générale may have been tipped off in advance. Police were interested whether others were involved either in the trades themselves or received notice of the bank's impending sell-off before {{the details of the}} scandal were publicly disclosed.|$|E
25|$|Sutcliffe had {{regularly}} {{used the}} services of prostitutes in Leeds and Bradford. His outbreak of violence towards them seems to have occurred because he was swindled out of money by a prostitute and her pimp. When interviewed by authorities, however, he claimed that the voice of God had sent him {{on a mission to}} kill prostitutes. Sutcliffe carried out his murder spree over five years, during which time the public were especially shocked by the murders of women who were not prostitutes. After his arrest for driving with false number plates in January 1981, the police <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> about the killings and he confessed that he was the perpetrator.|$|E
25|$|But when he {{was shot}} down Bryks was wearing the Mae West {{lifejacket}} of a Polish colleague from 242 Squadron, F/O Henry Skalsky. Therefore the Germans who <b>questioned</b> <b>him</b> at St Omer suspected he was Polish, and sent him to Dulag Luft at Oberursel in Hesse for interrogation by a Polish-speaking German officer. There he was accused of shooting a Luftwaffe fighter pilot who was parachuting from his Bf 109 in the air battle near St Omer on 17 June. For this he was threatened with being court-martialled in Berlin. After the war no such shooting was found in German records for that day. The accusation {{seems to have been a}} false one to put pressure Bryks.|$|E
