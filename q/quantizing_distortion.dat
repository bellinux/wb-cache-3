40|$|Introduction NTT {{has been}} {{studying}} an objective model for evaluating telephone transmission performance [39], [40], [41], [42]. This describes OPINE (Overall Performance Index model for Network Evaluation), focussing on practical use. OPINE deals with transmission loss, circuit noise, room noise, attenuation/frequency distortion (fundamental factors), <b>quantizing</b> <b>distortion,</b> talker echo and sidetone. It models the auditory-psychological process of evaluation by human beings of telephone transmission performance based on these factors. It is therefore {{the second type of}} model according to the classification of 2 (British Telecom). The model's basic principle is the fact that evaluation of psychological factors (not physical factors) on the psychological scale is additive. The model is extended from the first revision to take additional physical factors into account. OPINE was first constructed for fundamental factors in 1983 [39]. The opinion test data used for coefficient trai...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify important design variables of digital modulators and to discuss the manner in which they influence cost and performance. In particular, we derive formulas that show the variation of quantizing noise with sampling rate and quantizer resolution in basic PCM and DPCM modulators. These formulas imply a conflict between economy and efficiency and we describe three current approaches to the resolution of this conflict. The first is efficiency oriented, the second economy oriented, and the third relies on digital signal processing to convert between efficient and economical modulation formats...|$|E

40|$|With {{exponential}} {{increase in}} the volumes of video traffic in cellular net-works, there is an increasing need for optimizing the quality of video delivery. 4 G networks (Long Term Evolution Advanced or LTE A) are being introduced in many countries worldwide, which allow a downlink speed of upto 1 Gbps and uplink of 100 Mbps over a single base station. This makes a strong push towards video broadcasting over LTE networks, characterizing its performance and developing metrics which can be deployed to provide user feedback of video quality and feed-back them to network operators to fine tune the network. In this paper, we characterize the performance of video transmission over LTE A physical layer using popular video quality metrics such as SSIM, Blocking, Blurring, NIQE and BRISQUE. We conduct experiments to find a suitable no-reference metrics for mobile scenario and find that Blocking Metrics is most promising in case of channel or modulation variations {{but it does not}} perform well to quantize variations in compression ratios. The metrics BRISQUE is very efficient in <b>quantizing</b> this <b>distortion</b> and performs well in case of network variations also.

40|$|International audienceMultipath {{decreases}} {{the accuracy of}} the GNSS positioning by distorting the correlation function. Based on this observation it is possible to detect abnormally large multipath error by monitoring the correlation function. Indeed for the tracking of the code delay, several correlator outputs that correspond to specific locations on the correlation function are observable. Based on the available observables that are combined to form a metric, one can design a test detection to <b>quantize</b> the <b>distortion.</b> The potential metric candidates are selected based on noise resilience considerations. Afterwards, using a simplified correlator output model, two methods are compared for the determination of the detection thresholds. The value of the thresholds is related to the expected Probability of False Alarm. An analytic way to assess the performance of the coherent tests in term of sensitivity is given. The efficiency of the test can be widely improved by smoothing the correlator outputs or the test variable itself. The discussed metrics are implemented on a realistic GNSS tracking simulator processing the Land Mobile Satellite Channel model developed by the DLR. The correlation between the multipath error and the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is well known. Performances of test based on metrics and SNR are finally compare...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} vector {{quantization}} scheme {{which makes it}} possible to consider the dynamics of input vectors. In the proposed scheme, a linear transformation is applied to the consecutive input vectors and the resulting vector is <b>quantized</b> with a <b>distortion</b> measure defined by the statistics. At the decoder side, the output vector sequence is determined using the statistics associated with the transmitted indices {{in such a way that}} a likelihood is maximized. To solve the maximization problem, a computationally efficient algorithm is derived. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in LSP parameter quantization. It is found that the LSP trajectories and the corresponding spectra change quite smoothly in the proposed method.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Sept. 30, 2014 - Sept. 30, 2016 Time-domain data conversion has recently drawn increased research attention for its highly digital nature in favor of process technology scaling. Also, as the time information being carried by binary voltage, time-domain operation is much less sensitive to voltage noise compared to conventional voltage domain operation. However, for analog-to-digital converter (ADC) application, the challenge lies in the methodology of benefiting from time-domain operation while maintaining/improving the overall data conversion accuracy and power efficiency. This dissertation has {{a focus on the}} investigation of novel data conversion topologies based on classic voltage domain operation that is capable of generating time information, to improve ADC resolution, system stability and speed without power penalty. In the first approach, a novel continuous-time (CT) delta-sigma modulator (DSM) using a time-interleaved quantizer is proposed and implemented. Along with the doubled sample rate, the proposed architecture utilizes time information to perform correlated coupling between the two quantizer channels. A 120 MS/s CT Î”Î£ ADC using proposed technique is implemented in 0. 18 Âµm CMOS process. The measurement results achieve second order noise coupling from the interleaved quantizer itself without extra phases. More importantly, excess loop delay of two full sample clocks is compensated by time-domain signal coupling; the resulted CT DSM is fully stabilized in 120 MHz sampling rate and achieves 11 effective number of bits (ENOB). In the second approach, a new category of pulse-width-modulation (PWM) scheme is proposed and described: time symmetric PWM (TSPWM). An ADC structure is further proposed and implemented utilizing this novel voltage-to-time converter, followed by a first order noise-shaped switched-ring-oscillator (SRO) TDC quantizer. This ADC topology takes advantage of the TDC speed scaling for its digitized operation to boost the overall ADC resolution and signal bandwidth, while the voltage-to-time front-end is able to remain at a much lower speed than the TDC, thanks to the proposed technique. This is the first work that decouples the PWM modulation rate from TDC <b>quantizing</b> speed without <b>distortion</b> penalty. Built in 0. 18 Âµm, the implemented ADC is able to sample at a range from 20 MHz to 40 MHz, the generated pulse train is quantized by the following SRO TDC at a rate of 400 MHz. The prototype chip shows a SFDR improvement over 24 dB on the ADC output when TSPWM is used...|$|R
