Lightening autobodies {{is one of the}} most practical ways to conduct it, for which converting the body sheets from conventional steel to Al-Mg-Si alloy is effective. Although the Al-Mg-Si alloys have the advantage that they have hardenability during paint baking and do not cause stretcher strain patterns, poor formability is a crucial drawback. Bendability {{is one of the most}} important properties related to formability. However, there has been no assessing method having both speediness and <b>quantitative</b> <b>reproducibility.</b> In this study, we have developed a assessing method based on the electric resistance decrease arising from the decrease in conducting section when cracks are formed by bending. Bendability was assessed by electrical resistance change as well as by crack density on the tension surface measured with an SEM. It was found that the new method have far greater speediness with the same <b>quantitative</b> <b>reproducibility</b> than the crack measurement method...|$|E

This study {{aimed to}} compare the {{qualitative}} and <b>quantitative</b> <b>reproducibility</b> of quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Ureaplasma species (Ureaplasma spp.) throughout pregnancy {{and according to the}} genital sampling site. Study Design. Between 5 and 14 weeks of gestation (T 1), vaginal, fornix, and two cervical samples were taken. Sampling was repeated during the 2 nd (T 2) and 3 rd (T 3) trimester in randomly selected T 1 positive and negative women. Qualitative and <b>quantitative</b> <b>reproducibility</b> were evaluated using, respectively, Cohen’s kappa (κ) and interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and repeated measures ANOVA on the log-transformed mean number of DNA copies for each sampling site. Results. During T 1, 51 / 127 women were positive for U. parvum and 8 for U. urealyticum (4 patients for both). Sampling was repeated for 44 / 55 women at T 2 and/or T 3; 43 (97. 7 %) remained positive at the three timepoints. κ ranged between 0. 83 and 0. 95 and the ICC for cervical samples was 0. 86.

Image quality was assessed by eye-balling always during repositioning. This was done qualitatively for descriptive statistic purposes only. Reslices were compared qualitatively to original recordings of 2 D clips or 2 D images stored on the ultrasound device. Additionally, quality of SAX view was assessed by obtaining {{an image of a}} recorded 3 D-UV target structure and rotation of 90 °, resulting in a longitudinal slice (LAX) of the reconstructed 3 D-UV. These LAX 3 D-UV reslices were also compared to original LAX images of the model. Comparison resulted only in selecting or discarding of the recordings. A further visual estimation test for correlation analysis between original images and 3 D-UV was not planned. Test reproducibility was controlled by repeated recording of an anatomical site up to ten times. A <b>quantitative</b> test <b>reproducibility</b> was not planned. From these repeated recordings, 3 D-UV were chosen for further analysis.|$|R

PGC test results of standard polymer samples from the United States and from the Chromato-graphy Discussion Group (London) are presented. The exper-iments were designed without bias to industry types or to particular pyrolyzer designs. To obtain better reproducibility, we adopted a calibrated PGC approach. This approach involves tuning of a gas chromatograph by retention time and peak area measurements of a known organic compound blend, followed by pyrolysis of a known polymer. GC calibra-tion is then followed by quantitative PGC of each sample three times during a 14 -day period. The calibrated concept yields both superior and representative PGC data among laboratories around the world. Interesting comparisons of PGC polymer data from three testing correlations obtained {{with the cooperation of}} several American laboratories and one Japanese laboratory will be discussed.

The basic experimental set-up was as follows: one laboratory prepared and distributed a [35 S]methionine-labeled total yeast protein extract (Göteborg, Sweden), another laboratory prepared the IPG strips to be used by all labs in this study (Munich, Germany), the third laboratory (Aarhus, Denmark) circulated the protocols and coordinated the modest attempts to unify them. Samples were run horizontally in the first dimension and vertically in the second. The gels were sent to Göteborg for processing by phosphoimager technology and computerized image analysis (PDQuest), and the 2 -D PAGE resolved proteins were located and quantified automatically. A subset of 470 spots was manually matched in all gels out of an average of 1328 resolved proteins. The positional {{interlaboratory comparison}} revealed great pattern reproducibility, the correlation coefficient in no case being less than 0. 9994. In absolute terms an average deviation of 2. 8 mm (x-position) and 1. 8 mm (y-position) were obtained for all nine gels (three gels per lab). The interlaboratory comparison of protein quantitation displayed higher variability, and the best correlation coefficient generated was 0. 975. An average standard deviation of 34. 5 % was calculated for protein quantitation including all three labs, a value slightly higher than the intralaboratory variation (range 20 - 28 %). Thus, despite differences in protocols, chemicals and equipment, the immobilized pH gradient technology gave extremely high positional and <b>quantitative</b> <b>reproducibility.</b> This will greatly facilitate the exchange of data and the establishment of multi-user image-based 2 -D gel databases...|$|E

We observe a perfect <b>quantitative</b> <b>reproducibility</b> of the cavitation events where the inner bubbles in the two-dimensional cluster are shielded by the outer ones, reflected by their later expansion and their delayed collapse.

Primary research studies of test-retest reliability conducted on healthy human subjects were included that quantified test-retest reliability using either the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) or the coefficient of variance. The MEDLINE, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey databases were searched up to February 2014. Risk of bias was assessed with 10 criteria weighted toward methodological quality. Twenty-three studies {{were included in the}} review (n= 499 subjects) and evaluated for various characteristics, including sample size (5 – 45), retest interval (1 year), acquisition method, and test-retest reliability scores. For at least one metric, ICCs reached the fair range (ICC 0. 40 – 0. 59) in one study, the good range (ICC 0. 60 – 0. 74) in five studies, and the excellent range (ICC> 0. 74) in 16 studies.

Plasmon resonances occur at the holes edges, thus enabling the possibility of SERS signals from biomolecules and the potential application as biosensors. One advantage of the nanoholes patterned film is the optical-subdiffraction pitch, which prevents any Raman and/or fluorescence signal arising from the bottom slide.

Recently, we presented a novel platform that we termed global proteome survey (GPS), where we combined the best features of affinity proteomics and mass spectrometry, to probe any proteome in a species independent manner while still using a limited set of antibodies. We used so called context-independent-motif-specific antibodies, directed against short amino acid motifs. This enabled enrichment of motif-containing peptides from a digested proteome, which then were detected and identified by mass spectrometry. In this study, we {{have demonstrated the}} <b>quantitative</b> capability, <b>reproducibility,</b> sensitivity, and coverage of the GPS technology by targeting SILAC-labeled yeast cultures cultivated in glucose or ethanol.

Furthermore, peptides originating from proteins spanning in abundance from over a million down to less than 50 copies per cell, could be targeted. It is worth noting that a significant set of peptides previously not reported in the PeptideAtlas database was among the profiled targets. The quantitative data corroborated well with the corresponding data generated after conventional SCX fractionation of the same samples. Finally, several differentially expressed proteins, with both known and unknown functions, many relevant for the central carbon metabolism, could be detected in the glucose- versus ethanol-cultivated yeast.

It is now generally recognized that the two methods cannot be ex-pected to yield strictly identical results. Part of this discrepancy is du...|$|E
40|$|We {{present results}} of the first {{large-scale}} interlaboratory study carried out in synthetic biology, {{as part of the}} 2014 and 2015 International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competitions. Participants at 88 institutions around the world measured fluorescence from three engineered constitutive constructs in E. coli. Few participants were able to measure absolute fluorescence, so data was analyzed in terms of ratios. Precision was strongly related to fluorescent strength, ranging from 1. 54 -fold standard deviation for the ratio between strong promoters to 5. 75 -fold for the ratio between the strongest and weakest promoter, and while host strain did not affect expression ratios, choice of instrument did. This result shows that high <b>quantitative</b> precision and <b>reproducibility</b> of results is possible, {{while at the same time}} indicating areas needing improved laboratory practices. Raytheon BBN Technologies, Synthace, and Agilent provided support in the form of salaries for authors JB, MG, and JH, but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

40|$|Fifty-nine {{cases of}} Breast Epithelial Proliferative Lesions (BEPL) and Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), were studied by image analysis, to {{evaluate}} the nuclear changes occurring in the conventional diagnostic categories of ductal hyperplasia, atypical ductal hyperplasia and DCIS with <b>quantitative</b> methods. Diagnosis <b>reproducibility</b> is the main practical problem of these breast lesions. In fact, with subjective methods, the reproducibility appears to be very low and precarious especially for clinical demands. The objective, quantitative evaluation of cell phenotypical changes should be the method for both practical diagnostic problems and study of ductal cancer progression. The distribution pattern of the data in the feature, obtained with quantitative analysis, strongly suggests a continuum of changes, indicating an evolutionary process of Breast Ductal Carcinoma (BDC) progression in its preinvasive stage. Each observed case may be characterised by its own cellular, objective alterations and a progressive trend toward BDC can be stated. Since the actual changes of the proliferative phenotypes can be measured, and the values are reproducible, karyometric measurement may allow an objective grading of individual case...|$|R
40|$|Also {{published}} {{as a book}} chapter: Proteomics, 2009 / J. Reinders and A. Sickmann (eds.), Ch. 4 pp. 59 - 82 Numerous protein detection and quantitation methods for gel-based proteomics have been devised that can be classified in three major categories: (1) Universal (or "general") detection techniques, which include staining with anionic dyes (e. g., Coomassie brilliant blue), reverse (or "negative") staining with metal cations (e. g., imidazole-zinc), silver staining, fluorescent staining or labeling, and radiolabeling, (2) specific staining methods {{for the detection of}} post-translational modifications (e. g., glycosylation or phosphorylation), and (3) differential display techniques for the separation of multiple, covalently tagged samples in a single two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) gel, followed by consecutive and independent visualization of these proteins to minimize methodical variations in spot positions and in protein abundance, to simplify image analysis, as well as to improve protein quantitation by including an internal standard. The most important properties of protein detection methods applied in proteome analysis include high sensitivity (i. e., low detection limit), wide linear dynamic range for <b>quantitative</b> accuracy, <b>reproducibility,</b> cost-efficiency, ease of use, and compatibility with downstream protein identification or characterization technologies, such as mass spectrometry (MS). Regrettably, no single detection method meets all these requirements, albeit fluorescence-based technologies are currently favored for most applications; hence, the major focus of this chapter is on fluorescent-dye-based protein detection and quantitation techniques. Although satisfying results with respect to sensitivity and reproducibility are also obtained by methods based on radioactive labeling of proteins (which is still unsurpassed in terms of sensitivity), radiolabeling is, however, largely impractical for routine proteomic profiling because of the costs and the health and safety concerns associated with handling radioactive compounds.
