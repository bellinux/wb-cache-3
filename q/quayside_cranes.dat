40|$|Abstract: Fiber Bragg grating and {{resistance}} strain gauge {{have been used to}} test the stress change in key parts of structure of 61 t- 55 m <b>quayside</b> container <b>crane</b> under the same testing conditions. The testing data and stress-time history diagrams obtained by the {{resistance strain gauge}} and fiber Bragg grating have been analyzed. The results verify good real-time property and high reliability of the structural health monitoring system based on fiber Bragg grating system. <b>Quayside</b> container <b>crane</b> is core equipment of harbor and fatigue load of its structure has great effect on service life of the whole crane, making it an important index to assess safe service life of the crane. However, test by resistance strain gauge commonly used at present cannot satisfy long-term monitoring requirements, and can only assess service life by one test; hence its reliability cannot meet actual demands. Fiber Bragg grating is a fundamental fiber optic device recently developed (since end of last century) in the world and widely used in photo-electronic treatment (e. g. fiber optic sensing).

The introduction of the Newcastle Corporation's trolleybus system, together with the commissioning of new electrically-driven cranes on the Corporation-owned Newcastle Quayside in the 1930s, turned the Manors site into the central control point for the many suburban substations used by the trolleybuses. These substations took the 6 kV AC distributed from Manors and transformed and rectified this to the 550 V DC used by the trolleybuses and rapidly diminishing tram fleet. Manors itself became a substation and supplied the city centre area with the DC power for the trolleybuses and <b>Quayside</b> <b>cranes.</b> The electrically-operated lifts used on the Tyne Bridge were supplied by Manors station.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} built to provide water {{pressure}} to power the hydraulic machinery (for cranes, lock gates and sluices) at the Grimsby Docks. The tower {{was built to}} carry a tank 200 ft above {{the ground with a}} direct feed into the machinery. Small pumps topped up the tank as the hydraulic machinery drew off water. The tower system was brought into use in 1852 working the machinery of the lock gates, dry-docks and fifteen <b>quayside</b> <b>cranes,</b> and also to supply fresh water to ships and the dwelling houses on the dock premises. The water was obtained from a well, 15 ft in diameter and 47 ft deep, with a boring of 5 in in diameter to the chalk rock in the centre, situated near to where the Grimsby Evening Telegraph has its present offices. The well was also fed by seven borings of 5 in in diameter, at intervals in a length of 300 ft, which discharged into the well by a brick culvert 3 ft in diameter.|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear dynamic {{interactions}} in harbour <b>quayside</b> <b>cranes</b> {{due to a}} two-to-one internal resonance between the lowest bending mode of the deformable boom and the in-plane pendular mode of the container are investigated. To this end, a three-dimensional model of container cranes accounting for the elastic interaction between the crane boom and the container dynamics is proposed. The container is modelled as a three-dimensional rigid body elastically suspended through hoisting cables from the trolley moving along the crane boom modelled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam. The reduced governing equations of motion are obtained through the Euler-Lagrange equations employing the boom kinetic and stored energies, derived via a Galerkin discretisation based on the mode shapes of the two-span crane boom used as trial functions, and the kinetic and stored energies of the rigid body container and the elastic hoisting cables. First, conditions for the onset of internal resonances between the boom and the container are found. A higher order perturbation treatment of the Taylor expanded equations of motion in the neighbourhood of a two-to-one internal resonance between the lowest boom bending mode and the lowest pendular mode of the container is carried out. Continuation of the fixed points of the modulation equations together with stability analysis yields a rich bifurcation behaviour, which features Hopf bifurcations. It is shown that consideration of higher order terms (cubic nonlinearities) beyond the quadratic geometric and inertia nonlinearities breaks the symmetry of the bifurcation equations, shifts the bifurcation points and the stability ranges, and leads to bifurcations not predicted by the low order analysis...|$|E

50|$|The port plays a {{major role}} in the region's energy production. British Gas Hydrocarbon Resources Limited {{operates}} a condensate-storage site in Ramsden Dock, through which the liquid by-product of gas production at the nearby Rampside Gas Terminal is exported. The PNTL vessel Pacific Heron is based at the port of Barrow, and is used to transport nuclear material between nearby Sellafield and Japan. The port also played an important role in the construction of the Barrow Offshore Wind Farm, which was completed in 2006. Resources and materials were stored at the dock before being shipped to the wind farm site on Morecambe Bay. The turbines and energy produced are still strongly associated with the port. There are 20 hectares (50 acres) of storage space within the port, owned by Associated British Ports. They also own a multi-purpose vessel, the Furness Abbey, which is available for hire. There are many cranes in Barrow's dockland. The majority are owned by BAE, and ABP only operates one 120-tonne <b>quayside</b> <b>crane.</b> The maximum dimensions of vessels that can dock in Barrow are 200 m length by 35 m beam and 10 m draught.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} impact of automated and semi-automated devices {{on the process of}} loading, discharging, stacking and un-stacking of containers using <b>Quayside</b> <b>Cranes</b> (QSCs), Straddle Carriers (SCs), Rubber Tyred Gantry cranes (RTGs) and Rail Mounted Gantry cranes (RMGs) in container terminals. The emphasis of study is on the assessment of performance and cost effectiveness of the existing automated quayside and yard cranes. The study in this thesis examines the economic implications of reducing QSCs' cycle-times brought about by automatic features installed on the post-Panamax cranes. It demonstrates that a considerable increase in the productivity of QSCs is related directly or indirectly to an expected reduction of crane cycle-times. The concept offered by the proposed improvements distinguishes between the traditional system of loading and discharging of containers and the automated methods. It implies that automation devices installed on conventional QSCs significantly reduce the total turnaroundtime and hence the cost of containerships' waiting-times. It argues, however, {{that there should be a}} balance between the cost of containerships' waiting-times and the cost of automated berths' unproductive-times (idle-times). This study uses the elements of queuing theories and proposes a novel break-even method for calculating such a balance. The number of container Ground Slots (GSs) and the annual throughput of container terminals expressed in Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) have been used as the efficiency and performance measure for many years. The study in this thesis introduces appropriate container yard design layouts and provides a generic model for calculating the annual throughput for container terminals using semiautomated SC and RTG and automated and semi-automated RMG operating systems. The throughput model proposed in this study incorporates the dynamic nature, size, type and capacity of the automated container yard operating systems and the average dwell-times, transhipment ratio, accessibility and stacking height of the containers as the salient factors in determining a container terminal throughput. Further, this thesis analyses the concept of cost functions for container yard operating systems proposed. It develops a generic cost-based model that provides the basis for a pair-wise comparison, analysis and evaluation of the economic efficiency and effectiveness of automated and semi-automated container yard stacking cranes and helps to make rational decisions. This study proposes a Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) method for evaluating and selecting the best container yard operating system amongst alternatives by examining the most important operating criteria involved. The MADM method proposed enables a decision-maker to study complex problems and allows consideration of qualitative and qualitative attributes that are heterogeneous in nature. An Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique has been employed as a weighting method to solve the MADM problem. The AHP allows for the decomposition of decision problem into a hierarchical order and enables a pair-wise comparison of the attributes and alternatives. The results of the AHP analysis provide the basis for a pair-wise comparison, judgement and selection of the best automated or semi-automated container yard operating system...|$|E

Although the landside is {{not directly related to}} the quayside operation, the yard crane scheduling of a single block (Ng and Mak 2006; Gharehgozli et al., 2014 a; Gharehgozli et al., 2014 b) and of multiple blocks (He et al. 2010; Chen and Langevin 2011) have been studied in order to improve the operational efficiency of the stacking area. Cao et al. (2010) consider the integrated scheduling of the quayside transport area and the stacking area. Furthermore, the quayside area, the quayside transport area, and the stacking area together account for the transport of containers between the vessel and the stack, and therefore the integrated scheduling of these three areas has been investigated (Meersmans and Wagelmans 2001; Chen et al. 2007; Meier and Schumann 2007; Lau and Zhao 2008; Meisel (2009); Chen et al. 2013). In general, one can conclude from this literature review that the equipment scheduling problem aims at minimizing the completion time of all jobs in order to reduce vessel turnaround time. Scheduling problems are mainly concerned with productivity improvement without any consideration of creating energy efficiency at terminals.|$|R
