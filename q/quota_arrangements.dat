Choosing a quota system for farmland preservation is thus an important issue for policy makers and researchers. In order to explain this diversity and reveal shared principles for {{the choice of a}} quota system in practice, we compare typical <b>quota</b> <b>arrangements</b> in four countries through a model of transaction cost economics (TCE). We examine agricultural zoning in the Netherlands, the transferable development right in the US, command-and-control quotas and their supplemented trading mode in China, and the debated tradable planning permits for land-use control in Germany. Our comparison not only shows that extending TCE into tradable quota theory is feasible, but also compares experience with the tools of farmland preservation across the four countries.

The bulk of sugar exports (about 160,000 tons per year in the late 1980s) went to the European Economic Community (EEC) under the Lomé Convention, a special <b>quota</b> <b>arrangement.</b> The benefits of the quota were unmistakable: in 1987, for example, the EEC price of sugar was about US$460 per ton, whereas the world price was only US$154 per ton. (The gap between the two prices was not so dramatic in other years, but it was significant.) Guyana was allowed to sell a much smaller amount of sugar (about 18,000 tons per year in 1989, down from 102,000 tons in 1974) in the United States market at prices comparable to those in the EEC under another <b>quota</b> <b>arrangement,</b> the Caribbean Basin Initiative. Maintaining preferential access to the European market was a priority in Guyana; in 1988 and 1989, production levels were too low to satisfy the EEC quota, so Guyana imported sugar at low prices and reexported it to the lucrative European market. Even so, Guyana fell 35,000 tons short of filling the quota in 1989 and 13,000 tons short in 1990.|$|R

A wave of diffusion of corporate board quota legislation has swept across Europe, {{and some other}} parts of the world. This paper departs from the ongoing European processes of gender quotas for corporate boards being in the making, and examines how the Norwegian expansion of gender quota regulation from the public sector to the corporate world was made possible. The strong tradition in Norway to introduce gender <b>quota</b> <b>arrangements</b> to promote gender balance is emphasized in particular. The paper addresses national preconditions and processes. Central questions are: How does this reform fit with the Norwegian gender equality policy tradition? And what external factors – and institutional tensions – facilitated the policy process?

International trade rules have not constrained this development, mostly due to successful management of the interplay between international resource management and trade regimes. States protect resource management objectives from such constraint by inserting clauses that establish a normative hierarchy, or they employ various means for adapting IUU measures to the 'environmental window' of the global trade regime. The fact that regional states have introduced trade restrictions only when non-restrictive or less restrictive measures have failed enhances such compatibility, as do the gradual shift from unilateral to multilateral measures and the rise in transparency, openness and target-state involvement. None of those features reduces the effectiveness of regional trade measures; they minimize tension with trade commitments and largely strengthen their clout {{in the struggle to}} combat IUU fishing in the Northeast Atlantic.

40|$|In December 2001, China was {{accepted}} to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Many anticipated that, following China's accession to the WTO, its grain imports would increase rapidly. To mitigate the likely strong shock on Chinese grain producers' income and its grains industry, China was allowed a 'transition period' {{of a few}} years. During this transition period, China's grain imports would be managed under a TRQ (tariff-rate <b>quota)</b> <b>arrangement.</b> That is, if the imports are within the quota, a lower in-quota tariff will be charged; otherwise, a much higher out-quota tariff applies. The higher above-quota tariff would discourage imports and thus would provide protection to Chinese farmers and its grains industry. Five {{years have passed since}} China {{became a member of the}} WTO. Then, what has happened to China's grain trade under the TRQ arrangement? How did China implement the grains TRQ? Were China's TRQ practices in alignment with WTO rules? Such questions have continuously drawn much interest from grain traders and many international observers.

Design/methodology/approach – Survey data were randomly obtained from a questionnaire sample of 120 indigenes in Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers states; and subjected to factor-analysis using varimax rotation to identify the most crucial factors likely to influence the success of the policy. Cronbach's a was also applied to ascertain the reliability of the data and overall agreement amongst respondents. Findings – The study reveals a general level of indifference amongst the respondents, and an insignificant level of entrepreneurial implication, regarding the LC policy. Notwithstanding, the need to create business prospects, jobs opportunities, and establish special <b>quota</b> <b>arrangements</b> to benefit indigenes of the oil producing host-communities were found to be most crucial in their assessment of the policy's efficacy. Practical implications – It is expected that the policy should stimulate and open up more channels for budding entrepreneurial activities, job opportunities and wealth generation. These would mitigate situations of unwarranted militant activities, social disorder and disguised criminalities such as kidnapping and destruction of oil installations, resulting from perceived marginalisation, massive unemployment and poor living standards experienced within the region. Originality/value – The study provides insights into how the LC policy, if properly harnessed and judiciously implemented, can generate win-win outcomes for the nation, multi-national oil companies, host communities and indigenous entrepreneurs.

40|$|It is {{generally}} agreed that the arrangements that have regulated trade in textiles and clothing have slowed the natural shift in comparative advantage from industrial countries to developing countries. But {{there is quite a}} bit of disagreement about how restrictive the Multi-Fibre Agreements (MFA) are. The authors address the potential sources of allocative inefficiency occasioned by the MFA and search for evidence that the MFA has indeed led to such inefficiency. In a theoretical section, they identify five sources of inefficiency relating to allocations across countries, across consumers, and among firms within constrained countries. In the empirical part of the paper, first they provide evidence of the restrictiveness of the <b>quota</b> <b>arrangements</b> from trends in import shares for aggregate categories of textiles and clothing, before and during the MFA. Then they provide evidence from a detailed examination of quota utilization rates and price differentials among EC importing countries. Among their findings: relatively high utilization rates across exporters suggest a relatively high degree (and stability) of quota bindingness across exporters; overshipment was highest for the most important (by shipment value) products; there is concentration among a few leading exports (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Thailand) and a few importers (Benelux, Germany, and the United Kingdom); the data suggest a positive correlation between the coefficients of variation in prices and quota utilization rates for China, Hong Kong, and Korea suggesting that prices are related, as one would expect, to the degree of bindingness; and the data suggest that binding quotas would be associated with higher import prices.

40|$|Drawing on the {{experience}} and academic research of the 1990 s, this chapter identifies five lessons: • Openness to trade has been a central element of successful growth strategies. In all countries that have sustained growth the share of trade in gross domestic product (GDP) has increased, and trade barriers have been reduced. • Trade is an opportunity, not a guarantee. While trade reforms can help accelerate integration {{in the world economy}} and strengthen an effective growth strategy, they cannot ensure its success. Other elements that address binding constraints to growth are needed, possibly including sound macroeconomic management, trade-related infrastructure and institutions, and economywide investments in human capital and infrastructure. • There are many possible ways to open an economy. The challenge for policy makers is to identify which best suits their country’s political economy, institutional constraints, and initial conditions. As these vary from country to country, {{it is not surprising that}} there is a striking heterogeneity in country experiences regarding the timing and pace of reforms. Different countries have opened up different sectors at different speeds (for example Bangladesh and India); others have achieved partial liberalization through the establishment of export processing zones (for example China and Mauritius); and yet others have combined unilateral trade reforms with participation in regional trade agreements (for example Estonia). • The distributive effects of trade liberalization are diverse, and not always pro-poor. Trade reforms were expected to increase the incomes of the unskilled in countries with a comparative advantage in producing unskilled-intensive goods. Yet evidence from the 1990 s suggests that even in instances where trade policy has reduced poverty, there are still distributive issues. One important policy lesson is that countries need to help workers affected move out of contracting (import-competing) sectors into expanding (exporting) sectors. This is an issue relevant to both developing and industrialized countries. • The preservation and expansion of the world trade system hinges on its ability to strike a better balance between the interests of industrialized and developing countries. Global markets are the most hostile to the products produced by the world’s poor—such as agricultural products and textiles and apparel. The problems of escalating tariffs, tariff peaks, and <b>quota</b> <b>arrangements</b> systematically deny the poor market access and skew the incentives against adding value in poor countries. These problems can be addressed through collective action, best pursued through the Doha Round and the World Trade Organization. ...|$|E

It is the only viable way to survive the current environment of global economic uncertainty with the volatility of oil price.

40|$|This report {{compares the}} production, market and trade {{outcomes}} of two alternative policy scenarios, namely expiry of EU sugar quotas in 2015 / 16 and {{extension of the}} current sugar quota scheme. All other EU policy measures pertaining to the sugar sector, and to agriculture more generally, are assumed the same in both scenarios. The year of comparison is 2020. The CAPRI model {{was used for the}} simulations. The report begins with a description of beet and sugar production within the EU, and outlines the policies applied in the sugar sector within the EU’s Common Agricultural policy. This is followed by a description of the workings of the EU market for sugar. A theoretical model is used to summarise the main functional relationships in the EU sugar market and related markets, and the EU’s trade in sugar, from which a number of theory-based predictions about the impacts of quota expiry are derived. There is then a very brief overview of the CAPRI model and the way it has been used in this study. Isoglucose quotas will expire along with sugar quotas, and there is much speculation about the extent of potential competitive substitution between the two sweeteners, which has until now been neutralised by the <b>quota</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain greater insight into this issue. Two additional quota-expiry scenarios were run, in which isoglucose was assumed to take a 10 % and a 20 % share of the sweetener market at the expense of sugar. The main findings are: •	production of sugar beet and white sugar increases by around 4 %,. •	there is little net impact on the production of cereals, •	total ethanol production hardly changes, but the importance of sugar as an ethanol feedstock declines by a few percentage points, •	raw sugar imports from high-cost third countries decline very substantially, but those from the low-cost producer Brazil decrease only slightly, •	EU sugar exports fall, •	EU human consumption of sugar increases only marginally, despite a fall of 15 - 16 % in beet prices for sugar for internal human consumption, •	there is a very small positive welfare change, although income accruing to sugar beet producers falls by over 17 %,JRC.

This industry has been very much regulated by many bilateral agreements such as Multi Fiber <b>Arrangement</b> (MFA), a <b>quota</b> <b>arrangement</b> made by the importing countries. As MFA (quota regime) comes to an end by 2005 and integrates into the WTO regime, it will bring opportunities to highly competitive and proactive garment exporting countries whereas the challenges will be faced more by the less competitive countries.

40|$|The authors {{provide a}} simple {{introduction}} to {{the economics of the}} Multifibre Arrangement (MFA) and use available empirical evidence to examine its impact on exports of garments and textiles, focusing on India. Their review of the basic economics of the MFA shows the discriminatory character of the Arrangement. While exporting countries can gain from quota rents, much of this gain is likely to be offset by losses in exports to unrestricted markets, through waste resulting from domestic rent-seeking behavior, or shared with industrial country importers. Moreover, the restrictions curtail the ability of countries to generate sorely needed employment in the labor-intensive garment and textile sectors. Recent estimates for India of the export tax equivalents of the quotas suggest that they increased in 1999, {{after a couple of years}} around lower levels. The authors also examine the domestic policy distortions affecting the industry in India. While the abolition of quotas on international trade in textiles in 2005 will create opportunities for developing countries, it will also expose them to additional competition from other, formerly restrained exporters. The outcome for any country will depend on its policy response. Countries that use the opportunity to streamline their policies and improve their competitiveness are likely to increase their gains from quota abolition. Modeling results suggest that South Asia as a whole will gain from quota abolition, although different countries may experience different results. Unambiguously, however, the gains from domestic reform will increase after the abolition of the <b>quota</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Economic Theory&Research,Labor Policies,Environmental Economics&Policies,Markets and Market Access,Payment Systems&Infrastructure,Economic Theory&Research,Environmental Economics&Policies,TF 054105 -DONOR FUNDED OPERATION ADMINISTRATION FEE INCOME AND EXPENSE ACCOUNT,Markets and Market Access,Access to Markets...|$|R

But this performance has not been accompanied {{by some of the}} more dynamic growth benefits that might have been hoped for. In this study we develop the theory and present empirical evidence to demonstrate that these outcomes are the predictable consequences of {{the manner in which the}} specific preferences might be expected to work. The MFA (Multi-fiber <b>Arrangement)</b> <b>quotas</b> on US imports of textiles created a favorable environment for low value-added, fabric-intensive clothing production in countries with unused quotas by inducing constrained countries to move into higher quality products. By allowing the least developed African countries to use third country fabrics in their clothing exports to the US, AGOA provided additional implicit effective subsidies to clothing that were multiples of the US tariffs on clothing imports. Taken together, these policies help account for the program’s success and demonstrate the importance of other rules of origin in preventing poor countries from taking advantage of other preference programs. But the disappointments can also be attributed to the preferences because they discouraged additional value-addition in assembly and stimulated the use of expensive fabrics that were unlikely to be produced locally. When the MFA was removed, constrained countries such as China moved strongly into precisely the markets in which AGOA countries had specialized. Although AGOA helped the least developed countries withstand this shock, they were nonetheless adversely affected. Preference erosion due to MFN reductions in US clothing tariffs could similarly have particularly severe adverse effects on these countries. ...|$|R
