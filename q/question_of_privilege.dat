50|$|In Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR), {{questions}} of privilege affecting the assembly may include matters of comfort, amplification, or safety. For example, {{it may be}} difficult to hear the speaker. In this case, a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> could be raised to close the doors and windows. Such questions have precedence over {{questions of}} personal privilege should they conflict. Otherwise, a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> can only be interrupted by the motions to take a recess, adjourn, or fix the time to which to adjourn, or any incidental motions that must be disposed of at that time.|$|E

40|$|Article V of the New York Proposed Code of Evidence {{sets forth}} the rules <b>of</b> evidentiary <b>privilege.</b> Unlike other {{articles}} of the Proposed Code, it differs significantly from its federal counterpart.

5000|$|Interim Liberal leader Bob Rae {{responded to}} this revelation, saying, [...] "if they did, {{then we have a}} real problem because then that means that they were {{effectively}} misleading Parliament for many, many, many months.

50|$|His parliamentarian, Denise Davis disagreed, {{stating that}} <b>question</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> {{relating}} to the removal of a Speaker from office is such a highly privileged one that even the leader may not refuse.

40|$|In Jaffee v. United States, 116 S. Ct. 1923 (1996), the U. S. Supreme Court {{recognized}} a testimonial privilege protecting the patient-psychotherapist relationship.

The Court held that this rule authorized not only recognition <b>of</b> a new <b>privilege,</b> but also a <b>privilege</b> <b>of</b> a broad scope, extending to relationships between patients and licensed clinical social workers. Its decision came as a mild surprise, given a widely shared assumption that Rule 501 creates a strong presumption against establishment <b>of</b> new <b>privileges.</b> T his article criticizes the Court 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on an instrumental rationale, one that sees privileges as a means to the end of encourging individuals to seek needed psychotherapeutic assistance. After examining the etymology of the statutory terms reason and experience, the article argues that the Court should have explored a humanistic, privacy-focused rationale for its decision. Still, the article concludes, the Court arrived at the correct result, and in so doing, offered important insight into the meaning of those key statutory terms...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to these powers, the President has various other discretionary powers in the Constitution, which are of lesser political significance (in normal circumstances). The President may decide to call a referendum on legislation [...] "of great national significance". This power, granted by Article 27 of the Constitution, has not so far been used. The President cannot initiate a referendum, but must wait for an application {{by a majority of}} the Seanad (Senate) and one-third of the Dáil. Generally, owing {{to the way in which}} the Seanad is elected, the Government's coalition controls a majority of the seats, and strong party discipline means that Senators rarely go against their own party, so getting Seanad support for a referendum is difficult. If the Seanad were to be reformed, this power could potentially become much more significant. Similarly, the President has a latent role in resolving disputes between the Dáil and the Seanad. The President may convene a special committee to resolve <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> between the Dáil and the Seanad with regard to Money Bills, and with regard to speeding the passage of urgent bills through the Seanad. Again, owing to the method by which the Seanad is elected, disputes of this nature tend not to emerge in practice.|$|R
50|$|Hulbert was incensed when, on 19 January 1963, the BBC {{television}} programme That Was The Week That Was broadcast an item identifying the 13 {{members of parliament}} who had not spoken in the Chamber since the general election. He raised the issue as a <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Parliamentary <b>privilege,</b> {{saying that it was}} a claim that the Members concerned had not been attentive to their Parliamentary duties, and was inaccurate. Many other MPs considered the complaint itself risible and laughed while he was making it. The Speaker gave the complaint the traditional overnight consideration but ruled that it did not prima facie amount to an affront to the House.|$|R
