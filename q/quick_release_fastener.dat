25|$|The Mk.4 {{seat was}} {{designed}} as an improved, lightweight version of earlier Martin-Baker seats for installation {{in a range of}} lighter, smaller aircraft types. Improvements included a single combined seat and parachute <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>fastener</b> (QRF) and a snubber mechanism to allow crews to lean forward without loosening the harness. The first successful ejection using a Mk.4 seat took place in March 1957, the aircraft involved being a Fiat G.91.|$|E
50|$|The top of {{the case}} is removed by opening 4 <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> <b>fasteners,</b> {{revealing}} a number of user adjustable trimmers and pots. The modular design of the FT-221, where removable circuit boards allowed radio hams to modify their FT-221 either by replacing specific components or even replacing the whole board. One such replacement is the mutek replacement front end board which improved the front-end sensitivity. The open format of the internal construction also allowed the transmit and receive cables to be brought outside the case to use a low-noise coaxial relay.|$|R
50|$|Locking skewers {{replace the}} {{existing}} <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewers on a bicycle's wheels and Seatpost clamp (<b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewers enable removal without tools). This reduces {{the need to}} lock these parts of the bike since now their removal requires tools. One type of locking skewer uses the same design as a normal <b>Quick</b> <b>release</b> skewer, except after clamping the skewer the (keyed) handle may be removed.|$|R

50|$|A side-effect is {{that the}} <b>quick</b> <b>release,</b> which was {{developed}} to allow the wheel to be removed without having to unscrew any components, no longer works as designed: the skewer must be unscrewed in order to remove the wheel (although tools do remain unnecessary). This means that the tension on refitting must be adjusted again. Some cyclists file off the lawyer tabs so the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> works as originally intended.|$|R

50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>release</b> {{harnesses}} {{are already}} widely in use, {{and make it}} possible for sailors to unhook themselves from the wire from all angles while it is under tension, thus decreasing the chance of getting trapped underwater or in dangerous conditions. The adoption of <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> harnesses has not been universal due to the reduced reliability of the moving parts; stories of such systems releasing unexpectedly have caused many to shun them in favour of traditional fixed hooks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Quick</b> <b>releases</b> are {{sometimes}} recommended against {{with the use}} of disk brakes because of the need for the axle attachment to withstand braking forces.|$|R

50|$|Lawyer lips or lawyer tabs (a type of {{positive}} retention device) are tabs fitted to the fork ends {{on the front}} fork of bicycles sold in some countries (particularly the U.S.) to prevent a wheel from leaving the fork if the <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> skewer comes undone. They were introduced in response to lawsuits supported by experts including John Howard, in cases where incorrectly adjusted <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> wheels {{came out of the}} forks. Lawyer tabs are designed to compensate for the fact that many riders {{do not know how to}} operate a <b>quick</b> <b>release</b> properly: some riders treat them as a folding wing nut, and others do not tighten them enough for fear of snapping them or shearing the skewer (both are not likely given the normal range of human strength, and the mechanical advantages involved, as long as the skewer is not damaged or flawed).|$|R
