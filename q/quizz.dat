James juggled it for the first nine yards in the endzone, but recovered in time to get his foot in the last yard for the score. Arizona State came out pretty sharp as they scored on their first possession. The Beavs came out and scored on a drive with three huge plays. Most notably a long pass to James Rodgers which set up an easy score from Sean Canfield to Damola Adeniji from the 2. Arizona took too long on their next drive, trailing 28-10.

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>Quizz,</b> a gamified crowdsourcing {{system that}} simultaneously assesses {{the knowledge of}} users and acquires new knowledge from them. <b>Quizz</b> operates by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific topics; as a user answers the quiz questions, <b>Quizz</b> estimates the user’s competence. To acquire new knowledge, <b>Quizz</b> also incorporates questions for which {{we do not have}} a known answer; the answers given by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct answers for these questions. <b>Quizz</b> actively tries to identify knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising campaigns, effectively leveraging the targeting capabilities of existing, publicly available, ad placement services. <b>Quizz</b> quantifies the contributions of the users using information theory and sends feedback to the advertising system about each user. The feedback allows the ad targeting mechanism to further optimize ad placement. Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand users, confirm that we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users with the desired expertise and interest in the given topic. We present controlled experiments that examine the effect of various incentive mechanisms, highlighting the need for having short-term rewards as goals, which incentivize the users to contribute. Finally, our costquality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is below that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while offering the additional advantage of giving access to billions of potential users all over the planet, and being able to reach users with specialized expertise that is not typically available through existing labor marketplaces. 1...|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins] October 24, 1942. Bryant Service Club Bryant College Providence, R. I. Hello there! It {{looks as}} though someone, somewhere slipped up on the detail. Yes, I would {{recommend}} KP for a week. The folks at home forwarded to me a card which was sent out by Bryant service Club stating that the last package sent was not acknowledged. I received it in excellent condition, and was very grateful for it. In fact I sat right down and answered it, but didn’t’ answer to the Bryant Service Club, but {{to one of the}} faculty. I reckon it was at a busy time and slipped someone’s mind. Since that date I have been promoted to First Sergeant. It is a job with many headaches, but a job that presents many interesting problems in dealing with men, both good and bad. I find it extremely fascinating, and hope that somewhere along the line I do some good. However, being the “Mother” of a squadron surely keeps one very busy. For an example: Last week the Major, my commanding officer, suggested that I handle the painting of the mess hall (130 ’ x 30 ’) and choose my own color scheme and do just what I pleased just as long as I kept within a prearranged price limit. It was fun planning colors, buying drape material, and actually supervising the making and painting. One of the cooks, a natural cartoonist, has put several sketches of the mess personnel on the walls, and I await with eager anticipation the inspection by the Base Administrative Inspector next Tuesday. It is the only mess hall on the field that has been painted on the interior, and he should be extremely surprised. However, that detail is but one of many {{in the course of a}} day. I feel qualified to take charge of anything from minding babies to being best man at a wedding; form simple plumbing difficulties to very complex status reports on personnel. Oh yes, I am a right hand man to Dorothy Dix, only she doesn’t know it. On the 21 st of next month, one of the leading banks in Manchester will have on display some of my work in clay. The theme is “Don’t Talk. ”, or the “Civilian <b>Quizz</b> Program”. I have completed a soldier seated, and am making about eight civilian figures, all apparently asking questions. From each figure will be a runner with the question on the end of the runner. The figures stand about eight inches high, and it is quite a bit of work, but I enjoy it as a hobby in my room after work of the day is through. There aren’t too many evening s when there is free time, for the unexpected is always coming up. The people of Manchester have treated most of the soldiers very cordially, and well they might, for we spend almost all of our money in town, and have brought a mild degree of prosperity to the townsfolk, in addition to the current boom. I have been entertained a good deal, and several of my boys have found the “right girl”, have settled down to an almost normal life. How long it will last, I don’t dare guess. Incidentally, my present home address, for the records is s/o Mrs. Louis J. G. Martelle, 75 Pequot Road, Pawtucket, R. I., and any mail you may wish to send can be sent there. I receive the Bryant Alumni regularly, and quite often I see an item of some former classmate. While at Bryant, I traveled with William Gavitt of Cranston. Bill is now a Captain in the Marines, somewhere in the Pacific according to the latest reports from his folks. All for now, it is way beyond my bed time, and inasmuch as I haven’t done very much typing since I became 1 st sgt, this workout has really taken me over the coals. Very truly yours, LOUIS C. MARTELLE, 1 st Sgt, 34 th Base Hq 2 ̆ 6 AB Sq. [Transcription ends...|$|E
