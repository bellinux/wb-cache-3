25|$|Even if {{the source}} {{intensity}} is turned down, {{so that only}} one particle (e.g. photon or electron) is passing through the apparatus at a time, the same interference pattern develops over time. The <b>quantum</b> <b>particle</b> acts as a wave when passing through the double slits, but as a particle when it is detected. This is a typical feature of quantum complementarity: a <b>quantum</b> <b>particle</b> will act as a wave in an experiment to measure its wave-like properties, and like a particle in an experiment to measure its particle-like properties. The point on the detector screen where any individual particle shows up will {{be the result of}} a random process. However, the distribution pattern of many individual particles will mimic the diffraction pattern produced by waves.|$|E

25|$|The Schrödinger {{equation}} {{includes the}} wavefunction, so its wave packet solution implies {{the position of}} a (<b>quantum)</b> <b>particle</b> is fuzzily spread out in wave fronts. On the contrary, the Hamilton–Jacobi equation applies to a (classical) particle of definite position and momentum, instead the position and momentum at all times (the trajectory) are deterministic and can be simultaneously known.|$|E
25|$|In the {{framework}} of the de Broglie–Bohm theory, the quantum potential is a term within the Schrödinger equation which acts to guide the movement of quantum particles. The quantum potential approach introduced by Bohm provides a formally more complete exposition of the idea presented by Louis de Broglie: de Broglie had postulated in 1926 that the wave function represents a pilot wave which guides a <b>quantum</b> <b>particle,</b> but had subsequently abandoned his approach due to objections raised by Wolfgang Pauli. The seminal articles of Bohm in 1952 introduced the quantum potential and included answers to the objections which had been raised against the pilot wave theory.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman turned to quantum gravity. By analogy with the photon, which has spin 1, he {{investigated}} {{the consequences of a}} free massless spin 2 field and derived the Einstein field equation of general relativity, but little more. The computational device that Feynman discovered then for gravity, [...] "ghosts", which are [...] "particles" [...] in the interior of his diagrams that have the [...] "wrong" [...] connection between spin and statistics, have proved invaluable in explaining the <b>quantum</b> <b>particle</b> behavior of the Yang–Mills theories, for example, quantum chromodynamics and the electro-weak theory. He did work on all four of the forces of nature: electromagnetic, the weak force, the strong force and gravity. John and Mary Gribbin say in their book on Feynman: [...] "Nobody else has made such influential contributions to the investigation of all four of the interactions".|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that <b>quantum</b> <b>particles</b> can cross a black hole event horizons. This conclusion {{is based on the}} assumption that by specific singular coordinate transformations it is possible to remove divergences in the geodesic equations. We note that, while the used singular coordinate transformations do not cause problems on the level of the classical geodesic equations, which contain the first derivatives of particle wavefunctions, they usually lead to the appearance of delta-functions in the equations of <b>quantum</b> <b>particles.</b> In this paper, using physical boundary conditions for the equation of motion of <b>quantum</b> <b>particles</b> close to the black hole event horizon, it is found the real-valued exponentially time-dependent (not harmonic) wavefunctions. This means that <b>quantum</b> <b>particles</b> probably do not enter the Schwarzschild sphere, but are absorbed and some are reflected by it, what potentially can solve the main black hole mysteries.

2500|$|One {{can then}} compute the {{probability}} density associated to the approximate wave function. The {{probability that the}} <b>quantum</b> <b>particle</b> will {{be found in the}} classically forbidden region is small. In the classically allowed region, meanwhile, the [...] probability the <b>quantum</b> <b>particle</b> will be found in a given interval is approximately the fraction of time the classical particle spends in that interval over one period of motion. Since the classical particle's velocity goes to zero at the turning points, it spends more time near the turning points than in other classically allowed regions. This observation accounts for the peak in the wave function (and its probability density) near the turning points.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Penrose {{proposed}} that the Schrödinger–Newton equation mathematically describes the basis states involved in a gravitationally induced wavefunction collapse scheme. Penrose suggests that a superposition {{of two or more}} quantum states which have a significant amount of mass displacement ought to be unstable and reduce to one of the states within a finite time. He hypothesises that there exists a [...] "preferred" [...] set of states which could collapse no further, specifically the stationary states of the Schrödinger–Newton equation. A macroscopic system can therefore never be in a spatial superposition since the nonlinear gravitational self-interaction immediately leads to a collapse to a stationary state of the Schrödinger–Newton equation. According to Penrose's idea, when a <b>quantum</b> <b>particle</b> is measured, there is an interplay of this nonlinear collapse and environmental decoherence. The gravitational interaction leads to the reduction of the environment to one distinct state and decoherence leads to the localisation of the particle, e.g. as a dot on a screen.|$|E
2500|$|This {{is where}} {{statistical}} mechanics come into play, and where physicists begin to require rather unintuitive mental models: A particle's path simply cannot be exactly specified in its full quantum description. [...] "Path" [...] is a classical, practical attribute in our every day life, but one which quantum particles do not meaningfully possess. The probabilities discovered in quantum mechanics do nevertheless arise from measurement (of the perceived {{path of the}} particle). As Stephen Hawking explains, the result is not traditional determinism, but rather determined probabilities. In some cases, a <b>quantum</b> <b>particle</b> may indeed trace an exact path, and the probability of finding the particles in that path is one (certain to be true). In fact, as far as prediction goes, the quantum development {{is at least as}} predictable as the classical motion, but the key is that it describes wave functions that cannot be easily expressed in ordinary language. As far as the thesis of determinism is concerned, these probabilities, at least, are quite determined. These findings from quantum mechanics have found many applications, and allow us to build transistors and lasers. Put another way: personal computers, Blu-ray players and the internet all work because humankind discovered the determined probabilities of the quantum world. None of that should be taken to imply that other aspects of quantum mechanics are not still up for debate.|$|E

50|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, {{inspired}} by the successful use of quantum structures to model aspects of human cognition, and more specifically for the quantum modeling of the dynamics of human concepts in human thought, Aerts started to work on an idea that, if true, would deliver a revolutionary explanatory framework for quantum theory. Although not complicated in itself, the idea has very far-reaching consequences for many aspects of our physical reality. His idea was the following: <b>Quantum</b> <b>particles,</b> as they appear to us by interacting with (macroscopic) measuring apparatuses, are not 'objects' but 'concepts' or 'conceptual entities'. In other words, <b>quantum</b> <b>particles</b> are not strangely behaving particle-like objects but they are conceptual entities or concepts, playing a semantic role in the conceptual interaction taking place between pieces of matter. This means that pieces of matter are the equivalent of memory structures for the conceptual entities that <b>quantum</b> <b>particles</b> are.|$|R
