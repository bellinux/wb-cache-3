5|$|An {{optional}} query, {{separated from}} the preceding part by a question mark (?), containing a <b>query</b> <b>string</b> of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attribute–value pairs separated by a delimiter.|$|E
25|$|The generic URL (Uniform Resource Locator) syntax {{allows for}} a <b>query</b> <b>string</b> to be {{appended}} to a file name in a web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the question mark, or query mark, ?, is used to indicate {{the start of a}} <b>query</b> <b>string.</b> A <b>query</b> <b>string</b> is usually made up of a number of different name–value pairs, each separated by the ampersand symbol, &. For example, http://www.example.com/login.php?username=test=blank.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to save {{searches}} as a Search Folder where opening the folder will execute a specific search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved <b>query</b> <b>string</b> and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the <b>query</b> <b>string</b> of another search.|$|E

2500|$|Entrez Global Query is an {{integrated}} search and retrieval system that {{provides access to}} all databases simultaneously with a single <b>query</b> <b>string</b> and user interface. [...] Entrez can efficiently retrieve related sequences, structures, and references. The Entrez system can provide views of gene and protein sequences and chromosome maps. Some textbooks are also available online through the Entrez system.|$|E
5000|$|This {{convention}} is a W3C recommendation. [...] W3C recommends that all web servers support semicolon separators {{in addition to}} ampersand separators to allow application/x-www-form-urlencoded <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> in URLs within HTML documents without having to entity escape ampersands.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Query</b> <b>strings</b> {{form part}} of the URL, and are {{therefore}} included if the user saves or sends the URL to another user; cookies can be maintained across browsing sessions, but are not saved or sent with the URL.|$|R
5000|$|Different <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> {{passed by}} {{different}} {{visits to the}} page will mean that the pages are never served from the browser (or proxy, if present) cache thereby increasing the load on the web server and slowing down the user experience.|$|R
2500|$|The Entrez {{front page}} provides, by default, {{access to the}} global query. [...] All {{databases}} indexed by Entrez can be searched via a single <b>query</b> <b>string,</b> supporting boolean operators and search term tags to limit parts of the search statement to particular fields. [...] This returns a unified results page, that shows the number of hits for the search {{in each of the}} databases, which are also links to actual search results for that particular database.|$|E
2500|$|MDAC 2.8 was {{released}} in August 2003 and distributed with Microsoft Windows Server 2003, {{as well as on}} Microsoft's [...] website. It did not introduce any new features to the product but fixed a number of bugs and security issues [...] a reg file (automates changes to the registry) was removed that made the server run in an [...] "unsafe" [...] mode whereby the RDS could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the system and a new restriction was imposed on the length of the Shape <b>query</b> <b>string.</b> There were also several ODBC Administrator changes.|$|E
2500|$|In Windows Search, {{which is}} part of Windows Vista, it is also {{possible}} to save a search query as a Virtual Folder, called a Saved Search or Search Folder which, when accessed, runs the search with the saved query and returns the results as a folder listing. Physically, a search folder is just an XML file (with a [...]search-ms extension) which stores the search query (in either AQS or NQS), including the search operators as well. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the <b>query</b> <b>string</b> of another search. Search Folders are also distributable via RSS. By default, Windows references the profile of the user who originally created a Search Folder as part of the query's scope. This design choice does not prevent saved searches from being shared with other users, but it prevents them from operating on different user profiles. While users can manually modify the contents of a saved search so that the scope references the %USERPROFILE% environment variable, which will enable it to operate on other machines or profiles regardless of the original author, Microsoft has released a SearchMelt Creator utility that automates this process for the user.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} tools {{available}} today to help software engineers search in source code systems. It {{is often the}} case, however, {{that there is a}} gap between what people really want to find and the actual <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> they specify. This is because a concept in a software system may be represented by many different terms, while the same term may have different meanings in different places. Therefore, software engineers often have to guess as they specify a search, and often have to repeatedly search before finding what they want. To alleviate the search problem, this thesis describes a study of what we call intelligent search techniques as implemented in a software exploration environment, whose purpose is to facilitate software maintenance. We propose to utilize some information retrieval techniques to automatically apply transformations to the <b>query</b> <b>strings.</b> The thesis first introduces the intelligent search techniques used in our study, including abbreviation concatenation and abbreviation expansion. Then it describes in detail the rating algorithms used to evaluate the query results' similarity to the original <b>query</b> <b>strings.</b> Next, we describe a series of experiments we conducted to assess the effectiveness of both the intelligent search methods and our rating algorithms. Finally, we describe how we use the analysis of the experimental results to recommend an effective combination of searching techniques for software maintenance, as well as to guide our future research...|$|R

40|$|A new {{spectral}} {{code that}} can be used by Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) as an index for infrared (IR) spectra searches in Relational Database (RDB) is presented and its suitability is evaluated. Spectral codes are constructed for all spectra in the database as the spectral indexes and three <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> are created with the same theory used for the creation of the index code for the query spectrum. Some effects of parameters used to create index <b>strings</b> and <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> are discussed. All spectral searches are accomplished in structured query language (SQL) approach and the utilization examples of SQL have been shown. The sequential application of this procedure can reduce the original library of about 18 000 spectra to a few spectra {{that can be}} used as references for subsequent detailed comparison. The software developed for the proposed system is particularly suitable for spectral search and structure interpretation...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{subcellular}} localization is {{an essential}} step to annotate proteins and to design drugs. This paper proposes a functionaldomain based method—GOASVM—by making full use of Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) database to predict the subcellular locations of proteins. GOASVM uses the accession number (AC) of a query protein and the accession numbers (ACs) of homologous proteins returned from PSI-BLAST as the <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> to search against the GOA database. The occurrences of a set of predefined GO terms are used to construct the GO vectors for classification by support vector machines (SVMs). The paper investigated two different approaches to constructing the GO vectors. Experimental results suggest that using the ACs of homologous proteins as the <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> can achieve an accuracy of 94. 68 %, which is significantly higher than all published results based on the same dataset. As a userfriendly web-server, GOASVM is freely accessible to the public a...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a segmentation-free <b>query</b> by <b>string</b> word {{spotting}} method. Both the documents and <b>query</b> <b>strings</b> are encoded using a recently proposed word representa- tion that projects images and strings into a common atribute space based on a pyramidal histogram of characters(PHOC). These attribute models are learned using linear SVMs over the Fisher Vector representation of the images along with the PHOC labels of the corresponding strings. In order to search through the whole page, document regions are indexed per character bi- gram using a similar attribute representation. On top of that, we propose an integral image representation of the document using a simplified version of the attribute model for efficient computation. Finally we introduce a re-ranking step in order to boost retrieval performance.
