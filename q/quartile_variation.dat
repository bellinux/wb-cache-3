40|$|The {{variability}} of electromyographic (EMG) recordings between and within participants {{is a complex}} problem, rarely studied in swimming. The importance of signal normalization has long been recognized, but the method used might influence variability. The aims {{of this study were}} to: (i) assess the intra-individual {{variability of}} the EMG signal in highly skilled front crawl swimmers, (ii) determine the influence of two methods of both amplitude and time normalization of the EMG signal on intra-individual variability and of time normalization on muscle activity level and (iii) describe the muscle activity, normalized using MVIC, in rela-tion to upper limb crawl stroke movements. Muscle activity of rectus abdominis and deltoi-deus medialis was recorded using wireless surface EMG in 15 adult male competitive swimmers during three trials of 12. 5 m front crawl at maximal speed without breathing. Two full upper limb cycles were analyzed from each of the swimming trials, resulting in six full cycles used for the intra-individual variability assessment, quantified with the coefficient of variation (CV), coefficient of <b>quartile</b> <b>variation</b> (CQV) and the variance ratio (VR). The results of this study support previous findings on EMG patterns of deltoideus medialis and rectu...|$|E
40|$|Variability of electromyographic (EMG) {{recordings}} is {{a complex}} phenomenon rarely examined in swimming. Our purposes were to investigate inter-individual variability in muscle activation patterns during front crawl swimming and assess if there were clusters of sub patterns present. Bilateral muscle activity of rectus abdominis (RA) and deltoideus medialis (DM) was recorded using wireless surface EMG in 15 adult male competitive swimmers. The amplitude of the median EMG trial of six upper arm movement cycles {{was used for the}} inter-individual variability assessment, quantified with the coefficient of variation, coefficient of <b>quartile</b> <b>variation,</b> the variance ratio and mean deviation. Key features were selected based on qualitative and quantitative classification strategies to enter in a k-means cluster analysis to examine the presence of strong sub patterns. Such strong sub patterns were found when clustering in two, three and four clusters. Inter-individual variability in a group of highly skilled swimmers was higher compared to other cyclic movements which is in contrast to what has been reported in the previous 50 years of EMG research in swimming. This leads to the conclusion that coaches should be careful in using overall reference EMG information to enhance the individual swimming technique of their athletes. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Inter- and intra-subject {{variability}} {{of the motor}} evoked potentials (MEPs) to TMS is a well-known phenomenon. Although a possible link between this variability and ongoing brain oscillations was demonstrated, {{the results of the}} studies are not consistent with each other. Exploring this topic further is important since the modulation of MEPs provides unique possibility to relate oscillatory cortical phenomena to the state of the motor cortex probed with TMS. Given that alpha oscillations were shown to reflect cortical excitability, we hypothesized that their power and variability might explain the modulation of subject-specific MEPs to single- and paired-pulse TMS (spTMS, ppTMS, respectively). Neuronal activity was recorded with multichannel EEG. We used spTMS and two ppTMS conditions: intracortical facilitation (ICF) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI). Spearman correlations were calculated within and across subjects between MEPs and the pre-stimulus power of alpha oscillations in low (8 – 10 Hz) and high (10 – 12 Hz) frequency bands. Coefficient of <b>quartile</b> <b>variation</b> was used to measure variability. Across-subject analysis revealed no difference in the pre-stimulus alpha power among the TMS conditions. However, the {{variability of}} high-alpha power in spTMS condition was larger than in the SICI condition. In ICF condition pre-stimulus high-alpha power variability correlated positively with MEP amplitude variability. No correlation has been observed between the pre-stimulus alpha power and MEP responses in any of the conditions. Our results for the first time show that the variability of the alpha oscillations can be more predictive of TMS effects than the commonly used power of oscillations and we provide further support for the dissociation of high and low-alpha bands in predicting responses produced by the stimulation of the motor cortex...|$|E
40|$|This paper models {{individual}} wage variation in Finland by exploiting a high-quality dataset. The data is deflated to 1998 prices using earnings and salary index. For both genders {{the data is}} divided into four income quartiles. A linear mixed-effects model is estimated with the three degree polynomials of age, the duration of employment, and GDP growth as explanatory variables. The model provides predictors for {{individual wage}}s. The estimation period is 1975 - 1985. Genuine out-of-sample predictions are made first assuming a normal growth in 1986 - 1990, then a deep recession in 1991 - 1994. According to the models, the wage formation seems to be essentially different in different wage <b>quartiles.</b> Individual <b>variation</b> within a wage quartile is shown to be large. GDP is statistically significant only for one wage group, but still the prediction accuracy is remarkably worse during the recession period when GDP drops dramatically. The prediction errors for the middle-wage quarters seem to be considerably smaller than for the low and high-wage groups. There is some indication that the middle quarters can be predicted quite accurately several years ahead. The results show that individual aspects and the wage group {{play a significant role}} in modeling and prediction. This is potentially useful information when designing and developing pension schemes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spatial snowpack {{variability}} {{is thought}} to strongly influence the fracture initiation and fracture propagation properties of the snowpack, thereby largely controlling the avalanche formation process. To investigate variations in stability on the slope scale, stuffblock and rammrutsch stability tests were carried out in an array on eight small avalanche slopes above timberline near Davos, Switzerland over the winter 2001 - 02. On each slope 17 to 26 stability tests were done. The analysis focuses on failures in two persistent weak layers that were found on all eight slopes. The median {{and the spread of}} the stability values are calculated. Slopes with low average stability and low variation in stability are more critical than if either average stability or variation in stability is high. Slope scale trends in stability were found on some slopes. Depth of the failure layer partly explained variations in stability. The <b>quartile</b> coefficient of <b>variation</b> was of the order 50 % for the drop heights and 20 % if the slope scale linear trend was removed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to study {{regional}} lung function by standard computed tomography (CT) and characterise regional variations of density and specific gas volume (SVg) between different lung volumes. We studied 10 healthy and 10 severely emphysematous subjects. Corresponding CT images taken at high and low lung volumes were registered by optical flow to obtain two-dimensional maps of pixel-by-pixel differences of density (ΔHU) and SVg (ΔSVg) at slice levels near the aortic arch, carina and top diaphragm. In healthy subjects, ΔHU was higher at all levels (p< 0. 001) with higher variability expressed as interquartile range (p< 0. 001), largely due to its differences between dorsal and ventral regions. In patients, median ΔSVg values were 3. 2 times lower than healthy volunteers (p< 0. 001), while heterogeneity of ΔSVg maps, expressed as <b>quartile</b> coefficient of <b>variation,</b> was 5. 4 times higher (p< 0. 001). In all patients, there were areas with negative values of ΔSVg. In conclusion, ΔSVg is uniform in healthy lungs and minimally influenced by gravity. The significant ΔSVg heterogeneity observed in emphysema allows identification of areas of alveolar destruction and gas trapping and suggests that ΔSVg maps provide useful information for evaluation and planning of emerging treatments that target trapped gas for removal...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM: Amplitude {{analysis}} of electromyography (EMG) {{has been used}} to evaluate swimming technique but the variability of EMG recordings is a complex phenomenon rarely examined in this sport. The purposes of this study were to investigate inter-individual variability in muscle activation patterns during front crawl swimming and to explore if there were clusters of sub patterns present. METHODS: Bilateral muscle activity of rectus abdominis (RA) and deltoideus medialis (DM) was recorded using wireless surface EMG in 15 adult male competitive swimmers during three trials of 12. 5 m front crawl at maximal speed without breathing. The median EMG trial of six upper limb cycles was used for the interindividual variability assessment, quantified with the coefficient of variation, coefficient of <b>quartile</b> <b>variation,</b> variance ratio and mean deviation. Key features, i. e., sections of the EMG curve selected based on their potential to differentiate between muscle patterns and therefore to potentially classify the EMG patterns in clusters of swimmers, were selected based on qualitative and quantitative classification strategies to enter in a k-means cluster analysis. RESULTS: Inter-individual EMG variability in swimming was higher compared to what has been described for other cyclic movements, but when clustering swimmers, variability dropped in all measures with increased levels (clusters) with the exception of variance ratio for left DM (Table 1). Overall variability and variability in the clusters in RA was higher than in DM. In RA, clusters were differentiated by activity in the recovery phase and around the transition of pull to push phase. In DM, distinction was made by activity in the entry phase and during the exit and early in the recovery phase. CONCLUSIONS: Interindividual variability in a group of highly skilled swimmers was higher compared to other cyclic movements, which is in contrast with what has been reported in the previous 50 years of EMG research in swimming. In front crawl swimming there is not one general activation pattern for DM and RA, but several sub-patterns are present which are statistically different from each other during specific parts of the stroke cycle, mainly due to differences in amplitude. This leads to the conclusion that coaches should be very careful in using overall reference EMG information to enhance the technique of their swimmers. The present findings suggest that individual characteristics could be of more importance in determining the optimal muscle use pattern with the perspective of increasing performance on one hand or decreasing the risk of injuries on the other hand. The detection of these crucial individual characteristics could be a subject of future studies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Coronary {{artery disease}} is a common health problem. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prognosis impact on mortality of the variation of hemoglobin (Hb) levels during hospitalization time. Methods: The retrospective observational study included 2640 patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome in a single coronary care unit from May 2004 until June 2013. The primary endpoint was all cause of death at 1  year of follow up time, and secondary endpoint was all cause of death at 2  years of the follow up time. Results: Four groups were created according to the <b>quartiles</b> of Hb <b>variation</b> (admission Hb minus lowest Hb value) during the hospitalization time: group 1 : ≥ 2. 1  g/dL with 627 patients; group 2 : > 1. 1 and 0. 3 and ≤ 1. 1  g/dL with 686 patients and group 4 : ≤ 0. 3  g/dL with 661 patients. A total of 84 patients (3. 2 %) died during the first year of the follow up. More patients died in group 1 and 4 (6. 4 % vs 3. 7 % vs 3. 7 % vs 6. 8 %, Log-Rank =  0. 023). At 2  years of follow-up, the results were similar, with higher mortality in group 4 (7. 3 % vs 4. 3 % vs 4. 6 % vs 9. 2 %, Log-Rank =  0. 003). Multivariate analysis showed that Hb variation > 1. 1 was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ration =  0309 95 % confidence interval, 0. 136 – 0. 702; P =  0. 005). Conclusion: The patients with the lower baseline hemoglobin and the variability of Hb highest than 1. 1  mg/dL had the worse prognosis with high mortality rate during the follow up time...|$|R
