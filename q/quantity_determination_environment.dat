Because the possibilities of conditioning and distribution are limited, security of supply must take absolute priority. In this paper, measuring systems are described which are able to determine heat quantities accurately with the help of certain processing routines. These systems will assume ever-greater importance on account of today's energy prices. Besides the measuring systems, possibilities of measurement recording and processing are described. The following procedures are discussed: - Determination of characteristic gas quality data. - Measurement of gas volume taking gas quality into account (density-correction). - Comparison of measurement results with respect to forecasted an actual gas quality. - <b>Determination</b> of heat <b>quantities</b> by linking volume and calorific value on various time bases (monthly, daily, hourly). - Heat <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> dependent on gas throughput. - Continuous heat <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> through the use of energy computers. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{provides}} a framework to approach price and <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> in the roundwood market from a slightly new perspective. In {{the spirit of the}} trade union literature, a model of timber price determination is formulated according to which the forest owners' association determines timber prices and then forest firms unilaterally decide upon the timber to be used. The novelty here is to incorporate investment decisions of firms as a strategic factor into the model. The structure of the model is the following. The game is played in two stages. First, the forest owners' association and the firms in the forest industry decide on timber prices and capital stock, respectively. In the second stage, the firms determine timber demand conditional on the timber price-capital stock game, so that the equilibrium concept is the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. This game-theoretic model is applied to the annual data from the Finnish paper and pulp industry over the period 1960 - 1992. Estimation and testing results concerning the price and <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> of timber as well as capital stock determination are generally favorable for the hypotheses presented. In particular, diagnostics and various test procedures indicate that these equations outperform conventional specifications derived from the theory of the demand for factors of production. timber prices, forest sector, Nash equilibrium...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{the concept}} of {{concurrent}} engineering has been widely applied in the manufacturing industry, there is growing awareness and interest in the adoption of Concurrent Engineering (CE) in the Construction Industry because CE {{has the potential to}} make construction projects less fragmented, reduce project duration, improve project quality, reduce total project cost and increase project competitiveness. The integration of a variety of complicated and even some trivial construction processes is the key issue to improve the efficiency in the construction industry. The concurrent engineering {{plays a key role in}} the integration of the construction process. The construction of the traditional fire extinguishing piping system is generally fabricated and installed in the job site. This has the tendency to waste a lot of piping materials and in turn increases construction cost, time and labor and will cut down construction quality.

Then, for their practical applications, a seven determination management model (type <b>determination,</b> size <b>determination,</b> <b>quantity</b> <b>determination,</b> time determination, location determination, route determination, personnel and equipment determination) is proposed to consider these factors.

This research proposes a mixed-integer bi-level programming model and employs the iterative-optimization method. In the bi-level programming, the upper model is the logistics network design (LND) problem, which is designed for suppliers and consists of the hub locations, wholesale price of the products as well as the transportation flow of the commodity. The lower model is the order <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> (OQD) problem for retailers. It processes a special case of inventory problem in which the customer demand is stochastic and follows a series of assumed probability distributions. By applying the proposed methodology in a computational experiment, this research shows that if there were a large number of suppliers in the logistics system, retailers could order the product with relatively low price and the largest profit belongs to the retailer who could sell the commodity at the highest price.

Results: Mathematical competences are determined by the ability to process mathematical symbols and <b>quantity</b> <b>determination</b> which is partially inborn. We can stimulate mathematical abilities by preschool stimulation, which leads to a less difficult behavioural pattern. Better mathematical competences correlate with positive socio-emotional control and positive attitudes towards learning and school which contribute to a more engaged academic life-style. Higher mathematical achievements correlate with better paid positions and also increased gross domestic product (GDP) on the national level. The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth showed that their adult careers, accomplishments, and psychological well-being far exceeded base-rate expectations. On the other hand, children who are born preterm or near term experience mathematical learning difficulties which, despite the absence of overt health problems, present an obstacle into leading an otherwise fulfilling life. Conclusions: We can conclude from the findings, that mathematical precocity early in life predicts later creative contributions and leadership in critical occupational roles. Mathematical abilities are partially inborn. However, mathematical literacy can be further nurtured in preschool and school programmes. Since it is connected to a higher prosperity on individual as well as on national level, mathematical intervention should be offered especially to those who are underprivileged.
