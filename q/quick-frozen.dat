25|$|Frozen food is food {{preserved}} {{by the process}} of freezing. Freezing food is a common method of food preservation which slows both food decay and, by turning water to ice, makes it unavailable for most bacterial growth and slows down most chemical reactions.

Birdseye got the idea during fur-trapping expeditions to Labrador in 1912 and 1916, where he saw the natives use freezing to preserve foods.|$|E

The micro crystals obtained from such solutions were proven to be a new, so far unidentified solid phase. Mossbauer spectra of the <b>quick-frozen</b> solution and that of the complex salt indicated a highly symmetrical ferric environment in both systems From the EXAFS and XANES spectra, the environment of the ferric ion in these solutions (both native and <b>quick-frozen)</b> and in the complex salt was found to be different. In the complex salt, the bond lengths are consistent with an octahedral coordination around the ferric centres. In solution, the coordination geometry of Fe(III) is most probably tetrahedral.

Poultry processors have incorporated different strategies to reduce processing time and improve quality of breast fillets. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of deboning time and marination on meat quality of broiler breast fillets produced in Argentina. Three hundred sixty commercial 48 d old male broilers were aged for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 24 h before deboning. After deboning pH and color were determined. The right fillet of each breast was immediately <b>quick-frozen</b> and the left fillet was marinated by injection and then <b>quick-frozen.</b> All breast fillets were stored when frozen for 60 d and then thawed for pH, color, Warner-Bratzler shear force and thawing loss determinations. pH measured at deboning decreased during the first 4 h of aging in not marinated fillets. Measures taken after frozen storage showed no changes in pH with aging time. Lightness measured at deboning increased with aging time. Shear values in both marinated and not marinated fillets decreased as from 6 h of aging. Furthermore, marinated treatment reduced shear values in all aging time...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The light-activated GTP-binding protein (GBP) in toad rod outer {{segments}} {{has been}} {{located on the}} cytoplasmic surface (CS) of rod disk membranes by correlating biochemical results with images of <b>quick-frozen,</b> freeze-fractured, and deep-etched rod outer segments. This has been accomplished by selectively removing and replacing the 8 - 12 -nm particles that are found on the CS of disk membranes, exactly in parallel with the GBP. In contrast, the large particles are not correlated with another major disk enzyme, the light-activated cGMP phosphodiesterase. We {{have been unable to}} visualize this protein. The surface density of large particles, one particle per eleven rhodopsins in isolated rod outer segments and one particle per nine rhodopsins in intact retina, correlates well with previous biochemical estimates of GBP numbers based on enzyme activity. After the identification of the large particles, we tested the effects of light on the density of particles on the surface of disk membranes in intact retinas. Retinas <b>quick-frozen</b> at various intervals after a bright flash of light show a modest increase (~ 30 %) in particle density by 10 s after the flash but no increase before 1 s. The number of particles on the disk membrane returns to dark levels between 1 and 10 min after the flash. The 1 -s latency in the change of particle binding would appear to rule out this process as...|$|E
40|$|Exocytosis of {{cortical}} granules {{was observed}} in sea urchin eggs, either <b>quick-frozen</b> or chemically fixed after exposure to sperm. Fertilization produced a wave of exocytosis that began within 20 s and swept across the egg surface in the following 30 s. The front of this wave was marked by fusion of single granules at well-separated sites. Toward {{the rear of the}} wave, granule fusion became so abundant that the egg surface left with confluent patches of granule membrane. The resulting redundancy of the egg surface was accommodated by elaboration of characteristic branching microvilli, and by an intense burst of coated vesicle formation at approximately 2 min after insemination. Freeze- fracture replicas of eggs fixed with glutaraldehyde and soaked in glycerol before freezing displayed forms of granule membrane interaction with the plasma membrane which looked like what other investigators have considered to be intermediates in exocytosis. These were small disks of membrane contact or membrane fusion, which often occurred in multiple sites on one granule and also between adjacent granules. However, such membrane interactions were never found in eggs that were <b>quick-frozen</b> fixation, or in eggs fixed and frozen without exposure to glycerol. Glycerination of fixed material appeared to be the important variable; more concentrated glycerol produced a greater abundance of such "intermediates. " Thus, these structures may be artifacts produced by dehydrating chemically fixed membranes, and may not be directly relevant to the mechanism by which membranes naturally fuse...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{modified}} cornstarch concentration, {{freezing rate}} and thawing mode on quality properties of mashed potatoes were examined. The product was tested by oscillatory rheometry, instrumental texture profile analysis (ITPA) and cone penetration, colour, dry matter (DM) and sensory analyses. Oscillatory parameters showed that increasing starch concentration {{resulted in a}} softer product in which gel strength decreased {{in direct proportion to}} concentration in <b>quick-frozen</b> and microwave-thawed product. Quick freezing made for firmer mashed potatoes, whereas oscillatory, ITPA and penetration parameters were lower in the samples thawed at 4 °C Starch concentration and instrumental consistency and firmness were directly proportional to one another. Adding starch at the highest concentration, quick freezing and slow thawing produced a lighter-coloured mashed potato, although the loss of colour in the processed product was not detected by panellists in the microwave-thawed samples. DM was higher in the <b>quick-frozen</b> samples and lower in air-thawed samples. The factors studied affected different sensory texture parameters but had hardly any effect on attributes perceived during final and residual phases of mastication. Only starch concentration had a significant effect on sensory acceptability, but interactions between factors showed that starch addition followed by quick freezing was judged undesirable by the panellists due to excessive softening. Oscillatory parameters correlated well with sensory texture attributes and proved quite precise. They would therefore appear to be the best test to monitor properties of frozen mashed potatoes. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

In <b>quick-frozen,</b> deep-etched preparations, the endothelial fenestrae appeared to be bridged by a diaphragm composed of radial fibers interweaving in a central mesh, as previously observed in vivo.
