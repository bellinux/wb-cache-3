Three half-tracks were seen parked together near infantry, who began <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> confusion and then about thirty more tanks also parked together were seen, then a battery of 88mm guns and more half-tracks.

After Santa Clara defeated Utah, 34–14, the Stanford game began at 3:30p.m. It started off sloppily, and the Indians failed to advance the ball in their first two possessions. In their third series, however, Albert connected with an uncovered receiver, Hugh Gallarneau, for a 17-yard pass. Fullback Norm Standlee then rushed for 20yards. Halfback Pete Kmetovic ran untouched up the middle for the game's first touchdown. Stanford went on to win, 27–0, and outgained San Francisco by a margin of 247yards to eight. After the game, San Francisco head coach George Malley said, [...] "We were baffled, naturally, by all that <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> the backfield."

500|$|The Postman Always Rings Twice {{became a}} major box office success, which {{prompted}} the studio to take more risks on Turner, casting her outside of the glamorous sex symbol roles {{she had come to}} be known for. In August 1946, it was announced Turner was set to replace Katharine Hepburn in the big-budgeted historical drama Green Dolphin Street (1947), a role for which she darkened her hair and lost 15 pounds. It was Carey Wilson who insisted on casting Turner based on her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice. Turner later recalled she was surprised about replacing Hepburn, saying: [...] "I'm about the most un-Hepburnish actress on the lot. But it was just what I wanted to do." [...] It was her first starring role that did not center on her looks. In an interview, Turner said: [...] "I even go <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> the jungles of New Zealand in a dress that's filthy and ragged. I don't wear any make-up and my hair's a mess." [...] Nevertheless, she insisted she would not give up her glamorous image.|$|E
500|$|Anna's costumes in {{the film}} were {{informed}} {{by the research of}} Norwegian clothing styles. Based on these findings, art director Brittney Lee and her team later found out what materials should be used for the costumes. Co-director Jennifer Lee created a cheerful wardrobe featuring [...] "playful" [...] floral patterns and saturated colors in order to accurately reflect Anna's personality. The animators also took into account the climate that Anna is living in, costuming her in heavy wools and velvets, reflecting traditional winter clothing of the Scandinavian area. The animators added structures to the costumes in a way, such as pleated dresses, that allows movements, giving the character a free range of [...] "twirl all she wants" [...] throughout the film. In order to deepen the cultural context of the film, rosemaling, a traditional form of Norwegian decorative folk art, was added to almost every character's costumes. Anna and her sister, Elsa, also enjoyed a large number of types of costumes and the layers of costuming that have never been done before. As these characters are <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> the snow, they have to have petticoats, undergarments, capes, [...] "and they have all these layers and layers of things that are all meticulously designed," [...] Brittney explained.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2011, and {{concluded}} {{in the late}} summer (from the Northern Hemisphere's perspective). Filming largely took place in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town, but also in Durban and Springbok, Northern Cape. Outside South Africa the series was also filmed in Budapest, Hungary, and the UK. Among the separate locations the series takes place in, the New Delhi hotel in the first two episodes were shot in Cape Town, and the suburbs of Hout Bay doubled as Mozambique. Throughout the shoot the actors were allowed to perform the majority of their own stunts. Military advisors were on hand to teach the actors how to perform certain stunts, and to tell them what they did wrong during the take. The series includes a number of sex scenes, many of which were performed by Stapleton. In an interview with the British newspaper Metro, the actor stated [...] "I've done my fair share of nude scenes in the past {{but not as much as}} this – not as risqué, anyway," [...] adding that while he got used to it, he was always [...] "a bit nervous <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> front of 50 people with no clothes on. The sex scenes were usually with an actress I'd just met, so it's like: 'How's it going? I'm Sullivan and this is me nude.' It's nerve-racking at first but you have as much fun as you can with it." ...|$|E

500|$|Samus' reveal in the {{original}} Metroid, which UGO.com called {{the original}} [...] "jaw-dropping moment" [...] in gaming, was named as the greatest twist in video games by Game Informer in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo's history by GameDaily in 2008. The Irish Times found it refreshing {{to learn that the}} series' protagonist, who is [...] "well disguised under the suit of heavy armour", is female, but Rupert Goodwins of The Independent wrote that the [...] "Transformer-like suit she wears could just as easily contain a large centipede; it's hardly a breakthrough for feminism." [...] According to the 2007 book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century: Literate Connections, Samus was perhaps the most nonsexualized female video game character ever, a belief shared by Steve Rabin in Introduction to Game Development, which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo's most popular video game mascots. In 2002, Justin Hoeger of The Sacramento Bee opined that [...] "unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal. Samus is tough, silent, heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high-tech Power Armor." [...] That same year, however, an article in the Toronto Star retorted that the [...] "sexual politics" [...] surrounding Samus and the Metroid series needed to stop, arguing that the original [...] "big crazy shock to the gaming public" [...] was [...] "some seriously misspent energy" [...] as she [...] "is not a woman {{for the benefit of the}} sweaty/excited crowd, and neither is she a standard-bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights. She is a supremely talented action figure, and in the closeups on her helmet you can kind of see that she wears mascara, but that is all." [...] UGO.com included Samus' one-piece bathing swimsuit on the list of the best alternate costumes and IGN chose [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] by Aerosmith as Samus' theme song because she [...] "spends her time <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> a manly battle suit blasting first and taking names later." [...] Featuring her in their 2004 list of [...] "top ten forces of good" [...] (one section on their list of top 50 [...] "retro" [...] game characters), Retro Gamer opined she has remained [...] "a distinct female character, not relying on cheap thrills to capture the attention of gamers, which is more than can be said for some." ...|$|E

2500|$|ChuChu Rocket! is {{an action}} puzzle video game. The basic {{rules of the}} game require the player to guide mice, dubbed [...] "ChuChus", into a rocket while evading them from {{dangerous}} cats, dubbed [...] "KapuKapus". A brief premise is provided in the instruction manual, explaining that ChuChus are living on a space port that is invaded by KapuKapus one day. In their frantic state, the ChuChus begin <b>running</b> <b>around</b> <b>in</b> chaos, and so the player must guide them to their rockets to save them. Both ChuChus and KapuKapus run in a straight line, and turn right when they hit walls. A player can place up, down, left, and right arrows on the field of play, redirecting characters if they walk on it. Up to three arrows can be placed by a player at any time; placing a fourth arrow will make the player's oldest arrow vanish, and all arrows fade away over time. If a KapuKapu hits an arrow twice, the arrow disappears.|$|E
