40|$|International audienceIsland {{barriers}} are common features along the world coastlines. They have {{a crucial role}} in protecting inland and rich lagoonal ecosystems. Erosion and sand transfers on these island barriers during extreme events such as tropical storms or typhoons remain poorly investigated. This work focuses on a multi-scales nalysis (season to decade) of the morphodynamics of Wan-Tzu-Liao sand barrier subjected to extreme waves and sea surges. We combine topographic measurements of the emerged beach at seasonal scale between 2011 to 2012 and long-term (1993 - 2009) shoreline changes using aerial photographs and satellite images. At the seasonal scale, during Monsoon, the sand was taken from the beach-front and transported seaward outside the study area. During typhoons season, 12 typhoons drove a beach recovery process resulting in a seaward shoreline shift. This annual behavior is discussed in term <b>of</b> <b>roll-over</b> process <b>of</b> the barrier. At the decadal scale, the shoreline changes evidence cross-shore processes in the north part of the barrier and longshore processes in the south.

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} metabolic energy cost and external mechanical work for step-to-step transitions after tibiotalar arthrodesis, {{and the effect}} of MBT rocker bottom shoes. Methods: Oxygen uptake, forceplate and kinematic data were recorded in 18 controls and 15 patients while walking at a fixed speed of 1. 25 m/s in three walking conditions: barefoot, normal walking shoes and MBT rocker bottom shoes. Metabolic energy cost, external mechanical work, and the <b>roll-over</b> shape <b>of</b> the ankle-foot complex were analyzed. Findings: Tibiotalar arthrodesis leads to higher metabolic energy cost during walking. During step-to-step transitions positive work during push-off with the impaired ankle was decreased but negative work during collision was not affected. The <b>roll-over</b> shape <b>of</b> the ankle-foot complex did not differ between groups and shoe conditions. However, both in patients and controls rocker bottom shoes did lead to decreased positive work at push-off and increased negative work at collision and consequently higher metabolic energy cost of walking. Interpretation: External mechanical work for step-to-step transitions is not different between patients and controls and could not account for the higher metabolic energy cost in patients. Apparently, patients adopt a different walking strategy that limits step-to-step transition cost but nevertheless induces a higher metabolic energy cost. Despite restricted ankle movement, patients retain a normal <b>roll-over</b> shape <b>of</b> the ankle-foot complex. MBT shoes do not affect roll-over shape and appear to have a counterproductive effect on step-to-step transition cost and walking economy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|R

The Warburg slope (W) was found to steadily increase as a function of cell aging for completely discharged cells.

40|$|Abstract: Structure {{and climate}} have each been {{proposed}} {{as the primary}} control on sedimentation in continental rifts. Numerous Phanerozoic rifts spanning {{a wide range of}} inferred palaeoclimates have consistent relationships between structure and sedimentation, and between structural evolution and stratigraphic sequences. Six principal structural features strongly influence sedimentation patterns in rifts. (1) Topographically high accommodation zones segment rifts into 50 - 150 km long structural half-graben, each one a discrete depocentre. (2) Reactivation of pre-existing structural elements commonly controls the location and orientation of accommodation zones. Drainage systems outside the rift then may be captured and diverted towards the rift axis, establishing some accommodation zones as input points for sediment. (3) Footwall uplift at main border faults directs most drainage away from young rifts. Along the rift flanks, uplift is minimized at accommodation zones, enhancing their role as sediment input points. (4) Gentle <b>roll-over</b> <b>of</b> topography on flexural margins produces drainage systems that are generally small, and that do not introduce large amounts of sediment into the rift.
