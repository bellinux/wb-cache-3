40|$|Numerous {{open loop}} ground energy systems are under {{construction}} {{or have been}} constructed in central London. The majority of these systems use the Chalk aquifer as a water source. A {{significant proportion of the}} abstracted water must be returned to the aquifer to maintain groundwater levels. If the ground system is to function correctly, the temperature of the abstracted groundwater must not be altered significantly by early thermal breakthrough of the <b>returned</b> <b>water.</b> Groundwater flow within the Chalk is predominantly through fractures and these provide the primary route by which thermal breakthrough might take place. The nature of the fracturing {{and its impact on the}} thermal transport beneath a proposed site must be understood to provide confidence that the ground energy system will function correctly. Two tracer and thermal test methods to determine fracture properties are examined. The results suggest that the flow in the Chalk is carried by a small number of fractures and that careful modelling and interpretation can provide valuable constraints on the frequency of fractures, their spatial pattern and their hydraulic aperture. The results highlight difficulties for designing within borehole temperature monitoring systems for fractured aquifer thermal experiments...|$|E
40|$|As a {{comfortable}} and energy-efficient air conditioning system, {{the application of}} floor radiant heating system is used increasingly greatly {{in the north of}} China. As a result, the feasibility of floor radiant cooling has gained more attention. To examine the thermodynamic performance of the floor radiant cooling system, we measured the operational conditions including the minimum floor surface temperature, the cooling capacity, and the indoor temperature field distribution under different outdoor temperatures in Beijing. Because the ground temperature changes with the mean temperature of the supplied and <b>returned</b> <b>water</b> and room temperature, the mean temperature of the supplied and retuned water was obtained. Finally, we analyzed the phenomenon of dewing and developed measures for preventing it. The dry air layer near the floor formed by a displacement ventilation system can effectively prevent dews {{on the surface of the}} floor in the wet and hot days in summer. In addition, for the sake of the displacement ventilation system, the heat transfer effect between floor and space is enhanced. Our analysis pointed out that floor radiant cooling system combined with displacement ventilation ensures good comfort and energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Wireless sensors {{have the}} {{potential}} to provide significant insight into in situ physical and biogeochemical processes in sub-ice hydrologic systems. However, the nature of the glacial environment means that sensor deployment and data return is challenging. We describe two bespoke sensor platforms, electronic tracers or ‘ETracers’, and ‘cryoegg’, for untethered, wireless data collection from glacial hydrologic systems, including subglacial channels. Both employ radio frequencies for data transmission, are designed to endure harsh environmental conditions and can withstand low temperatures, high pressure, turbulence and abrasion. We discuss the design, optimization and field testing of the ETracers and cryoegg, culminating in test deployments beneath the Greenland ice sheet. The small, low-cost ETracers were able to travel through subglacial drainage channels, from where they <b>returned</b> <b>water</b> pressure measurements through 100 m of ice, and could measure water depth in crevasses. The larger cryoegg was able to return multi-parameter data from moulins through 500 m of wet ice to receivers up to 2 km away, and from 12 m depth in a proglacial lake to a receiver on the shore. The tests demonstrate that the cryoegg and ETracers are low-power, versatile, robust wireless sensor platforms suitable for glacial environments, which may be used with portable, low-cost receiving equipment...|$|E

Based on the predicted air temperatures and observed indoor temperature from Haiyuan community,a simulation experiment is executed. The experiments show that the root mean square error between simulated indoor temperature and required temperature (20 ºC) is 0. 26 ºC, root mean square error between predicted and observed supply water temperature is 3. 76 ºC. When the heat transfer coefficient is decreased by 10 %, the predicted supply <b>water</b> temperature and <b>return</b> <b>water</b> temperature is decreased 3. 8 % and 3. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} {{ground source heat pump}} system has been developed and validated using experimental data from a full system installation. This system includes a heat pumpwith a fixed speed compressor, variable speed internal and external circulation pumps and provides space heating or cooling using fan coil units. In this study,the performance of the system,subject tovaried boundary conditions,is evaluatedusingdifferent SPF (systemperformance factor) definitions. The results show that the auxiliary components can consume {{a large proportion of the}} total system energy consumption. Depending on the definition of SPF, different system performances were observed. The internal circulation pump and fan coil units, which remain in constant operation, act to degrade the SPF, particularlyas the building load factor is reduced. This degradation is present in both heating and cooling. In heating mode, the SPF increases for decreasing <b>return</b> <b>water</b> set-point temperature, which is primarily attributed to an improved heat pump COP. However, fordecreasing <b>return</b> <b>water</b> set-point temperature, the fan coil unit heating capacityis reduced, which suggests an optimal <b>return</b> <b>water</b> temperature for maximising SPF, while matching the required building demand is possible. For cooling mode, a higher <b>return</b> <b>water</b> set-point temperature increases the SPF, but again the heat transfer across the fan coils is reduced, leading to a similar conclusion...|$|R

40|$|International Space Station (ISS) Expeditions 26 - 30 spanned a 16 -month period {{beginning}} in November of 2010 wherein the final 3 flights of the Space Shuttle program finished ISS construction and delivered supplies {{to support the}} post-shuttle era of station operations. Expedition crews relied on several sources of potable water during this period, including water recovered from urine distillate and humidity condensate by the U.

40|$|Abstract. In 2007, a 2. 8 -ha {{multi-function}} constructed wetland {{was successfully}} built in Pingtung County, Taiwan {{to improve the}} water quality of local stream and ecosystem of the surrounding environment. The mean inflow rate was approximately 1, 350 m 3 /day. The major influents of the wetland come from the local drainage ditches and streams mainly containing <b>returned</b> <b>water</b> from upstream farmlands and secondary wastewater from hog farms located in the upper catchment of the wetland. Thus, the influents contain moderate to high concentrations of organics and nutrients. The mean measured hydraulic loading rate, hydraulic retention time, water depth, and total volume of wetland system were 0. 1 m/day, 5. 5 days, 0. 7 m, and 7, 800 m 3, respectively. In this study, water, sediment, and plant samples were collected and analyzed quarterly for each wetland basin during the two-year investigation period. Results show that more than 77 % of total coliforms (TC), 78 % of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), 88 % of total nitrogen (TN), and 96 % of ammonia nitrogen were removed via the constructed wetland system. Thus, the wetland system has {{a significant effect on}} water quality improvement and is able to remove most of the pollutants from the local stream through natural attenuation mechanisms. Except for stream water quality improvement and rehabilitating the natural ecosystem, this wetland also offers more water assessable eco-ponds and eco-gardens for public.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analysis conducted upon the sensor data {{gathered from the}} distribution control system of a central heating and cooling plant in Ottawa, Canada. After observing that the performance of four boilers and five chillers of this plant vary substantially in time under steady-state conditions, data-driven models were developed to explain this variability from the archived sensor data. By employing a forward stepwise regression and a repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation approach, two-layer feed-forward artificial neural network models with seven to fifteen hidden-nodes were selected for each boiler and chiller. The selected boiler models could explain 84 to 95 % of the variability in a boiler's efficiency, and the selected chiller models could explain 65 to 94 % of the variability in a chiller's coefficient of performance. Among studied nine variables, the most informative ones to predict a boiler's efficiency were identified as follows: flue gas O 2 concentration, pressure, part-load ratio, forced draft fan state, and <b>return</b> <b>water</b> flow rate. Unlike boilers, all four studied variables were found useful in predicting a chiller's coefficient of performance.
