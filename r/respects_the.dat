In these <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E
5|$|Public {{perception}} of the anthem is mixed among Russians.

A 2009 poll showed that 56% of respondents felt proud when hearing the anthem, and that 25% liked it.|$|E

5|$|C. lepophagus was {{a similar}} in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that {{indicates}} a less cursorial lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of Canis than the gray wolf, {{as shown by}} its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's sagittal crest, which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, {{as shown by the}} larger chewing surfaces on the molars, reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus more so than the wolf.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Pflueger renovated the Nasser brother's New Mission Theater, {{bringing}} Art Deco stylings to {{the lobby}} {{in contrast to the}} Spanish Mission trimmings in the main auditorium. In 1993, the theater closed. The theater, now designated San Francisco Landmark No. 245, was purchased by Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas and completely renovated to its original splendor, opening its doors once again to patrons in December 2015. Pflueger simultaneously worked on the remodeling of the Nasser's New Fillmore Theater, a sister design similar in many <b>respects.</b> <b>The</b> New Fillmore closed in 1957 and was demolished to make way for an urban redevelopment project.|$|E
5|$|In many <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> YF-22s were {{different}} from production F-22s. Contrary to the F-117 Nighthawk, which was initially difficult to control because of small vertical stabilizers, Lockheed over-specified the fin area on its YF-22. Therefore, the company reduced the size of those on F-22s by 20–30 percent. Lockheed recontoured {{the shape of the}} wing and stabilator trailing edges to improve aerodynamics, strength, and stealth characteristics; the wing and stabilitor sweep was reduced by 6° from 48°. Finally, to improve pilot visibility, the canopy was moved forward 7inches (178mm), and the engine intakes were moved rearward 14inches (356mm).|$|E

5|$|In many <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> {{neurological}} {{phase of}} infection {{is thought to}} be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is that the virus is imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users to tap into the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E

Dunderdale also said that the police had asked her not to comment on the issue and therefore she would stay mum about what led to the need for security.|$|E

5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E

5|$|In January 2012 Sihanouk {{issued a}} letter to express his wish to be cremated after his death, and for his ashes to be interred in a golden urn.

On 15October 2012 Sihanouk {{died of a heart attack}} at 1:20am, Phnom Penh time. When the news broke, Sihamoni, Hun Sen, and other {{government}} officials flew to Beijing to pay their last <b>respects.</b> <b>The</b> Cambodian government announced an official mourning period of seven days between 17October and 24October 2012, and state flags were ordered to fly at one-third height.

5|$|In many <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the empty weight of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.|$|E

5|$|In many <b>respects,</b> <b>the</b> {{history of}} the Polish Underground State mirrors that of the Polish non-communist {{resistance}} in general. The Underground State traces its origins to the Service for Poland's Victory (Służba Zwycięstwu Polski, SZP) organization, which was founded on 27 September 1939, one day before the surrender of the Polish capital of Warsaw, {{at a time when}} the Polish defeat in the German invasion of Poland (accompanied by the Soviet one) appeared inevitable. SZP founder General Michał Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski received orders from Polish Commander-in-Chief Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły to organize and carry out the struggle in occupied Poland. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski decided that the organization he was creating needed to move beyond a strictly military format; and in line with the traditions of the underground 19th-century Polish National Government and World War I-era Polish Military Organization, it would need to encompass various aspects of civilian life. Hence, the SZP, in contact with (and subordinate to) the Polish Government in Exile, envisioned itself not only as an armed resistance organization, but also as a vehicle through which the Polish state continued to administer its occupied territories.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong {{government}} generally <b>respects</b> <b>the</b> {{human rights}} of its citizens, {{and members of the}} Legislative Council of Hong Kong and the District Council of Hong Kong are elected into office by Hong Kong citizens. However, there are 27 ex officio members of the district council (the Rural Committee Chairmen in the New Territories) as of the fifth District Council Assembly, and roughly half of the legislative council seats are elected by 3% of the people in Hong Kong through the functional constituency. The imbalance of voting power in the LegCo has led to widespread criticism of its inability to represent Hongkongers' socio-economic needs. In addition, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong is elected by 1,200 members based on their contributions to four different sectors of Hong Kong's society. This policy has received criticism from various political figures in Hong Kong, and led to the Umbrella Revolution. Plans to expand the voting population had begun to appear in the 2000s, and political figures liaised with the government to provide universal suffrage.|$|E
