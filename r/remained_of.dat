5|$|The Great Southern Group {{dismantled}} {{much of what}} <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the company. Frederick W. Paine was {{detached from}} the LNC, along with the specialist division overseeing the exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow property development on formerly consecrated sites. All that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the LNC was Brookwood Cemetery itself, by this time moribund and becoming heavily overgrown. Considered virtually worthless, Great Southern sold the LNC to property speculators Maximillian Investments in July 1973 for £400,000.|$|E
5|$|After Burgoyne's {{surrender}} on October 17, 1777 (part of {{the aftermath}} of the Saratoga Campaign), Ann Bleecker, her daughter and sister (all that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the family), and possibly a slave child returned to Tomhannock. Unfortunately, Caty Swits (1743–77) died during the return journey. Ann Bleecker was devastated by the loss of three generations of women in her family.|$|E
5|$|After the accident, {{souvenir}} hunters {{proved to}} be such a problem that the owners of Berry Brow kept all gates locked. Geoff Inkpen stated that after completion of an Inquiry a bulldozer would be used to dig a ditch at the crash site and what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Amana would be buried.|$|E

5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|All tracks {{except the}} few yards {{embedded}} in the quayside at Watchet were removed by 1920, but other features were removed or altered piecemeal over time. By 1940, for example, no trace <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Washford station, but both sets of level crossing gates remained in place.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the site.|$|E

5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Between 21 and 23 September the Ottoman III Corps (Ottoman Seventh Army) {{fought a}} rearguard action from Tubas to the Jordan River, which delayed the British cavalry encirclement and enable what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman Eighth Army and the Ottoman Seventh Army {{to retreat to}} {{the eastern side of}} the Jordan River.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the 1340s, little <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Ivan Alexander's initial successes. John VI Kantakouzenos' Turkish allies pillaged parts of Bulgarian Thrace in 1346, 1347, 1349, 1352 and 1354, to which were added the ravages of the Black Death. The Bulgarians' {{attempts}} to repel the invaders met with repeated failure, and Ivan Alexander's third son and co-emperor, Ivan Asen IV, was killed in battle against the Turks in 1349, as was his older brother Michael Asen IV in 1355 or a little earlier.|$|E

5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid and {{sustained}} decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E
5|$|During {{the meeting}} in Kolwezi, Tshombe had ordered all {{remaining}} Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Fischer's {{estate was}} {{estimated}} at 140 million ISK (about 1 million GBP, or $2 million USD). It quickly became {{the object of a}} legal battle involving claims from four parties, with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> Fischer's estate after government claims. The four parties were Fischer's apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai, his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young, his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ, and the U.S. government (claiming unpaid taxes).|$|E

5|$|Following Deadstick, the engineers, glider {{pilots and}} 'B' Company men were {{returned}} to their parent formations.

5|$|Friends {{and colleagues}} remembered Crawford as a cantankerous and {{irritable}} individual. His contributions to British archaeology, including in Antiquity and aerial archaeology, {{have been widely}} acclaimed; some have referred to {{him as one of}} the great pioneering figures in the field. His photographic archive <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> use to archaeologists into the 21st century. A biography of Crawford by Kitty Hauser was published in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich {{remained}} the favourite home of Richard Talbot's descendants for many years. During the early years, {{the security situation}} in Wales <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> concern. Owain Glyndŵr rebelled against English rule in 1402 and Welsh forces invaded the Goodrich area in 1404 and 1405. Gilbert Talbot was responsible for fighting back the Welsh advance and securing the castle. As time went on, however, the threat began to diminish. During the 15th century the Talbots considerably expanded {{the size of the}} lord's quarters in the castle and provided additional accommodation for servants and retainers.|$|E

In his annual budget address on October 13, 2010, Daley projected a deficit for 2010 of $655 million, the largest in city history. Daley proposed a 2011 budget totaling $6.15 billion, including spending all but $76 million of what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> the parking meter lease proceeds, and received a standing ovation from aldermen.|$|E
