40|$|Oral reading has {{a varied}} history of {{interpretation}} (12) and IS presently under scrutiny {{in terms of}} characteristics rather than quantity (5). Despite the doubt that controversies generate, the identification and tabulation of oral <b>reading</b> <b>errors</b> dominate decisions generated in practice us,ing informal reading inventories. In practice, informal reading inventories depend on identification, scoring, and interpretation of oral <b>reading</b> <b>errors.</b> Controversies are usually ignored perhaps {{in the hope that}} the expert judgment of reading specialists overcomes the difficulties. Beldin (1) explores the controversial history of informal inventories. From early studies to the present, doubt surrounds scoring criteria (7, 9, 10).

5000|$|Retry (shortcut key R): Attempts the {{operation}} again. [...] "Retry" [...] made sense if the user could rectify the problem. For example, if the user simply forgot {{to close the}} drive latch, they could close it, retry, and the system would continue where it left off. On early hardware, retrying a disk <b>read</b> <b>error</b> would sometimes be successful, but as disk drives improved, this became far less likely, although the message itself appeared less often.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} {{obstacle}} is the incompatible (and technically corrupted) error-correction data. Again, {{the effect of}} this is dependent on the disc drive; some drives will be able to read the data without problems, but others will produce audio files with loud pops every few seconds. As a consequence of having faulty error-correction codes, the discs may be less resilient to anything that might cause a <b>read</b> <b>error,</b> such as dust and scratches resulting from normal use.|$|E

5000|$|Ignore (shortcut key I): Return success {{status to}} the calling program or routine, despite {{the failure of}} the operation. For instance, a disk <b>read</b> <b>error</b> could be ignored and DOS would return {{whatever}} data was in the read buffer, which might contain some of the correct data from the disk. [...] "Ignore" [...] did not appear in cases where it was impossible for the data to be used; for instance, a missing disk could not be ignored.|$|E
5000|$|RAID 0+1: creates two {{stripes and}} mirrors them. If a single drive failure occurs {{then one of}} the stripes has failed, at this point it is running {{effectively}} as RAID 0 with no redundancy. Significantly higher risk is introduced during a rebuild than RAID 1+0 as all the data from all the drives in the remaining stripe has to be read rather than just from one drive, increasing the chance of an unrecoverable <b>read</b> <b>error</b> (URE) and significantly extending the rebuild window.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{benefit of}} MLC flash memory is its lower cost {{per unit of}} storage due to the higher data density, and memory-reading {{software}} can compensate for a larger bit error rate. The higher error rate necessitates an error correcting code (ECC) that can correct multiple bit errors; for example, the SandForce SF-2500 Flash Controller can correct up to 55 bits per 512-byte sector with an unrecoverable <b>read</b> <b>error</b> rate of less than one sector per 1017 bits read. The most commonly used algorithm is Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH code). Other drawbacks of MLC NAND are lower write speeds, lower number of program-erase cycles and higher power consumption compared to SLC flash memory.|$|E
40|$|AbstractNarrative {{and stories}} in {{education}} {{have been the}} focus of increasing attention in recent years. The idea of narrative is fertile ground for adult educators who know intuitively the value of stories in teaching and learning. Narrative is deeply appealing and richly satisfying to the human soul, with an allure that transcends cultures, centuries, ideologies, and academic disciplines. The present study examined the efficacy of narrative therapy and storytelling in reducing <b>reading</b> <b>errors</b> of dyslexic children. Sample of 30 dyslexic 1 st to 3 rd graders were identified as dyslexia using the Dyslexia Checklist (Michaeli, 2006). The sample was administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R, 1974) and Diagnostic Reading Test (Bahari Gharahgoz, 2006) and randomly assigned to an experimental and a control group. During a five month period, the experimental group received twenty five, one hour sessions of individual training with the narrative therapy by counselor and storytelling by children. The control group received none. The two group pre-post tests of <b>reading</b> <b>errors</b> were compared using ANCOVA. The results revealed that, controlling for the intelligence variable, the application of narrative therapy accounted for a 60 % reduction in <b>reading</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A C2 {{error is}} a <b>read</b> <b>error</b> of a compact disc. C2 errors can {{to a degree}} be {{recovered}} by the hardware error detection and correction scheme. A CD drive can have extraction errors when the data on the disc is not readable due to scratches or smudges. The drive can compensate by supplying a [...] "best guess" [...] of what the missing data was, then supplying the missing data. C2 error correction is an analysis over many interleaved frames, an improvement over C1 error correction, which analyzed just one frame, resulting in more accurate data correction. C2 error correction codes are also used by the Digital Audio Tape (DAT) format.|$|E

40|$|The SATA advertised {{bit error}} rate of one error in 10 terabytes is frightening. We moved 2 PB through {{low-cost}} hardware and saw five disk <b>read</b> <b>error</b> events, several controller failures, and many system reboots caused by security patches. We conclude that SATA uncorrectable read errors are not yet a dominant system-fault source - they happen, but are rare compared to other problems. We also conclude that UER (uncorrectable error rate) is not the relevant metric for our needs. When an uncorrectable <b>read</b> <b>error</b> happens, there are typically several damaged storage blocks (and many uncorrectable read errors.) Also, some uncorrectable read errors may be masked by the operating system. The more meaningful metric for data architects is Mean Time To Data Loss (MTTDL. ...|$|E
