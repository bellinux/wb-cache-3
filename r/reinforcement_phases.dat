50|$|In {{mechanical}} terms, nanocomposites {{differ from}} conventional composite materials {{due to the}} exceptionally high {{surface to volume ratio}} of the reinforcing phase and/or its exceptionally high aspect ratio. The reinforcing material can be made up of particles (e.g. minerals), sheets (e.g. exfoliated clay stacks) or fibres (e.g. carbon nanotubes or electrospun fibres). The area of the interface between the matrix and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase(s)</b> is typically an order of magnitude greater than for conventional composite materials. The matrix material properties are significantly affected {{in the vicinity of the}} reinforcement. Ajayan et al. note that with polymer nanocomposites, properties related to local chemistry, degree of thermoset cure, polymer chain mobility, polymer chain conformation, degree of polymer chain ordering or crystallinity can all vary significantly and continuously from the interface with the reinforcement into the bulk of the matrix.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One kind of 3 DNMMC with {{different}} volume fraction <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase</b> was fabricated by pressureless technique. The bending strength and fracture toughness were tested by 3 -P bending strength experiments. When the volume fraction of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase</b> phase {{was not in}} excess of 10 %, composites had an improvement of bending strength and fracture toughness owing to relatively homogeneous Al 2 O 3 particle distribution encircled by metal matrix and the occurrence of interface reaction product as MgAlO 2 spinel phase. Much and smaller craters and dimples are observed in metal matrix alloy and limited ductility of composites causes the early failure of composites. With the increases of volume fraction of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase</b> phase, crack characteristic consist of crack nucleation, growth, coalescence and crack propagation became the main fracture failure mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ti 2 AlC/TiAl {{composites}} {{with the}} addition of niobium were prepared by spark plasma sintering using titanium, aluminum, niobium elemental powers and TiC particles as reactants. The experimental and analytical studies on this kind of material concentrated on the relationship between <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase</b> and mechanical properties. The Ti 2 AlC/TiAl composites with 5 % niobium exhibit high mechanical properties. The three-point bending strength and fracture toughness reaches as high as 915 MPa and 23 MPa·m 1 / 2, respectively. It is found that the in-situ reaction occurs at 1100 °C {{with the addition}} of niobium at the interface between the TiAl matrix and original reinforcement TiC.

40|$|Additions {{of boron}} in {{modified}} titanium alloys and Ti-B composites {{result in the}} in situ formation during high temperature processing of TiB <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phases</b> that improve the mechanical properties and wear resistance of unreinforced titanium alloys, while still utilizing the high strength-to-weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance of titanium. Several boron-modified titanium alloys and Ti-B composites in a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V matrix have been investigated {{to determine the effect}} of processing parameters on the TiB <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phases</b> and resultant microstructures and mechanical properties. Using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, conventional characterization techniques, and newly developed methodologies for three-dimensional visualization, the microstructures of these Ti-B materials have been studied. Observations included a similar anisotropic whisker morphology with roughly hexagonal cross-sections among all TiB phases; alignment of all TiB phases with extrusion, with the extent of alignment affected by thermomechanical processing parameters; brittle fracture behavior of TiB whiskers, with fracture down the length of whiskers not aligned in the tensile direction and across the width of whiskers aligned in the tensile direction; and discoveries of the anisotropic morphologies of the coarse primary TiB phase and the sub-micron precipitated TiB phase. It has been observed that extruded boron-modified alloys with compositions in the hypoeutectic regime of the quaternary system of titanium, alloying elements aluminum and vanadium, and boron, containing a unimodal size distribution of eutectic TiB whiskers, significantly improve the strength and stiffness compared to unreinforced Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy while also demonstrating tensile elongation to failure within the fracture-critical limits required for aerospace structural applications. Materials design methodologies have been developed using Ti-B materials, and they show promise for predicting the effects of processing parameters and the resultant microstructures and mechanical properties for boron-modified titanium alloys and Ti-B composites optimized for a variety of commercial and industrial applications.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this three-year project was to develop and deliver to NASA Lewis one-dimensional and two-dimensional higher-order theories, and related computer codes, for the analysis, optimization and design of cylindrical functionally graded materials/structural components for use in advanced aircraft engines (e. g., combustor linings, rotor disks, heat shields, blisk blades). To satisfy this objective, a quasi one-dimensional version of the higher-order theory, HOTCFGM- 1 D, and four computer codes based on this theory, for the analysis, design and optimization of cylindrical structural components functionally graded in the radial direction were developed. The theory is applicable to thin multi-phased composite shell/cylinders subjected to macroscopically axisymmetric thermomechanical and inertial loading applied uniformly along the axial direction such that the overall deformation {{is characterized by a}} constant average axial strain.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{relevant}} to the research of possibilities {{for the production of}} decorative complex relief metal matrix composites (MMCs) of the “invitro” type, with unformed and unchanging <b>reinforcement</b> (strengthening) <b>phase</b> in the process of creating a composite. The research on the methods of metal matrix composites development in this paper has been brought to the application of different space vacuum schemes for composite synthesisof vacuuming the space for composites synthesis by using the notion of the “capillary forming”. In this method the metal matrix (copper alloy melt) was infiltrated in the space between the pellets of <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase</b> (quartz particles – SiO 2), whereas the classical method adopted for the obtaining MMCs “in vitro”, uses a mechanism of forced insertion of the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase</b> into the ready for use melt, followed by homogenization of the composite structure. In the particular case, because the obtained composite will have a complex relief three-dimensional surface, the conditions for compacting the building phases in the three directions x, y, z should be virtually equalized. In order to accomplish the task set, a laboratory system is developed. The experiments were conducted with laboratory equipment elaborated on the base of another equipment for "capillary forming" with extra vacuum. The structures of the obtained MMCs were tested by metallographic analysis...|$|R

In a combined reversal and multiple baseline design, two pairs of mentally retarded children were sequentially exposed to three <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phases.</b> After baseline rates of attentive behavior were obtained, praise was delivered to the target subject in each subject pair for attentive behavior. After a reversal phase, praise was delivered contingently to target subjects for inattentive behavior. In a final phase, contingent praise for attentive behavior was reinstated for the target subjects. Throughout the study, nontarget subjects received no direct reinforcers. The results indicated a vicarious reinforcement effect. Reinforcing attentive behavior of target subjects increased this behavior in adjacent peers. However, reinforcing inattentive behavior of target subjects also increased the attentive behavior of adjacent peers.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Composite materials consisting {{of two or more}} different phases are very extensively used in modern society. If the composite is designed and fabricated correctly, then desirable properties not available in any single conventional material can be achieved. Ceramic reinforced aluminium alloys are desired for high performance applications due to their superior properties compared with the soft, unreinforced metal. However "traditional" particle or fibre reinforced composites suffer from a limited ability to achieve high reinforcement levels. Interpenetrating composites (IPCs) have 3 - 3 connectivity, with both the matrix and <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phases</b> being fully connected; they are expected to provide truly multifunctional properties. Whilst pressure is normally needed for the processing of IPCs due to the poor wetting between most aluminium alloys and ceramic materials, it raises the risk of ceramic preform damage and limits the component shape. In this research, interpenetrating composites were produced at atmospheric pressure by infiltrating 10 wt...|$|E

Recent results obtained from a Space Shuttle experiment (using transparent materials) will be used to illustrate the fundamental physics that dictates the final distribution of agglomerates in a casting. We have further extended this real time investigation to aluminum alloys using X-ray microscopy. A variety of interface-particle interactions will be discussed and how they alter the final properties of the composite.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that when metal matrix {{composite}} materials (MMCs) are machined by mechanical means considerable damage to the <b>reinforcement</b> <b>phase(s)</b> and the substrate up to 100 mu m below the surface are common. During machining, the surface layer in particular is highly sheared and the reinforcement phase, in particle or fiber form, can be severely fragmented and dislodged from the metal matrix leaving crevices behind. However, the effects of machined surface condition on corrosion behavior have not been reported in the literature. This information is vital for the prediction of the long-term environmental stability of MMCs. In the previous studies of the corrosion properties of MMCs, the specimens used for testing were mostly surface finished by polishing. It is apparent that, in most situations, this would not be a practical condition for MMCs in service. In this study, the effects of machined surface condition on the corrosion behavior of aluminum 2009 /SiC composite material were studied.

The microstructure of composites and their electrical conductivity have been investigated. The results showed a uniform dispersion of large size par-ticulate {{phase in the}} matrix of the primary a-phase with its equiaxed grain morphology. However, clustering of small size particles was observed at the grain boundary and grain junctions. The grain size of the composite materials was observed to be {{lower than that of}} the base Al-alloy. The composite materials invariably indi-cated their lower electrical conductivity compared to that of the monolithic Al-all y. The electrical conductivity of composites decreased with increase in the volume fraction and decrease in size of the reinforcement particles. A high flow rate of particles during spray deposition resulted in a decrease in its conductivity.
