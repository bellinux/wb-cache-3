40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a design of a new raster {{sub-system}} intended for modern GIS systems open for client and server operation, database connection and strong application interface (API). Motivation for such a design comes from {{the current state of}} API working in GRASS 6. If found attractive, the here presented design and its implementation (referred as RG 7) may be integrated to the future new generation of the GRASS Geographical Information System version 7 - 8. The paper describes in details the concept of raster tiling, computer storage of rasters and basic raster access procedures. Finally, the paper gives a simple benchmarking experiment of random read access to <b>raster</b> <b>files</b> imported from the Spearfish dataset. The experiment compares the early implementation of RG 7 with the current implementation of rasters in GRASS 6. As the result, the experiment shows the RG 7 to be significantly faster than GRASS in random read access to large <b>raster</b> <b>files...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{automated}} {{decision support}} system (DSS) framework is proposed to assist Western Australian farmers to improve decision making in crop variety selection for different climatic and agronomic scenarios. The AgMine DSS comprises six major components including data input, data mining, and statistical analysis, database, prediction and visualisation modules. This paper proposes how the visualization and data mining modules {{can be used to}} improve farmer decision making for individual districts. Visualisation of climate and other data was carried out using ArcGIS tool using two districts (Milling and Wongan Hills). Collation and preprocessing of data was carried out to <b>raster</b> <b>files</b> and a large repository of <b>raster</b> <b>files</b> was created for later geospatial analysis and climate and crop yield mapping. Data sets were sourced from public information resources, national and state agricultural cropping research data. Annual interpolation of rainfall and crop yield of different wheat varieties for the period 2008 to 2012 was carried out using the Arc Map and the Ordinary Kriging method with Spherical Semi-variogram models. Association rule mining techniques where also used to determine the relationship between, crop variety, rainfall and soil at district level. A framework, which combines these techniques, is proposed which can be used by farmers in decision making by providing visualisations of seasonal patterns of rainfall for individual districts and show the effect of various scenarios of dry and wet years on crop production...|$|R
50|$|The {{software}} system supports multiple terabytes of terrain data {{due to the}} spherical clipmaps rendering and the efficient data management. Any <b>raster</b> <b>file</b> format is supported, which can be read by the open source library GDAL but Geodata must be in geographic coordinates and WGS 84. The data structures used by Biosphere3D require no or short pre-processing steps; so all data can be modified on the fly with minimal turn around times. This facilitates quick 3D scene generation and a semi-interactive workflow.Biosphere3D exports Portable Network Graphics (PNG) and in the high dynamic range imaging image file format OpenEXR in virtual resolutions as stills and animations.Other features of Biosphere3D include support for advanced visual effects such as physics-based atmospheric scattering, Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, sun shading, and water shading (currently only one global water level is supported).|$|E

Subsequently, {{to the process of}} geo-referencing, new <b>raster</b> <b>files</b> are generated; therefore, geometrical data are stored within a regular matrix (GRID) organized as a set of rows and columns. The size of the cells establishes the level of spatial resolution. Each cell of the GRID contains its own height above ground level (GRID-quote) and a set of ‘information’ that can be a particular geographic feature or other data, such as the wind speed. Then, the raster dataset can be displayed or rendered in many different ways.|$|R
