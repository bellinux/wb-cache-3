40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years, a widely {{accepted}} model of "open-access" fisheries has been developed, yet empirical {{tests of the}} standard model have been relatively few. One difficulty is that fish stocks, the levels of which affect the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch,</b> are not directly observable. Simplifying assumptions are generally required, such as the assumption that catchability does not change over time. Estimation {{on the basis of}} the standard model also raises difficulties in specification, if contemporaneous correlation of the error term with one of the regressors is to be avoided. This paper describes an algorithm that imposes a less restrictive pattern (than constancy) on catchability, yet does so in an econometrically acceptable fashion. It also reports on an application of this algorithm to the Flemish Cap groundfishery over the period from 1971 to 1985.

30|$|Trends {{over time}} were {{difficult}} to establish. The total <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> of booklice (Liposcelis bostrychophila) increased over time, but when we examined the seven houses in London, where there were rather similar approaches to sampling, {{there was no evidence}} of similar trends or correlations. Determining the relationship between changes in catch and climate or environmental factors requires more thorough analysis. The distribution of insects in traps did not follow the Poisson distribution, expected if insects were randomly distributed. This is evident from the occasional capture of large numbers of insects and hints at the importance of infestation. Some insects showed a tendency to be associated with other insects at a higher frequency than expected, but there were no especially obvious entomological reasons for this, apart from the occasional association of adults with their larvae. Webbing and case bearing clothes moths were more abundant in pheromone traps, confirming effective capture through the use of attractants. Traps that are covered to prevent dust or admission of bats may not give a true indication of the distribution of other insect species.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} already {{demonstrated}} the usefulness and efﬁciency <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops to reduce nitrate leaching from cropping systems into groundwater. Catch crops must be sown in summer in a temperate climate, when {{the soil is}} often dry after the main crop harvest. This can lead to poor crop establish- ment. The present study uses a model to explore differences in the emergence <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops in summer {{for a wide range}} of soil and weather conditions that occur in France and identiﬁes the main causes of failure. The SIMPLE model predicts the emergence duration and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> crops by considering species and seed characteristics in interaction with seedbed conditions (temperature, moisture, clods and surface crust). The model was previously validated for white mustard and seems appropriate for the present work of simulating ryegrass and vetch emergence under contrasted weather and water stress conditions. Simulations were performed {{for a wide range of}} pedoclimatic conditions and sowing prac- tices (dates, depth and seedbed structures). Soil water content and temperature in the upper layers of the soil were ﬁrst simulated with the STICS soil-crop model and were then validated in an initial step by comparing simulations with experimental data. These outputs were then used as input data for the SIMPLE emergence model. Results showed that, on average, the emergence <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops sown in summer were sufﬁcient (> 75 %), regardless of species and sowing technique. Simulations indicated that a poor emergence rate (< 50 %) occurred in less than one year in ten for northern sites, and two years in ten in south-western France. In regions with a Mediterranean climate, emergence varied greatly from year to year, with failures (< 25 %) approximately two years in ten and low emergence (< 50 %) in approx- imately four years in ten. In dry summer regions, poor emergence occurred more frequently with early sowing (mid-July) due to water stress, while later sowing (around September 15) was generally more successful. Predictions indicate that sowing date is the management choice with the most impact and that it must be carefully adapted to weather to maximise the potential <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops to trap nitrate and thus minimise nitrate leaching. This work illustrates the application of modelling as a tool for evaluating risks and optimising the management <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> crops for a wide range of conditions, which thus increases the success of emergence and cover establishment under ﬁeld conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate depth distribution of pelagic species captured in a longline fishery and to evaluate the difference in depth distribution among species. We estimated depth distribution for 17 frequently captured species based on a Chinese longline fishing trip targeting bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the central-eastern Pacific Ocean in February-November 2006. The depth distributions of 13 bycatch species were significantly different from that of bigeye tuna. Although most of the bycatch species were found to be distributed in water depths shallower than bigeye tuna (i. e. increasing hook depths can decrease <b>catch</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> these species), the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> <b>rates</b> declined with increasing hook depths may be different.

40|$|Using firm-level {{data for}} {{a sample of}} European countries, {{we focus on the}} effects that product-market {{regulations}} have on firm-level TFP growth. We proxy regulatory burdens using the OECD indicators of sectoral non-manufacturing regulations. These allow accounting for both the direct effects of sectoral regulation on within-sector performance and the indirect effects of sectoral regulation on firms in other sectors through intersectoral input-output linkages. Our econometric specification of TFP is based on a "neo-Schumpeterian" empirical specification in which productivity improvements depend on growth at the global technological frontier and a catch up term. We assume that regulation can affect productivity growth both directly and by slowing down the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> up. We find that product market regulations that curb competitive pressures tend to reduce the productivity performance of firms. The negative effect is particularly strong on firms characterised by an above-average productivity growth. Domestic regulations that affect all regulated firms in the same way seem to be more important than border regulations in this context. total factor productivity, firm-level data, product market regulation...|$|E
30|$|About 55 % of {{the traps}} {{of the more}} than 30000 traps {{examined}} over that period contained insects that were readily categorised. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> (insects/trap) was highest in London and the Southeast. Booklice (Liposcelis bostrychophila) and silverfish (Lepisma saccharina) were the most frequent catch. Woolly bear (Anthrenus spp.) larvae and crustacean woodlice (Porcellio spinicornis) were also common. A higher frequency of furniture beetles (Anobium punctatum) is notable in the Southeast and West. Despite this overall pattern, catch varied greatly between individual properties. The general view that insects have increased over time was not universal, although the dominant booklouse showed an increased catch over the last decade. The insects {{did not appear to be}} randomly distributed, but clustered onto traps in greater numbers than might be expected from a Poisson distribution, which suggested they occurred as infestations. Some insect species appeared in combination with other species at a higher frequency than expected, but the reasons for these associations were not always obvious. Pheromone traps collected more webbing and case bearing clothes moths (Tineola bisselliella, Tinea pellionella) than traps without attractants, much as expected. There are hints that covered traps may collect fewer insects than simple blunder traps.|$|E
40|$|Methyl eugenol (4 -allyl- 1 - 2 -dimethoxybenzene-carboxylate) is a {{commonly}} occurring plant phenylpropanoid {{which is a}} highly attractive lure to the male oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel). Twelve plastic bucket traps were hung {{in a row of}} Norfolk pine trees. Each trap contained either 4 ml of methyl eugenol on a cotton dental wick, 2 g methyl eugenol plastic matrix (hereafter called a “plug”), or an untreated dental wick (as a control). After 5 months and 12 days the control wick was charged with 2 ml of liquid methyl eugenol and was subsequently recharged every two weeks. Results showed that the 4 ml treated wick and the 2 gram plastic methyl eugenol plug had no significant difference in catch per trap per day for the first 2 months. Although the plug actually averaged higher catch the difference was not significant by analysis of variance with or without repeated measures. Using the repeated measures analysis, date was the most significant factor, although there was no interaction between the effects of lure and date. In the subsequent 2 months, the plastic lures continued to catch at a declining rate (mean 36. 7 ± 15. 0 % of the 4 ml lure on a cotton wick). The data suggest that the plastic lure could be used for 2 months where temperatures are not extreme. In exclusion programs maximum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> is a requirement, but that is not necessary for population suppression. For the latter purpose, the 2 ml methyl eugenol plug could be used longer than two months, or the matrix could be adjusted to hold a larger volume of lure.

40|$|PresentationPelagic fishers {{operate in}} a dynamic {{environment}} and {{are faced with a}} high level of uncertainty on a daily basis. To cope with this complexity, fishers often rely on sharing information with others in order to improve their decision making. Yet previous research has not explicitly investigated the effect of resource user’s social networks on environmental outcomes in a marine setting. Linking observer data from 2008 - 2012 to a complete social network dataset from Hawaii’s longline fishery, we empirically estimate the relationship between fisher’s information sharing networks and <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> incidental <b>catch.</b> The network exhibits strong homophily, with fishers organizing themselves into three information sharing network groups largely corresponding to their ethnic affiliation. Controlling for spatiotemporal factors, we find significant differences in shark bycatch among the three network groups. Additionally, we find that bycatch rates for individuals whose majority of ties fall outside their ethnic group are more closely aligned with their network group, rather than their ethnic group. Significant differences in shark bycatch among network groups hold when examining only reciprocal ties, which breaks the network up into several distinct components, and controlling for ethnicity. Our results indicate that some fishers may be dynamically reacting in time and space to information received from trusted sources within their network group on strategies to mitigate bycatch, while others are not. This research provides the first empirical evidence that network homophily is correlated with environmental outcomes, and that social network structure is significantly related to <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> incidental <b>catch...</b>|$|R
40|$|This leaflet {{continues}} {{the study of}} catch and effort in the Irish lobster fishery, commenced in 1968, which was {{the subject matter of}} Fishery Leaflet No. 14 (Gibson 1968), As before, the results set out in this Leaflet have been obtained mainly from information supplied by Irish lobster fishermen who kept log books of their catch and effort in 1969. The response by fishermen to the requests by the Department to keep and fill in log books was still not as satisfactory as was expected, with the result that once again less than twenty log books were returned which contained information of sufficient standard to be useful in calculating the relationship between fishing and effort. The recording of this data is essential for the proper management of the lobster fishery in Irish waters and it is unfortunate that more fishermen are not co-operating in the log book scheme which is designed to help them. Those fishermen who have taken part in the scheme have already freely acknowledged that the log books (which remain their own property) have proved invaluable to them in their fishing operations, Furthermore the reproduction of all the data supplied by fishermen in one Leaflet enables those interested to see the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> made by each type of boat or fishing gear. This information enables fishermen to compare their fishing results with those of others and so perhaps helps them to choose alternative and more satisfactory means for the capture of lobsters. However, if this service is to be of most advantage to all fishermen, the numbers of fishermen filling in log books must be increased considerably. It is hoped that the annual publication of these records will encourage other fishermen to join the scheme thereby furthering everyone's knowledge of this important species in Irish waters...|$|E
40|$|The disabilities {{experienced}} by colour-blind people {{show us the}} biological advantages of colour vision in detecting targets, in segregating the visual field and in identifying particular objects or states. Human dichromats have especial difficulty in detecting coloured fruit against dappled foliage that varies randomly in luminosity; {{it is suggested that}} yellow and orange tropical fruits have co-evolved with the trichromatic colour vision of Old World monkeys. It is argued that the colour vision of man and of the Old World monkeys depends on two subsystems that remain parallel and independent at early stages of the visual pathway. The primordial subsystem, which is shared with most mammals, depends on a comparison <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> quantum <b>catch</b> in the short- and middle-wave cones; this system exists almost exclusively for colour vision, although the chromatic signals carry with them a local sign that allows them to sustain several of the functions of spatiochromatic vision. The second subsystem arose from the phylogenetically recent duplication of a gene on the X-cnromosome, and depends on a comparison <b>of</b> the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> quantum <b>catch</b> in the long- and middle-wave receptors. At {{the early stages of the}} visual pathway, this chromatic information is carried by a channel that is also sensitive to spatial contrast. The New World monkeys have taken a different route to trichromacy: in species that are basically dichromatic, heterozygous females gain trichromacy as a result of X-chromosome inactivation, which ensures that different photopigments are expressed in two subsets of retinal photoreceptor...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Experimental data on {{photoreceptor}} {{cells and}} visual pigments {{are the basis}} for model calculations per-formed to assess photoreceptor quantum catches under disparate irradiance conditions.

In each case, receptor type quantum catches are compared for various water types and depths. By associating the habit and habitat of an organism with the physical prop-erties of its photoreceptors, quantum-catch ratios are found as possible criteria {{in the selection of}} pigment peaks (A,,,). In addition to integrated (“total”) quantum catches by the receptor types, <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> quantum <b>catches</b> are de-termined as a function of wavelength.

The catch crops were grown at six field sites, where the perennial species were under-sown with barley and the annual species were after-sown following barley harvest.

This requires data {{on a combination of}} measures, including reported landings, retained and discarded non-target catch, and post-discard survival. Identification of the factors influencing discard vs. retention is needed to improve catch estimates and to determine wasteful fishing practices. To do this we compared retention <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> elasmobranch non-target <b>catch</b> in a broad subset of fisheries throughout the world by taxon, fishing country, and gear. A regression tree and random forest analysis indicated that taxon was the most important determinant of retention in this dataset, but all three factors together explained 59 % of the variance. Estimates of total elasmobranch removals were calculated by dividing the FAO global elasmobranch landings by average retention rates and suggest that total elasmobranch removals may exceed FAO reported landings by as much as 400 %. This analysis is the first effort to directly characterize global drivers of discards for elasmobranch non-target catch.

The developments presented here include additional analyses of the SPC data holdings for oceanic whitetip sharks (Carcharhinus longimanus; OCS) and silky sharks (Carcharinus falciformis; FAL) caught in longline and purse seine fisheries in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO). Oceanic whitetip and silky sharks {{are some of the}} most commonly caught bycatch species in pelagic tuna longline and purse seine fisheries, however the quantity and quality <b>of</b> historical shark <b>catch</b> data are often poor (Camhi et al. 2008, Clarke et al 2011). A main driver of this is that sharks have long been considered non‐target species and as such are often either inaccurately recorded in vessel logbooks or entirely un‐recorded. A surge in the shark fin trade in the 1990 s (Clarke 2009), combined with the practice of shark finning (i. e. retention of fins while discarding the carcasses at sea), has led to increased interest in the impact of fishing on shark populations (Clarke et al. 2007, Clarke and Harley 2010, Lawson 2011). At a basic level management plans rely on estimates <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> to assess this impact despite high levels of discards and low reporting (Clarke 2007, Clarke and Harley 2010).

Evidence from the literature indicates that some countries, particularly East Asian countries or small island states exploiting their own comparative advantage, achieve very rapid <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> growth and <b>catch</b> up with already well-off countries. Others, in particular those from Sub-Saharan Africa, have very little or no growth. This thesis empirically investigates the {{determinants of}} economic growth in Cyprus over the period 1960 - 1995 to evaluate whether the Cypriot economic growth during this period is better explained in an 'old' or 'new' growth modelling framework. Advanced multivariate time series techniques are applied to test the validity of models and to examine the relative importance of different variables which may have an impact on both the long-run and short-run growth of the Cypriot economy. The empirical findings show that physical capital investment, human capital and tourism investment are the major causes of growth in the Cypriot economy...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{influencing}} the species composition {{and magnitude of}} landings and discards were evaluated {{based on data from}} at-sea observations of 4 533 otter trawl tows. Data were collected from the USA mixed species otter trawl fisheries of the Georges Bank-Southern New England region, sampled during 1989 – 92. General linear models for main effects have related discard rates, total <b>catch,</b> and indices <b>of</b> species richness, diversity and evenness to temporal, spatial and operational variables associated with the fishing process (year, month, statistical reporting area, primary species sought, cod-end mesh size, vessel size, tow duration, total catch, total discards and depth). Discarding <b>rates</b> (proportion <b>of</b> the <b>catch</b> discarded) varied significantly both for individual species and for aggregated species by year, area, month, and target species. The effects of cod-end mesh size were variable, and confounded with year-class strength, particularly in the case of yellowtail flounder. Fisheries regulated by minimum fish and mesh sizes (e. g. for flounders and large gadoids) generally exhibited higher average discard rates and more variation than fisheries directed to species without such restrictions (e. g. for small pelagics, skates and others). The species composition and diversity <b>of</b> <b>catches</b> were significant functions of area, year, target species and month, as well as mesh size and tow duration. Year effects were more important for explaining variation in discard rates than total (multispecies) catches. This result is probably because large, partially-recruited year-classes differentially attract effort from other species targets, but most of the fleet landings are composed <b>of</b> mixed <b>catches</b> <b>of</b> species at moderate abundance levels. Multivariate approaches to analysis of sea sampling data offer important insights into the potential effectiveness of technological and area/time management measures for reducing fishery discards. Key words: Bycatch, discards, gear selectivity, species compositio...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{examine the}} {{transitional}} dynamics {{of a model}} economy populated by individuals who split their time between acquiring a formal education, producing nal goods, and innovating. The paper has two objectives: (i) to uncover the macroeconomic circumstances that triggered the onset and rise of formal education; (ii) to reconcile the remarkable growth of the education sector with the constancy of other key macroeconomic variables, such as the interest rate, the consumption-output ratio and the growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> per capita income (Kaldor facts). The transitional dynamics of human capital growth models, such as Lucas (1988), would attribute the arrival of education to the diminishing marginal productivity of physical capital. Conversely, the model proposed here {{suggests that it is}} the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> learning that <b>catches</b> up with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return on physical capital. The learning rate increases with the stock of public knowledge the primary input used by the education sector. The conjecture is that when public knowledge hits a critical threshold, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> return on education becomes large enough to induce individuals to spend time in school. The stock of public knowledge grows as the number of technologies available increases. In accordance with the development trajectories of modern economies, the model generates a development sequence in which an innovation-only economy is followed by an innovation-education economy. The models transitional paths are matched with about three centuries of U. S. economic data...|$|R

40|$|The local pelagic {{longline}} fishery targeting swordfish {{started in the}} Seychelles in 1995. Actually 10 vessels are active. In June 2000 a two year research program was set up through partnership of SFA, IFREMER and the French cooperation in Seychelles. Between 2000 and 2001, 18 longline trips corresponding to 136 sets were conducted on the SFA’s research vessel “L’Amitié”. The longlines were equipped with hook timers and temperature/depth recorders which permitted estimates of the time, the depth and the survival <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> the <b>catch</b> to be made. Most of the longlines were set after sunset and hauled after sunrise. A total of 730 swordfish were caught (64. 4 % of commercial species). Yellowfin and bigeye tuna represents 18. 8 % and 12. 0 % <b>of</b> the commercial <b>catches</b> respectively. The number of swordfish caught on hook timer is half the total swordfish caught (345 fish). <b>Catch</b> by unit <b>of</b> effort (CPUE) for swordfish for the program is equal to 12. 2 fish for 1000 hooks. Data collected by hook timers, show similar trends as observed in Reunion island (France), 52 % of swordfish are caught during the first 3 hours following the hooks setting. CPUE balance by hour are maximum between 8 : 00 PM and 9 : 00 PM (5. 76 fish. 1000 - 1 hooks. hour- 1). Average survival rate calculated was 20 %. More than 50 % of the swordfish were dead after six hour on hook. Sex ratio (female vs. male) was 0. 696, and {{a significant difference between}} the ratio female- male is observed for the majority of month of the year.

40|$|A growing push to {{implement}} catch share fishery programs is based {{partly on the}} recognition that they may provide stronger incentives for ecological stewardship than conventional fisheries management. Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard <b>rates,</b> use <b>of</b> habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 catch share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that catch share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> share programs were measured through comparisons <b>of</b> fisheries with <b>catch</b> shares to fisheries without catch shares or by comparing fisheries before and after catch shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by catch share implementation: only discard rate, which declined significantly in catch share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, catch share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, discard rate, and the ratio <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> to catch quotas. These impacts <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent of the number <b>of</b> years that <b>catch</b> share programs had been in place. These findings suggest that for the indicators examined, the primary effect <b>of</b> <b>catch</b> shares was greater consistency over time. This enhanced consistency could be beneficial to fishery systems and might also be an indication of more effective management...|$|R
