25|$|Nova wears a {{standard}} Xandarian StarCorps uniform, {{designed to accommodate}} his powers without being damaged by them. The uniform is highly resistant to damage, including outer space conditions, and is airtight. In addition, the uniform has a built-in life support function that can sustain Rider under the most extreme environmental conditions, including acting as a life-support suit by locking off the mouth and eyes of the helmet. The helmet contains a radio, telescopic sights, night vision sensors, and heat imaging sensors, {{as well as a}} visual heads-up display for tracking energy signatures. Nova's helmet has a <b>rigid</b> <b>construction</b> and shape when worn, but becomes as malleable as cloth when it is not, allowing Rider to hide it in his civilian clothes when desired. Nova's uniform is not only extremely malleable, but contains specific functions to aid Rider in his role as a Nova Corps Centurion. Among these features are an electromagnetic discharge that can nullify gravity and an interface to stargates that allow him to enter hyperspace, where he can move at velocities exceeding the speed of light. Rider can also alter the appearance and nature of his uniform to suit his needs. However, as Rider learns the hard way, the Nova Corps keeps a strict dress code. When he makes major cosmetic changes to his uniform after rejoining the New Warriors, Nova is summarily ordered to conform to standard.|$|E
500|$|The Eagle {{had been}} stocked with safety {{equipment}} such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in {{the form of a}} bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the basket but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care, or with any acknowledgement of adopting indigenous peoples' techniques for dealing with the extreme environment. In this, Andrée contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers. Sven Lundström points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for the team due to Andrée's mistaken design of the sleds, with a <b>rigid</b> <b>construction</b> that borrowed nothing from the long proven Inuit sleds, and were so impractical for the difficult terrain. Andrée called it [...] "dreadful terrain", with channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over melt ponds. The men's clothes included no furs but were woollen coats and trousers, plus oilskins. They wore the oilskins but the explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. Danger was everywhere, as it would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.|$|E

Readymixed or site mixed concrete is {{used for}} <b>rigid</b> pavement <b>construction.</b> However, conventional concrete mixtures require more than 7 days to gain adequate strength to allow for traffic. Development of high early strength concrete would be a solution to allow traffic within a reasonable time. However, use of high cement content in early strength concrete induces distress in the pavements {{and would not be}} an economical mix. A high performance concrete mix was developed for <b>rigid</b> pavement <b>construction</b> using a low cost admixture with available materials in Sri Lanka.

Slab temperature was also measured with time and found temperature rise due to heat of hydration was insignificant. Using the mix proportion developed, concrete roads can be allowed for traffic in 12 hours and can also be used for repair works of the existing roads.

40|$|Not many {{full-scale}} {{tests at}} the H 4 level have yet {{been carried out}} according to {{the first and second}} standards of the prEN 1317. For this reason, only a few H 4 tests are mentioned in the literature. Full-scale tests conducted with heavy vehicles are also mentioned in the literature. These tests deviate from the H 4 tests listed in the first and second standards of the prEN 1317. They are included here to supplement the limited number of tests at H 4 level found in the literature. Some conclusions are: (1) Heavy vehicle safety barriers can be made of either steel or concrete. Examples of constructions made of both these materials were found that satisfy the desired H 4 level; (2) For a fixed construction, concrete is to be preferred over material for small widths; (3) For more <b>rigid</b> <b>constructions,</b> steel is to be preferred over material for greater widths; (4) The available heavy vehicle safety barriers are higher than the current constructions. Vehicle safety barriers with a height of about 1. 3 metres appear to provide good results. With a height of about 1. 0 metre, vehicle rollovers still occur; and (5) the damage suffered from collisions involving a steel construction appears to be much greater than damage suffered from collisions involving concrete safety barriers...|$|R

This dissertation explores the experiences of racially mixed Jamaicans in South Florida {{and the impact of}} those experiences on their racial self-characterizations through the boundary-work theoretical framework. Specifically, the study examines the impact of participants’ exposure to the one-drop rule in the U. S., by which racial identification has been historically determined by the existence or non-existence of black forebears. Employing qualitative data collected through both focus group and face-to-face semi-structured interviews, the study analyzes mixed-race Jamaicans’ encounters in the U. S. with racial boundaries, and the boundary-work that reinforces them, as well their response to these encounters. Through their stories, the dissertation examines participants’ efforts to navigate racial boundaries through choices of various racial identifications. Further, it discusses the ways in which structural forces and individual agency have interacted in the formation of these identifications. The study finds that in spite of participants’ expressed preference for non-racialism, and despite their objections to rigid racial categories, in seeking to carve out alternative identities, they are participating in the boundary-making of which they are so critical. ...|$|R

During the investigation the method for the problem solution of the <b>rigid</b> plastic <b>constructions,</b> on the base of which the use of extremal principles of the limiting resistance theory and the formulation of the dynamics problem as the corresponding problem of linear programming are laying, has been used. As a result exact (in the frameworks of the assumptions accepted) solutions of the dynamic deformation problems for rigid plastic rectangular plates with various conditions of resting, statically optimum round plates, three-layer gently sloping shells of revolution have been obtained and analyzed for the first time. The formulation realized for problems of the dynamic deformation of rigid plastic plates and gently sloping shells of revolution as problems of linear programming has an advantage over other possible (numerical) methods for the problem solution both from theoretical and practical points of view and may be used in the calculation practice.

This can be achieved by specifying pavement layer thickness with proper types of materials based on the extent traffic, environmental conditions and life cycle cost analysis. Since traffic is regarded as the key design parameter, traffic analysis was done for seventeen provincial roads. That analysis was carried out to find vehicle composition, magnitude of the axle loads, axle configuration and frequency of load repetitions. An experimental campaign was implemented in order to monitor the recycled aggregate properties before utilizing them as a <b>rigid</b> pavement <b>construction</b> material. Properties of recycled aggregate were determined in terms of (i) particle size distribution (ii) particle density (iii) porosity and absorption (IV) particle shape (v) strength and toughness. Then the development of concrete mix design was done. In this study, various physical and mechanical properties of concretes were examined. The concrete properties were determined by doing the workability test, compressive test, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity test.
