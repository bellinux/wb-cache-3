50|$|The DAT {{recorder}} mechanism {{was considerably}} {{more complex and}} expensive than an analogue cassette deck mechanism due to the rotary helical scan head, therefore Philips and Panasonic Corporation developed a rival digital tape <b>recorder</b> <b>system</b> with a stationary head based on the analogue compact cassette. The DCC was cheaper and simpler mechanically than DAT, but did not make perfect digital copies as it used a lossy compression technique called PASC. (Lossy compression was necessary to reduce the data rate to a level that the DCC head could record successfully at the linear tape speed of 4.75 cm/s that the compact cassette system uses.) DCC was never a competitor to DAT in recording studios, because DAT was already established, and as it was launched {{at the same time}} as Sony's Minidisc format (which has random access and editing features), it was not successful with consumers either. However, DCC proved that high quality digital recording could be achieved with a cheap simple mechanism using stationary heads.|$|E

Cerys died at Birmingham Children's Hospital on 17 October 2015, aged 9. In April 2014, the millionaire's son was involved in a Birmingham bar brawl which left a man blinded.

For I60R a generalized <b>recorder</b> <b>system</b> was installed (Datenspeicherkassette DSK / data storage cassette) that {{allowed to enter}} the train number, driver info, train weight along with the driving events. The standardized DSK black box allows for approximately 30,000 km of general recording data and 90 km of detailed recording data. Later models of the DSK are electronic especially since {{the introduction of the}} computerized PZ80/PZB90 train protection generations.Modern Train Event Recorders follow International or National Standards like IEEE Std. 1482.1-1999, FRA 49 CFR Part 229, IEC 62625-1 etc. specifying the digital and analogue data to be acquired, recorded and transmitted for further analysis. The need for event recorders to sustain an accident has led to companies like Faiveley (France), Hasler Rail (Switzerland), Bach-Simpson (USA), Saira Electronics (Italy) FAR Systems, MIOS Elettronica (Italy) to develop crash protected memory modules as a part of their event recorders. These new generation event recorders have growing demand both for rapid transit systems and mainline trains, in Europe, United States,India, etc.|$|E
