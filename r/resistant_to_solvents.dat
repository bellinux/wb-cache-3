40|$|The {{carbonaceous}} chondrite meteorites are fragments of asteroids that have remained relatively unprocessed since {{the formation of}} the Solar System 4. 56 billion years ago. The major organic component in these meteorites is a macromolecular phase that is <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>solvent</b> extraction. The information contained within macromolecular material can be accessed by degradative techniques such as pyrolysis. Hydropyrolysis refers to pyrolysis assisted by high hydrogen gas pressures and a dispersed sulphided molybdenum catalyst. Hydropyrolysis of the Murchison macromolecular material successfully releases much greater quantities of hydrocarbons than traditional pyrolysis techniques (twofold greater than hydrous pyrolysis) including significant amounts of high molecular weight polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as phenanthrene, carbazole, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, perylene, benzoperylene and coronene units with varying degrees of alkylation. When hydropyrolysis products are collected using a silica trap immersed in liquid nitrogen, the technique enables the solubilisation and retention of compounds {{with a wide range of}} volatilities (i. e. benzene to coronene).

40|$|Lipases are {{the most}} pliable {{biocatalyst}} and bring about {{a wide range of}} bioconversion reactions, such as hydrolysis, interesterification, esterification, alcoholysis, acidolysis and aminolysis. Lipases can act on a variety of substrates including natural oils, synthetic triglycerides and esters of fatty acids. They are <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>solvents</b> and are exploited in a broad spectrum of biotechnological applications. Lipase catalyzed transesterification, hydrolysis and esterification are the important class of reactions for food technology applications in fats and oil industry, dairy industry, pharmaceuticals and bakery industry. Lipases are very peculiar as they hydrolyse fats into fatty acids and glycerol at the water-lipid interface and can reverse the reaction in non-aqueous media. Novel biotechnological applications, like biopolymer synthesis, biodiesel production, treatment of fat-containing waste effluents, enantiopure synthesis of pharmaceuticals and nutraceutical agents, have been established successfully. The present article extends the frontier of lipase technology towards food processing applications and discusses the important characteristics of lipases and its sources. Various methods of lipase immobilization for food technology applications, various assay methods for lipase, production of lipase by submerged and solid state fermentation strategies, and various purification methods available have been discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|The growing use of ETFE-Foils in {{pneumatic}} structures has {{motivated the}} research in material models for thermoplastic polymeric. This type of polymer is more <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>solvents</b> and other chemicals. The lightweight of the ETFE foil {{is one of the}} most important features that motivates its use in structural buildings. Moreover, it has been applied often to roofs, resulting in low costs for the foundation. The translucency property is advantageous, because it allows the utilization of natural light, reducing the use of artiﬁcial light. Another property related with resource consumption is the anti- adhesive nature of ETFE. This property means that roofs and atria need to be cleaned less frequently, leading to a reduction in the cost of the building maintenance. ETFE membrane structures clearly present large deformations by which the small strain material model fails to give good results. Beyond this behavior some experiments showed the dependency of the ETFE mechanical properties with temperature. These experiments indicated viscoplastic material behavior, characterized by diﬀerent responses for diﬀerent strain rates / load rates and diﬀerent temperatures. The present work shows an implementation in a ﬁnite element software of an elasto- viscoplastic material model considering large strains for the ETFE membranes. The parameters were obtained with uniaxial experiments analysis from literature. The results of the numerical model show good agreement with the experiments...|$|E

30|$|The {{growth of}} the {{graphene}} nanostructures {{was carried out in}} a radio-frequency (RF) inductively coupled plasma CVD system, as described in previous reports [35, 36, 37, 38, 40]. A piece of copper foil (99.95 %, Alfa Aesar) of 4 [*]×[*] 4  cm 2 dimensions was used as the growth substrate and placed on a stage in the plasma chamber. First, a gas mixture of 10 sccm argon (Ar) and 20 sccm hydrogen (H 2) was fed into the chamber, and a pressure of 1.5  Pa was set. The plasma was then produced using 750  W from an RF power supply and a matching network. The copper foil was treated for 3  min with the H 2 –Ar mixture, following which methane was fed into the chamber for 6  min. The density of the graphene nanowalls was controlled by varying the H 2 flow rate supplied during deposition. For this work, a high H 2 content (80 sccm) was used to produce fewer and thinner CNWs, whereas a lower H 2 content (20 sccm) generated denser and thicker CNWs on the copper foil. No external substrate heating was used; however, the substrate temperature reaches ~[*] 250  °C owing to plasma heating effects [38]. Next, all produced CNW films were decoupled from the copper foil using deionized water. The foil was placed in the water and sink while the graphene film was left floating on the water surface. Subsequently, the films were transferred onto Thermanox™ coverslips for biological characterization. These substrates (made by Nunc and purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Australia) are made from a hydrophilic polyester film with very low oxygen content and are highly <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>solvents.</b> Uncoated Thermanox™ coverslips were used as the experimental control. Therefore, by simply controlling the H 2 content, the same production and transfer processes yielded two different topographies. The first comprised a dense CNW surface, and the second consisted of thin CNWs oriented horizontally with very few standing CNW sheets [hereafter named as hybrid graphene layers (HGLs)].|$|E
40|$|This is an {{investigation}} into alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) from Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius. Eighteen ADHs have been studied, with seven taken for closer inspection. Characterisation was carried out to determine the industrial significance of these enzymes, starting with the substrate scope of the ADHs. The key results obtained are as follows: ADH A is the alcohol dehydrogenase domain of the bifunctional ADHE enzyme (Extance, 2012; Extance et al., 2013). It has been determined that the substrate scope, whilst restricted to linear aliphatic aldehydes, extends at least to dodecanal. Also, with a specificity constant of 167 mM- 1 min- 1 it appears that ADH A could prefer butanal to shorter-chain aldehydes such as ethanal and propanal with specificity constants of 38 mM- 1 min- 1 and 35 mM- 1 min- 1, respectively. Thus ADH A may have a preference for longer aldehydes than previously believed due to its native role {{in the production of}} ethanol from acetyl-coA. ADH B was previously investigated for its potential role in the production of butanol. Here it was confirmed as an NADH-dependent ADH, with a substrate scope limited to five carbon length substrates and smaller, with residual activity with C 6 substrates. ADH B demonstrated activity with ethyl 4 -chloroacetoacetate, an intermediate in the production of statins. Further, an estimated half-life whilst stored at 4 °C of 770 days; retention of 86 % activity with 10 vol% ethyl acetate and 92 % activity with 10 vol% acetonitrile; and a specific activity of 27 U mg- 1 with 3 M 2 -butanone are all indications that ADH B is a potentially useful enzyme for industry. The last enzyme to be previously investigated was ADH C, which in this work was confirmed to be an acetoin reductase with a very small substrate scope exclusively based around the acetoin motif, and therefore no further work was conducted. ADH D and ADH F both have broad substrate scopes including the industrially-relevant substrates, 5 -norbornene- 2 -carboxaldehyde, 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -propanedione, ethyl 4 -chloroacetoacetate and ethyl- 2 -oxo- 4 -phenylbutyrate. ADH D is an NADPH-dependent enzyme whereas ADH F can utilise both NADH and NADPH. Both enzymes are annotated as aldo-keto reductases, which is further indicated by multiple sequence alignment with the most similar available protein sequences and crystal structures. Thus, these two enzymes are the first aldo-keto reductases to be examined from moderate thermophiles, and are tentatively assigned in the AKR family as AKR 6 D 1 and AKR 5 G 4 respectively. ADH D has a very low KM (≤ 0. 1 μM) with NADPH, giving a specificity constant of 2, 800, 000 mM- 1 min- 1, substantially higher than any other noted. ADH D showed > 80 % activity from pH 5. 0 - 8. 0. The enzyme was <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>solvents</b> DMSO (at 5 vol%) and ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and cyclopentyl methyl ether (at 20 vol%). ADH F had the broadest substrate scope of any ADH tested, with 1 -phenyl- 1, 2 -propanedione the most preferred substrate with a KM of 0. 010 mM and a specificity constant of 54, 000 mM- 1 min- 1. It greatly preferred sodium phosphate at pH 7. 0, as almost any deviation resulted in a substantial loss of activity. Activity of ≥ 70 % was recorded in 5 vol% DMSO, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, cyclopentyl methyl ether and 50 vol% hexane. Both ADH D and F have optimal activities at 70 °C and both may have application in the biotechnology industry for the production of pharmaceutical intermediates and other high value chemicals. ADH E acts solely as an aldehyde reductase, with Vmax using NADH of 74, 331, 320 and 281 U mg- 1 for methanal, ethanal, propanal and butanal, respectively. Activity with NADPH was limited (< 1 % compared with NADH). Activity was also noted with higher aldehydes such as octanal and furfural. ADH G is an NADPH-dependent ADH utilizing aldehydes only. It has an optimal temperature of 60 °C with a half-life of under two hours at that temperature. In conclusion, this thesis reports a feasibility study into the potential industrial use of specific enzymes for a variety of purposes ranging from the production of pharmaceutical intermediates to bioremediation. ADHs D and F are most likely to have use in the biotechnology industry, and ADHs B and E may be suitable for cofactor regeneration. ADH E may additionally be useful in the bioremediation industry. In addition, the anticipated biological significance of these enzymes is described...|$|E
