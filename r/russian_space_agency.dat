5|$|The commander, Bill Shepherd, was {{a former}} Navy SEAL, whose only spaceflights were on shuttle missions, and at the {{beginning}} of the mission his total time in space was about two weeks. Questions had been raised by the <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> about the choice of Shepherd as mission commander due to his lack of experience. Flight engineer Sergei Krikalev had spent over a year in orbit, mostly on Mir, and would become the first person to visit the ISS twice. He had felt excitement to have been one of the first people to enter the Zarya module (the first component of the space station) in 1998, during STS-88, and was looking forward to returning. Yuri Gidzenko was designated commander and pilot of the two-day Soyuz mission to the station, had one previous spaceflight, which was a 180-day stay aboard Mir.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, ESA started new {{programmes}} {{in order}} to create its own crew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals is Hopper, whose prototype by EADS, called Phoenix, has already been tested. While projects such as Hopper are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with the <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> have emerged. Following talks with the <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> in 2004 and June 2005, a co-operation between ESA and the <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed Kliper, a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. A €50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by the ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> {{as well as}} ESA {{announced}} that they would continue to look for other international partners such as Japan to invest in Kliper. A substantive cooperation with NASA was unlikely, due to the parallel development of America's own next-generation manned launch vehicle, the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV).|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of its docking, the Expedition 16 crew was aboard the space station. This {{consisted}} of Peggy Whitson of NASA who was the station's Commander, along with two Flight Engineers; Yuri Malenchenko of the <b>Russian</b> Federal <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and Garrett Reisman of NASA. They were replaced by the Expedition 17 crew in April and May, who remained aboard the station at {{the time of}} the ATV's departure.

25|$|On 28 April 2008, {{by placing}} 10 {{satellites}} on PSLV-C9 (PSLV-CA), Indian Space Research Organisation created {{a world record}} for {{the highest number of}} satellites launched in a single mission. This record was broken by NASA in 2013 (by launching 29 satellites) and was further improved by <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> by deploying 33 satellites in a single mission. PSLV-C34 launch is the biggest launch (in terms of number of satellites) by ISRO and third biggest in the world.|$|E
25|$|In late July 2006, the <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and the European Space Agency {{agreed to}} {{collaborate}} {{on a different}} project {{to develop a new}} spacecraft.

25|$|In 2005 Kliper was {{displayed}} in several air shows around Europe and Asia, {{in order to}} reach out to international partners who would be interested to co-fund and co-develop the spacecraft. The <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> especially looked to Europe as the European Space Agency (ESA) had become its major partner in space activities during the last years. In May 2005 rumours started in the press that Europe would join the Kliper project in a specially funded venture that would be part of the Aurora Programme. These rumours turned out to be correct when both Russian and European space officials announced their cooperation to build Kliper during the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget on June 10, 2005.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} launch sites for Kliper, further {{information}} became available as of October 2005, with a planning-stage declaration from Nikolai Moiseev, Deputy Director of the <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> that Kliper {{could have been}} launched from ESA's Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana. Though this aim had already been suggested, the comment {{was made in the}} context of facility upgrades for Kourou that are already under way since 2003 and are expected to be finished in 2007 with the first launch of a Soyuz rocket from French Guiana in 2008. It had been suggested that Kliper could have been launched from both Baikonur and Kourou, by Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA's human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration directorate, in December 2005.|$|E
25|$|A {{controlled}} deorbit into {{a remote}} ocean {{was found to}} be technically feasible only with Russia's assistance. The <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> has experience from de-orbiting the Salyut 4, 5, 6, 7 and Mir space stations; NASA's first intentional controlled de-orbit of a satellite (the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) occurred in 2000. As of late 2010, the preferred plan is to use a slightly modified Progress spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS. This plan was seen as the simplest, cheapest and with the highest margin. Skylab, the only space station built and launched entirely by the US, decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years, and no attempt was made to de-orbit it using a deorbital burn. Remains of Skylab hit populated areas of Esperance, Western Australia without injuries or loss of life.|$|E

25|$|Kliper, as {{a vehicle}} alone, would have been {{primarily}} a manned spaceship, carrying six cosmonauts and payloads of up to 700 kilograms (mostly experiments and other equipment used for carrying through experiments in orbit) and was planned to stay in orbit for approximately 15 days independently and for up to 360 days if docked to the International Space Station. This highlighted both the Russian/European and the American change in space transportation philosophy. Rather than focusing on the lifting of cargo and a crew, {{in the same way}} as the Space Shuttle or Buran, the <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> adopted a 'people first' philosophy with the aim of 'bolting' extra capabilities for more advanced missions onto Kliper at a later date. Each orbiter was intended to make 25 flights prior to retirement.|$|E
25|$|RSC Energia {{continued}} {{to pursue the}} project without Russian government support and {{announced that it would}} seek private investment for the craft. News reports in Russia indicated that Kliper was still expected to be ready for <b>Russian</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> test flights around the year 2012, as part of Russian spacecraft upgrade program. The project has been officially halted in June 2007, after the major proponent of the project, Nikolai Sevastyanov, was dismissed from the position of the president of RSC Energia. The newly appointed president of RSC Energia, Vitaly Lopota, confirmed that Kliper would not be displayed on the 2007 MAKS aviation and space show. He said that Energia would spend more time on the project analysis, perform additional dynamic modeling, revise the design and appearance and then would come up with new proposals for Roscosmos.|$|E
25|$|An {{emotional}} {{woman who}} {{is at the center of}} a love triangle between Boone and Chalmers, she begins as head of the Russian contingent. The novels hint that she used both wit and seduction to rise through the ranks of the <b>Russian</b> <b>space</b> <b>agency</b> to become the leader of the first colonization mission. After the first revolution, she flees with other members of the First Hundred to the hidden colony in the pole. She becomes a school teacher of the children of the hidden colonists but later becomes a powerful political force. After the deaths of Chalmers and Boone, she falls in love with Michel Duval. She suffers heavily from bipolar disorder and from memory-related psychological disorders with growing age, which often lead her to isolate herself from others and sometimes turn violent. Throughout the novels, Maya takes an active political role, helping to keep the surviving First Hundred together during the failed revolution of 2061 and guiding the successful revolutions that occur decades later, despite her psychological problems.|$|E
