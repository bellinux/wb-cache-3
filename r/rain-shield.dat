50|$|The {{station was}} firstly {{constructed}} in 1896 and opened on 20 April 1902 with {{service on the}} Western Line. The station was a single-story wooden structure with Japanese style with slant roof and <b>rain-shield</b> walls. The rail line connected to the station roughly divides Chiayi City into two regions. The region located {{in front of the}} station prospered as the city business district, while the region located behind the station was scarcely developed. Service to the Alishan Forest Railway began in 1912 from the station. The station was renovated in June 1933 to its current structure.|$|E
50|$|Hardwick {{is open to}} the public. It has a fine garden, {{including}} herbaceous borders, {{a vegetable}} and herb garden, and an orchard. The extensive grounds also contain Hardwick Old Hall, a slightly earlier house which was used as guest and service accommodation after the new hall was built. The Old Hall is now a ruin. It is administered by English Heritage on behalf of the National Trust and is also open to the public. Many of the Old Hall's major rooms were decorated with ambitious schemes of plasterwork, notably above the fireplaces. Remarkably, impressive fragments of these are still to be seen (protected by preservative coatings and <b>rain-shields),</b> though most of the building is unroofed.|$|R
40|$|Simulated rain of two intensities {{was allowed}} to fall for 30 min on to barley leaves {{infected}} by Rhynchosporium secalis. The resulting splash droplets were collected on horizontal pieces of fixed photographic film. Most spore-carrying droplets were in the 400 ??? 800 ??m diam range. They were dispersed as far as 1 m from the barley leaves {{and the number of}} conidia collected on horizontal microscope slides declined exponentially with distance from the leaves. It was estimated that, of the conidia dispersed in 30 min of simulated rainfall with an intensity of 12 mm h??? 1, 40 % were dispersed in the first 10 min and 27 % in the last 10 min, and with an intensity of 65 mm h??? 1 39 % were dispersed in the first 10 min and 25 % in the last 10 min. Horizontal pieces of film and microscope slides were placed, under <b>rain-shields,</b> at 15 cm above ground level in an infected crop of winter barley during June and July 1985. Of the spore-carrying droplets collected during periods of rain, most were less than 400 ??m diam, but most spores were in 400 ??? 800 ??m diam droplets. No conidia were collected during dry weather or during rainfall with intensity less than 0. 2 mm h??? 1. During showers most conidia were collected when rainfall intensity was greatest; a regression of number of conidia collected cm??? 2 min??? 1 on rainfall intensity (both square-root transformed) accounted for 76 % of the variance...|$|R
40|$|Near O'ahu {{the annual}} oceanic {{evaporation}} is 65 in. (1651 mm) and the rainfall is 18 in. (457. 2 mm), giving a 47 -in. (1 193. 8 -mm) deficit. In 1981, evaporation over central O'ahu was 27 in. (685. 8 mm) and rainfall was 197 in. (5 003. 8 mm), for a 170 -in. (4 318 -mm) surplus. The pattern of evaporation over an island {{differs from that}} over the open ocean, just as the pattern of rainfall and cloudiness is changed by island topography. Evaporation measurements that were begun in 1980 at five leeward sites were expanded to include measurements at four windward sites in southern O'ahu from October 1985 through September 1987. Specially designed small <b>rain-shielded</b> evaporimeters were calibrated against class A pan evaporation. Such pertinent factors as rainfall, sunlight, wind, and air temperature were recorded for correlation with evaporation. Although monthly class A pan evaporation was 0. 53 the evaporimeter measurement for the entire 1980 - 1987 period, a 0. 55 ratio was finally adopted as a more reliable transformation value. Correlation coefficients of determination (r^ 2) values between monthly evaporimeter and pan evaporation readings ranged from 0. 77 to 1. 0, between pan evaporation and sunlight readings from 0. 79 to 0. 87, and between evaporimeter and sunlight readings from 0. 66 to 0. 93. A fivefold increase in pan level wind across the transect only increased the sunlight energy used as latent heat by 50 %. Evaporation relative to the Manoa Mauka campus calibration site ranged from 0. 79 on the windward coast, to 0. 56 at the windward base of the Ko'olau Range, to 0. 65 at the leeward base, to 1. 2 at the extreme leeward site. Evaporation equivalent to 0. 91 the windward net radiation but 1. 23 the leeward value suggests negative advection onshore from the ocean and strong positive advection from the dry leeward surroundings. The annual water balance for October 1985 through September 1987 was a deficit of 20. 4 to 32. 4 in. (518. 2 to 823. 0 mm) at the windward coast, a surplus of 37. 9 in. (962. 7 mm) at the windward Ko'olau base, a surplus of 100 in. (2 540 mm) at the leeward Ko'olau base, and a deficit of 55. 9 in. (1419. 9 mm) at the leeward valley floor.
