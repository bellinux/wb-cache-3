5|$|A new note in Coutances' {{administration}} was his custom of issuing writs {{not in his}} own name, as had previously been the practice, but in the king's name. The archbishop also stressed that his decisions were made with the advice and consent {{of many of the}} leading nobles of the realm, as well as the barons of the Exchequer. This was a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> Longchamp's authoritarian method of government.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Rothbard {{left the}} Libertarian Party and began {{building}} bridges to the post-Cold War anti-interventionist right, calling himself a paleolibertarian, a conservative <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the cultural liberalism of mainstream libertarianism. Paleolibertarianism sought {{to appeal to}} disaffected working class whites through a synthesis of cultural conservatism and libertarian economics.|$|E
5|$|Most of the population, {{urban and}} rural, took out their anger and frustrations on the nation's Vietnamese population. Lon Nol's call for 10,000 volunteers {{to boost the}} {{manpower}} of Cambodia's poorly equipped, 30,000-man army, managed to swamp the military with over 70,000 recruits. Rumours abounded concerning a possible PAVN offensive aimed at Phnom Penh itself. Paranoia flourished and this set off a violent <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the nation's 400,000 ethnic Vietnamese.|$|E

5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between {{the late eighteenth}} and the early nineteenth centuries. It {{was part of the}} wider European Romantic movement, which was partly a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the Age of Enlightenment, emphasising individual, national and emotional responses, moving beyond Renaissance and Classicist models, particularly to the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{important}} {{place in the}} government or private sector not occupied by proven party comrades. Adolf Hitler clearly announced before the seizure of power that the party would be running things. Thus, anywhere {{there might be a}} <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the party, a Hitler guard stands ready to quell that reaction.|$|E
5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} affirmation of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative {{interpretations of the}} Confession. By the 1940s, the dominance of liberal theology {{had given way to}} a neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} Keen Johnson, then {{an executive with}} Reynolds Metals, to oppose Cooper's re-election bid. Cooper {{had the support of}} organized labor and benefitted from a large segment of Kentuckians who voted for Republican Richard M. Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy as a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> Kennedy's Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election. Cooper ultimately defeated Johnson by 199,257 votes, a record victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate.|$|E
5|$|In Northern Europe, Greek mythology {{never took}} the same hold of the visual arts, but its effect was very obvious on literature. The English {{imagination}} was fired by Greek mythology starting with Chaucer and John Milton and continuing through Shakespeare to Robert Bridges in the 20th century. Racine in France and Goethe in Germany revived Greek drama, reworking the ancient myths. Although during the Enlightenment of the 18th century <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> Greek myth spread throughout Europe, the myths continued to provide {{an important source of}} raw material for dramatists, including those who wrote the libretti for many of Handel's and Mozart's operas.|$|E
5|$|In {{a partial}} <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the Manzoni years, Birmingham City Council is {{demolishing}} {{some of the}} brutalist buildings like the Central Library and has an extensive tower block demolition and renovation programme. There has been much redevelopment in the city centre in recent years, including the award-winning Future Systems' Selfridges building in the Bullring Shopping Centre, the Brindleyplace regeneration project, the Millennium Point science and technology centre, and the refurbishment of the iconic Rotunda building. Funding {{for many of these}} projects has come from the European Union; the Town Hall for example received Â£3million in funding from the European Regional Development Fund.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{treatment}} with low doses of streptozotocin induces hyperglycaemia with concomitant lymphocytic infiltrations into pancreatic islets (insulitis) in several mouse strains. The transfer of cellular immune <b>reactions</b> <b>against</b> islet cells {{by means of}} spleen cells was tested in two congeneic and five allogeneic strain combinations. Donor mice were treated on 5 consecutive days with 40 mg streptozotocin per kg body weight. Three weeks later, 5 x 10 (7) live spleen cells were transferred into thymusless recipient mice. Insulitis which had developed in about 70 % of the donors was only transferable from C 57 B 1 / 6 J to congeneic thymusless mice. In a second congeneic and in all allogeneic strain combinations, cellular immune <b>reactions</b> <b>against</b> pancreatic islets could not be transferred. In none of the recipients of spleen cells from diabetic donors was hyperglycaemia observed. As streptozotocin-induced cellular immune <b>reactions</b> <b>against</b> pancreatic islet cells were only transferable in one congeneic and in no allogeneic strain combinations, it is concluded {{that there is a}} genetic restriction both on the levels of donor and recipient mice...|$|R
5|$|The Robot Building, {{located in}} the Sathorn {{business}} district of Bangkok, Thailand, houses United Overseas Bank's Bangkok headquarters. It was designed for the Bank of Asia by Sumet Jumsai to reflect the computerization of banking; its architecture is a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> neoclassical and high-tech postmodern architecture. The building's features, such as progressively receding walls, antennas, and eyes, contribute to its robotic appearance and to its practical function. Completed in 1986, the building {{is one of the}} last examples of modern architecture in Bangkok.|$|E
5|$|The <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> {{the king}} {{at the general}} council had shown Atholl that James was {{not only on the}} back-foot but his {{political}} standing had received a huge set-back and may have convinced the earl that James's death was now a viable course of action. Atholl had seen how assertive action by two of his brothers at different times had allowed them {{to take control of the}} kingdom and that as James's nearest adult relative, the earl must have considered that decisive intervention on his part at this time could prove to be equally successful.|$|E
5|$|The sum of a {{geometric}} series {{is itself a}} result even older than Euler. A typical 18th-century derivation used a term-by-term manipulation similar to the algebraic proof given above, and as late as 1811, Bonnycastle's textbook An Introduction to Algebra uses such an argument for {{geometric series}} to justify the same maneuver on 0.999... A 19th-century <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> such liberal summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today: the sum of a series is defined to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums. A corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence; {{it can be found}} in any proof-based introduction to calculus or analysis.|$|E

5|$|After the Second Punic War, {{there was}} a great {{increase}} in income inequality. While the middle class was drafted to serve in increasingly long campaigns, their farms and homesteads fell into bankruptcy. And with Rome's great military victories, vast numbers of slaves were imported into Italy. In the middle of the second century BC, the tribunate of Tiberius Gracchus led to a breakup of the long-standing norms of the republican constitution. Graccus' legislation effectively established a parallel administration challenging the socio-political power of the old aristocracy and establishing a precedent that the popular assemblies could vote themselves whatever they wanted. His younger brother, Gaius Gracchus, further challenged the Senate's political preeminence, by threatening it with new judicial procedures. The Senate's violent <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> both the Gracchi, which led to their deaths, also served to legitimise the use of violence for political ends.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metal is {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal's origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. Most of the pioneers in the field were British; the first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue Ãyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with a raucous spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N' Roses rose to fame {{near the end of}} the decade with an image that was a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the glam metal aesthetic.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{the use of}} {{the flag}} and other {{national}} symbols has been relatively low for most of the time since the Second World Warâa <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the widespread use of flags by the Nazi Party and against the nationalistic furore of the Nazis in general. During the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Germany, public use of the national flag increased dramatically. Although this explosion in the flag's popularity was initially greeted by many Germans with a mixture of surprise and apprehension, the decades-old fear that German flag-waving and national pride was inextricably associated with its Nazi past was dismissed {{by the end of the}} tournament by Germans and non-Germans alike.|$|E

5|$|Punk {{was a form}} of rebellious {{rock that}} began in the 1970s, and was loud, aggressive, and often very simple. Punk began as a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the popular music of the period, {{especially}} disco and arena rock. American bands in the field included, most famously, The Ramones and Talking Heads, the latter playing a more avant-garde style that was closely associated with punk before evolving into mainstream new wave. Other major acts include Blondie, Patti Smith, and Television. In the 1980s some punk fans and bands became disillusioned with the growing popularity of the style, resulting in an even more aggressive style called hardcore punk. Hardcore {{was a form of}} sparse punk, consisting of short, fast, intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth, with such influential bands as Bad Religion, Bad Brains, Black Flag, Dead Kennedys, and Minor Threat. Hardcore began in metropolises like Washington, D.C., though most major American cities had their own local scenes in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Renaissance on ecclesiastical {{architecture}} {{can be seen in}} the re-adoption of low-massive church building with round arches and pillars, in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly dominant in England in the late Medieval era. It may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands, and was perhaps a conscious <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> English forms in favour of continental ones. It {{can be seen in the}} nave of Dunkeld Cathedral, begun in 1406, the facade of St Mary's, Haddington from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's Kings College, Aberdeen (1500â09). About forty collegiate churches were established in Scotland in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Many, like Trinity College, Edinburgh, showed a combination of Gothic and Renaissance styles. The early sixteenth century saw crown steeples built on churches with royal connections, symbolising imperial monarchy, as at St. Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh.|$|E
5|$|For six years, Tamar was a co-ruler {{with her}} father upon whose death, in 1184, Tamar {{continued}} as the sole monarch and was crowned a second time at the Gelati cathedral near Kutaisi, western Georgia. She inherited a relatively strong kingdom, but the centrifugal tendencies fostered by the great nobles were far from being quelled. There was considerable opposition to Tamar's succession; this was sparked by a <b>reaction</b> <b>against</b> the repressive policies of her father and encouraged by the new sovereign's other perceived weakness, her sex. As Georgia had never previously had a female ruler, {{a part of the}} aristocracy questioned Tamar's legitimacy, while others tried to exploit her youth and supposed weakness to assert greater autonomy for themselves. The energetic involvement of Tamar's influential aunt Rusudan and the Georgian Catholicos-Patriarch Michael IV Mirianisdze was crucial for legitimizing Tamar's succession to the throne. However, the young queen was forced into making significant concessions to the aristocracy. She had to reward the Catholicos-Patriarch Michael's support by making him a chancellor, thus placing him at the top of both the clerical and secular hierarchies.|$|E
