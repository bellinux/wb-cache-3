Her zombie-husband appears then, ties her and Jimmy and makes them {{sit in front of}} the fireplace, listening to fairy tales. Bill tries to get to the house through the garage, but the car starts by itself and the <b>rolling</b> <b>gate</b> of the garage closes. Bill, poisoned by the exhaust fumes, falls on the floor. At this time, Tobias arrives and frees Bill from the garage. They get into the house together, Bill starts to fight with the zombie, and Tobias brings the voodoo-doll of the zombie with him. Jimmy manages to throw it into the fire and the zombie burns and disappears. Todd is visited by the ghost or the zombie of his girlfriend Dana, who should be in the hospital. The zombie tries to kill him, but Claire rescues him. Bill tries to escape the house with his family, but Jessica is gone. Tobias finds her notes with the rules about the dollhouse, which say: [...] "My hand disappears in the fireplace". The men understand that the fireplace is a gateway to somewhere else. Bill goes first and Tobias follows. They get to the dollhouse, where Jessica is sitting on the floor, surrounded with bloody shells of voodoo-dolls. Monstrous demons, which Bill saw in his nightmares, have gotten out of the dolls and are about to attack the girl and her company. Tobias casts some kind of a protective spell, which allows Bill and Jessica to escape through a door. They get out, but Tobias is dragged by the demons and obviously killed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to minimize the}} weight of the gate by optimizing simultaneously the height of the floating tanks, the number of their watertight partitions and the gate scantling while considering the floating stability (Richir et al. 2006) The <b>rolling</b> <b>gate,</b> considered for this lock, has to float to be led into the port for maintenance or repairing operations. Two partitioned floating tanks are used inside the gate. Water ballast can be pumped from the floating tanks to float the structure or to restore the mass equilibrium in case of damage due to boat impact. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Fibre-reinforced {{polymers}} (FRPs) {{are becoming}} a more commonly used building material in many civil engineering applications including locks. One quality of FRPs {{is the fact that}} it has a high strength to weight ratio. By applying FRPs in rolling lock gate design, the self-weight of the gate could be significantly reduced. This in turn could lead to less wear-and-tear to the support carriages, mechanical parts and rails. Self-weight is also an important factor in the stability of a rolling lock gate. A minimum weight is required to counter the moment caused by horizontal loads during opening and closing. If FRPs were to be applied in rolling lock gates an optimization of lightweight versus stability will be required. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the technical feasibility of the FRP rolling lock gate and how the gates design is affected by the stability criteria. Also, the question remains if the FRP design can compete with traditional materials, for example steel. To quantify the problem a case study was chosen: New Lock Terneuzen. A rolling lock gate is set to be constructed to improve the connection between Ghent-Terneuzen. The rolling gates will be very large, with a span of 55 m and a height of approximately 26 m. Initially, the <b>rolling</b> <b>gate</b> is designed with a box shape. The global dimensions of the box gate are determined with a hand calculation based on the boundary conditions and design input from the chosen case study. Basic strength, deflection and stability checks are performed. The box gate is dimensioned in both FRP and steel. The following dimensions are found for the FRP box gate: Width of 8. 96 m, with retaining plates: skin: 280 mm, core: 200 mm and webs: skin: 200 mm, core: 200 mm. The dimensions found with the hand calculation serve as input for a 3 D model of the design. The model is created with Scia Engineer. With this software the gate is checked with finite element analysis. Some additional checks, fatigue and creep, are performed. The box gate model is adjusted to resemble the gate during movement. This is achieved by changing the supports, leaving the top right corner unsupported. In addition to a 3 D stability check of the designed box gate, the width between the supports, representing the carriage width, is varied (from 0. 5 to 12 m) and the impact on the stability is evaluated. This impact is quantified by the required dead weight to guarantee stability. All the results are used to come up with potential improvements or alternatives to the box gate design. The main objective being a gate with increased stability, which is again quantified by the overweight required. A number of ideas are discussed, where optimizing the shape of the gate is explored further. It is found that the required dead weight to achieve stability increased for all evaluated shapes. The main reason is the distribution of the stabilizing moment, which is split up in a horizontal and vertical component. The shape changes result in an shift from horizontal to vertical, which in turn results in more dead weight required to meet the stability criteria. The application of FRP in <b>rolling</b> <b>gate</b> design is technically feasible. However from a stability point of view it’s questionable if FRP is the better choice over traditional materials. In the chosen case study, the amount dead weight required to fulfil the stability criteria is significant, and the lightweight quality of FRP cannot be fully taken advantage of. Laminates are designed much thicker when compared to the dimensions required to meet strength and deflection criteria. In other words, material is added primarily for the sake of adding weight. Reducing the required dead weight was proven to be much harder than anticipated. Even though a wide base gives a larger arm for the vertical couple, which would lead to a smaller force at an equal moment, the required weight is not necessarily reduced. The applied loads, shape of the gate, location of supports and deflections all affect the distribution of loads over the supports, both horizontal and vertical, of the gate. In a structure of this scale, even small differences can have a significant impact on the stability of the gate and the dead weight required to achieve this stability. The required dead weight to meet the stability criteria must be brought down in order for FRP to be a viable option. <br/...|$|E
2500|$|Each chamber {{has three}} lateral water-saving basins, {{for a total}} of nine basins per lock and 18 basins in total.

40|$|Design of a {{lock gate}} for Nieuwe Zeesluis in IJmuiden becomes a {{challenge}} when the boundary conditions limit the {{choice for the}} conventional types of the gate. The available width of the lock does not allow a straight <b>rolling</b> <b>gate</b> to {{be considered as a}} possible alternative as it is in most similar cases. All the initial efforts of this study have been made in search of a new alternative to solve the space limit problem. After assessment of a number of feasible type of gates, finally, when the curved gate concept was introduced based on the concept of rolling gates and sliding gates, all the functional requirements of the design had to be met. This study investigates in three different structural alternatives for the curved gate in the concept development stage as well as three different operating systems and two different supporting systems. Based on certain design objectives, a final concept is chosen and is developed into a preliminary design. The design objective have been defined based a simple criteria of achieving the most benefit with the lowest investment possible. In this manner it is tried to increase the functionality of the design for gate structure. These objectives are basically: - Minimum use of movable devices - Minimum necessity of maintenance - Innovation - Simplicity The main challenge in the conceptual design is to find the optimum combination within the alternatives for the main compartments of the gate while every advantageous solution for a compartment, introduces a new problem in another. For making a better decision a framework is defined for the evaluation of the solutions and alternatives {{with the help of a}} score system which enables us to see which alternative is in line with the design objectives the most. Furthermore, the study presents a rather detailed design of certain compartments such as operational equipment, guidance devices, tracks, hydraulic bearings and sealing system. Structural and stability checks are done for the extreme load conditions, loads during the special combined movement and construction of the gate. This results in a preliminary design which is integrated and consistent in satisfying all the functional requirements of the design. The final and most important evaluation of the research study discusses the costs, safety, reliability and availability of the gate structure by means of a qualitative RAMS analysis accompanied by a cost comparison table. These two outcomes provide insight on applicability of the gate into the different situations but especially in this case study. This report will discuss the approach and steps in which the idea was developed and it answers the feasibility and applicability questions by the help of final results and evaluations. Report ends with presenting the conclusions of the work and giving a number of recommendations. Hydraulic StructuresHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Rijkswaterstaat {{asks whether}} and how {{navigation}} locks can be standardized and if it could result in cost savings. This graduation work focused on finding how one could standardize {{one part of the}} navigation locks, namely the lock gate. Besides, finding an innovative idea for the lock gate was also part of the agenda. This resulted in the design of a concrete modular <b>rolling</b> arc <b>gate.</b> The modular part as a means of standardizing the gate, by making it possible to install the gate at many different sites; the concrete and arc gate parts are the parts where innovation is applied. The most difficult part was to support the gate in the gate recesses {{in such a way that}} bending stresses were reduced to a minimum (creating an arch-like structure) without any extra mechanisms, to keep the gate light and thin. This was done by clamping the gate in the recess, which resulted in some contradicting demands. On the one hand, the gate needed to be flexible, so that it would bend enough to clamp in the recess, hence, a thin gate was required. On the other hand, the gate needed to be strong enough to bear the loads, hence, the gate needed to be thicker. The lock gate could not be as thin as required to reach the supports through bending and this concept was concluded technically unfeasible. It is however recommended to investigate the costs and benefits of a concrete modular gate design because this resulted in a relatively easy to build and maintain design (given that the supports had not been a problem).

(b) The rolling shutter used by sensors in these cameras also produces warping in the output frames (we have exagerrated the effect for illustrative purposes). (c) We use gyroscopes to measure the camera’s rotations during video capture. (d) We use the measured camera motion to stabilize the video and to rectify the <b>rolling</b> shutter. (Golden <b>Gate</b> photo courtesy of Salim Virji.) In this paper we present a robust, real-time video stabilization and rolling shutter correction technique based on commodity gyroscopes. First, we develop a unified algorithm for modeling camera motion and rolling shutter warping. We then present a novel framework for automatically calibrating the gyroscope and camera outputs from a single video capture. This calibration allows us to use only gyroscope data to effectively correct rolling shutter warping and to stabilize the video. Using our algorithm, we show results for videos featuring large moving foreground objects, parallax, and low-illumination. We also compare our method with commercial image-based stabilization algorithms. We find that our solution is more robust and computationally inexpensive. Finally, we implement our algorithm directly on a mobile phone. We demonstrate that by using the phone’s inbuilt gyroscope and GPU, we can remove camera shake and rolling shutter artifacts in real-time...|$|R
40|$|Ho Chi Minh City has to {{deal with}} severe {{flooding}} in the rainy season. To prevent the city from this flooding, MARD set up plan 1547. The main idea of the plan is to build a ring dike around HCMC in combination with several movable tidal barriers. One of these barriers is the Muong Chuoi Barrier. In this report a conceptual design of the Muong Chuoi Barrier is made. The structure consists of a movable tidal barrier and a navigation lock, both able to bear the water in both directions. The navigation lock provides a possibility of vessels passing when the barrier is closed. In the preliminary research information is gained about the location properties, the soil conditions, the hydraulic conditions and the shipping class, which results in a basis of design. An analysis of diffrent gate and foundation types give a number of possible alternatives. Vietnamese unit prices are investigated and used to make a proper cost estimation of the different alternatives. The most important requirements from the basis of design are: the normative high water level, the water discharge of the Muong Chuoi river, the shipping class, the number of vessels passing every day and minimum life span of the structure. After a selection between all the possible solutions, that follow from the preliminary research, four alternatives are worked out, which are a combination between two gate types, a lifting gate and a radial gate, and two foundation types, a caisson foundation and foundation with combi wall and underwater concrete. By means of structural calculations, the quantities of the materials used are determined. Based on these results and the unit prices from the preliminary research, a cost estimation of every alternative is made. In the multi criteria analysis for the barrier, the most important factor are the costs, its weighing factor is 50 %. Other criteria are: maintenance, constructability, usability and environmental impact. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is alternative D, the radial gate in combination the combi wall foundation. The study of alternatives for the navigation lock focuses only on the lock head. Again a selection is made between the possible solutions that follow from the preliminary research. Four types are selected for the multi criteria analysis: mitre gates, single leaf gates, lifting <b>gates</b> and <b>rolling</b> or sliding <b>gates.</b> One of the most important criteria for the navigation lock are cost (35 %). Also the usability (35 %) is considered to be important, in particular the locking cycle and reliability. After the multi criteria analysis, the best alternative is the single leave gate. A conceptual design for the lock is created. The inner dimensions of the lock chamber are determined, the structural elements are designed and an structural calculation of the single leave gate is made.
