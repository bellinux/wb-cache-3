40|$|Abstract From March 1980 to March 1987, 217 {{consecutive}} patients underwent 252 carotid <b>revascularisations</b> with routine use {{of continuous}} EEG monitoring and selective {{use of an}} intraluminal shunt for symptomatic (70 %) or asymptomatic (30 %) internal carotid artery (ICA) atherosclerotic stenosis. All carotid endarterectomies were routinely performed with a patch graft angioplasty. None of the patients suffered permanent or transient neurological deficits in the immediate postoperative period {{and none of them}} died. There was an 0. 8 % stroke rate and 0. 4 % mortality rate in the early postoperative course. Neurological assessment, Doppler and Echo doppler sonography of both the operated and the contralateral ICA was performed every 6 months. One-hundred and twenty-one patients (142 carotid <b>revascularisations)</b> operated on up to December 31 st 1985 were reassessed in July 1986. The mean follow-up time was 35 months (range: 6 months to 6 years). New neurological symptoms were present in 7. 4 % of the patients; 2. 5 % of patients developed a stroke and 8. 9 % showed progression of stenosis in the contralateral ICA. One patient had a common carotid artery stenosis 2 years after surgery. Re-stenosis of the ICA was found in two patients who underwent re-operation without difficulty. The late mortality was 21. 4 % (11. 9 % of the overall series). In only two patients (7. 6 %) was stroke the cause of death...|$|R
40|$|Background: Coronary artery {{bypass graft}} (CABG) and {{percutaneous}} <b>revascularisations</b> with implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES) are important treatment methods in {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD). Research questions: The evaluation addresses questions on medical efficacy, health economic parameters as well as ethic, social and legal implications {{in the use of}} DES vs. CABG in CHD patients. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in December 2006 in the most important electronic databases beginning from 2004. Register data and controlled clinical studies were included in the evaluation. Additionally, a health economic modelling was conducted. Results: Medical evaluation: The literature search yielded 2, 312 hits. 14 publications about six controlled clinical studies and five publications about two registers were included into the evaluation. Register data showed low mortality (0. 2 % to 0. 7 %) and low rates of myocardial infarction (0. 5 % to 1. 4 %) during hospital stay. In patients with stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery one study showed in several analyses a significantly higher rate of reinterventions and a significantly higher rate of repeated angina pectoris for DES up to two years after the implantation (16. 8 % vs. 3. 6 % and 35 % vs. 8 %). In patients with left main coronary artery stenosis two studies revealed a significantly higher survival without myocardial infarction and stroke for DES up to one year (96 % vs. 79 % and 95 % vs. 91 %) and two studies a significantly higher rate of <b>revascularisations</b> up to two years (20 % vs. 4 % and 25 % vs. 5 %) after the primary intervention. In patients with multivessel disease, one study found a significantly higher mortality and myocardial infarction rate for CABG at one year (2. 7 % vs. 1. 0 % and 4. 2 % vs. 1. 3 %). The rate of <b>revascularisations</b> was significantly higher in two studies up to two years after DES implantation (8. 5 % vs. 4. 2 % and 14. 2 % vs. 5. 3 %). The rate at repeated angina pectoris was significantly higher in one study in DES patients during two-years follow-up (28 % vs. 12 %). Health economic evaluation: The one-year total costs per patient after CABG were calculated to be 13, 373 euro and after DES 10, 443 euro, leading to a difference of 2, 930 euro in favour of DES implantation. The three-year total costs per patient after CABG were estimated to be 13, 675 euro and after DES 10, 989 euro, showing a cost difference of 2, 686 euro in favour of DES implantation. In the performed sensitivity analyses no break even point was reached. Discussion: Existing data should be viewed only as limited evidence for possible medical and health economic effects. Conclusions: There is limited evidence for the possible advantage of DES vs. CABG with respect to mortality and the rate of myocardial infarction in some indications as well as disadvantages with regard to the rate of <b>revascularisations</b> and the rate of repeated angina pectoris. Moreover there is also a limited evidence for possible economic advantage of DES vs. CABG in multivessel disease.

Despite the technological advances, ostial lesions still present a higher rate of immediate and late adverse events compared with non-ostial lesions. The objective of this study was to evaluate coronary ostial lesions treated with the Szabo technique. MethodsTen patients treated by PCI using the Szabo technique to treat ostial lesions in main coronary arteries between October and November, 2011, were included. Aorto-ostial lesions were excluded. ResultsOf the ten treated patients, seven were males, with ages ranging from 42 to 75 years, and 60 % had acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation. The circumflex artery was treated in six patients, and a 7 F catheter was used in eight patients. In three patients, both guidewires twisted during the advancement of the stent to the lesion, which was solved by partially retrieving and repositioning the standard target-vessel wire. Procedural success was observed in 90 % of the cases. There were no in-hospital deaths, (re) infarctions or emergency <b>revascularisations.</b> ConclusionsIn this study, the Szabo technique successfully treated ostial lesions in main coronary arteries and provided adequate positioning of the stent in most cases...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: NOBORI 1 was a multicentre, randomised (2 : 1), prospective, controlled, clinical trial which enrolled 363 patients (238 Nobori and 125 TAXUS) with up to two de novo lesions in two epicardial vessels. The primary endpoint was in-stent late loss at nine months, while secondary endpoints included safety and efficacy up to five years. At five years, clinical data were available for 350 patients (96 %). There were no differences in the composite of death and myocardial infarction (10. 9 % vs. 11. 2 %) and target lesion failure (9. 2 % and 10. 4 %), while ischaemia- and non-ischaemia-driven target lesion <b>revascularisations</b> were less frequent in the Nobori (6. 3 %) than in the TAXUS arm (16. 0 %). The rates of stent thrombosis (definite and probable according to the ARC definitions) were 0. 0 % and 3. 2 %, in the Nobori and TAXUS stents, respectively (p= 0. 014).

Methods A “SPECT-group” of 80 patients (15 female, 65 male; mean age 60 ± 9 years) and a “PET-group” of 70 patients (14 female, 56 male; mean age 57 ± 10 years) underwent a one day stress/rest examination either with attenuation-corrected 13 N-ammonia PET or attenuation-corrected 201 TlCl SPECT or 99 mTc-hexakis-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitril (MIBI) SPECT. PET and SPECT results were semiquantitatively graded using a 6 -segment heart model. All patients underwent CA, and stenoses were graded as a diameter reduction ≥ 50 %. Results Coronary findings between both groups did not significantly differ at CA. For the SPECT-group overall sensitivity and specificity for localisation of stenoses was 77 % and 84 %. Respective values for the PET-group were 97 % and 84 %. The specificity of MPI by SPECT in the detection of ischemia was 74 % and 91 % for MPI by PET.

40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{long-term}} outcome {{of patients who}} underwent radioactive stent (RS) implantation. Methods and results: The RS study population consisted of 133 consecutive patients who underwent RS implantation between November 1997 and July 2000. They were matched using the propensity score method with 266 patients who underwent bare metal stenting (BMS) in the same span. Long-term survival status and information on MACE (death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or any re-intervention) was retrospectively obtained. Eight-year cumulative survival (90. 2 % vs. 87. 4 %, p= 0. 57) was similar between the RS and BMS group respectively, while 8 -year cumulative MACE-free survival was significantly lower in RS patients (42. 1 % vs. 64. 3 %, p< 0. 001) due to the difference in events (mainly target lesion <b>revascularisations</b> [TLRs]) {{during the first year}} of follow-up (cumulative 1 -year MACE-free survival: 59. 4 % vs. 86. 7 %, p< 0. 001); there was no difference in the MACE rate after the first year (p= 0. 71). The TLR rate at six months in the RS group was 29. 3 %, mainly due to edge restenosis and at one year 36. 2 % (control group: 9. 5 %, p< 0. 001). Conclusions: A high incidence of MACE and re-intervention was observed during the first year following RS implantation, mainly related to TLR for edge restenosis.
