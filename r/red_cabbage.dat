Hall followed the Jackson/Seale structure, combining 1 Henry VI and 2 Henry VI into one play {{that all but}} eliminated 1 Henry VI, and following this with an edited version of 3 Henry VI. This production was noted for how it handled {{the violence of the}} play. The set was designed to look like an abattoir, but rather than attempt to present the violence realistically (as most productions do), Hall went in the other direction, presenting the violence symbolically. Whenever a character was decapitated or killed, a <b>red</b> <b>cabbage</b> was sliced up whilst the actor mimed the death beside it.|$|E

He introduced novel French flavours and cooking techniques to Polish cuisine, making it lighter and more moderate {{in the use of}} fat, sugar, vinegar, salt and expensive exotic spices.

5000|$|Various cabbage-based salads that {{resemble}} coleslaw are commonly {{served as a}} side dish with the second course at dinner, next to meat and potatoes. There is no fixed recipe, but typical ingredients include shredded white <b>cabbage</b> (<b>red</b> and Chinese <b>cabbage</b> are also not uncommon), finely chopped onions, shredded carrots, and parsley or dill leaves, with many possible additions. These are seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of sugar, and tossed with a dash of oil (typically sunflower or rapeseed) and vinegar, while mayonnaise-based dressings are uncommon. An alternative, usually served with fried fish, is made with sauerkraut, squeezed to get rid of excess salty brine and similarly tossed with carrots, onions, black pepper, sugar and oil.|$|R

2500|$|The {{color of}} red/purple {{beetroot}} {{is due to}} a variety of betalain pigments, unlike most other red plants, such as <b>red</b> <b>cabbage,</b> which contain anthocyanin pigments. The composition of different betalain pigments can vary, resulting in strains of beetroot which are yellow or other colors in addition to the familiar deep red. [...] Some of the betalains in beets are betanin, isobetanin, probetanin, and neobetanin (the red to violet ones are known collectively as betacyanin). Other pigments contained in beet are indicaxanthin and vulgaxanthins (yellow to orange pigments known as betaxanthins). Indicaxanthin has been shown as a powerful protective antioxidant for thalassemia and prevents the breakdown of alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E).|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed as}} if Malone wished to justify the preference, for the words were {{scarcely}} out of the speaker's mouth when Peter Augustus came up, all in grande tenue, gloved and scented, with his hair oiled and brushed to perfection, and bearing in one hand a huge bunch of cabbage-roses, five or six in full blow. These he presented to the heiress with a grace to which the most cunning pencil could do but defective justice. And who, after this, could dare to say that Peter was not a lady's man? He had gathered and he had given flowers; he had offered a sentimental, a poetic tribute at the shrine of Love or Mammon. Hercules holding the distaff was but a faint type of Peter bearing the roses. He must have thought this himself, for he seemed amazed at what he had done. He backed without a word; he was going away with a husky chuckle of self-satisfaction; then he bethought himself to stop and turn, to ascertain by ocular testimony that he really had presented a bouquet. Yes, there were the six <b>red</b> <b>cabbages</b> on the purple satin lap, a very white hand, with some gold rings on the fingers, slightly holding them together, and streaming ringlets, half hiding a laughing face, drooped over them. Only half hiding! Peter saw the laugh; it was unmistakable. He was made a joke of; his gallantry, his chivalry, were {{the subject of a}} jest for a petticoat--for two petticoats: Miss Helstone too was smiling. Moreover, he felt he was seen through, and Peter grew black as a thunder-cloud. When Shirley looked up, a fell eye was fastened on her. Malone, at least, had energy enough in hate. She saw it in his glance.|$|R

The fire was lit in a platform of brick, raised in the centre of the floor: the sky was visible through the chimney, which, although of a great breadth below, gradually narrowed to the top. A family of wandering Bohemians, consisting of the father and mother and three children, were seated on the platform when Vivian entered; the man was playing on a coarse wooden harp, without which the Bohemians seldom travel. The music ceased as the new guests came into the room, and the Bohemian courteously offered his place at the fire to our hero, who, however, declined disturbing the family group. A small table and a couple of chairs were placed {{in a corner of the}} room by the innkeeper's wife, a bustling active dame, who apparently found no difficulty in laying the cloth, dusting the furniture, and cooking the supper at the same time.

40|$|Background: Preterm {{birth is}} one of the leading causes of {{neonatal}} morbidity in the United States. Despite decades of research, the etiology is largely unknown. Objective: The purpose of our study was to examine the association betweenmaternal dietary patterns during pregnancy and preterm birth. Methods: This prospective cohort study used data from the PIN (Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition) study (n = 3143). Dietary intake was assessed at 26 – 29 wk of gestation by using a food-frequency questionnaire, and patterns were derived by using factor analysis and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Associations between dietary patterns and preterm birth were assessed by logistic regression. Results: Four dietary patterns were identified from the factor analysis characterized by high intakes of the following: 1) fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, high-fiber and fortified cereals, nonfried chicken and fish, and wheat bread; 2) beans, corn, French fries, hamburgers or cheeseburgers, white potatoes, fried chicken, mixed dishes, and ice cream; 3) collard greens, coleslaw or <b>cabbage,</b> <b>red</b> and processed meats, cornbread or hushpuppies, whole milk, and vitamin C–rich drinks; and 4) shellfish, pizza, salty snacks, and refined grains.
