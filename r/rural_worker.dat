40|$|Benefits of {{crowdsourcing}} {{tasks are}} largely reaped by urban rather than <b>rural</b> <b>workers.</b> Even if <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> could access these web portals, tasks are in general elementary. This research aims {{to see whether}} rural crowdsourcing workers' digital imaging ability is better than urban workers, and whether creative ability leads to better imaging ability. Understanding this comparative scenario along with contextual factors (such as confidence level of manager on workers, job satisfaction and work situation) influencing these parameters helps to crowdsourcing skillful computational digital imaging jobs to <b>rural</b> <b>workers.</b> These understandings were studied by collecting data from 120 IT workers (60 each from semi-urban and rural areas) located in six states of India. Statistical analyses show that urban BPO workers’ were better than <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> only in 2 D digital imaging ability (not in 3 D ability), but <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> were better in Torrance Tests of Creativity Thinking (TTCT) test. Association between worker’s creativity and manager assessment is not aligned for <b>rural</b> <b>workers.</b> In contradict to expectation, the findings show that workers with low job satisfaction and excellent work circumstances lead to possess high creativity skills in TTCT creativity score. Next steps involve improving digital imaging and creativity abilities of workers, and aligning manager conviction on worker’s creativity...|$|R

40|$|Background. Mobile <b>Rural</b> <b>Workers</b> {{have been}} widely concern as {{potential}} source of new HIV infections in China, {{due to the nature}} of the mobility and magnitude of the population. Objective. The study aimed at assessing disparities between mobile <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> and local residents in HIV-related vulnerability by exploring important contextual factors contributing to the disparities. Method. A sample of 134 mobile <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> and 127 local residents were systematically recruited into a cross-sectional study. All 261 participants responded to a close-ended questionnaire and 24 attended a Focus Group Discussion. Information on HIV-related knowledge, attitude and perception, risk behaviors, mobility status as well as socio-economic status were collected and analyzed. Result. Adjusted for sex, age and education, mobile <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> were more likely to have lower income (OR = 3. 06, 95 % CI: 1. 31 - 7. 18), no medical insurance (OR = 6. 58, 95 % CI: 2. 95 - 14. 71), less social support (OR = 2. 13, 95 % CI: 1. 04 - 4. 33), and poor knowledge on HIV (OR = 2. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 05 - 5. 99), compared to local residents. However, mobile <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> were less likely to have multi-partners than their local counterparts (OR = 0. 3, 95 % CI: 0. 11 - 0. 84). Among the mobile rural labors, females were more likely to be less paid (OR= 7. 69, 95 % CI: 2. 17 - 25), and less likely to get access to condom (OR= 4. 25, 95 % CI: 1. 64 – 11. 00) compare to males. Differences in income, social support and condom access between mobile <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> and local residents were much larger in female group. No female mobile worker reported multipartnership in the study. Conclusion. Compared to local residents in Beijing, mobile <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> were more vulnerable to HIV infection in terms of economic constraints, access to medical services and insurance, social support and HIV-related information and knowledge. Gender disparity predisposed woman mobile workers for higher level of vulnerability. Marginalization of mobile <b>rural</b> <b>workers</b> poses potential threat to HIV/AIDS prevention, and should be averted by addressing inequity during the process of economic development and socio-cultural transition at host communities...|$|R
