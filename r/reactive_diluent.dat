40|$|Summary. Within these {{investigations}} a new monomer for-mulation – {{consisting of a}} biodegradable basis monomer, <b>reactive</b> <b>diluents,</b> fillers, and an appropriate photoinitiator – was developed for the stereolithographic fabrication of bone replacement materials. In the current paper we describe the testing of several acrylate based <b>reactive</b> <b>diluents</b> – having different functional groups – concerning reactivity, biocom-patibility, and mechanical properties. Polymers from tripro-pylene glycol diacrylate, propoxylated glycerol diacrylate and tricyclodecan dimethanol diacrylate showed the most pro-mising results regarding these 3 criteria.

50|$|Diluents (or thinners) {{are usually}} added to {{lacquers}} {{to reduce their}} viscosity (they are used to adjust the rheology). In thermal cured lacquers, such diluents added are volatile substances which evaporate from the lacquer during drying. In the case of radiation-curing lacquers (for example UV lacquers), those diluents should be avoided. The addition of <b>reactive</b> <b>diluents</b> facilitates the processing of the lacquers, allows the addition of more fillers and improves the wetting behavior on the substrate. If volatile diluents are replaced by <b>reactive</b> <b>diluents,</b> flammability, smell, skin irritation and environmental compatibility (by lower or no VOC emissions) can be improved.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} hyperbranched aliphatic-aromatic polyesters has been {{synthesized}} which contain vinyl ether or oxetane functionalities as curable groups. We investigated the curing behavior of these multifunctional polymers {{in the presence}} of reactive diluents in order to analyze the possibility of their application in high solids coatings. The vinyl ether-modified hyperbranched polyesters {{with a high degree of}} modification yield the best coatings. Furthermore, coating systems containing vinyl ether-modified hyperbranched polyesters and triethyleneglycol divinyl ether (DVE- 3) as <b>reactive</b> <b>diluent</b> showed a better performance compared to those containing 4 -hydroxybutyl vinyl ether (HBVE).

On the other hand, the curing reaction of the functional hyperbranched polymers without the presence of any <b>reactive</b> <b>diluent</b> stopped at 32 % conversion of functional groups due to the reduced mobility of the polymer.

40|$|This work {{describes}} how a fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) {{derived from a}} vegetable oil can be introduced as <b>reactive</b> <b>diluent</b> in a solvent-borne thermally cured coil-coating system. The evaluated <b>reactive</b> <b>diluent,</b> rape seed methyl ester (RME), has been evaluated both in a fully formulated clear coat system and via model studies. A <b>reactive</b> <b>diluent</b> {{is a compound that}} acts as a solvent in the liquid paint, lowering the viscosity, and chemically reacts into the final film during cure. Introduction of a <b>reactive</b> <b>diluent</b> derived from vegetable oil give a more environmental compliant coating since a renewable material is incorporated in the coating and the amount of traditional solvent can be decreased. These positive environmental factors have increased the industrial interest. The fully formulated clear coat studies {{describes how}} addition of <b>reactive</b> <b>diluent</b> affects rheological properties of the wet paint, film formation, incorporation, and final film properties in a hydroxyl-functional polyester/melamine coil-coating system. The coating were cured under industrial coil-coating cure conditions and analyzed with Raman, carbon- 14 dating, extraction, dynamic mechanical analysis, and visually observed. Viscosity measurement of the wet paint show that RME works as a diluent. RME increase the mobility in the system enhancing the film formation process and occurrence of defect-free films. The incorporation of RME could not be confirmed by Raman analysis. However, carbon- 14 dating did indicate the presence of RME that could not be extracted from the films. The appearance and mechanical properties of the films were also significantly affected by addition of RME. Dynamic mechanical analysis of the free standing films showed that the final film properties were affected by oven temperature, choice of co-solvent, and flash-off period. Model studies were performed to further clarify how RME chemically can react through transesterification with the hydroxyl-groups of the polyester. RME and its two main components methyl oleate and methyl linoleate were reacted with primary alcohols with and without tertiary hydrogen both under low temperature (110, 130, 150, 170 °C) and industrial cure conditions. The transesterification reaction was monitored with 1 H-NMR and real time IR. Evaporation and side reactions, e. g. oxidation, are competing factors with the transesterification reaction. The fatty acid structure affects the conversion as a higher amount of unsaturations triggers higher degree of oxidation. The study also showed that reaction time and temperature affects the transesterification conversion, degree of side reactions, and catalyst choice. QC 2010111...|$|E
