Za dodatno homogenizacijo in redukcijo oksidov smo sintetiziran vzorec znane sestave segrevali v cevni peči pri temperaturi 850 °C in času 12 ur v redukcijski atmosferi Ar/H 2. Nanodelci imajo zadovoljivo Curiejevo temperaturo, ki je primerna za uporabo v samoregulativni magnetni hipertermiji. Želeli smo združiti dva terapevtska pristopa, in sicer magnetno hipertermijo in farmakoterapevtsko zdravljenje. Glavni cilj je bil sintetizirane nanodelce napolniti z zdravilnimi učinkovinami (ZU). ZU (paracetamol, bupivakain hidroklorid in pentoksifilin) smo uspešno vgradili v pore nanodelcev v matrici silike. S pomočjo UV/Vis spektrofotometra smo spremljali sproščanje ZU iz superparamagnetnih nanodelcev. Vsak vzorec smo sproščali v vsaj dveh paralelkah po 180 minut. Pomerjene {{absorbance}} smo preračunali v koncentracije oziroma deleže sproščenih ZU po določenih časovnih intervalih. Sintetizirane nanodelce sestave Cu 32, 5 Ni 67, 5 smo okarakterizirali s pomočjo rentgenske praškovne difrakcije (RTG), termogravimetrične analize (TGA/SDTA), Fourier transformirane infrardeče spektroskopije (FTIR), transmisijske elektronske mikroskopije (TEM) in magnetnih meritev. Površino, volumen in velikost por smo določili z BET analizo. Curiejevo temperaturo smo določili s pomočjo termogravimetrične aparature (TGA/SDTA), ki smo jo opremili s permanentnim magnetom. Superparamagnetni nanodelci so uporabni na področju magnetne hipertermije, kot tudi na področju aktivnega farmakoterapevtskega zdravljenja. The {{aim of this}} master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis was {{to synthesize}} superparamagnetic nanoparticles with the composition Cu 32, 5 N 67, 5 in a silica matrix with narrow size distribution by sol-gel method. Following additional homogenization and oxidation-reduction, the synthesized specimen of known composition was heated in a tube furnace at 850 °C for 12 hours in an Ar/H 2 reduction atmosphere. The nanoparticles possess a satisfactory Curie temperature, suitable for use in self-regulatory magnetic hyperthermia. We wanted to combine two therapeutic approaches: magnetic hyperthermia and pharmaco-therapeutic therapy. The main objective was to charge nanoparticles with active substances. Furthermore, these active substances (paracetamol, bupivacaine hydrochloride and pentoxifylline) were successfully introduced into pores of nanoparticles in silica matrix. We closely followed the release of active substances from superparamagnetic nanoparticles using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Every specimen was released {{in at least two}} replicates 180 minutes each. Measured absorbance values were converted into concentrations and proportions of <b>released</b> <b>active</b> <b>substances</b> after specified time intervals, respectively. Synthesized nanoparticles with the composition Cu 32, 5 N 67, 5 were characterized using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/SDTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and magnetic measurements. The surface, volume and size of pores were defined with the BET analysis. Furthermore, the Curie temperature was determined with the thermogravimetric apparatus (TGA/SDTA), equipped with a permanent magnet. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are applicable in the field of magnetic hyperthermia, {{as well as in the}} field of active pharmaco-therapeutic therapy...|$|E

No important differences in gastro-intestinal processing of enteric coated products have been found between the dog and the human. The difference between both forms resides is the gastric processing. Monolithic forms are retained until the stomach is empty and are expelled by the housekeeper waves. The disperse forms, after desintegration, are treated as liquids and pass the pylorus gradually. This results in unpredictable gastric passage and effective plasma concentrations.

Most of these depots contain benzyl alcohol (BOH) to facilitate the production and administration. Because BOH changes the solubility of components in both the body fluid and the oil formulation, it is relevant to know {{the change in the}} BOH concentration in the oil over time. In this study, volunteers were subcutaneously injected with an oil depot that contained 10 % BOH, nandrolone decanoate, and cholecalciferol. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of BOH and its metabolites benzoic acid and hippuric acid simultaneously in serum to estimate the BOH release out of the depot. For this, an HPLC bioassay was developed and adequately validated. Hereafter, the bioassay was applied to serum samples obtained at several time points between 0 and 35 days. BOH appeared immediately in serum after injection. The pharmacokinetic profile revealed that all BOH was depleted from the depot within 52 h after injection.

In this study, a conjugate of 3 -hydroxybutyric acid oligomers with a carboxylic acid group-bearing model drug (ibuprofen) was evaluated in vivo as a potential pro-drug for parenteral administration. Two different formulations, an oily solution and an o/w emulsion were prepared and administered intramuscularly (IM) to rabbits in a dose corresponding to 40  mg of ibuprofen/kilogramme. The concentration of ibuprofen in blood plasma was analysed by HPLC, following solid–phase extraction and using indometacin as internal standard (detection limit, 0. 05  μg/ml). No significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, Tmax, AUC) were observed between the two tested formulations of the 3 -hydroxybutyric acid conjugate. In comparison to the non-conjugated drug in oily solution, the relative bioavailability of ibuprofen conjugates from oily solution, and o/w emulsion was reduced to 17 % and 10 %, respectively.

In addition, in our work, Eudragit RL and Eudragit RS were included in the composition of some formulations, as well as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80. As part of the study of the dissolution test, the similarity coefficient (f 2) for the obtained profiles was calculated, and mathematic models were used to estimate the kinetics and mechanism of <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> <b>release.</b> In our work, it was observed that the inclusion of polymer Eudragit FS alone in the tablet composition ensured a modified <b>release</b> of the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> for 10 h. After this time period, the amount of metronidazole determined in the acceptor fluid was 71 % - 81 % of the declared dose. Modification of the composition by the addition of surfactants resulted in an increased <b>release</b> of the <b>active</b> <b>substance</b> of up to 98 %. This effect was dependent on the type of surfactant and its quantitative ratio to the Eudragit FS. Similar release profiles were obtained for tablets containing Eudragit RS and sodium lauryl sulfate, as well as Eudragit RS and polysorbate 80. Depending on the composition of tablets, metronidazole release proceeded in accordance with either first or second-order kinetics. We calculated as well, that the differing masses of Eudragit FS in the studied formulations correlates with the order of release kinetics (p < 0. 002). Such an effect was validated using the Weibull model, wherein, in all the studied formulations, the release rate was seen as a decreasing function of time.

Nevertheless, the oral or systemic administration of such drugs is hindered by numerous side effects, which could be overcome by their intra-articular (i-a.) administration as dosage forms capable of gradually <b>releasing</b> the <b>active</b> <b>substance.</b> The present review article summarises the research done in the field of drug delivery systems for i-a. injection vs. current management of osteoarthritis or {{rheumatoid arthritis}}. Aspects such as the influence of size, shape, polymer matrix or targeted drug on the i-a. retention time, phagocytosis and biological activity will be discussed. Finally, we will comment on the need for adapted delivery systems for the novel and very potent anti-inflammatory drugs, such as inhibitors of the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase or the IL- 1 beta conversion enzyme, which to date cannot be properly used due to the severe side effects associated with their systemic administration...|$|R

Microencapsulation of highly-water soluble drugs is a challenge especially if low molecular weight component must be encapsulated. The high hygroscopicity of the currently produced cardioprotective drug mildronate (3 -(2, 2, 2 - trimethylhydrazinium) propionate dihydrate) defines additional requirements to both the packaging material and the storage conditions that is why up to now only conventional dosage forms of mildronate – capsules and sterile solution – are manufactured. Taking into account growing interest in prolonged administration of mildronate {{an attempt was made}} to prepare modified release form of the drug. An appropriate selection of the polymer matrix is necessary in order to develop successful {{drug delivery}} system. In the present study polylactide (PLA), polystyrene (PS) and polyhydroxybutyrte (PHB) were tested for controlled delivery of highlywater soluble mildronate. The effect of polymer choice on the final product was investigated and <b>release</b> rate of <b>active</b> component from microparticles was evaluated...|$|R
