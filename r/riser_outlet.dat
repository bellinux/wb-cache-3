50|$|An {{investigation}} into the fire {{found that there was}} no dry <b>riser</b> <b>outlet</b> on the 14th floor of the building as they were only located on alternate floors. The firefighters connected to the dry riser on the 13th floor, but then to fight the location of the fire, the hose had to pass through firedoors, which were then kept open. This led to the fire to have more oxygen {{due to the fact that}} compartmentation was not achieved. The two firefighters died when they got tangled in cable trays which were attached to the ceiling with plastic hooks which melted. The melting of plastic hooks was also listed as the cause for the death of two other firefighters during another tower block fire in Southampton five years later. It was after these subsequent deaths that changes to Building Regulations was imposed, namely to BS 7671, which covers electrical installations in the UK, and apply to the use of fire resistant cables in escape routes fixed to walls and ceilings, which came into force in July 2015. The regulation was not a retrospective one, meaning that it will only be enforceable on all new builds and not refurbishments.|$|E

The model is directed towards industrial sized units such as boilers and gasifiers and includes the entire CFB loop. Different solid fractions, particle size distributions, particle interaction and back-flow effects at the <b>riser</b> <b>outlet</b> are considered. Results from the model show good agreement with experimental data from large-scale CFB boilers (ranging from 12 to 226 MWth).

40|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC) riser reactors have complex hydrodynamics, which depend {{not only on}} operating conditions, feedstock quality, and catalyst particles characteristics, {{but also on the}} geometric configurations of the reactor. This paper presents a numerical study of the influence of different <b>riser</b> <b>outlet</b> designs on the dynamic of the flow and reactor efficiency. A three-dimensional, three-phase flow model and a four-lump kinetic scheme were used to predict the performance of the reactor. The phenomenon of vaporization of the liquid oil droplets was also analyzed. Results showed that small changes in the outlet configuration had a significant effect on the flow patterns and consequently, on the reaction yields...|$|E

The {{system is designed}} hydraulically such that controlled movement of a plug in the pipe distributes water sequentially to consecutive borders. The outlets operate hydraulically like weirs at heads below 80 mm. Belled-ends on the outlets increases their capacity 75 % at low heads.

The estimated junction loss coefficients have shown negligible variation with the temperature.|$|R
40|$|Permian evaporites of the Castile Formation crop {{out over}} ~ 1, 800 km 2 {{in the western}} Delaware Basin (Eddy County, New Mexico and Culberson County, Texas, USA) with {{abundant}} and diverse karst manifestations. Epigene karst occurs as well-developed karren on exposed bedrock, while sinkholes dominate the erosional landscape, including both solutional and collapse forms. Sinkhole analyses suggest {{that more than half}} of all sinks are the result of upward stoping of subsurface voids, while many solutional sinks are commonly the result of overprinting of collapsed forms. Epigene caves are laterally limited with rapid aperture decreases away from insurgence, with passages developed along fractures and anticline fold axes. Hypogene karst occurs as diverse manifestations, forming the deepest and longest caves within the region as well as abundant zones of brecciation. Hypogene caves exhibit a wide range of morphologies from complex maze and anastomotic patterns to simple, steeply dipping patterns, but all hypogene caves exhibit morphologic features (i. e. <b>risers,</b> <b>outlet</b> cupolas and half-tubes) that provide a definitive suite of evidence of dissolution within a mixed convection (forced and free convection) hydrologic system. Extensive blanket breccias, abundant breccia pipes and numerous occurrences of calcitized evaporites indicate widespread hypogene speleogenesis throughout the entire Castile Formation. Although most cave and karst development within the Castile outcrop region appears to have hypogene origins, epigene processes are actively overprinting features, creating a complex speleogenetic evolution within the Castile Formation...|$|R
40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of the Lukoil Neftochim Bulgaria FCC unit variables on FCC gasoline qualitywhile employing an octane-barrel catalyst. It was found that research octane number of the FCC gasoline directlycorrelated with the <b>riser</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature (ROT). FCC gasoline was found to consist of higher octane low boiling(that boil in the range 40 - 60 oC) and high boiling components (that boil in the range 160 - 200 oC). The high octanelow boiling components are mainly olefins, whereas the high octane high boiling components are mainlyaromatics. The raise of ROT leads to increase of ratio of β-cracking relative to hydrogen transfer which results inenhancement of the lower molecular hydrocarbon content in the FCC gasoline...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified multi model predictive control algorithm {{for the control}} of <b>riser</b> <b>outlet</b> temperature and regenerator temperature for the fluid catalytic cracking unit (FCCU). The models of the fluid catalytic cracking unit are estimated using subspace identification (N 4 SID) algorithm. The PRBS signal is applied as an input signal to estimate the FCCU models. Since the estimated model does not give 100 % fit; especially for nonlinear systems having more than one operating conditions, multi-model approach is proposed. In multi model, more than one model of FCCU used in MPC design. The main advantages of proposed method are that it can handle hard input and output constraints {{and it can be}} used for multi input multi output processes (MIMO) without increasing the complexity in control design. MATLAB/Simulink is used to estimate the models of FCCU and simulate the results for the controller. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm provides better result for both reference tracking and disturbance rejection. Comment: 7 pages, 12 figure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Riser</b> <b>outlet</b> effects {{induced by}} an L-outlet and by abrupt T-outlets with {{different}} extension heights and outlet surface areas are studied experimentally and computationally. Experiments {{are carried out}} in a cold flow riser. The cold flow riser has a diameter of 0. 1 m and a height of 8. 765 m and is operated in the dilute flow regime with a superficial gas velocity of 2. 48 - 7. 43 m/s and a solids flux of 3. 0 kg/m²/s. Particle velocities are measured using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA). Vortex formation in the extension part of the riser is observed. The vortex circulates the solids along the wall opposite to the outlet, thus inducing a solids reflux. The flow pattern upstream the outlet is, however, hardly affected in the small diameter riser. The vortex position and length {{are affected by the}} extension height, but hardly by the outlet surface area and the superficial gas velocity. The use of an L-outlet significantly reduces the vortex formation. The experimental measurements are used to validate a 3 D Eulerian–Eulerian and Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow (KTGF) based gas–solid flow model. In general, the calculated trends are qualitatively in agreement with the experimentally observed phenomena. The exact shape of the vortex is not always accurately predicted...|$|E

40|$|Suburban {{development}} of Gwinnett County has surrounded {{many of the}} flood control watershed dams that {{were built in the}} mid- 1900 s. In many cases, the watersheds and downstream reaches have developed significantly since the time of construction. Development has changed the runoff characteristics of the watershed and many homes are now in the breach zones of these dams. The spillways of many of these dams cannot safely pass flood flows based on current design standards required by the State of Georgia Rules for Dam Safety or the NRCS design criteria for high hazard dams. The Yellow River Watershed Dam No. 14 (Y- 14) is the first of the watershed dams to be upgraded in Gwinnett County. Y- 14 was originally constructed in 1967 by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS – currently the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service or NRCS) to control drainage from a 3. 1 square mile watershed. The structure has a 40 feet high embankment dam, a traditional SCS principal spillway structure with a <b>riser</b> tower and <b>outlet</b> pipe, and a 50 ft. wide earthen auxiliary spillway through a saddle on the left abutment. In 2003, the dam was upgraded to bring it into compliance with modern standards by constructing a new Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) Stepped Spillway on top of the embankment dam and decommissioning the original auxiliary spillway. This paper describes the evaluation of the original dam and the design of the upgrades to the dam. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S.

30|$|Fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (FCC), {{one of the}} most important conversion processes used in petroleum refineries, transforms the low-value heavy crude oil into a variety of high-value-added light oil products. Up to now, the total capacity of FCC units (FCCUs) in China has reached 150 Mt/a, of which the outputs roughly account for 70  %, 40  % and 30  % of gasoline, propylene and diesel pools, respectively. However, in recent years, the reaction temperature and cracking degree have increased to a large extent with the feedstocks becoming heavier and inferior. As a result, the incidental high coke formation rate may threaten the operation safety in some refineries. Two factors contribute to the coke formation: (1) long residence time of the mixture of oil, gas and catalysts in the separator and (2) the severe back-mixing of oil gas in the disengager (Li et al. 2011; Karthika et al. 2012; Xu 2014; Gao et al. 2013; Dong et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2016). To solve these problems, a series of efficient separation systems at the <b>riser</b> <b>outlet</b> have been developed. These separation systems concentrate on separating the production and catalysts as soon as possible. Besides, they should reduce the residence time of oil gas in the reaction systems (gas–solid separation unit and disengager) simultaneously. Technologies which can simultaneously realize quick mixture separation and reduce oil gas residence time in the reaction system have been studied. Results show that the separation systems have brought huge economic benefit for chemical industries all around the world.|$|E
40|$|Since the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) {{has been}} {{conceptualized}} {{in the frame}} of GEN IV International Forum (GIF), ENEA is strongly involved on the HLM technology development. Currently ENEA has implemented large competencies and capabilities in the field of HLM thermal-hydraulic, coolant technology, material for high temperature applications, corrosion and material protection, heat transfer and removal, component development and testing, remote maintenance, procedure definition and coolant handling. In this frame the CIRCE pool facility has been refurbished to host a suitable test section able to thermal-hydraulically simulate the primary system of a HLM cooled pool reactor. In particular a fuel pin bundle simulator (FPS) has been installed in the CIRCE pool. It has been conceived with a thermal power of about 1 MW and a linear power up to 25 kW/m, relevant values for a LMFR. It consist of 37 fuel pins (electrically simulated) placed on a hexagonal lattice. The LBE, heated by the FPS, flows up through the riser, reaching the Heat Exchanger (HX) inlet though a gas separator placed in the tank upper zone. The primary fluid circulation occurs employing a gas lift system which injects Argon from a nozzle connected to the riser entrance, enhancing the LBE flow. The heat exchanger represents the heat sink of the system and it is designed to have a thermal duty of about 800 kW; it consists of 91 double-wall bayonet tubes (with helium gap) fed by low pressure boiling water. Finally the decay heat removal system (DHR), designed to remove 40 kW and uncoupled from the main flow path. It consists of a bayonet element in which the air is injected from the top, flows downward through the inner tube and then flows upward through the annular region, where heat is removed from primary LBE side. The bayonet element is placed into a suitable shell thermally insulated from the external pool. LBE enters into the shell from the top and flows downwards in a counter flow heat exchanger configuration. The experimental campaign was designed to study the PLOHS+LOF accident, with decay heat removed by the DHR-system. This paper reports the experimental data as well as a preliminary analysis and discussion of the results, focusing on the most relevant tests of the campaign, namely Test IV Temperatures along the three sections of the FPS were reported and the Nusselt number in the FPS sub-channels was investigated. Moreover, the void fraction in the riser was computed and the <b>riser</b> inlet and <b>outlet</b> average temperatures were discussed. Concerning the HX, temperature measurements in the sub-channels were presented, as well as temperatures at the inlet and outlet sections. For the DHR-system, temperatures at the entrance and exit section were analyzed both for the primary lead bismuth eutectic (LBE) circuit and for the secondary air side, estimating the thermal power removed by DHR under the formulated accidental scenario. Finally system codes thermal hydraulics analyses performed adopting the RELAP 5 /Mod 3. 3 are presented. A comparison with the data obtained from preliminary experimental tests is presented...|$|R
