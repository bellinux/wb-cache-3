50|$|A Seven's {{top speed}} greatly {{depends upon the}} body configuration, engine power and gearing. Early models with low-powered engines had {{difficulty}} exceeding 90 mi/h km/h, although a race-prepared Seven was clocked at 127 mi/h km/h by Brausch Niemann through a speed-trap at the 1962 Natal Grand Prix. In addition, clamshell style wings tend to create drag and generate lift at higher speeds. Cycle guards help alleviate this tendency, and low height Brookland aeroscreens that replace the windscreen help improve top end speed. Sevens do suffer from front end lift at high speed, the nose creates more lift than downforce at speeds over around 70 mi/h km/h, although <b>retro</b> <b>fitted</b> 'winglets' may counter this lift.|$|R
5000|$|Taylor uses {{their own}} pickup system, the [...] "Expression System," [...] which {{consists}} of a humbucking induction pickup mounted in the neck {{and a pair of}} dynamic soundboard transducers wired to an onboard preamplifier designed by Rupert Neve. The entry-level 100 and 200 series use an externally similar system known as ES-T, which uses a single under-saddle pickup and no soundboard transducers. The first generation ES system was introduced in 2004. It had 2 transducers: one mounted to the bridge, and one on the lower bout of the sound board. Also, it had a small single coil neck pickup mounted in the neck joint. All wired to the onboard preamp which has 3 knobs for volume, tone, and blend. This early ES system and was available on the higher end models 500 series and above as well as the 30th anniversary limited edition series starting in the fall of 2004.

While one source states that this package is not available as a <b>retro</b> <b>fit</b> to previously delivered engines, Rolls Royce told Aviation Week and Space Technology that the upgrades were intended in most cases for both new engines and as retrofits. This upgrade is based on advancements made during {{the development of the}} Trent XWB (for the Airbus A350 XWB) and matches improvements made for the Trent 700 called the Trent 700EP.

5000|$|The tour used seven {{individual}} rigs for {{performers and}} props to become airborne. For dancers to be flown {{to the center}} of each upstage, a wench, which dropped 18 inches {{off the face of the}} panel, was placed in the rig. Cyrus' flying required two wenches, one for a vertical lift and one for a horizontal move that coursed the audience and back to the stage. Four elevators, or trap doors, were located throughout the stage, some of which had the option of a 4×4 or an 8×8 foot opening. All of the fly rigs and elevators were built and operated by Show Group Production Services (SGPS)/Showrig. The challenge that presented the most difficulty for SGPS was time constraint, as there were only three weeks of rehearsal. Brian White, co-owner of SGPS, explained, There wasn’t a lot of time, but the good news was that it was at the L.A. Forum, which gave us a lot of height to fly things around, and there was also a lot of room to lay stuff out on the floor. The other good thing was that our offices are only 10 minutes away. So if I had to send a welder down there to make some changes I could do it pretty fast. The biggest thing we had going for us was a great crew. We had some really good people out there." ... I’d say that about 90 percent of what we built on Miley Cyrus fit the first time in rehearsal. The only reason we had to <b>retro</b> <b>fit</b> anything was because of last minute design changes that came about once everything was up and they could see it all.|$|E

40|$|The {{first flight}} of the EZ-Rocket, a rocket-powered {{airplane}} built by XCOR Aerospace, occurred on July 21, 2001. The EZ-Rocket {{is based on a}} <b>retro</b> <b>fitted</b> Long-EZ homebuilt air frame; its engines and propulsion system, which utilize non-toxic, easy-to-handle propellants, were developed in-house from clean paper to manned flight operations in fewer than ten months, and for less than $ 500, 000. The aircraft has taught the COR team rocket flight operations, and demonstrated that non-toxic propellants are reliable and inexpensive. Based on this demonstration vehicle, XCOR is ready to start the next incremental development in airframe and rocket engine capability, the Xerus vehicle. The Xerus will be able to fly a suborbital trajectory and deploy an expendable upper stage that will put 10 kgmicrosatellites into low Earth orbit. Without the upper stage, the Xerus could carry 250 kg for four minutes of high-quality microgravity flight. This paper will describe the current status and lessons learned in the precursor vehicle test program and engine development program, and discuss technical and business scenarios and likely timetables for extremely low cost flights of payloads of interest to the small satellite and microgravity research communities...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of the}} "School of the Future" project (www. school-of-the-future. eu), which {{receives}} funding {{within the}} EU's Seventh Framework Programme, is to design, demonstrate, evaluate and communicate shining examples of how to reach the future high-performance building level. School buildings and their primary users, namely pupils - the next generation - are in {{the focus of the}} project. Both, the energy and indoor environment performance of 4 demonstration buildings in 4 European countries and climates is being greatly improved due to holistic <b>retro</b> <b>fits</b> of the building envelope, the service systems, the integration of renewables and building management systems. The results and the accompanying research and dissemination efforts to support other actors dealing with building retrofits is leading to a multiplied impact on other schools and on the residential sector, since the pupils will act as communicators to their families. The user behaviour and the awareness of energy efficiency and indoor environment are being improved due to tailored training sessions. Nearly zero emission or nearly zero energy buildings are a main goal in various country roadmaps for 2020. The demonstration buildings or this project may not completely reach this level, though, as the aim of the call is cost efficiency and multiplication potential. The retrofit concepts however, result in buildings with far lower energy consumption than in regular retrofits with high indoor environment quality - thus leading the way towards zero emission. They can be considered as schools of the future. Results from national examples of zero emission schools complete the information used for developing the deliverables such as guidelines, information tools, publications and a community at the EU BUILD UP portal. The project is based on a close connection between demonstration, research and industry which is being represented by the "Design Advice and Evaluation Group''.

40|$|Fossil fuels {{are used}} widely for energy {{production}} {{and are likely}} to continue {{to play a major role}} world wide for many years to come. Much work has been done on the technology for capturing CO₂ from gaseous industrial e ffluent. For large-scale applications like coal or natural gas-fired power plants, using amine solvents to capture post-combustion CO₂ is the most mature CO₂ capture technology. This technique can be used to <b>retro</b> <b>fit</b> existing plants by treating the flue gas after combustion. This thesis contains a dynamic mathematical model for the absorber column that can be used to include more detailed reaction chemistry for the absorption of CO₂ into an amine in the presence of O₂ as it becomes available. The dynamic model is constructed from first principles and, while it is built using MEA as the absorbent to remove CO₂, it can be adjusted to cater for the removal of different industrial gases with various absorbents. The model is solved using a commercial solver, MATLAB Ode 15 s when reduced to a system of ODE's by finite difference in the spatial dimension. The flux of MEA, CO₂, O₂ and H₂O across the phase interface in either direction has been included and more components can be added as required. The loss of MEA through oxidative degradation has been quantified which is currently not available using commercial packages. Reaction rate kinetics have been employed to predict the accumulation of oxidation products which is limited by the incomplete knowledge of the dominant reactions between O₂ and MEA. When research has produced more detailed information about the products formed during this oxidation, it can be inserted easily into the model. Validation has been performed using data from the CSIRO PCC pilot plant at AGL Loy Yang. A limited parametric study of the impact of operating conditions on oxidation was performed...|$|E
40|$|Posture during toileting and {{its effect}} on toileting has been under {{scrutiny}} for more than 7000 years. With the advent of the western toilet in the 19 th century and a more closeted approach to toileting, the effects of posture became even more important to study because the visual one to one education of children, regarding toileting became less and less. Wennergren in her study of children demonstrated the value of foot support to relax the pelvic floor during urination in children. Moore in her study showed that a majority of British women will not sit on the toilet outside their house and would 'hover' to pass urine. A Taiwanese study showed a similar trend except that young students would precariously perch in a squat over a western toilet than sit on it for hygiene reasons. All these studies stimulated the generation of this thesis. PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY The principal objectives of these investigations were to study - The effect of the 'lean forward' position on the western toilet (WT) compared to the 'sit upright position' during micturition. - The effect of the 'raised knee' position on the western toilet compared to the 'lean forward' position during micturition. - The effect of squatting on a custom built Asian toilet compared to 'lean forward' position on the western toilet. What was learnt led to numerous 'sub-studies' on squatting which included - - Study of squatting in volunteers leading to a 'squatability' index - Study of school children and their ability to squat - Study of abdominal pressures in squatting and sitting positions at rest and during Valsalva manoeuvre - Study of the levator hiatus during squatting and lying down at rest - Possible design of a <b>retro</b> <b>fit</b> device to aid toileting on the western toilet called Duneze METHODOLOGY All toileting parameters were studied using uroflowmetry which was used as standard, as in previous studies. [1 - 6] Support for Uroflowmetry, which is a simple non-invasive measurement of urine flow over time and an indication in screening for voiding difficulty, as a screening test for voiding dysfunction has become stronger over time, [7 - 9] measuring some of the key components of the micturition process. [10] An abnormally slow urine flow suggests a provisional diagnosis of voiding difficulty subject to test repetition, post-void residual bladder volume (PVRBV) measurement and possible voiding cystometry. Post Void Residual Urine Volume Measurement of post void residual urine volume (PVRBV), the amount of residual urine in the bladder after a voluntary void, is another non-invasive screening test for evaluating voiding dysfunction. Most urologists agree that volumes of 50 mL to 100 mL constitute the lower threshold defining abnormal residual urine volume PVRBV measurement. There are 2 methods of measuring PVRBV: sterile catheterization and bladder ultrasound. Although sterile catheterization provides a urine sample, there are many disadvantages associated with the procedure: it causes patient discomfort, carries a risk of urethral trauma and introducing an UTI, is time-consuming, and may not be necessary. [11] In contrast, bladder ultrasound can be performed with a portable device. It is noninvasive and time-efficient, minimizes medical waste and supplies, and determines when catheterization is medically appropriate. However, a urine specimen cannot be obtained during this procedure. Portable 3 -dimensional ultrasound devices have been shown to provide highly accurate measurement of bladder volume. Coombes and Millard compared the BladderScanTM BVI 2500 series (Diagnostic Ultrasound, Bothell, Wash) with catheterization for the measurement of bladder volume with no significant difference in estimates being demonstrated. The overall accuracy (94...|$|E
40|$|In 2011, the 'School of the Future' {{project was}} {{launched}} {{as a demonstration}} project in the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union. The related call for applications focused on the 'Demonstration of Energy Efficiency through Retrofitting of Buildings'. Project goals included design, implementation and evaluation of holistic renovation measures in buildings with a high replication potential for large regions of Europe. The aim was to reduce the use of heating energy for the thermal conditioning of spaces in selected buildings by at least 75 % through appropriate retrofitting measures. Accompanying measures were to include long-term measurements and an initiative to improve user behaviour. As the associated working programme was developed {{in cooperation with the}} Energy-Efficient Buildings - European Initiative of the European Construction Technology Platform (ECTP), partners from industry were encouraged to participate in the project. The project proposal 'School of the Future' met these requirements, as the project focused on the renovation of four school buildings in four European countries with different climates. In addition to the public-sector building owners, five research institutions and four industry partners joined the project. In all of the four schools, the retrofits comprised measures to improve the building envelope, the building services systems and the use of renewable energy. The energy objectives defined by the project partners are as follows: · Reduction of the heating energy use by 75 % (as defined in the call) · Reduction of the total energy use by factor 3 (i. e. by two thirds) The total energy use includes space heating, water heating (DHW), ventilation, lighting and the residual use of electricity in buildings. None of the four school buildings needed cooling. The scope of the project included a monitoring phase of at least twelve months during which the energy consumption of the <b>retro</b> <b>fitted</b> buildings was measured. Subsequently, the measurements were continued by the building owners. In addition to enhancing energy efficiency, the project also dealt with indoor comfort. Here, the target was to · Improve the indoor environment to enhance pupils' performance The analysis of the induced change in the indoor climate was based on short-time measurements and questionnaires. The four retrofitted schools are no zero energy schools, as this standard could not be realized without exceeding the envisaged energy- relevant investment costs of 100 €/m². Nevertheless, these schools use significantly less energy than specified in the national requirements for building renovation, thus leading the way towards even more energyefficient school buildings. The further work packages in the project (the retrofit guidelines, forinstance) demonstrate ways towards zero emission buildings or even buildings that generate surplus energy (energy surplus buildings). The project was based on three pillars: demonstration, research, and dissemination. The outcome of the individual areas of work is summarized in the following sections. All results derived from the project are available on the project's website www. school-of-the-future. eu.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} design and {{performance}} studies of a prototype combined {{air source heat pump}} and storage system, <b>retro</b> <b>fitted</b> to heat occupied spaces subjected to high ventilation rates. The {{source of heat}} is from the air in the extract duct. Two limiting thermal conditions exist. The first is the thermal capacity of air passing over the ducted heat exchangers. The second is the dew and freezing points of the exhaust air, because of the insulating effect of ice on exchanger fins and tubes. Both are alleviated to a significant extent with high mass flow rates passing down the duct, since more heat can be extracted for a set decline in exhaust air temperatures. This study identifies reasons for ventilation and building strategies involving high ventilation rates, including the physiological and emotional needs of people and the various economic, climatic and Governmental polices (climate change levy, public health legislation) that impact upon heating and ventilation design. The study recognises the need for reduced carbon dioxide emissions and explores issues of indoor air quality and sick building syndrome and how increased ventilation rates can address them. The proposition investigated in this thesis is that air source recovery and heating by heat pump systems, combined with a heat storage system, can economically allow increases in ventilation rates to well above current standards without incurring great increases in energy use and carbon emissions; and in some circumstances reducing them. The thesis discusses in depth and detail, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} possible alternative methods of heating a building and ventilation recovery, comparing their effectiveness and cost. A prototype system has been designed and field trials of a retrofit application have produced performance data that has subsequently been used in a long term cost comparison. The rig's design and construction are fully documented and its function over a full heating season is comprehensively explained (recording methods, types of calibration, control choices etc). A theoretical estimate of the energy requirements could have been attained using simulation and degree day information, however, a real like-for-like comparison using field trials prepared and a model was developed which allowed test data to be used to predict costs. The rig was tested over two heating seasons and compared with actual reading from alternative heating systems, degree day calculations are discussed but the reliance is on the actual live data gathered. (although summer cooling is achievable with the test rig no readings were recorded or comparison made). The work shows that heat pump heating and recovery systems and combined storage ability out-performed the other systems investigated. The crucial elements of its functionality are the high temperature of the heat source and the vast volume (and thermal capacity) of air being used, extracting at 24 °C and delivering at 35 °C. The Coefficient of performance varies through the heating season but, synthesis of theory with test rig performance demonstrate that the longer term cost of the system is attractive; and its attraction shall probably grow with anticipated future trends in consumer demands for comfort and air quality coupled with fuel costs and a philanthropic social and political attitude to emissions control...|$|R
