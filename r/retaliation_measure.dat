The economic variables reflect the state of a domestic industry (unemployment, productivity, sales, imports). The strategic variables contain characteristics of the targeted country in the inquiry (big exporter, developed/developing, <b>retaliation</b> <b>measures).</b> Political variables are related to the pressure that industries wield on decision makers (industry size, petitioners 2 ̆ 7 organization, lobby activity).

50|$|The {{activities}} of the OPCW and its core organisational structure are described in the Chemical Weapons Convention (whose members are all in OPCW). The principal body is the conference of the states parties, which normally is convened yearly, and in which all countries participate and have equal voting rights. Countries are generally represented in the Conference by a permanent representative to the organisation, which in most cases is also the ambassador to the Netherlands. The conference decides on all main topics regarding the organisation (for example, taking <b>retaliation</b> <b>measures)</b> and the convention (approving guidelines, imposing retaliating measures against members).The Executive Council is the executive organ of the organisation and consists of 41 States Parties, which are appointed by the Conference on a 2-year term. The Council amongst others oversees the budget and cooperates with the General Secretariat on all matters related to the convention.The Technical Secretariat applies most of the activities mandated by the Council and is the body {{where most of the}} employees of the organisation work.

40|$|After having {{guaranteed}} {{the functioning of}} the multilateral system of trade negotiations within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) for more than 40 years, the United States is obviously changing its trade strategy. There is an ongoing debate within the Clinton administration and among leading US economists on the potential benefits and costs of multilateral trade talks. The formation of the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA) and more recently the aggressive <b>retaliation</b> <b>measures</b> against the European steel industry and the announcement of further tariffs on European and Japanese exports indicate that the United States has lost confidence in the effectiveness of the GATT process and will likely turn towards a new trade strategy favouring the establishment of additional free trade zones under US leadership and a policy of aggressive bilateralism. This paper investigates whether an American departure from multilateralism leads on a highway or a dirt road to freer trade. In Section II. 1, the analysis starts with a brief discussion of the welfare effects of regional trading blocs. In Section II. 2, the political economy effects of the GATT process of multilateral trade negotiations and the formation of free trade areas will be discussed. Section III examines {{the pros and cons of}} a policy of aggressive bilateralism. In Section IV, it will be shown that a multilateral system of international trade negotiations being built upon a conditional mostfavoured- nation (MFN) principle might be the first-best solution to the current problems of the GATT.

40|$|The {{belief in}} sorcery and {{witchcraft}} in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is widely spread {{and has an}} important role in most of the spheres of public and private life. Most of the population of PNG does not accept natural causes as an explanation of illness or death. The belief that sorcerers and witches have deliberately used their supernatural powers in order to harm other people is a common conviction and the relatives of the victims adopt <b>retaliation</b> <b>measures</b> against the alleged witches, such as murder, torture, destruction of their property or exile. This kind of violence causes hundreds of deaths every year. The following research does not aim to make an account or analysis of this kind of violence, as I believe this aspect has been already presented enough and it is not constructive in itself. This investigation focuses on exploring the initiatives undertaken by local activists to overcome the high level of violence, especially targeting women, arising from witchcraft and sorcery-related accusations in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. With that objective, I carried out a feminist ethnography, mainly supported by the theories of Postcolonialism, Postcolonial Feminism, Politics of Location, Situated Knowledges and Feminist Standpoint, putting them into dialogue with previous research on sorcery and witchcraft in Papua New Guinea and with the first-hand testimonies of more than 50 field interviews that I conducted myself. With this research, I aim to making visible a terrible form of gender-based violence against women; highlight the work of those local women and men that are taking a stand against sorcery and witchcraft accusations in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea; and bring a more constructive and less ethnocentric view to the current academic and media discourse. In this regard, the current thesis compiles and assesses these local initiatives, trying to fill a gap in a recently discovered field of research...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} downturn and recession affects every industry and sector of Ireland. The educational sector is long {{thought of as}} being instrumental in developing {{the minds of the}} future. This sector has been used in recent years, as a tool for getting Ireland out of this economic depression. The psychological contract (PC) is a valuable construct which attempts to explain a mutually reciprocal union of promises that exist in the employment relationship (Robinson, Kraatz, & Rousseau 1994; Guest 1998). Research on this topic has increased since the inception of the term in the 1960 s, as it is regarded as having a huge bearing on the employment contract. In recent years the educational sector has undergone significant change and pressure has been placed on teachers to work longer hours, and deal with increased class sizes. They are expected to continue to carry out extra-curricular activities, at no extra benefit to them. The ASTI (Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland), the representative body for secondary teachers in Ireland, has argued that the Croke Park Agreement (CPA) along with other austerity measures taken by the government in an attempt at cost saving and stream lining the sector, has broken promises made to teachers, and consequently breached their PC. In an attempt to investigate this evidence further, research was carried out in the form of in-depth interviews, to understand the factors that influence a perceived breach of a PC, and what <b>retaliation</b> <b>measures,</b> if any, teachers take against such measures. Responses gained from the interviews and the literature is used to understand breach and what action is taken against it. Change, support issues, and actions taken by the principal, were the main factors contributing to a perception of breach; while reaction and trust influenced what retaliation the teachers took against this perception of breach. The author uses this information to then promote recommendations of how to approach addressing the contentious issues that the sector faces...|$|R
40|$|The WTO law of {{remedies}} for violation appears incoherent. States {{that fail to}} comply with their obligations are subject to WTO-authorized retaliation. First, this retaliation takes the inefficient form of blocked trade by the complaining state. This remedy {{is unlikely to be}} useful to developing countries. Second, the amount of trade blocked by the violation is often used as the <b>measure</b> of authorized <b>retaliation.</b> This <b>measure</b> is not necessarily incentive compatible, as it is not necessarily linked to welfare. Thus, its use may result in inefficient breach, or inefficient compliance, with WTO law. Third, only states that engage in dispute resolution proceedings are authorized to retaliate, artificially reducing the possible incentives to comply. Fourth, authorization to retaliate is granted only prospectively, and there are generally no formal {{remedies for}} damages accruing before adjudication and the passage of permitted time for compliance. This also artificially reduces incentives to comply. This paper analyzes the rationale for, and structure of, welfare-based remedies that could form the basis for cash compensation in WTO law...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the world-wide use of {{antidumping}} {{has become very}} widespread – 41 WTO-member countries initiated antidumping cases over the 1995 - 2003 period. From another perspective, US exporters were subjected to 139 antidumping cases during this period, by enforcement agencies representing 20 countries. In this context, it is natural to consider whether antidumping filings may be motivated as <b>retaliation</b> against similar <b>measures</b> imposed on a country’s exporters. This {{is the focus of}} our study, though we also control for the bilateral export flows involved and non-retaliatory impacts of past cases, with other motivations – macroeconomic, industry-specific and political considerations – dealt with through industry, country and year fixed effects. Applying probit analysis to a WTO database on reported filings, we find strong evidence that retaliation was a significant motive in explaining the rise of antidumping filings over the past decade, though interesting differences emerge in the reactions to traditional and new users of antidumping. antidumping, retaliation...|$|R
50|$|During the 1990s, free {{software}} licenses began including clauses, such as patent retaliation, {{in order to}} protect against software patent litigation cases - a problem which had not previously existed. This new threat {{was one of the reasons}} for writing version3 of the GNU GPL in 2006. In recent years, a term coined tivoization describes a process where hardware restrictions are used to prevent users from running modified versions of the software on that hardware, in which the TiVo device is an example. It is viewed by the FSF as a way to turn {{free software}} to effectively non-free, and is why they have chosen to prohibit it in GPLv3.Most newly written free software licenses since the late 1990s include some form of patent <b>retaliation</b> clauses. These <b>measures</b> stipulate that one's rights under the license (such as to redistribution), may be terminated if one attempts to enforce patents relating to the licensed software, under certain circumstances.

40|$|Literature about {{strategic}} {{trade policy}} (Brender, Krugman, [...] .) has been concerned only with implicit internal strategic trade policies. We define them as policy tools targeting exclusively {{the behavior of}} national firms. In duopolistic terms, {{the goal is to}} move the reaction function of the domestic firm and to locate it in a better position than previously. The home country government must credibly commits itself to pursue a particular trade policy before firms make decisions about prices or production. On the contrary, external strategic trade policies influence the behaviour of foreign firms and force them to act in the way desired by the home government. Mixed strategies associate both actions and may lead to a collusive agreement. We show that if subsidy is an attractive policy tool for internal strategic trade policy with Cournot-Nash competition, Voluntary Export Restraints agreements are an equivalent and alternative strategic trade policy for governments having more preference for fiscal restraints than for the surplus of consumers and the general welfare. It is acceptable by foreign firms because they are less predatory than alternative <b>measures.</b> <b>Retaliations</b> by foreign countries are avoided by the agreement; VERs allow to impose a co-operative framework. ...|$|R

40|$|To settle {{disputes}} concerning {{rights or}} obligations under WTO agreements, the WTO enforces a dispute settlement system. The WTO dispute settlement {{system has been}} in operation since 1995 and has, during this time, been the most productive of all international dispute settlement systems. The Dispute Settlement Understanding is a dispute settlement system between governments, {{and the use of}} the system is limited to members of the WTO. The WTO dispute settlement process contains four main stages, namely consultations, the panel stage, appellate review proceedings, and implementation and enforcement. I am focusing on the critical stage of implementation and enforcement and the practical problems that may arise using the remedies available in this phase of the process in this thesis. The Dispute Settlement Understanding offers three types of remedies when a member is breaking WTO law. The withdrawal or amendment of the WTO-inconsistent measure is the final remedy. The DSU also provides for two temporary remedies which may be applied while awaiting the withdrawal or amendment or if the losing party fails to bring its inconsistent measure into compliance with WTO obligations. The two temporary remedies are compensation and suspension of concessions or other obligations. One issue arising at the implementation stage of the DSU is the relationship between article 21. 5 of the DSU and article 22. 2 of the DSU. Question may arise whether the compliance proceedings or the suspension of concessions proceedings has priority, if either. Past DSU review negotiations have not found a solution to this issue of sequencing yet, the discussion is continuing in the current negotiations. The concept of compensation has not been used very frequently. There are several possible reasons why compensation as a remedy is rarely used in practice and I am focusing on three aspects in this thesis. First, compensation is voluntary, and the disputing parties have to agree on the solution. Second, the compensation must be consistent with the covered agreements. Third, the current system on compensation may not provide for effective reparation of damages suffered by the complaining party. There have been discussions from time to time to make the compensation within the DSU financial but every proposal has always been turned down. To suspend concessions or other obligations is a remedy used more frequently than compensation. However, there are practical problems arising with this remedy as well. First, <b>retaliation</b> <b>measures</b> are trade destructive and can affect the injured party negatively as well as the losing party. Second, in particular the possibility to retaliate is not a genuine option to smaller or developing country members. Third, these smaller and developing country members are also the ones that are most affected by the possibility to “cross-retaliate”. The discussion in this thesis shows that the remedy is not efficient for every party in every single dispute and may therefore uphold the inequality between the members of the WTO. It was determined by the time of the introduction of the DSU that the system was to be examined and evaluated after using it for a couple of years. The negotiations are still in progress. The members were encouraged to contribute with questions, proposals, and comments concerning changes and improvements of the DSU to these special sessions. The Chairman of the Special Session of the DSU summarized the proposals and drafted legal texts which ended up in the so-called Chairman’s text. To me, it seems like the review of the DSU has been set aside while awaiting the negotiations in other important WTO areas. We may see the DSU as part of the overall “give and take” in the end anyway, even if this was not a desirable outcome in the beginning of the negotiations. 356 consultation questions have been made since the introduction of the dispute settlement system. It is important to remember that the great majority of the cases are settled through consultations or mutually agreed solutions, never reaching the full DSU process and the problems with the remedies described in this thesis. The remedies available today may not always result in the most efficient solution. However, it is important to remember that the remedies existing today are the remedies which the member states found they were willing to accept both as successful complainants and as unsuccessful defendants. From a democratic, diplomatic, and political point of view, an emergency exit like article 22 of the DSU is necessary for the practical function of the WTO dispute settlement system...|$|R
5000|$|The first large CHEKA {{action against}} alleged anarchists {{where people were}} killed was in mid April 1918 in Petrograd. Then {{at the end of}} April and {{beginning}} of May coordinated CHEKIST attacks against alleged anarchists were launched in both Petrograd and Moscow. ( [...] P. Avrich. G. Maximoff. [...] ) These violent attacks without warning from the Bolsheviks forced anarchists underground and prompted <b>measured</b> <b>retaliation</b> by them in self-defense. Anarchists in Rostov, Ekaterinoslav and Briansk broke into prisons to liberate the prisoners and issued fiery proclamations calling on the people to revolt against the Bolshevik regime. The Anarchist Battle Detachments attacked the Whites, Reds and Germans alike. Many peasants joined the revolt, attacking their enemies with pitchforks and sickles. Meanwhile, in Moscow, the Underground Anarchists were formed by Kazimir Kovalevich and Piotr Sobolev to be the shock troops of their revolution, infiltrating Bolshevik ranks and striking when least expected. On 25 September 1919, the Underground Anarchists struck the Bolsheviks with [...] "their heaviest blow against the 'oppressors'". The headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party was blown up, killing 12 and injuring 55 Party members, including Nikolai Bukharin and Emilian Iaroslavskii. Spurred on by their apparent success, the Underground Anarchists proclaimed a new [...] "era of dynamite" [...] that would finally wipe away capitalism and the State. The Bolsheviks responded by initiating a new wave of mass repression in which Kovalevich and Sobolev were the first to be shot. The remaining Underground Anarchists blew themselves up in their last battle with the Cheka, taking much of their safe house with them.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{non-compliance}} with the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) recommendations and rulings emerges when the violator state fails to bring its inconsistent measures into conformity with its WTO obligations {{within a reasonable}} period of time. Compensation and suspension of concessions or other obligations (retaliation) are the only remedies provided under WTO law for cases of non-compliance. Many academic writings, as well as statements from WTO Members, have demonstrated pessimism concerning {{the effectiveness of these}} remedies, particularly retaliation. The central point of this thesis concerns three main issues: the problems of WTO retaliation, the question of the effectiveness of retaliation, and the purposes of retaliation. This thesis aims to provide another perspective, besides the common “harm-resulted” perspective, for assessing the effectiveness of WTO retaliation. Accordingly, it provides several approaches: (1) identification of the purpose of retaliation in order to assess its effectiveness; (2) analysis of the enquiry whether there are in fact several purposes of WTO retaliation; (3) examination of the question whether the presence of retaliation purposes other than that inducing compliance is within the ambit of WTO law; (4) consideration of retaliation as a way of inducing a mutually agreeable solution; and (5) consideration of the question whether any deviation from strict compliance would undermine the WTO dispute settlement system. On the basis of extensive research on the purposes of WTO retaliation, namely through interpreting Article 22 of the DSU, examining the design of WTO treaty, assessing the academic writings/debates as well as the statements of arbitrators; several conclusions are made, of which the main one is that inducing compliance is not the sole purpose that WTO retaliation can pursue. Therefore compliance is not the only benchmark by which the effectiveness of WTO <b>retaliation</b> should be <b>measured...</b>|$|R
