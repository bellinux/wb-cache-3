40|$|International audienceIn orogens, {{shortening}} {{is mainly}} accommodated by thrusts, which constitute preferential zones for fluid–rock interactions. Fluid flow, mass transfer, and mineralogical reactions taking place along thrusts have been intensely investigated, especially in sedimentary basins for petroleum and uranium research. This study combines petrological investigations, mineralogical quantifications, and geochemical characterizations {{with a wide}} range of analytical tools with the aim of defining the fluid properties (nature, origin, temperature, and redox) and fluid–host rock interactions (mass transfers, recrystallization mechanisms, and newly formed synkinematic mineralization) in the Pic-de-Port-Vieux thrust fault zone (Pyrenees, Spain). We demonstrate that two geochemically contrasted rocks have been transformed by fluid flow under low-grade metamorphism conditions during thrusting. The hanging-wall Triassic <b>red</b> <b>pelite</b> was locally bleached, while the footwall Cretaceous dolomitic limestone was mylonitized. The results suggest that thrusting was accompanied by a dynamic calcite recrystallization in the dolomitic limestone as well as by leaching of iron via destabilization of iron oxides and phyllosilicate crystallization in the pelite. Geochemical and physical changes highlighted in this study have strong implications on the understanding of the thrust behavior (tectonic and hydraulic), and improve our knowledge of fluid–rock interactions in open fluid systems in the crust...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSynkinematic phyllosilicates in fault zones {{can be used}} {{to deduce}} the {{deformation}} mechanisms and the conditions of fault activity, as their chemical composition, crystal structure and texture can record the different stages of deformation and fluid-rock interactions. The Pic de Port Vieux, a second-order thrust related to the major Gavarnie thrust in the southern central part of the Pyrenees Axial Zone, juxtaposes Triassic pelites of the hanging wall and Cretaceous limestones of the footwall. In order to investigate the mineralogical and geochemical changes and constrain the deformation conditions of thrusting, characterization of phyllosilicates was performed along a transect in the fault hanging wall pelites. The Triassic pelites are mainly composed of quartz, calcite, phyllosilicates (chlorite and K-white mica) and ± hematite. The core fault zone thickness is estimated to be about one meter of intensively foliated green pelites, whereas the damage zone is composed of several meters of <b>red</b> <b>pelites.</b> XRD data demonstrated that the difference in color is related to hematite which is only present in the damage zone. Phyllosilicates of the damage zone are mainly inherited/diagenetic K-white mica and chlorite. In the core zone, newly formed chlorite is abundant and preferentially located in veins. It is enriched in Fe compared to the chlorite of the <b>red</b> <b>pelites.</b> The well-defined foliation in the core zone is overlaid by preferentially oriented muscovite grains which have homogeneous compositions, with less Na and relatively more Fe than mica from the <b>red</b> <b>pelites.</b> Newly formed chlorite and muscovite in the core zone are synkinematic to the fault activity. They are both related to deformation processes and fluid rock interactions. Kübler index measurements and chlorite thermometry show that synkinematic phyllosilicates have registered a temperature of 270 °C ± 23 °C for the damage zone and 285 °C ± 28 °C for the core zone which are corresponding to lower-anchizone/epizone grade conditions. Numerical modelling with the geochemical modelling program PhreeqC was performed to determine the favorable conditions for the mineralogical change between <b>red</b> and green <b>pelites.</b> It suggests that the main critical parameter favoring hematite dissolution and chlorite precipitation in the core zone, is the redox conditions. According to the model, the chemical changes in the core zone occurred due to interactions with highly reductive fluids. In addition, the hematite dissolution maybe the source of iron for newly formed phyllosilicates in the core zone that are more iron rich compared to those from the <b>red</b> <b>pelites...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{characteristics}} of sedimentary deposits in continental basins, especially those controlled by extension, {{are often used}} to infer global climatic changes. We question the relevance of such an approach because the stratigraphic pattern of those basins are mostly similar whatever their latitudes/paleolatitudes (i. e. their general climatic conditions), namely the transition from (1) an ancestral drainage network to (2) deep lake with a dominance of black and grey shale deposits, (3) shallow oxic lake with a dominance of <b>red</b> <b>pelites</b> deposits and to eventually (4) a new drainage network. Such transitions observed in Late Palaeozoic continental basins throughout Laurasia and Gondwana are generally interpreted as evidence of global change from a wet climate to an arid climate. From the sedimentological and structural analysis of a Late Palaeozoic basin, the Graissessac-Lodève basin, {{in the south of}} the Variscan French Massif Central, we proposed a new tectono-stratigraphic sequence of this basin from the Late Carboniferous to the Early Trias. We estimate the paleo-area (from 295 - 450 km 2 to 880 - 1150 km 2) of the basin and we deduce a subsidence curve from the Late Carboniferous to the Late Permian (from 600 ± 200 m/My to 100 ± 10 m/My). We conclude that the Graissessac-Lodève basin stratigraphic pattern corresponds to a classical continental rift sequence controlled by tectonics. In order to assess a possible control of the stratigraphic sequence by the climate, we have reconstructed the paleo-depth of the lake with (1) the morphometric analysis of the wave ripples and (2) with an estimation of the lacustrine slope considering the tectonic origin of the lake. We find that the maximum lacustrine depth has evolved from a range of 80 - 300 m during the Late Carboniferous to 40 - 45 m during the Late Permian. From our estimates of the different configurations of the basin, we show that the volume of the water in the lake has remained nearly constant between 10 and 30 km 3, from the Late Carboniferous (300 My) to the Late Permian (250 My). Eventually, we conclude that the sedimentological indicators of shallowing and episodic drying observed from the Late Carboniferous to Late Permian in this basin, and probably in all the Pangea basins of the same type, are the consequence of the basin enlargement by tectonics and its sedimentary filling rather than climatic change...|$|R
40|$|Slices of {{the crust}} of the Piémontaise (Penninic) ocean are today exposed along the alpine suture zone from {{southern}} Italy {{along the northern}} Apennine and western Alps {{as far north as}} southern Germany. Its northernmost extension is known as Arosa-Zone and is exposed as a 10 m to a few 100 m wide seam along the northwestern base of the Austroalpine Nappes from Graubuenden in the south through the Rätikon and the Walsertal into the Allgaeu in SW Bavaria. Aside from fragments of sedimentary sections of the austroalpine nappes, tectonic slices of the Piémontaise oceanic crust and ultramafic fragments (serpentinites, ophicalcites) of the late Paleozoic subcontinental lithospheric mantle occur within the Arosa-Zone, both often with their original sediment coverage of Upper Jurassic <b>red</b> deep sea <b>pelites</b> and/or Lower Cretaceous Aptychen limestone. However, as some basalts are directly covered by reddish to grey limestones in Aptychen-facies of Lower Cretaceous age the emplacement of the pillow basalts may be asynchronous. New field observations support that the basalts from Hindelang to Liechtenstein occur as sediment-free “pillow supported ” successions. On the contrary, th...|$|R
