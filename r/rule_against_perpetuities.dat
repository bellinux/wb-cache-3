5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities.</b> The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E
25|$|Other hypothetically {{relevant}} possibilities {{which almost}} never actually occur {{but have been}} invoked by lawyers or courts to invalidate transfers under the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities</b> include the slothful executor (a situation where the executor of the estate does not probate the will for many years after the testator's death), the magic gravel pit (a transfer to be made {{as soon as a}} gravel pit is out of gravel may not vest for hundreds of years), the war that never ends (a transfer to be made {{at the end of a}} war might never happen), and other similar situations.|$|E
25|$|A {{purpose trust}} in English {{law is a}} trust created for the {{fulfillment}} of a purpose, not {{for the benefit of}} a person. These are normally considered invalid by the courts because they have no legally recognized beneficiaries, therefore nobody to enforce the trust, with the exception of charitable trusts, which are enforceable by Attorney General as they represent public interest. As well as charitable trusts, there are several exceptions to the rules against purpose trusts. If the requirement to fulfill a purpose is a request, rather than an obligation, the trust is valid; a trust will also be found valid if, while being for a purpose, it involves beneficiaries in some respect. Purpose trusts can also be valid if they are for the erection or maintenance of tombs and memorials (assuming such memorials are not overly grandiose), the maintenance of animals, and arguably the saying of masses, although these must all obey the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities</b> and not continue for more than 21 years after the testator's death.|$|E

40|$|Trusts {{were first}} created in England many centuries ago by {{settling}} property upon protective Trusts whereby the income {{was paid to}} successive generations whilst the corpus was maintained intact thereby avoiding death duty. To prevent this, rules were formulated some 250 years ago to prevent the indefinite "tying-up" of property and these still apply today and are generally {{referred to as the}} <b>Rules</b> <b>Against</b> <b>Perpetuity.</b> In New Zealand these Rules have recently been amended but briefly they are to the effect that property may be placed in Trust for the period of a life in being plus 21 years thereafter or for 80 years. Similarly until the Perpetuities Act, 1964, it was permissible to accumulate income only for a very restricted period and as a result the compilers of Trust Deeds had to be wary that they did not infringe this law which became known as the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> accumulations. This, however, was abolished with the Perpetuities Act, 1964, and it is now permissible to accumulate income for the full period of the Trust. Many notable authorities have upheld the right of the individual to order his affairs {{in such a way as}} to preserve as much as possible of his funds intact for transmission to his beneficiaries. The classical dictum which has been quoted in many subsequent cases was that of Lord Tomlin in the Duke of Westminister v Inland Revenue Commissioners # 1936 # when he said, "every man is entitled if he can to order his affairs so that the Tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is less than it otherwise would be". Planning an Estate and the introduction of a Trust into that plan requires a careful consideration of many varied, and often conflicting objectives. It also involves assessing existing problems and visualising those that may develop in future...|$|R
2500|$|The fertile octogenarian is {{a fictitious}} {{character}} {{that comes up}} when applying the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities.</b> The rule presumes that anyone, even an octogenarian (i.e., someone between 80 and 90 years of age) can parent a child, regardless of sex or health. [...] For instance, suppose that a will devises {{a piece of land}} known as Blackacre [...] "to A for her life, and then to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age." [...] A is, at the time the will is probated, an 85-year-old woman. In applying the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities,</b> an imaginative lawyer will argue (and a court must accept under the common law rule itself) that A could have a child in her 86th year and then in her 87th year all of A's other children could die, then in her 88th year A herself could die. [...] Because the interest will not vest until her new child reaches 25 years of age, which cannot happen until more than 21 years after A and her other children (together who form the [...] "lives in being" [...] to which the rule refers) have all died, the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities</b> makes the entire gift [...] "to the first of A's children to reach 25 years of age" [...] void. [...] A will hold Blackacre for life, and then the property will revert to the person whose will transferred it to A in the first place. (Actually, it will go to that person's estate, since the will was probated only after his death.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Because these {{hypothetical}} scenarios {{show how}} a reasonable gift can be voided based on so unlikely an outcome, they have generated much criticism among legal scholars, {{resulting in the}} [...] of the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities</b> by statute in many jurisdictions. Many U.S. States have adopted laws mollifying {{the application of the}} rule by requiring courts to [...] "wait and see" [...] for a period of years, sometimes as long as 360 years (which effectively negates the possibility of litigation ensuing during the life of any person alive at the same time of the author of the will).|$|E

[...] The rule itself, simply stated, makes a future interest in property void if it can be logically proven that there is some possibility of the interest not vesting or failing within 21 years after the end of a life in being at the time the interest is created.|$|E

40|$|Throw a stone into a {{room full}} of law professors, and it is {{virtually}} impossible to hit someone who will defend perpetual trusts. Yet since 1995, eighteen states have repealed their <b>rules</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities,</b> and there are now twenty-one states that permit trusts to last forever. Many academics have responded with a virtual pile-on, calling the repeals a 2 ̆ 2 race to the bottom 2 ̆ 2 at best and 2 ̆ 2 loony 2 ̆ 2 at worst. Lawrence Waggoner, Professor Emeritus at the University of Michigan School of Law and Reporter for the Restatement (Third) of Property: Wills and Other Donative Transfers, has made another contribution to the scrum. Professor Waggoner does not just dislike perpetual trusts. They are, in his description, 2 ̆ 2 folly. 2 ̆ 2 Professor Waggoner nominally aims his critique at wealthy individuals who desire perpetual trusts and the lawmakers who enable them by passing favorable legislation. He lodges five specific objections: (1) after a certain period of time, the beneficiaries of perpetual trusts will be insufficiently related to the trust creator; (2) after a certain period of time, there will be too many beneficiaries of a perpetual trust; (3) perpetual trusts will be expensive to manage; (4) outdated trust instruments will hamper management of perpetual trusts; and (5) trustee turnover will negatively impact perpetual trusts. This Essay considers each of his objections in turn, and concludes that Professor Waggoner 2 ̆ 7 s concerns are misplaced and exaggerated. Perpetual trusts raise important policy concerns, to be sure, but 2 ̆ 2 folly 2 ̆ 2 is in the eye of the beholder. The legal system does not yet have enough experience with perpetual trusts to understand their full implications. A more prudent approach would be to embrace a variation on the long-standing approach to perpetuities problems: let 2 ̆ 7 s wait and see...|$|R

2500|$|Note that {{changing}} the word [...] "issue" [...] to [...] "children" [...] makes the gift valid: Since {{the class of}} [...] "A's children" [...] is closed and completely cognizable {{at the time of}} A's death (plus a gestation period as allowed by the rule), A's children no longer have a vested remainder subject to open; upon A's death, they now have an indefeasibly vested remainder, which is outside the scope of the <b>Rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>Perpetuities.</b> On the contrary, the class of [...] "A's issue" [...] is subject to expand long after A's death, so their future interest remains that of a vested remainder subject to open, which is within the scope of the rule. [...] B cannot serve as the life in being for A's issue because B was not yet born, i.e., not [...] "a life in being," [...] {{at the time of the}} transfer. [...] Because her death could (as explained above) be more than 21 years after A's death, the result is that the gift to A's issue violates the rule because it is possible that the gift will vest more than 21 years after the end of all lives in being at the time the gift was created.|$|E
2500|$|The unborn widow poses {{a similar}} {{seemingly}} silly but logical problem. Suppose that property is left [...] "to A for life, then to his widow for life, then to A's issue." [...] Because the gift to A's widow cannot be resolved until A dies, {{the law will}} consider the possibility that, after the property is left to A, he marries {{a woman who was}} not born at the time the gift was made. For instance, it is possible that in 1950 the property is left to A, in 1955 a woman B is born, and in 1975 A and B marry each other (neither having issue at the time). Furthermore, it is possible that A will die, say in 1980, and his widow B will outlive him for more than 21 years. Suppose that she dies in 2005. [...] B was not a life in being {{at the time of the}} transfer, and the only remaining [...] "validating life" [...] under the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities</b> is A, who has been dead for 25 years by this time. The gift to A's issue does not vest until his widow dies, and since that could theoretically happen more than 21 years after the death of all lives in being at the time of the transfer, the transfer to A's issue is invalid from the start.|$|E
2500|$|While express trusts in a family, charity, pension or {{investment}} context {{are typically}} created {{with the intention}} of benefiting people, property held by associations, particularly those which are not incorporated, was historically problematic. Often associations did not express their property to be held in any particular way and courts had theorised that it was held on trust for the members. At common law, associations such as trade unions, political parties, or local sports clubs were formed through an express or implicit contract, so long as [...] "two or more persons [...] bound together for one or more common purposes". In Leahy v Attorney-General for New South Wales Viscount Simonds in the Privy Council, advised that if property is transferred, for example by gift, to an unincorporated association it is [...] "nothing else than a gift to its members at the date of the gift as joint tenants or tenants in common." [...] He said that if property were deemed to be held on trust for future members, this could be void for violating the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities,</b> because an association could last long into the future, and so the courts would generally deem current members to be the appropriate beneficiaries who would take the property on trust for one another. In the English property law concept, [...] "joint tenancy" [...] meant that people own the whole of a body of assets together, while [...] "tenancy in common" [...] meant that people could own specific fractions of the property in equity (though not law). If that was true, a consequence would have been that property was held on trust for members of an association, and those members were beneficiaries. It would have followed that when members left an association, their share could not be transferred to the other members without violating the requirement of writing in the Law of Property Act 1925 section 53(1) for the transfer of a beneficial interest: a requirement that was rarely fulfilled.|$|E

2500|$|A second main {{equivalent}} to a security interest is a [...] "Quistclose trust" [...] named after the case Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd. Here a company named Rolls Razor Ltd had promised to pay a dividend to its shareholders, but had financial difficulty. Already in debt to its bank, Barclays, for £484,000 it agreed to take a loan from Quistclose Investments Ltd for £209,719. This money was deposited in a separate Barclays account, {{for the purpose of}} being paid out to shareholders. Unfortunately, Rolls Razor Ltd entered insolvency before the payment was made. Barclays claimed it had a right to set off the Quistclose money against the debts that were due to it, while Quistclose contended the money belonged entirely to it, and could not be used for the satisfaction of other creditors. The House of Lords unanimously held that a trust had been created in favour of Quistclose, and if the purpose of the payment (i.e. to pay the shareholders) failed, then the money would revert to Quistclose's ownership. While Quistclose trust cases are rare, and their theoretical basis has remained controversial (particularly because the trust is for a purpose and so sits uncomfortably with the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities),</b> trusts have also been acknowledged to exist when a company keeps payments by consumers in a separate fund. In Re Kayford Ltd a mail order business, fearing bankruptcy and not wanting pre-payments by its customers to be taken by other creditors, acted on its solicitors' advice and placed their money in a separate bank account. Megarry J held this effectively ensured other creditors would not have access to this cash. Since the Insolvency Act 1986 reforms, it is probable that section 239, which prohibits transactions that desire to give a preference to one creditor over others, would be argued to avoid such an arrangement (if ever a company does in fact seek to prefer its customers in this way). The position, then, would be that while banks and trade creditors may easily protect themselves, consumers, employees and others in a weaker bargaining position have few legal resources to do the same.|$|E
2500|$|People have {{a general}} freedom, subject to {{statutory}} requirements and basic fiduciary duties, to design {{the terms of a}} trust in the way a settlor deems fit. However English courts have long refused to enforce trusts that only serve an abstract purpose, and are not for the benefit of people. Only trusts charitable trusts, defined by the Charities Act 2011, and about four other small exceptions will be enforced. The main reason for this judicial policy is to prevent, as Roxburgh J said in Re Astor's Settlement Trusts, [...] "the creation of large funds devoted to non-charitable purposes which no court and no department of state can control". This followed a similar policy to the <b>rule</b> <b>against</b> <b>perpetuities,</b> which rendered void any trust that would only be transferred to (or [...] "vest") in someone in the distant future (currently 125 years under the Perpetuities and Accumulations Act 2009). In both ways, the view has remained strong that the wishes of the dead should not, so to speak, rule the living from the grave. It would mean that society's resources and wealth would be tied into uses that (because they were not charitable) failed to serve contemporary needs, and therefore made everyone poorer. Re Astor's ST itself concerned the wish of the Viscount Waldorf Astor, who had owned The Observer newspaper, to maintain [...] "good understanding... between nations" [...] and [...] "the independence and integrity of newspapers". While perhaps laudable, it was not within the tightly defined categories of a charity, and so was not valid. An example of a much less laudable aim in Brown v Burdett was an old lady's demand in her will that her house be boarded up for 20 years with [...] "good long nails to be bent down on the inside", but for some reason with her clock remaining inside. Bacon VC cancelled the trust altogether. But while there is a policy against enforcing trusts for abstract and non-charitable purposes, if possible the courts will construe a trust as being for people where they can. For example, in Re Bowes an aristocrat named John Bowes left £5000 in his will for [...] "planting trees for shelter on the Wemmergill estate", in County Durham. This was an extravagantly large sum of money for trees. But rather than holding it void (since planting trees on private land was a non-charitable purpose) North J construed the trust to mean that the money was really intended for the estate owners. Similarly in Re Osoba, the Court of Appeal held that a trust of a Nigerian man, Patrick Osoba, said to be for the purpose of [...] "training of my daughter" [...] was not an invalid purpose trust. Instead it was in substance intended that the money be for the daughter. Buckley LJ said the court would treat [...] "the reference to the purpose as merely a statement of the testator's motive in making the gift".|$|E
