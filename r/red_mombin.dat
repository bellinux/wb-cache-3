50|$|Spondias purpurea is {{a species}} in {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} cashew family, Anacardiaceae, that is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is most commonly known as jocote, which derives from the Nahuatl word xocotl, meaning any kind of sour or acidic fruit. However, this fruit can be particularly sweet when it ripens long enough. Other common names include <b>red</b> <b>mombin,</b> purple mombin, hog plum, ciruela huesito (Venezuela), ciruela, ciriguela, cirigüela, cirguela, and jobito (Ecuador).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the volatiles profile of <b>red</b> <b>mombin</b> (Spondias purpurea) pulp and its powder produced by spray-drying (SD) as an example to show utility of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) {{in the analysis of}} parameters such as the quality and stability of fruit products. Volatiles profiles of the pulp were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), quantified by gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and compared to the profile of the powder stored at 0, 60 and 120 days in plastic (PP) or laminated packages (LP). The results showed that the technique was able to identify 36 compounds in the <b>red</b> <b>mombin</b> pulp, 17 out of which have been described {{for the first time in}} this fruit, showing that <b>red</b> <b>mombin</b> fresh pulp appears to be unique in terms of volatiles composition. However, only 24 compounds were detected in the powder. This decrease is highly correlated (r 2 = 0. 99), at least for the majority of compounds, to the degree of volatility of compounds. Furthermore, the powder stored in PP or LP showed no statistical differences in the amounts of its components for a period of 120 days of storage. Finally, this work shows how HS-SPME analysis can be a valuable tool to assess the quality and stability of fruit products...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Red</b> <b>mombin</b> is a {{seasonal}} fruit and susceptible to degradation reactions {{due to its}} high water content. This highlights the need to use processes that prolong its life and make it available all year round, including to markets away from the production sites. Thus, {{the objective of this}} study was to produce <b>red</b> <b>mombin</b> pulp powder in spouted bed dryer, evaluate it regarding physical and chemical parameters and assess its hygroscopic behavior at temperatures of 20, 30 and 40 °C, fitting the models of the GAB, Oswin and Peleg to the experimental data. The results of the physical and chemical analyses showed intermediate wetting time of 0. 39 g min- 1, solubility higher than 60 % and mean flowability with Hausner ratio and Carr index of 1. 26 - 1. 34 and 0. 21 - 0. 25, respectively. The powder particles exhibited spherical shape, smooth surface and some irregularities, with tendency to form agglomerates. The isotherms had a type-II sigmoidal behavior, and the Peleg model, at all temperatures, showed the best fits to the experimental data with determination coefficients above 0. 99 and mean percentage deviations lower than 2. 0 %...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo dessa pesquisa foi avaliar a curva de desenvolvimento de frutos da cirigueleira. Para a avaliação do crescimento e maturação, as flores foram marcadas após a antese, e as colheitas dos frutos foram {{realizadas}} durante todo o período de desenvolvimento, visando às avaliações de diâmetro, comprimento, peso fresco, peso seco e volume. O ciclo de desenvolvimento da antese até o amadurecimento do fruto foi de 124 dias, sendo caracterizado pelo aumento dos pesos fresco e seco, volume, comprimento e diâmetro. O aumento do comprimento do fruto apresentou maior taxa de crescimento até aproximadamente 55 dias, seguido por um período de crescimento mais lento até 105 dias após a antese. O início da maturação do fruto ocorreu quando a taxa de crescimento foi mais lenta, em torno de 100 dias, enquanto o amadurecimento se iniciou aproximadamente aos 119 dias após a antese. The aim of {{this research}} was to evaluate the development profile of <b>red</b> <b>mombin</b> fruits. For the evaluation of growth and maturation, open flowers were marked after anthesis and fruits were sampled at regular intervals, and length, diameter, volume, and, fresh and dry weights were measured throughout the development following the growth of the fruits. <b>Red</b> <b>mombin</b> fruit developmental cycle, from anthesis to full ripening, lasted 124 days, characterized by the increase in fresh and dry weights, volume, length, and diameter. The growth period, mainly characterized by the increase in fruit length, had the highest growth rate until approximately 55 days, followed by a lower growth rate period from 55 to 105 days post-anthesis. Fruit maturation, which started when fruit growth rates slowed down, was set around 100 days and fruit ripening was initiated around 119 days post-anthesis...|$|E
