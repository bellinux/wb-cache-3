40|$|Anatomically {{favorable}} {{structures that}} have a longitudinal orientation are particularly amenable to endoscopic harvest. Typically, only a single portal is necessary for access, and an optical cavity can be maintained using a mechanical <b>retraction</b> <b>device.</b> As with all minimal invasive surgery, this can still allow rapid and often a safer tissue harvest with diminished morbidity, especially with respect to wound healing and non–aesthetic scar formation. Many plastic surgery applications have already been described facilitated by the endoscopic harvest of vein, tendon, and nerve grafts, as well as certain local or free muscle flaps...|$|E
40|$|A {{hot cell}} {{installation}} for {{the handling of}} highly radioactive material may comprise {{a dozen or more}} interconnected high density concrete vaults, the concrete vault walls having a thickness of approximately three feet. Typically, hot cells are constructed in rows so as to share as many shielding walls as possible. A typical overall length of a row of cells might be 70 yards. A secondary mechanism exists for placing certain objects into a cell. A typical hot cell has been constructed with 8 inch diameter holes through the exterior shielded walls in the vicinity of, and usually above, the viewing windows. It became evident that if the hot cell plugs could be removed and replaced conveniently significant savings in time and personnel exposure could be realized by using these 8 inch holes as entry ports. Fifteen inch cylindrical steel plugs with a diameter of eight inches weigh about two hundred pounds. The shield plug swing mechanism comprises a steel shielding plug mounted on a <b>retraction</b> <b>device</b> that enables the plug to be pulled out of the wall and supports the weight of the pulled out plug. The <b>retraction</b> <b>device</b> is mounted on a hinge, which allows the plug to be swung out of the way so that an operator can insert material into or remove it from the interior of the hot cell and then replace the plug quickly. The hinge mounting transmits the load of the retracted plug to the concrete wall...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: We present 2 {{cases of}} laparoendoscopic single site surgery (LESS) {{splenectomy}} performed with a conventional laparoscope and instruments, {{and the use}} of a novel internal <b>retraction</b> <b>device.</b> Methods: One patient underwent LESS splenectomy for idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), and a pediatric patient with sickle cell disease underwent LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. In each case, a 2 -cm vertical incision was made {{within the confines of the}} umbilical ring, and a SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk CT) inserted. A 5 -mm, 30 -degree laparoscope and standard 5 -mm instruments were used. After isolation of the splenic hilum, one 5 -mm trocar of the SILS port was upsized to 12 mm, and a laparoscopic stapler was used to divide the splenic artery and vein. An internal retractor consisting of a laparoscopic bulldog clamp with a hook attachment was used to retract the gallbladder, and to secure the specimen retrieval bag during splenic extraction, which eliminated the need for a fourth trocar. Results: Total operative time was 160 minutes for the LESS splenectomy, and 216 minutes for the LESS splenectomy and cholecystectomy. Both procedures were successfully completed with conventional instrumentation and a SILS port, without the need for additional incisions or trocars. No complications occurred, and both patients had an uneventful recovery. Conclusions: LESS splenectomy is a feasible procedure that can be performed safely. Although articulating instruments and laparoscopes may offer advantages, they are not necessary for performing LESS splenectomy...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{demonstrate}} the effectiveness of a new kind of disposable autostatic surgical retractor in hernias procedures in order to achieve an easier, faster, and safer surgical intervention. Material and Methods: Between January and March 2008, 42 inguinal hernioplasty procedures have been performed using the 3 PAWS model of ReeTrakt™ a self-retaining, low profile retractor. Equivalent patients samples, in which operations were performed using conventional <b>retraction</b> <b>devices,</b> were considered for comparison of the intra and postoperative results. Results: In all of the 42 inguinal hernioplasty procedures performed, the ReeTrakt™ system has simplified the performance of the surgical team. The retractors were very easy to place. The view of the operating field was always optimal. We also noted a reduction in the operating time. There were no intraoperative complications. No postoperative complications related to the use of this kind of devices occurred. Conversely the amount of peri and postoperative complications in the control group managed with conventional <b>retraction</b> <b>devices</b> was marginally higher than in the ReeTrakt patient group. Conclusion: The ReeTrakt™ system is a very simple and useful low profile retractor for inguinal hernia repair procedures. Its ultra low profile allows a much improved view of the operating field, an unhindered insertion of the surgical instruments and a shortening of intervention time, avoiding the typical problems which arise as a result of standard retractors typically used during this kind of procedure. Due to absolute perpendicular retraction it offers a highly atraumatic performance, avoiding swelling and marks on the insertion sites. Thus in our opinion, reducing the risk of wound oedema, heamatoma or infection, as well as the possible complications of the incision associated with the this surgical procedure...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} the effectiveness of a new kind of disposable surgical retractor in arteriovenous fistula (AVF) procedures in order to achieve an easier, faster and safer surgical intervention. METHODS: Between January and June 2008, 22 AVF procedures were performed using the 3 PAWS ReeTrakt (Insightra Inc. - Irvine, Ca., USA) a self-retaining, low profile retractor. An equivalent patient sample, in which an AVF was performed using conventional <b>retraction</b> <b>devices,</b> was considered for comparison of the intra- and post-operative results. RESULTS: In all of the 22 AVF procedures performed, the ReeTrakt system has simplified the performance of the surgical team. The retractors were very easy to place. The view of the operating field was always optimal. The introduction of the surgical instruments was at all times extremely easy and unrestricted. We also noted a reduction in the operating time (from an average of 67 min in controls to 43 min). There were no intra-operative complications. No post-operative complications related to the use of this kind of device occurred. Conversely, the amount of intra- and post-operative complications in the control group managed with conventional <b>retraction</b> <b>devices</b> was marginally higher than in the ReeTrakt patient group. CONCLUSION: The ReeTrakt system is a very simple and useful low profile retractor for AVF procedures. Its ultra low profile allows a much improved view of the operating field, an unhindered insertion of the surgical instruments and a shortening of intervention time, avoiding the problems which arise as a result of standard retractors typically used during this kind of procedure. Due to absolute perpendicular retraction it offers a highly atraumatic performance, avoiding swelling and marks on the insertion sites. Therefore, in our opinion, it has the potential to reduce the risk of wound oedema, hematomas or infection associated with the AVF procedure. This is important as many patients are elderly with fragile tissues...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Minor {{intraoperative}} bleeding during laparoscopy poses {{a significant}} {{challenge to the}} minimally invasive urologist. We report on our improvement of the previously reported laparoscopic cigarette sponge with absorbable materials. Methods: The sponge was constructed from a strip of absorbable gelatin sponge wrapped in oxidized regenerated cellulose and secured with absorbable suture. This device can be inserted into the laparoscopic field through a standard 12 -mm laparoscopic port and similarly removed. It can also remain intracorporeally if left behind following surgery. Results: The sponge {{has proven to be}} very effective at controlling minor hemorrhage and aiding with dissection and <b>retraction.</b> Conclusion: This <b>device</b> has improved operative safety and provides a useful alternative when laparoscopic bleeding occurs...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the stresses and displacement induced in the periodontium by an active <b>retraction</b> screw <b>device</b> (hycon device) and an active tie back using the finite element analysis. Materials and Methods: A 3 -dimensional {{model of the}} maxillary dentition was designed for the study. A retraction force of 410 and 200 g was applied to simulate the forces generated by the hycon device and an active tie back respectively. The stresses generated by these forces were evaluated on the periodontium at cervix, mid root and apical region. Results: In the present study, maximum amount of tensile stresses {{were found on the}} labio-cervical (0. 4919 and 0. 2945 MPa) aspects of canine, compressive stresses on the linguo-cervical (− 0. 1758 and − 0. 0679 MPa) aspect of the 2 nd premolar and the apical region of all teeth showed low magnitude compressive stresses, with both the loads. The displacement produced by the retraction screw was of the magnitude 0. 172 - 0. 183 mm (0. 177 mm) in the anterior segment and 0. 0065 - 0. 007822 mm (0. 0071 mm) in the posteriors (anchor loss). Active tie backs produce a displacement of 0. 162 - 0. 172 mm in the anterior segment and a negligible amount of displacement in the posteriors. Conclusions: Even though the stress level in the periodontium produced by hycon device was almost 2 - 3 times that of active tie backs, the displacement produced per activation was within the physiological limits and less than the width of the periodontium (0. 20 - 0. 25 mm), which in turn induces bone remodeling...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{individual}} canine <b>retraction</b> using HYCON <b>device</b> and Nickel Titanium closed coil springs. Materials and Methods: The sample consists of 20 patients, 10 males and 10 females. Class 1 bimaxillary protrusion cases {{were selected for}} the study with age group ranging from 14 to 23 years. HYCON device {{was placed on the}} right side of the maxillary arch and Nickel Titanium closed coil spring were placed on left side of the maxillary arch. Lateral cephalograms, OPG and study models were taken before retraction (T 0) and records were taken after retraction (T 1). Results: The duration of this study is for 3 months. HYCON device retracted canines by 2. 42 mm/mo whereas NiTi closed coil spring retracted canines by 1. 34 mm/mo in a period of 3 months. Anchorage loss with a minimal of 1. 40 mm is seen in HYCON device whereas in case of NiTi closed coil spring the anchorage loss was 3. 35 mm. The angular rotation of canines measured was found to be 2. 59 degrees in HYCON device and 10. 80 in NiTi closed coil spring. Clinically and radiologically, in most of the cases canines moved bodily with 1. 90 degrees of tipping for HYCON device while NiTi closed coil spring canine tipping was 6. 95 degrees. Conclusion: For rapid space closure HYCON device is a promising appliance. With HYCON device, canines can be completely retracted in 3 months and there was bodily movement of canines seen in all cases with minimum amount of tipping...|$|R
