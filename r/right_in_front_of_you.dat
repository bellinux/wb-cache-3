The film, entitled , was directed by Bruce Hendricks and produced by Art Repola. The film compiled some of the show's performances, along with backstage footage. Cyrus said Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert was made for individuals who did not attend a concert during the tour due to ticket scalping. She continued, [...] "This is like better than front row. You could reach out and feel like you can touch my hand, you could see me right then, right there, <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> which is so fun." [...] It was released on February1,2008 to American cinema, with an intended span of one week at theaters. The film was released {{to a total of}} 683, with an extra four being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed over $31.1million. With its opening week sales, the film set multiple records.

With a total gross of $70.6million worldwide, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert was once the highest-selling concert film of all time, until surpassed by Michael Jackson's This Is It (2009), which sold over $189million worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|After {{releasing}} Back to Basics, Aguilera considered {{launching a}} tour of small clubs like the Blue Note in New York. [...] "I think there is something really special about doing a performance like that and feeling the energy of a more intimate audience, {{and that is something}} we are definitely, definitely going to entertain in the future", she stated. However, Aguilera considered that it is [...] "a more vulnerable approach for your performance. You can't hide behind anything. It's just you, and your audience is <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> but I still love it. I love to perform more than anything else in the world, being on that stage and feeling the energy of the crowd enjoying your music". However, an arena tour would give her more time to work the bigger show and then strip it down to something raw and organic. Before the tour's launching, Aguilera stated that it was her my most inspired show to date. [...] " [...] lots of amazing circus elements and throwback elements to the past and the areas that I am inspired by. It's just an interesting show to watch and {{to be a part of}} and to use your imagination", she said. Aguilera gave details of the concert, saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|Also {{once again}} turning {{out for this}} tour was John Robb who again ecstatically {{reviewed}} the Manchester date of the tour (14 December 2011 at the HMV Ritz) for his Louder Than War website. [...] Robb singled out for particular praise new album track Vince Taylor (about the 1960s musician of that name) which was premiered on the tour. [...] "Vince Taylor is primetime Adam Ant. It sounds like those off the wall early pop songs like 'Young Parisians' crossed with the 3D filmscapes of the 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' album and sounds like a potential single with its nagging riff in the verses and its great melody. It's great to hear a new song in a near two-hour set of Ant classics and obscurities and is a hint at the healthy future of this remarkable comeback from Adam... People keep talking about the best new band of the year. In a weird way here it is <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> Decades in and Adam Ant sounds fresher than ever, reinvigorated he sounds like he has just started ... As Adam strips down to semi nakedness during the filthy Physical- the long, slow f—k of the set has reached its climax. It seems astonishing {{when you think about}} it but Adam Ant is currently fronting one of the best rock n roll shows in the UK right now." ...|$|E

You can climb up that trellis, Thomas, and lift up that window-sash very carefully, so's not to make no noise, and get in.

There's always a little night lamp burning in it, by which you can see to get about. In the corner, on your right as you go into the room, is a table with my instrument-box standing on it. The box is pretty heavy, and there is a handle on top to carry it by. You needn't be afraid to go in, for by this time they are both sound asleep, and you can pick up the box and walk out as gingerly as a cat, having of course taken your shoes off before you went in. Then you can hand the box out the back window to me,--I can climb up high enough to reach it,--and you can scuttle down, and we'll be off, having the best rig on Williamson Green that I ever heard of in my born days.' ...|$|E
