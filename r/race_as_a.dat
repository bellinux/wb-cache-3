At the age of fifteen, he took up {{a job at the}} Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg, the {{national}} railway company of the Indies, in Semarang. In 1911 he chose to leave the company as he was disgusted by its racist policies, including the use of <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> basis for the amount paid in wages.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy {{in a radio}} broadcast on November 3, painting the <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> choice between a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not indulge in negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E

5|$|Blacklock (1814 – 24 February 1831) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse who won {{seventeen}} of his twenty-three races. As {{a two-year-old}} in 1816 he was undefeated in three starts. In his first <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> three-year-old he {{finished second in}} the St. Leger, a neck behind Ebor. He then won four races in two weeks, including the Gascoigne Stakes and Dundas Stakes. In 1818 he recorded several wins including two of the Great Subscription Purses at York. He won a third Great Subscription Purse in 1819, along with the York Gold Cup. After retiring from racing, Blacklock became a successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain in 1829, the year his son Voltaire won the Doncaster Cup. He was owned by Thomas Kirby as a two-year-old, before being purchased by Richard Watt, who owned him for the remainder of his racing career. Blacklock was trained by Tommy Sykes.|$|E

5|$|In the 1500m, Talbot {{decided that}} Windle would {{attack from the}} outset and attempt to hang on in the latter stages of the race. They also worked on Windle's technique, curing his habit of {{dropping}} his elbow to a lower position when he was tired. Windle broke the Olympic record in the heats {{with a time of}} 17min 15.9s to qualify fastest for the final by more than six seconds. In the final, Windle repeated the strategy of sprinting from the start, leading throughout to lower his own Olympic record to 17min 1.7s and holding off American John Nelson by 1.3s. Windle's tactics disrupted the raceplan of the Americans; Nelson and world record holder Roy Saari had planned to pace each other throughout the race, but ended up reacting to Windle instead of swimming their own <b>race.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, Saari finished in seventh place, far outside his global standard.|$|E
5|$|Not all cyclists were {{competing}} for the victory; some only joined as tourists. The most notable of them was Henri Pépin. Pépin had hired two riders, Jean Dargassies and Henri Gauban, to ride with him. They treated the <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pleasure ride, stopping for lunch when they chose and spending {{the night in the}} best hotels they could find. Dargassies and Gaubin became the first cyclists {{in the history of the}} Tour de France to ride not for their own placings but for another rider's interest. During the race, they found another Tour de France competitor, Jean-Marie Teychenne, lying in a ditch. They helped him get up and fed him; from then on Teychenne also helped Pépin.|$|E
5|$|One of Barack Obama's first {{decisions}} as president-elect was to appoint Hillary Clinton, US Senator from New York and former Democratic presidential primary opponent, as Secretary of State; Clinton resigned her Senate seat {{to take the}} position. The district's seat became vacant in January 2009 when Governor David Paterson appointed Gillibrand to the United States Senate to replace Clinton. On February 23, 2009, Governor Paterson issued a proclamation setting the date for the special election as March 31, 2009. Under state law, Paterson was not required to issue a proclamation for a special election until July 2010. Both the Rothenberg Political Report and the Cook Political Report listed the <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> toss-up.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 purse {{was set at}} $150,000, {{but fewer}} than 15 mushers {{finished}} the race that year, meaning the money allotted for the final two prizes were distributed {{to each of the}} 13 mushers who finished. The purse peaked at $200,000 in 2007, and winner Lance Mackey took home $40,000. In 2014, the purse was $115,000, but only 11 mushers finished the race, fewer than the number of paying positions. Rather than distribute the extra money to the finishers, the race chose to roll over the unused prize money into the 2015 <b>race.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, the 2015 Yukon Quest will have a purse of more than $127,000.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet {{stopped in}} Danzig, Swinemünde, and Flensburg, {{where it was}} greeted by units of the German Navy; Kaiser Karl der Grosse and the main German fleet was {{anchored}} at Swinemünde for the occasion. The visit was strained by the growing Anglo-German naval arms <b>race.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of the British visit, the 1905 autumn maneuvers (6 to 13 September) were shortened considerably, consisting only of exercises in the North Sea. The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight, and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe. In November, the I Squadron cruised in the Baltic. In early December, the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise, this time to Danzig, where they arrived on 12 December. While on the return trip to Kiel, the fleet conducted tactical exercises.|$|E
5|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} previous year's winner Franco Chioccioli. According to author Bill McGann, Miguel Indurain {{came into the}} race with the aims of riding it for preparation for the Tour de France in July. Claudio Chiappucci came into the <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> contender after finishing on the podium at the previous season's Giro d'Italia and Tour de France. The Spanish newspaper El País believed Indurain to be the favorite heading into {{the first day of}} racing. However, the newspaper did state that his chances were lower since his teammate Jean-François Bernard was not participating in the race due to an injury. l'Unità writer Dario Ceccarelli and Avui writer Recuero believed that Chiappucci and Indurain were the favorites to win the overall crown. Spanish newspaper Diari de Girona named Indurain, Chiappucci, Laurent Fignon, and Massimiliano Lelli the main contenders to win the race.|$|E

5|$|Wizard's first <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> five-year-old was a {{sweepstakes}} of 100 guineas each on 20 April at Newmarket. He faced three {{opponents and}} won the race from odds-on favourite Spaniard. He was then intended to face 1810 Derby winner Whalebone at Newmarket in early May, but Whalebone's owner, the 4th Duke of Grafton, paid a forfeit and the race never took place. He beat Middlethorpe at Newmarket after Middlethorpe unseated his rider {{in the early stages}} of the race. The match against Middlethorpe won him 500 guineas. The following day he beat Anthonio over five and a half furlongs. He faced Middlethorpe again in September when he fell lame and Middlethorpe beat him. This was his final race and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career Wizard earned 3850 guineas.|$|E
5|$|Blacklock, still unnamed, had {{his first}} <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> three-year-old in the St. Leger Stakes at Doncaster on Monday 22 September. He did not arrive at Doncaster until the Saturday before, and after reports that he was amiss his odds had {{lengthened}} {{to as much as}} 10/1 in the betting. After arriving, he had a gallop in the afternoon and soon shortened in the betting. After another of the pre-race favourites, Stainborough, was withdrawn due to illness Blacklock was sent off as the short-priced favourite at about evens. Blacklock appeared {{like he was going to}} win easily and Jackson eased him up in the final furlong (200 metres) of the race. However, Ebor and Restless began to quickly close down his lead. By the time Jackson realised, Blacklock could not accelerate quick enough and Ebor came out on top, beating Blacklock by a neck. Restless finished in third place and was the only other runner that could be placed by the judge. Blacklock had a crack in one of his hind heels, which was thought to have affected him in the race.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{played a}} variety of roles in the {{following}} season. First, Kapono was temporarily moved to the starting shooting guard spot after the Raptors fired head coach Sam Mitchell. When Calderón was injured, Parker had to fill in {{as the starting point}} guard. After struggling in December, he hit good form in January and helped the Raptors inch towards a better record after the team went 16–28. Although Parker eventually regained his starting spot, Toronto fell further behind the playoff <b>race</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of changing rosters and inconsistent performances, dropping to 21–34 just before the All-Star break. The shooting guard's offensive output was also erratic throughout the season, and the Raptors all but fell out of the playoffs picture by March. The Raptors eventually concluded the regular season with only 33 wins, with Parker suffering a significant drop in his numbers (shooting percentage and points per game). His future remained uncertain as he was due to become a free agent, but he expressed a desire to return to Toronto for the next season. With Toronto selecting shooting guard DeMar DeRozan in the 2009 NBA draft, that uncertainy was compounded.|$|E
