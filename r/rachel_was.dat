5|$|Monica (Courteney Cox) {{tells her}} friends {{that she will}} not be cooking a turkey for Thanksgiving because of the large amount of {{leftovers}} it will create. Chandler does not eat turkey {{as a result of his}} dislike of all Thanksgiving foods (a result of childhood trauma), Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow's character) is a vegetarian and <b>Rachel</b> <b>was</b> having an aversion to poultry from her pregnancy. This left only Monica, Ross and Joey to eat the enormous turkey. Joey (Matt LeBlanc) protests, and announces that he will eat the entire turkey himself if necessary. Monica agrees, and Joey finishes the nineteen-pound turkey by the end of the episode. Monica tells Rachel that she has invited over an old high-school friend of hers and Ross's called Will Colbert (Brad Pitt).

A virtually unknown actress at the time who had previously starred in five short-lived sitcoms, Aniston auditioned {{for the role of}} Rachel after turning down an offer as a cast member on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. After acquiring the role and before Friends aired, Aniston was temporarily at risk of being recast because she had also been involved with another sitcom, Muddling Through, at the time, which was ultimately canceled and allowed Aniston to remain on Friends.|$|E

5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and <b>Rachel</b> <b>was</b> decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E
