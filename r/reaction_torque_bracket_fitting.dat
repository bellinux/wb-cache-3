40|$|Owing to the {{dynamics}} coupling between a free-floating base and a manipulator, the non-stationary {{base of a}} space robot will face the issue of base disturbance due to a manipulator’s motion. The <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted on the satellite base’s centroid is an important index to measure the satellite base’s disturbance. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is made, and a novel way to derive the analytical form of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is proposed. In addition, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space is derived, in which the manipulator’s joint motion is dynamically decoupled from {{the motion of the}} satellite base, and its novel expression demonstrates the equivalence between the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space and the reaction null-space. Furthermore, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted as an optimization index can be utilized to achieve satellite base disturbance minimization in the generalized Jacobian-based end-effector Cartesian path tracking task. Besides, supposing that the redundant degrees of freedom are abundant to achieve reaction torque-based active control, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> can be used to realize satellite base attitude control, that is, base attitude adjustment or maintenance. Moreover, because reaction torque-based control is a second-order control scheme, joint torque minimization can be regarded as the optimization task in reaction torque-based active or in-active control. A real-time simulation system of a 7 -DOF space robot under Linux/RTAI is developed to verify and test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed ideas. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the corresponding analysis about the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is correct and the proposed methods are feasible...|$|R

It is assumed that since the solar paddle attachments to the hub of the spacecraft are not rigidly locked, the effect of the solar panels can be replaced by a constant <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acting on the hub of the spacecraft. This could result in the satellite having an equilibrium motion about an axis displaced from the nominal axis of symmetry. The variational equations of motion are developed about such an equilibrium position using the SAS-A spacecraft as a model. Energy dissipation on the rotor as well as the main body is included.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} two novel redundancy resolution schemes {{aimed at}} locally minimizing the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> {{transferred to the}} spacecraft during manipulator manoeuvres. The subject {{is of particular interest}} in space robotics because reduced reactions result in reduced energy consumption and longer operating life of the attitude control system. The first presented solution is based on a weighted Jacobian pseudoinverse and is derived by using Lagrangian multipliers. The weight matrix is defined by means of the inertia matrix which appears in the spacecraft <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> dynamics. The second one is based on a least squares formulation of the minimization problem. In this formulation the linearity of the forward kinematics and of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> dynamics equations with respect to the joint accelerations is used. A closed-form solution is derived for both the presented methods, and their equivalence is proven analytically. Moreover, the proposed solutions, which are suitable for real-time implementation, are extended in order {{to take into account the}} physical limits of the manipulator joints directly inside the solution algorithms. A software simulator has been developed in order to simulate the performance of the presented solutions for the selected test cases. The proposed solutions have then been experimentally tested using a 3 D free-flying robot previously tested in an ESA parabolic flight campaign. In the test campaign the 3 D robot has been converted in a 2 D robot thanks to its modularity in order to perform planar tests, in which the microgravity environment can be simulated without time constraints.

The interesting performances that can be achieved {{with a high level of}} redundancy are analyzed in this paper in case of minimizing the base <b>reaction</b> <b>torques,</b> forces, or weighted combinations of them. The Zero Reaction Workspace in which a null <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is possible has been computed for different space manipulators with increasing degrees of freedom, showing that it can be significantly increased by increasing the available degree of redundancy.

40|$|In space {{robotics}} missions, {{either in}} the scenario of space servicing or debris capture, both the minimization of the energy required for the manipulator manoeuvre and the minimization of the reactions transferred to the base spacecraft are of crucial importance. Indeed, {{both of them are}} related to the possibility of having a longer system operative life in space: for the energy minimization this is straightforward, and for the reaction minimization {{this is due to the}} fact that the Attitude Control System is going to spend less fuel for attitude recovery and correct pointing of antennas after the manipulator manoeuvre if the reactions transferred to the base spacecraft have been minimized. In this paper, a minimum kinetic energy inverse kinematics solution for redundant manipulators has been introduced and validated by simulation. Its performance has been compared to the classical inverse kinematics solution which minimizes joint velocities and to the one that minimizes the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> transferred to the base spacecraft for a 3 -degrees-of-freeedom planar manipulator. Two different end-effector trajectories have been used for validation and then for the comparison of the different inverse kinematics solutions in terms of: total energy required for performing the task, maximum required power, maximum kinetic energy, maximum <b>reaction</b> <b>torque,</b> and maximum joint angles, velocities, and accelerations. Finally, the new concept of iso-energy curve has been introduced, and a set of them has been drawn over the robot workspaces, which have been computed using the kinetic energy minimization solution and the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> minimization solution, considering or not the robot joint limits.

40|$|The {{capture of}} non-cooperative targets {{is a key}} {{priority}} for future space robotics missions. Typical operative scenarios are the maintenance and refuelling of malfunctioning satellites or the capture of space debris. In these operative scenarios, {{one of the key}} issues to be addressed is the impact force minimization: a null relative velocity of the robot end-effector with respect to the target is required at the time of capture, otherwise either the target or the robotic system could be damaged, the target could be pushed away, or the chaser spacecraft attitude could be destabilized. On the other hand, it is always desirable that the <b>reaction</b> <b>torques</b> transferred by the manipulator to the base spacecraft are minimized, so that a small amount of fuel is used for the attitude recovery, which is required to maintain the communication link with the ground after the robotic manoeuvre, thus increasing the system operating life. In this paper, two novel methods are proposed and compared for capturing a non-cooperative target with a redundant robot and in the meantime transferring a null <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> to the base spacecraft. This is a great advantage with respect to {{the state of the art}} capture methods, in which the problem of capture and of reactions minimization are handled separately and their integration is not straightforward. In the first method, the robot end-effector follows a parametric trajectory, which parameters are computed in order to have the same direction and speed of the target at the time of capture. On the other hand, in the second method the end-effector trajectory is computed by making the position and velocity error converge to zero inside the inverse kinematics control loop. The proposed methods have been demonstrated and compared by means of dynamic simulations of a 3 -degrees-of-freedom planar manipulator. Both of them have shown a good performance and in particular in both cases the manipulator is able to reach the target with the desired end-effector velocity and with a null <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> transferred to the base spacecraft...|$|R
