25|$|Academics Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg {{have criticized}} Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan {{for his role}} in the {{promotion}} and rise in tech stocks. Their research cites numerous examples of Greenspan putting a positive spin on historic stock valuations despite a wealth of evidence suggesting that stocks were overvalued.|$|E
25|$|Facing {{opposition}} in Congress for an initially proposed $1.6 trillion tax cut (over ten years), Bush held town hall-style public meetings {{across the nation}} in 2001 to increase public support for it. Bush {{and some of his}} economic advisers argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers. With reports of the threat of recession, Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan said tax cuts could work but must be offset with spending cuts.|$|E
25|$|John Linder {{asserts that}} an {{estimated}} 11 trillion dollars is {{currently held in}} foreign accounts, largely for tax purposes, and is growing by $800 billion per year. Former Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan predicts that enactment of the FairTax {{would result in a}} large portion of those funds being transferred to U.S. banks, where they would become available to U.S. capital markets, bringing down interest rates, and otherwise promoting economic growth in the United States instead of the countries where those funds are currently held.|$|E

"Irrational exuberance" [...] is {{a phrase}} {{used by the}} then-Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>chairman,</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan, in a speech given at the American Enterprise Institute during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. The phrase was {{interpreted}} as a warning that the market might be overvalued.|$|R
500|$|The {{possibility}} of the euro becoming the first international reserve currency is now widely debated among economists. Former US Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan gave his opinion in September 2007 that it was [...] "absolutely conceivable that the euro will replace the US dollar as reserve currency, or will be traded as an equally important reserve currency". In contrast to Greenspan's 2007 assessment, the euro's increase in {{the share of the}} worldwide currency reserve basket has slowed considerably since 2007 and {{since the beginning of the}} worldwide credit crunch related recession and European sovereign-debt crisis.|$|E
500|$|Many {{economists and}} world governments {{determined}} that the situation became the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial, according to former Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan. Bush, meanwhile, proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back {{a large portion of}} the U.S. mortgage market. Vince Reinhardt, a former Federal Reserve economist now at the American Enterprise Institute, said [...] "it would have helped for the Bush administration to empower the folks at Treasury and the Federal Reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the FDIC to look at these issues more closely", and additionally, that it would have helped [...] "for Congress to have held hearings".|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the publication of The Fountainhead, Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated [...] "The Collective") included future Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara, and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, Atlas Shrugged, as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's {{close relationship with the}} younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.|$|E

Following a breakfast with Federal <b>Reserve</b> Bank <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan, Prakash and other new members were sworn-in on December 6, 2005 by U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez who administered the oath of Office. White House Chief of Staff, Andrew H. Card, Jr., attended the swearing-in ceremony, representing the President.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{chapters}} {{focus on}} individuals other than Rand. The first discusses her former protege and lover, Branden. The next covers her heir, Peikoff. The last of these chapters {{is about the}} most famous member of the Collective, former Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan. Walker then turns to Rand's ideas, accusing her of dogmatism, ignorance, and flawed thinking. A chapter about her [...] "dark side" [...] describes her as hostile and domineering.|$|R
500|$|The {{surplus in}} fiscal year 2000 was $237 billion—the third {{consecutive}} surplus and the largest surplus ever. In 2001, Bush's budget estimated {{that there would be}} a $5.6trillion surplus over the next ten years. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held townhall style meetings across the U.S. in order to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35trillion tax cut program—one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. Bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers, saying [...] "the surplus is not the government's money. The surplus is the people's money." [...] Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan warned of a recession and Bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine Social Security. O'Neill disputes the claim, made in Bush's book Decision Points, that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts. By 2003, the economy showed signs of improvement, though job growth remained stagnant. Another tax cut program was passed that year.|$|E
2500|$|Former Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan {{praised the}} Sarbanes–Oxley Act in 2005: [...] "I am {{surprised}} that the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, so rapidly developed and enacted, has functioned {{as well as it}} has...the act importantly reinforced the principle that shareholders own our corporations and that corporate managers should be working on behalf of shareholders to allocate business resources to their optimum use." ...|$|E

And to uphold our currency's soundness, it must be recognized and honored as legal tender and counterfeiting must be effectively thwarted," [...] Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan said at a ceremony unveiling the $20 bill's new design. Prior to the current design, the most recent redesign of the U.S. dollar bill was in 1996.|$|E
50|$|In January 1995, {{one year}} after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and {{immediately}} after Rubin was sworn in as Secretary of Treasury, Mexico was suffering through a financial crisis that threatened to result in it defaulting on its foreign obligations. President Bill Clinton, with the advice of Secretary Rubin and Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan, provided $20 billion in US loan guarantees to the Mexican government through the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the wake}} of the dot-com crash and the {{subsequent}} 2001-2002 recession the Federal Reserve dramatically lowered interest rates to historically low levels, from about 6.5% to just 1%. This spurred easy credit for banks to make loans. By 2006 the rates had moved up to 5.25% which lowered the demand and increased the monthly payments for adjustable rate mortgages. The resulting foreclosures increased supply, dropping housing prices further. Former Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan admitted that the housing bubble was [...] "fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{some have}} spoken {{out in favor}} of {{moderate}} inequality as a form of incentive, others have warned against the current high levels of inequality, including Yale Nobel prize for economics winner Robert J. Shiller, (who called rising economic inequality [...] "the most important problem that we are facing now today"), former Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan, ("This is not the type of thing which a democratic society – a capitalist democratic society – can really accept without addressing"), and President Barack Obama (who referred to the widening income gap as the [...] "defining challenge of our time").|$|R
2500|$|Former U.S. Federal <b>Reserve</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan {{said that}} {{the founders of the}} Austrian School [...] "reached far into the future from when most of them practiced and have had a {{profound}} and, in my judgment, probably an irreversible effect on how most mainstream economists think in this country". In 1987, Nobel Laureate James M. Buchanan [...] told an interviewer, [...] "I have no objections to being called an Austrian. Hayek and Mises might consider me an Austrian but, surely some of the others would not." [...] Chinese economist Zhang Weiying supports some Austrian theories such as the Austrian theory of the business cycle.|$|E

They calculate that in the absence of both a monetary and fiscal response, unemployment would have peaked at about 16.5% instead of about 10%, the peak to trough GDP decline would have been about 12% instead of 4%. Despite the lack of deficit spending, without the intervention the 2010 and 2011 US federal budget deficit was forecast to be almost two times larger, due to the predicted collapse of tax receipts.|$|R

5000|$|At a July 13, 2004, Senate Banking Committee {{hearing on}} the effects of the GLBA five years after passage, the Legislative Director of the Consumer Federation cited Roger Ferguson’s 2003 speech and stated the “extravagant promises” of {{universal}} banking had “proven to be mostly hype.” He noted that advocates of repealing Sections 20 and 32 had said “banks, securities firms, and insurance companies would merge into financial services supermarkets” and, after five years, some mergers had occurred “but mostly within the banking industry, not across sectors.” Within the banking industry, Federal <b>Reserve</b> Board <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> Greenspan testified to Congress in 2004 that commercial bank consolidation had “slowed sharply in the past five years.” ...|$|R
5000|$|While bubbles may be {{identifiable}} in progress, bubbles can be definitively measured only {{in hindsight}} after a market correction, {{which began in}} 2005-2006 for the U.S. housing market.

These models confirm that the recent behavior of long-term yields has been unusual-that is, it cannot be explained {{within the framework of}} the models. Therefore, we consider other macroeconomic factors omitted from the models and find that some of these variables, particularly declines in long-term bond volatility, may explain a portion of the conundrum.
