25|$|From an {{agricultural}} perspective, however, the Geopark {{is simply an}} area of poorly drained grazing that becomes progressively less useful as its altitude increases. Nevertheless, the lower slopes of the inlier are still sufficiently valuable to be enclosed, largely with drystone walling, and are used for grazing sheep and cattle. Fell ponies are also <b>raised</b> <b>here.</b> Immediately above the village, this area is known as Red Carle.|$|E
25|$|Most of the municipality's {{population}} {{lives in the}} city proper, with most jobs located in the manufacturing and commerce sectors here. About 250,000 hectares are under cultivation in the city's outskirts, most of which is near the coast. Crops include wheat, grapes, flowers, chickpeas, alfalfa and walnuts. Livestock has been traditionally important here, especially beef cattle. Pigs, sheep, goats, horses, domestic fowl and bees are also <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> as well. Fishing is practiced along the coast with shrimp being the most important catch.|$|E

60|$|The {{fundamental}} {{trouble is}} {{that men and women}} are different creatures, with different minds and different aptitudes and different paths in life.

The point lies in the fact that they are different.|$|R
25|$|Colonization: The Assyrians, in {{conjunction}} with their deportation (see below) would also send {{some of their own}} into foreign lands and settle them as colonists. The primary aim was to establish a loyal power base; taxes, food and troops could be <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> as reliably as at their homeland, or at least it must have been hoped. Furthermore, their presence would bring innumerable benefits; resistance to other conquerors, a counter to any rebellions by the natives and assist the provincial Assyrian governors in ensuring that the vassal state was loyal to Assyria.|$|E
25|$|About 75% of the municipality’s land is {{dedicated}} to agriculture and pasture, with about 47% of the municipality’s population dedicated to it, as well as crafts. Main crops include corn, beans, chili peppers and oranges. Livestock <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> includes cattle, pigs, sheep and horses. There is some logging done.

25|$|Most of the {{municipality}} now {{is dedicated to}} agriculture and livestock. The main crop is corn along with other grains such as alfalfa, wheat and oats. There are {{a significant number of}} orchards here producing walnuts, pears, apples, capulins and other fruit. The municipality is the major producer of walnuts in Mexico. Livestock <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> includes pigs, cattle, sheep and domestic fowl. One important agricultural activity there is the production and conservation of traditional varieties of corn. Like other communities in the area, there are three main varieties of corn planted where {{as well as a number}} of minor varieties. These are planted mostly as a trial or because of their special characteristics, not to compete with the three main varieties. In local markets, these farmers are able to sell these local varieties as well as exchange seed to maintain genetic variety.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the biggest}} issues of {{development}} is {{the management of the}} so-called “deep determinants” of economic growth and development.

Industry consists on only small scale operations that produce locally needed products such as processed foods, textiles, furniture and bricks. Likewise, most commerce is of a local nature.

However, this accusation came from the Belgian Social Democrats, and was <b>raised</b> <b>here</b> by Henry Charles. Peukert and the Gruppe Autonomie published a rebuttal of these allegations which appeared in the Anarchist, which also accused Dave of being a spy.
