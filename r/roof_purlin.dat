The fireplace in the south chamber of the parlour wing is particularly fine, according to Lake. There is an intact roof truss, and the main roof timbers meet vertically underneath the <b>roof</b> <b>purlin,</b> which Lake considers characteristic of Cheshire timber framing of the 15th century. Traces of internal decoration survive, with red ochre on the roof timbers contrasting with white limewash on the wattle and daub panels of the roof truss.|$|E
50|$|The Netherlands {{is often}} {{overlooked}} for its timbered houses, yet many exist, including windmills. It was in North Holland where {{the import of}} cheaper timber, combined with the Dutch innovation of windmill-powered sawmills, allowed economically viable widespread use of protective wood covering over framework. In the late 17th century the Dutch introduced vertical cladding also known in Eastern England as clasp board and in western England as weatherboard, then as more wood was available more cheaply, horizontal cladding in the 17th century. Perhaps owing to economic considerations, vertical cladding returned to fashion. Dutch wall framing is virtually always built in bents and the three basic types of roof framing are the rafter <b>roof,</b> <b>purlin</b> roof, and ridge-post roof.|$|E

5000|$|Common purlins in wood construction, {{also called}} a [...] "major-rafter minor-purlin system". Common purlins are {{typically}} [...] "trenched through" [...] the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying {{this type of}} <b>roof</b> system).

No examples of framed buildings with common <b>purlin</b> <b>roofs</b> have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common <b>purlin</b> <b>roofs.</b> Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada.

A <b>purlin</b> <b>roof</b> consists of horizontal logs that are notched into the gable-wall logs. The latter are progressively shortened to form the characteristic triangular gable end.

Flatter roofed cabins might have had only 2 or 3 gable-wall logs while steeply pitched roofs might have had as many gable-wall logs as a full story. Issues related to eave overhang and a porch also influenced the layout of the cabin.|$|R

40|$|When used as {{secondary}} <b>roof</b> <b>purlins,</b> cold-formed steel (CFS) sections {{are often}} attached to trapezoidal sheets through self-drilling screws {{to form a}} complete roofing system. The load application points are often eccentric to the shear centre, and thus inevitably generate a torsional moment that will induce twisting and/or warping deformations in addition to bending deflection. The connections between <b>purlin</b> and <b>roof</b> sheeting provide a restraining effect on purlin members by preventing such lateral and twisting movements, and hence have a beneficial effect on the load-carrying capacity. In this thesis the interactional behaviour of CFS purlin-sheeting system have been investigated through the following steps: (1) A F-test is carried out to measure the rotational stiffness at the connections, an engineering-orientated model is developed for quantifying the rotational stiffness regardless to purlin and sheet geometry and loading directions; (2) A set of loading tests on Z- and Σ- roof system are conducted to investigate the impact of rotational stiffness on the overall structural performance, load-carrying capacity and buckling behaviour of the system; (3) Finite element simulations of the existing tests are carried out and successfully validated; (4) Numerical parametric studies are established to study other factors that could affect the rotational stiffness...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an investigation into}} the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel zed- and channel-section purlins when subjected to uplift loading in purlin-sheeting systems. In pre-buckling, an analytical model is presented to describe the bending and twisting behaviour of partially restrained zed- and channel-section purlins when subjected to uplift loading. Formulae used to calculate the bending stresses of the <b>roof</b> <b>purlins</b> are derived by using the classical bending theory of thin-walled beams. Detailed comparisons are made between the present model and the simplified model proposed in Eurocode EN 1993 - 1 - 3. In buckling, a numerical investigation is presented on the buckling behaviour of partially restrained cold formed steel zed- and channel-section purlins when subject to transverse distributed uplift loading. The buckling behaviour of zed- and channel-section purlins of different dimensions subjected to uplift loading under the influence of rotational spring stiffness applied on the middle line of the upper flange is examined. In the post-buckling, nonlinear finite element analysis models are created for the partially restrained cold-formed steel zed- and channel-section purlins subjected to transverse uniformly distributed uplift loading. The analyses are performed by considering both geometric and material nonlinearities, and corresponding design curves of zed- and channel-section purlins are established...|$|R
