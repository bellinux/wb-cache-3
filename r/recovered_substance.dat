40|$|Magister Psychologiae - MPsychSubstance {{abuse is}} a public health concern in South Africa, and Western Cape Province in {{particular}} {{has been identified as}} having alarming rates of substance abuse. Substance abuse is the cause {{of some of the most}} pervasive and costly problems in society. Substance abuse is associated with various social problems such as crime, violence, unemployment, poverty, risky sexual behaviours, the escalation of chronic diseases such as AIDS and TB, and dysfunctional family life – and these problems are often interlinked. Furthermore, substance disorders place a huge strain on the health and welfare system of South Africa. In- and outpatient treatment facilities exist in communities to assist with alleviating the problem of substance abuse. Aftercare facilities are a form of outpatient service for substance abusers who have completed inpatient treatment. The primary aim of aftercare is to assist <b>recovered</b> <b>substance</b> abusers to maintain treatment gains by abstaining from substance use and to facilitate their reintegration with their families and communities. The purpose of the present study was to explore and obtain an in-depth understanding of the experiences of rehabilitated substance abusers in aftercare, following their completion of inpatient treatment. The sampling method for the study was purposive, and the sample consisted of two female and six male participants. Participants' attendance at the aftercare programme was verified with the aftercare coordinator. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and data were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Results of the study found that, overall, participants had a positive experience of aftercare. Furthermore, results indicated that aftercare played a vital role in assisting participants to maintain treatment gains...|$|E
40|$|Substance use {{disorders}} are a growing global public health concern. Recognized by the DSM-V and ICD- 10 as a chronic psychiatric disorder, substance use disorders cause significant morbidity and mortality, accounting for almost 5 % {{of the global}} burden of disease. Substance abusers {{are at increased risk}} for psychiatric conditions and have higher rates of comorbid disease, including: HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Tuberculosis. Economically, substance use disorders cost the United States over 193 billion dollars each year through costs incurred by the criminal court system, healthcare costs from increased morbidity, and loss of productivity from disability and incarceration. The negative stigma attached to addicts and addition causes many individuals to deny their illness and avoid treatment. Significant disparities exist in subsets of the US population in both the prevalence of substance use disorders as well as access and referral to treatment. Individuals from the LGBT community, active service members of the US military, military veterans, women and incarcerated individuals face considerable barriers in accessing treatment. These disorders, due to their chronic nature, require long-term prevention efforts and continued treatment throughout the affected individual’s life. <b>Recovered</b> <b>substance</b> abusers are always at risk for relapse, particularly when they lack support, coping skills and understanding from their community. Substance use {{disorders are}} affected by environmental and genetic factors, as well as gene-environment interactions. Through the use of better prevention efforts, improved treatment protocols and changes to the criminal justice system, the public health burden in the United States can be lowered, improving the economy, and setting a positive example for other countries to emulate. Incorporating the information known about genetics and addiction into current treatment practices could have significant positive effects on treatment outcomes and future prevention efforts, improving the overall health of the public...|$|E

40|$|An ethnographic {{research}} project at Eastern Kentucky University (EKU) in Richmond, Kentucky, helps senior occupational science (OS) students’ transition into the masters’ in occupational therapy program by affording {{the opportunity to}} understand and apply social advocacy concepts to their future occupational therapy practice. Advocacy, in its most simple form, means to support a cause, which can take {{the shape of an}} individual, event, or circumstance and the purposeful actions causing an effect or consequence (Merriam-Webster’s, 2011). For these students’, the principle of doing, or carrying out an advocacy {{research project}}, helps to create their occupational identity (Crepeau, Cohn, 2 ̆ 6 Schell, 2003) and enables the students to understand the impact of occupations on individuals’ sense of health and well-being (Royeen, 2003). The Liberty Place House of Recovery for Women (Liberty Place), in Richmond, Kentucky, is a state-funded, six - twelve month community residential program that seeks to adequately serve Kentucky women who are <b>recovering</b> <b>substance</b> abusers (“About the Program,” para. 4). Assisting Liberty Place in advocating for the women, the students offer their skills in organizing an employment fair, matching the women with local employers, and understanding the women’s employment needs. Students begin to address the women’s needs, rights, and interests in employment while learning fundamental occupational therapy principles in the area of work, such as clients’ (1) managing work time, (2) redeveloping work habits and skills, and (3) work-related social behaviors (Early, 2008).

40|$|The {{major concern}} is that the church is not {{actively}} involved with solving the substance abuse dilemma that is disturbing communities nationwide, especially within the Black communities. The validity of this characterization is supported by the understanding that most congregational members generally view substance abusers as sinners, excluded from God 2 ̆ 7 s mercy and concern. This problem intensifies when considering that substance abuse treatment and aftercare residential facilities are available to 15 percent, or less, of approximately 18 million alcoholics and 5. 5 million drug abusers. Since there are no established standards for ministering to substance abusers, the church must be relevant to causes and cures of all issues that are contributing factors to human destructiveness resulting from substance abuse. This study focuses on examining and exploring some initiatives for confronting this nation 2 ̆ 7 s substance abuse predicament. The design for this inquiry was organized into three phases. Phase I involves examining possibilities to form a substance abuse group recovery home, to prove that any religious body can set up one with a reasonable amount of economic planning and without government financial support. Phase II consists of exploring opportunities to develop a simple biblical and spiritual growth study guide for community and congregational use. Phase III involves conducting a feasibility study for establishing a comprehensive relationship between a local substance abuse treatment center and churches located within the vicinity of the center for creating a healing community with a wholistic approach. Study conclusions provided sufficient information that a self-supported and self-governed group recovery home could be operated and function under the directions of a religious body, without government assistance. Current operations of the Agape House Ministry is the result of this phase. Completion of a social analysis survey of <b>recovering</b> <b>substance</b> abusers in a local treatment center, dialoguing with a recovering person, and conducting a study of two groups (<b>recovering</b> <b>substance</b> abusers 2 ̆ 6 congregational members) provided the format for developing a simple study guide.

Objective: To determine the effects of acupuncture on withdrawal symptoms in <b>recovering</b> <b>substance</b> abusers. Methods: We completed a structured literature review to investigate the effects of acupuncture of withdrawal symptoms. Results: Of all of the studies examined (n= 16), seven studies reported that acupuncture significantly improved withdrawal symptoms compared to the control group.

Several biases and confounders were inherent of the treatment methods and study population. Limitations included only searching two databases and potentially too stringent of inclusion criteria. Future studies should explore ways to increase blinding techniques, as well as select specific drugs and withdrawal symptoms to analyze. Conclusion: The majority of studies indicated no difference between the experimental and control groups. The significance of these findings suggest that more research is needed, and until more compelling results emerge, acupuncture may not be considered evidence-based...|$|R
