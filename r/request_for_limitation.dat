5000|$|The {{talks were}} beset {{by a number}} of {{difficulties}} from the outset. Among these were disagreements over what constituted [...] "offensive" [...] and [...] "defensive" [...] weapons, and the polarization of France and Germany. The increasingly military-minded German governments could see no reason why their country could not enjoy the same level of armaments as other powers, especially France. The French, for their part, were equally insistent that German military inferiority was their only insurance from future conflict as serious as they had endured in the First World War. As for the British and US governments, they were unprepared to offer the additional security commitments that France <b>requested</b> in exchange <b>for</b> <b>limitation</b> of French armaments.|$|R

40|$|We are {{studying}} the combined problem of generating a timetable and student schedules from initial data that includes student course requests, the number of sections allowed of each course, {{the maximum number of}} students allowed into each course, and the maximum number of times available in the timetable.

The goal, given the initial input, is to develop a timetable indicating the time at which each section of a course will be offered as well as a schedule for each student indicating the times at which the courses requested are scheduled.

The restrictions for reopening the permit are as follows: (1) The permittee has properly operated and maintained the TEDF for a sufficient period to stabilize treatment plant operations, but has nevertheless been unable to achieve the limitation specified in the permit. (2) Effluent data submitted by the permittee supports the effluent limitation modifications(s).
