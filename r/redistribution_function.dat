The principal aim {{of this paper is}} presentation of the RF by Guilbert (1981) which is corrected for the computational errors in the original paper. This corrected RF was used in the series of papers on model atmosphere computations of hot neutron stars. We have also organized four existing algorithms for the RF computations into a unified form ready to use in radiative transfer and model atmosphere codes. The exact method by Nagirner and Poutanen (1993) was numerically compared to all other algorithms in a very wide spectral range from hard X-rays to radio waves.

This <b>redistribution</b> <b>function</b> includes both coherent (R_II) and incoherent (R_III) scattering contributions with their branching ratios. methods: The expressions were derived by applying the formalism outlined above. The statistical equilibrium equation for the atomic density matrix is first formally solved {{in the case of}} the two-term atom with unpolarized and infinitely sharp lower levels. Then the <b>redistribution</b> <b>function</b> is derived by substituting this solution for the expression of the emissivity. results: Expressions are provided for both magnetic and non-magnetic cases. Atomic fine structure is taken into account. Expressions are also separately provided under zero and non-zero hyperfine structure. conclusions: Redistribution functions are widely used in radiative transfer codes. In our formulation, collisional transitions between Zeeman sublevels within an atomic level (depolarizing collisions effect) are taken into account when possible (i. e., in the non-magnetic case). However, the need for a formal solution of the statistical equilibrium as a preliminary step prevents us from taking into account collisional transfers between the levels of the upper term. Accounting for these collisional transfers could be done via a numerical solution of the statistical equilibrium equation system.

40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} new scheme for {{determining}} {{the shape of the}} size distribution, and its evolution, for collisional cascades of planetesimals undergoing destructive collisions and loss processes like Poynting-Robertson drag. The scheme treats the steady state portion of the cascade by equating mass loss and gain in each size bin; the smallest particles are ex-pected to reach steady state on their collision timescale, while larger particles retain their primordial distribution. For collision-dominated disks, steady state means that mass loss rates in logarithmic size bins are independent of size. This prescription reproduces the ex-pected two phase size distribution, with ripples above the blow-out size, and above the tran-sition to gravity-dominated planetesimal strength. The scheme also reproduces the expected evolution of disk mass, and of dust mass, but is computationally much faster than evolving distributions forward in time. For low-mass disks, P-R drag causes a turnover at small sizes to a size distribution that is set by the <b>redistribution</b> <b>function</b> (the mass distribution of frag-ments produced in collisions). Thus information about the <b>redistribution</b> <b>function</b> may be recovered by measuring the size distribution of particles undergoing loss by P-R drag, such as that traced by particles accreted onto Earth. Although cross-sectional area drops with age ∝ t 2 in the PR-dominated regime, dust mass falls ∝ t 2 : 8, underlining the importance of understanding which particle sizes contribute to an observation when considering how disk detectability evolves.
