40|$|M. Tech. Verrucae vulgaris, {{commonly}} known as warts are benign growths due to infection with papillomaviruses, which occur mainly on the hands and feet (Gawkrodger, 2002). Verrucae are caused by a virus, the human papillomavirus (HPV) (Fitzpatrick and Aeling, 2001). Verrucae are a common skin problem, which account for approximately 5 %- 10 % of the skin conditions seen in patients in many countries. The peak incidence ranging {{between the ages of}} 12 and 16, rarely being found in infants and the elderly (Gibbs and Degreef, 1997). Thuja occidentalis is a common homoeopathic remedy that has historically been used for the treatment of wart-like excrescences on cutaneous surfaces of the skin (Vermeulen, 1994). Based on homoeopathic principles, the toxicological symptoms of this remedy gives the therapeutic indications for which it is prescribed. <b>Ricini</b> <b>oleum,</b> {{commonly known}} as castor oil, for which there is an unknown mode of action, has been recommended for various cutaneous complaints, when applied externally (Grieves and Leyel, 1998). To date insufficient research has been conducted to confirm the effects of Thuja occidentalis and <b>Ricini</b> <b>oleum</b> on verrucae vulgaris. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the efficacy of homoeopathically prepared, externally applied, Thuja occcidentalis 6 cH and <b>Ricini</b> <b>oleum</b> 6 cH, in the treatment of common warts, verrucae vulgaris. The study was a contextual, placebo controlled, double-blind research study. Forty-five participants ranging from 5 to 60 years old were recruited for this study. Participants who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected (Appendix A). Suitable participants completed a consent form, explaining all aspects of the study (Appendix B). Participants were required to complete a participant profile form, as well as an initial subjective questionnaire after which they were randomly placed into one of three treatment groups (Appendix C). Each participant was given a 25 ml amber glass dropper bottle, which contained either Thuja occidentalis 6 cH, <b>Ricini</b> <b>oleum</b> 6 cH or the placebo. The placebo group was shared with another researcher conducting a similar study. The solutions were administered topically; two drops twice daily v and treatment lasted for ten days. A maximum of two verrucae were treated throughout the study and these lesions were kept covered at all times with a waterproof elastoplaster. Changes in symptoms were documented according to a questionnaire (Appendix D). The verrucae being treated were evaluated on three occasions; one day prior to commencement of the clinical trial, on day five of the trial, as well as on day ten. Each assessment involved photographs and physical measurements of the verrucae, as well as a subjective questionnaire, that the participant was requested to complete. The results were statistically analysed in terms of change in length, width and height of the verrucae. Results for the categorical responses were cross-tabulated with the respective treatments and chi-square tests were performed to compare efficacy of treatments. For the measured responses, the Friedman two-way analysis of verrucae was used to compare the responses to each treatment i. e. before, during and after each treatment. Based on the outcomes of this study, it was revealed that all three treatment groups responded with significant results, in terms of a decrease in overall size of the verrucae lesions. Two of the experimental groups, namely the Thuja occidentalis 6 cH and the <b>Ricini</b> <b>oleum</b> 6 cH groups, illustrated an overall decrease in size of verrucae from the start to the end of the clinical trial. The placebo group yielded the smallest decrease in overall size of verrucae, during this study. None of the participants noticed a change in their emotional status or physical status, while participating in the clinical trial. The duration of the trial was not sufficiently long enough. In addition, further research into this topic is required to assess whether the observations that were made in this study would result in eventual cure of the condition...|$|E
