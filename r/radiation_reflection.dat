40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} significantly influences many biological entities in {{the terrestrial}} biosphere. However, {{the amount of}} UV exposure can be affected by surfaces that reflect UV radiation. Knowledge about reflected UV radiation from surfaces in the built environment is limited, especially from vertical or other non-horizontal surfaces and the resulting effects of UV <b>radiation</b> <b>reflection</b> from these surfaces. The main aims {{of this research is}} comprised of (1) characterisation of UV <b>radiation</b> <b>reflection</b> from a variety of urban building materials in vertical positions, (2) quantification of the biological effect of UV reflection from simulated structures on a human and (3) establishing relationships between UV radiation measurement indicators and resulting biological effects. UV <b>radiation</b> <b>reflection</b> was investigated using spectral measurements made with portable spectrometers, and took into consideration factors that could influence the measurements including orientation, direction, solar zenith and azimuth angles and surface type. The biological effects due to reflection from vertical urban structures were investigated using dosimetry which enabled body site UV exposure analysis. Relationships from UV <b>radiation</b> <b>reflection</b> between different surface orientations (vertical, horizontal and inclined) were quantified. The UV Index was used to predict changes to UV exposure from certain vertical UV radiation reflective surfaces. Spectral reflection from vertical urban structures was found to be variable and for metallic surface types the variation appears to be predominantly controlled by solar zenith and solar azimuth angles, with man-made surfaces reflecting some radiation specularly. Hence, surface type and the coating on the surface type dictates the way UV radiation is reflected from a surface. Increases in UV exposure are observed during seasons with larger solar zenith angles, and decreases in seasons with predominantly lower solar zenith angles. This produces an observable seasonal effect, creating a potential problem in cooler seasons than in warmer seasons due to human behaviour, where personal UV protection can be overlooked compared to thermal comfort. This study has shown that UV reflection from certain vertical surfaces will substantially enhance UV exposure to an individual, and reduce the time for an outdoor worker to exceed recommended UV exposure limits...|$|E

High instream temperatures resulting from low flows are a consideration in managing the Virgin River for two endangered fish species. Throughout these periods, fish behavior changes have been observed during those high turbidity. One hypothesis was that high turbidity decreased the amount of solar radiation {{in the water column}} due to increased reflection at the water surface resulting in reduced instream temperatures. To quantify the extent of changes in incoming energy to the river, a water tank was constructed to measure the effects of turbidity on solar <b>radiation</b> <b>reflection</b> off the water surface and attenuation with depth. We found that increases in turbidity led to a linear increase in solar <b>radiation</b> <b>reflection</b> for specific turbidity ranges. We also found that attenuation of solar radiation increased linearly as turbidity increased for specific turbidity ranges. The effects of turbidity on solar radiation behavior were translated into changes in instream temperatures through the use of an instream temperature model.
