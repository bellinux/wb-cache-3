40|$|Forty {{patients}} with syncope of unknown origin underwent quantitative signal averaging {{of the surface}} QRS complex before invasive electrophysiologic testing with programmed ventricular stimulation. Of 34 {{patients with}}out bundle branch block, 12 had inducible ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 22 did not (Group II). The duration of low amplitude signals, the <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>voltage</b> of the terminal 40 ms and the signalaveraged QRS vector duration were measured in each case. One or more abnormal signal averaging variables were present in 92 % of patients in Group I, but in only 27 % of patients in Group II (p < 0. 005). An abnormal <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> <b>voltage</b> of the terminal 40 ms was the most significant distinguishing variable, being present in 83 % of Group I patients and in only 14 % of Group II patients (p < 0. 005). The QRS vector duration was prolonged in 58 % of Group I patients, but in only 9 % of Group II patients (p < 0. 05). Likewise, the duration of low amplitude signals was prolonged in 58 % of Group I patients, but in only 19 % of Group II patients (p < 0. 05). When compared with 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, the presence of abnormal signal averaging variables was more predictive of inducible ventricular tachycardia. Seven (32 %) Group II patients had 2 10 ventricular premature beats/h, couplets or episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia; however, none had abnormal late potentials recorded. In contrast, three patients (25 %) in Group I had 10 ventricular premature beats/h, although all in that group had one or more abnormal signal-averaged variables. The sensitivity and specificity of the various signalaveraged variables ranged from 50 to 83 % and from 82 to 91 %, respectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{describe}} initial {{validation of}} a new system for digital to analog conversion (DAC) and reconstruction of 12 -lead ECGs. The system utilizes an open and optimized software format with a commensurately optimized DAC hardware configuration to accurately reproduce, from digital files, the original analog electrocardiographic signals of previously instrumented patients. By doing so, the system also ultimately allows for transmission of data collected on one manufacturer's 12 -lead ECG hardware/software into that of any other. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To initially validate the system, we compared original and post-DAC re-digitized 12 -lead ECG data files (∼ 5 -minutes long) in two types of validation studies in 10 patients. The first type quantitatively compared the total waveform voltage differences between the original and re-digitized data while the second type qualitatively compared the automated electrocardiographic diagnostic statements generated by the original versus re-digitized data. RESULTS: The grand-averaged difference in <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> <b>voltage</b> between the original and re-digitized data was 20. 8 µV per channel when re-digitization involved the same manufacturer's {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC) as the original digitization, and 28. 4 µV per channel when it involved a different manufacturer's ADC. Automated diagnostic statements generated by the original versus reconstructed data did not differ when using the diagnostic algorithm from the same manufacturer on whose device the original data were collected, and differed only slightly for just 1 of 10 patients when using a third-party diagnostic algorithm throughout. CONCLUSION: Original analog 12 -lead ECG signals can be reconstructed from digital data files with accuracy sufficient for clinical use. Such reconstructions can readily enable automated second opinions for difficult-to-interpret 12 -lead ECGs, either locally or remotely through the use of dedicated or cloud-based servers...|$|R

5000|$|A {{distinction}} {{should be}} made between the voltage {{at the point of}} supply (nominal system voltage) and the voltage rating of the equipment (utilization voltage). Typically the utilization voltage is 3% to 5% lower than the nominal system voltage; for example, a nominal 208 V supply system will be connected to motors with [...] "200 V" [...] on their nameplates. This allows for the voltage drop between equipment and supply. Voltages in this article are the nominal supply voltages and equipment used on these systems will carry slightly lower nameplate voltages. Power distribution system voltage is nearly sinusoidal in nature. Voltages are expressed as <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> (RMS) <b>voltage.</b> Voltage tolerances are for steady-state operation. Momentary heavy loads, or switching operations in the power distribution network, may cause short-term deviations out of the tolerance band. In general, power supplies derived from large networks with many sources are more stable than those supplied to an isolated community with perhaps only a single generator.|$|R
