40|$|The {{research}} {{is motivated by}} two concerns: Is backward <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> any fundamental sense different to forward recall, and {{is it possible to}} distinguish between simple, complex and delayed recall tasks apart from absolute levels of recall. To this end participants studied lists of words for backward serial <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> which word length (Experiment 1) and phonological similarity (Experiment 2) were manipulated. The results indicated that phonological similarity effects were present <b>in</b> backward <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> simple, complex and delayed tasks. In contrast, word length effect had no influence in any of the three tasks. This finding suggests that models of forward recall may not be applicable to backward recall...|$|R

5|$|After {{starting}} {{out in the}} Delhi junior system, Kartik moved through the age group ranks at Railways, was selected for the Indian Under-19 team. He made his first-class debut in 1996–97 {{and after a few}} productive seasons at domestic level, made his Test debut in early-2000 as Kumble's bowling partner. However, he ran into disciplinary problems and was expelled from the National Cricket Academy in the same year, while new national captain Sourav Ganguly was reluctant to entrust him with responsibility. Ganguly called for off spinner Harbhajan to be <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> 2001, and was rewarded with a series-winning performance against Australia. This entrenched the off spinner in the team and left Kartik on the outer.|$|E

5|$|All around are pubs and brothels. The Earl of Cardigan tavern is on {{one side}} of the street, and {{opposite}} is the Rummer, whose sign shows a rummer (a short wide-brimmed glass) with a bunch of grapes on the pole. Masonic lodges met in both taverns during the 1730s, and the Lodge at the Rummer and Grapes in nearby Channel Row was the smartest of the four founders of the Grand Lodge.

A loyal servant of the crown, MR Pia introduced ML Pin to King Vajiravudh when he was seven years old. Another often-recounted story from his childhood is that of how, before having learned to count, when his mother asked him to gather half a bunch of betel leaves for her, ML Pin set down to picking up one leaf with each hand at a time, separating them equally into two piles.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Gasparo Cairano before 1489. No {{information}} has been found about the date and place of his birth, education, or the circumstances {{that led him to}} Brescia. The appellation da Milano, with which he is often <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> the sources, however, does not provide a definitive fact of his origin because it could refer to the city {{as well as to the}} dukedom or diocese. The generic reference, in any case, is compatible with the cultural basis of his artistic work. Some conjectures can be made on the surname Cairano, in particular that it leads one to Cairate in Varese province, which is to this day shortened to Caira in the local dialect.|$|E
5|$|Reger's Hebbel Requiem {{is in one}} movement. It {{follows the}} overall form of the narrated poem, but with variations, {{resulting}} in a structure of different moods.

The translation of the incipits is given as in the liner notes of the 2009 recording in the translation by Richard Stokes. The four-part SATB chorus is often divided. The work is in D minor and common time. The tempo marking is Molto sostenuto, and is sustained with only slight modifications (stringendo and ritardando) until the most dramatic section, marked Più mosso (faster) and later Allegro, returning to the initial tempo for the conclusion.|$|E

5|$|The Creppings were lords of {{the manor}} {{followed}} by the Leigh or Legh family. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, held the manor from 1363 to 1370 and Simon Simeon, whose will mentioned coal mines, from 1401–1406. The Leighs held the manor {{for much of the}} time between 1300 until 1697 when Anne Leigh married Ralph Brandling of Felling in Durham. The Leighs once occupied New Hall whose name is <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> the street names in the area. William Gascoigne, who invented the micrometer and died fighting for the Royalists at Marston Moor in 1644, was another resident of New Hall.|$|E
5|$|Anbe Vaa {{marked the}} first time AVM Productions had written a script to suit an actor's image and acting style; prior to this they had chosen actors to fit an already {{completed}} script. AVM Productions' founder A. V. Meiyappan's son M. Saravanan, one of the film's producers, <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> 2013 that, as a fan of M. G. Ramachandran, it was his wish to see him act under the AVM banner. For several days he hesitated to tell his father about this choice, but when he did, he showed support. While Tirulokchandar was writing the script, Meiyappan suggested approaching Ramachandran for the lead role. Tirulokchandar found this intriguing, as the script's genre was dissimilar to what Ramachandran was noted for: action-adventure or social and family dramas which portrayed him as a champion for the downtrodden.|$|E
5|$|Beardsley {{featured}} {{regularly for}} Kettering {{at the start}} of 2008–09, and scored his first goal of the season after turning in Jean-Paul Marna's cross in the 82nd-minute of a 2–0 away win over Cambridge on 25 August 2008. Having scored four goals in the first two months of 2008–09, he rejoined former club Kidderminster on a one-month loan on 27 November 2008, with a view to a permanent transfer. He debuted as an 80th-minute substitute in a 3–2 home victory against Salisbury City on 6 December 2008. Beardsley made three appearances while on loan at Kidderminster, and returned to Kettering after being <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> January 2009. Only weeks after returning, he entered Kettering's 4–2 home loss to Premier League team Fulham in the FA Cup on 24 January 2009 as a 73rd-minute substitute. Beardsley featured mostly as a substitute over the remainder of 2008–09, which he finished with 44 appearances and 5 goals for Kettering. They finished in eighth-place in the Conference Premier, and Beardsley was released by the club in May 2009.|$|E

5|$|Following {{improvements}} to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, they could also navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> 1790, when he surveyed it below Midhurst. In the same year, {{the construction of the}} Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an Act of Parliament which would enable him to improve the Rother. The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges for using the navigation were low, as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.|$|E
5|$|Freese {{emerged as}} a {{potential}} starter when an injury seemed likely to put Cardinals starting third baseman Troy Glaus {{on the disabled list}} {{at the beginning of the}} 2009 season. Freese made his MLB debut on Opening Day of the 2009 season, coming off the bench and hitting a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the Cardinals' home opener against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Freese was expected to be the team's starting third baseman, but was quickly passed over by Brian Barden and Joe Thurston. He was optioned to Triple-A Memphis on April 20, 2009 to make room for newly acquired reliever Blaine Boyer. He later had surgery to repair a left ankle injury that hampered him during spring training. He missed two months of the season. He was activated and assigned to the Springfield Cardinals of the Double-A Texas League in late July, before he was assigned to Memphis. He led the Memphis Redbirds to a PCL division championship. He was <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> the September call-up on September 23, 2009. Freese played only 17 games for the Cardinals in 2009, in addition to 56 games for Triple-A Memphis.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Lexus {{underwent}} a gradual sales recovery in North America and Asia as the marque focused on adding hybrids and new model derivatives. Sales in the U.S. held steady despite the 2009–2010 Toyota vehicle recalls, several of which included Lexus models. The ES 350 and certain IS models {{were affected by}} a recall for potentially jamming floor mats, while parent company Toyota bore the brunt of negative publicity amid investigations over its series of product recalls and problem rates per-vehicle. The redesigned GX 460 was also voluntarily <b>recalled</b> <b>in</b> April 2010 for a software update, one week after Consumer Reports issued a recommendation not to buy the SUV, citing a possible rollover risk following the slow stability control response to a high-speed emergency turn. Although the publication knew of no reported incidents, the GX 460 received updated stability control software.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study investigates {{information}} <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> unaccompanied {{and accompanied}} older cancer {{patients and their}} companions. Methods: One hundred cancer patients (aged >/= 65 years) and 71 companions completed a recall questionnaire after a nursing consultation preceding chemotherapy treatment. Recall was checked against the actual communication in video-recordings of the consultations. Patients also completed measures of anxiety and memory-related beliefs. Results: Findings revealed that <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> patient and companion couples together was higher than their separate recall scores (both proportional and absolute), indicating that they supplement each other. Proportionally, unaccompanied patients recalled {{almost as much as}} couples, whereas their absolute recall scores were lower. Younger age and higher education were associated with higher <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> both patients and companions. Patients' memory-related beliefs predicted the recall scores of their companions rather than their own recall score. When patients reported memory complaints, <b>recall</b> was lower <b>in</b> their companion. In contrast, when patients indicated that they did not understand all information, their companion recalled more. Conclusions: These findings indicate that, although an interrelationship exists between <b>recall</b> <b>in</b> patients and their companions, accompanied patients are likely to benefit from the extra information that their companions remember.
