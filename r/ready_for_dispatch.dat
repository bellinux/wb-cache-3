25|$|For the 2007–2009 fire seasons, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger {{authorized}} {{a contract}} for exclusive use of the aircraft {{at a cost of}} $5 million per year, or an average of about $41,000 per day for the June 15 to October 15 fire season; there was an additional $5,500 per-flight-hour charge. The exclusivity of the contract allowed the aircraft to always be <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch,</b> and it was able to launch to a fire within one hour of being called. In 2011, the exclusive use contract was cancelled by the State of California due to state budgetary constraints.|$|E
60|$|That was all Deringham saw {{at first}} sight, but he {{realized}} that it was very beautiful, and then commenced to note details with observant eyes. There was a sawmill beside the river, for he could faintly hear a strident scream and see the blue smoke drifting in gauzy wisps across the hill. The square log-house which stood some little distance from the lake looked well built and substantial, and the road that wound through the green oblong had been skilfully laid with rounded strips sawn off the great fir-trunks. Sleek cattle stood apparently <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch</b> in a corral, the yellowing oats beyond them were railed off by a six-foot fence, and behind the rows of sawn-off stumps which ringed about the clearing great trunks and branches lay piled in the confusion of the slashing. Deringham was not a farmer, but {{he was a man of}} affairs, and all he saw spoke to him of prosperity that sprang from strenuous energy and administrative ability.|$|E
6000|$|He {{shut the}} door upon them, locked it, and turned to Hortensia, smiling grimly. Then he crossed quickly to the desk, and Hortensia {{followed}} him. He sat down, and pulled out bodily the bottom drawer on the right inside of {{the upper part of}} the desk, as he had seen Lord Ostermore do that day, a little over a week ago. He thrust his hand into the opening, and felt along the sides for some moments in vain. He went over the ground again slowly, inch by inch, exerting constant pressure, until he was suddenly rewarded by a click. The small trap disclosed itself. He pulled it up, and took some papers from the recess. He spread them before him. They were the documents he sought--the king's letter to Ostermore, and Ostermore's reply, signed and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch.</b> [...] "These must be burnt," [...] he said, [...] "and burnt at once, for that fellow Green may return, or he may send others.

5000|$|Simply, a [...] "pro forma invoice" [...] is a [...] "confirmed {{purchase}} order" [...] where {{buyer and}} supplier agree on detail {{and cost of}} the product to be shipped to the buyer. A pro forma invoice is generally raised when the seller is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatching</b> the material {{but he wants to}} ensure that the payment is being sent before dispatch. And similarly, the customer also wants to know which components are included in the pro forma invoice to avoid disagreements later.|$|R

50|$|A modern DISAMATIC molding {{line can}} mold {{at the rate}} of 550 sand molds per hour (one {{complete}} mold in 6.5 seconds). Maximum mis-match of two halves of the castings does not exceed 0.1 mm. Total uptime exceeds 98%. Possible mold sizes range from 400 x 500 to 850 x 1200 millimeters. A DISAMATIC line can be completed with automatic casting and sand cooling drums, robotized devices for extracting castings from the molds and automatic casting cleaning and abrasive blasting machines placed inline. In such automatic production lines there is no need of any human manual labor until the castings are completely finished and <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch.</b>|$|E
50|$|When New Delhi was {{informed}} of an impending coup by intelligence sources, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi personally contacted the Indian Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani, with a verbal request {{to provide assistance}} to René. Coincidentally, the Indian Navy had already dispatched the frigate INS Vindhyagiri (F42) on a scheduled visit to Seychelles. It was decided that on arrival Vindhyagiri would report an engineering defect requiring an extended stay in Port Victoria. A senior Indian naval officer was then sent to the Seychelles on a commercial airline to command the operation and an “engineering” team of 20 sailors trained in weapons was <b>readied</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch</b> to Port Victoria. The extended presence of the Vindhyagiri in Port Victoria averted the planned coup.|$|R

50|$|The Inter-Allied Commission, {{in which}} General Henri Le Rond {{was the most}} {{influential}} person, waited rather long before taking any steps to end the violence. The French troops generally favored the insurrection. In some cases, British and Italian contingents actively cooperated with Germans. UK Prime Minister Lloyd George's speech in the British Parliament, strongly disapproving of the insurrection, aroused the hopes of some Germans. But the Entente appeared to have no troops <b>ready</b> and available <b>for</b> <b>dispatch.</b> The only action the 'Inter-Allied Military Control Commission' and the French government made was demanding immediate prohibition of the recruiting of German volunteers from outside Upper Silesia, and this was promptly made public.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006, the {{aircraft}} was operated {{on a limited}} evaluation contract from the State of California. During the 2006 season, {{the aircraft}} was offered on a [...] "call-when-needed" [...] basis, which came with a $26,500 per-flight-hour (three hour minimum) cost and a 12- to 24-hour activation delay. Under these terms, Tanker 910 flew on six fires in California and one in Washington.For the 2007-2009 fire seasons, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger authorized a contract for exclusive use of the aircraft {{at a cost of}} $5 million per year, or an average of about $41,000 per day for the June 15 to October 15 fire season; there was an additional $5,500 per-flight-hour charge.

50|$|On {{the western}} side of the station is the goods station with its former {{marshalling}} yard. The marshalling yard was heavily used until the 1990s and also served the industrial lines of several firms based there (including haulage firms, a mineral oil dealers with its own tank facilities and a scrap merchants). On {{the eastern side of the}} station, between the passenger station and the Saxon (northern) locomotive depot or Betriebswerk, is the railway post office hall, in which the post trains were made <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch.</b> In addition, on the northern edge of the neighbouring station of Oberkotzau there was a small shunting yard with five tracks, the remains of another former marshalling yard which, until the mid-1920s, was linked with the goods station in Hof by a third track between Hof and Oberkotzau. After being closed for several years, a Hof haulage contractor opened a container station in about 2000 in the Hof goods station, which has been expanded several times. In the goods station today there are still twelve tracks, a hump at the northern end and a headshunt at the southern end, from which shunting is carried out. The marshalling sidings at Oberkotzau station, by contrast, were removed in 2000. Likewise, in the 1990s, the railway post hall was closed. Today only a branch of the Deutsche Post, between the former railway post hall and the passenger station, remains in operation - a relict of the railway postal services.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{meaningful}} use of Orly Aerodrome {{with the}} arrival of the first aircraft on 6 April 1918, when three Sopwith 1A2s landed at the field from Le Bourget Airport. The first aircraft was flown out on 20 April. During the first month of operation, a total of 37 aircraft were flown from Orly to the Front and to various training schools. [...] At this early stage of operations, there were still few personnel assigned and much of the equipment for the Park had not yet arrived. The operations were very much makeshift until June, when the number of personnel had increased and considerably more equipment was available. New aircraft aeeiving for acceptance at Orly were first directed to the Receiving Division. There were several sections for the various types of aircraft (SPAD, Sopwith, Salmson, etc.), being received. There, the section would perform an cursory inspection of the aircraft and determine if it needed additional equipment. If it needed a Radio, for example, it was transferred to the Radio Section. If it needed armament, it was sent to the Armament Section, etc. Once any necessary equipment was installed, the aircraft then was sent to the Inspection Section for a careful inspection to see that all corrections and any repairs necessary to the aircraft were made to insure it was <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch.</b> After the inspection was passed, a thirty-minute flight test was made of the aircraft to verify its readiness.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to departure, {{the lead}} {{mechanic}} {{had noticed that}} the [...] "#2 and #4 tyre pressures were below the minimum for flight dispatch" [...] and attempted to inflate them, but no nitrogen gas was readily available, and the project manager, unwilling to accept a delay, disregarded the problem and <b>readied</b> the aircraft <b>for</b> <b>dispatch.</b> As the aircraft was taxiing, {{the transfer of the}} load from the under-inflated No. 2 tire to the No. 1 tire on the same portside axle resulted [...] "in overdeflection, over-heating and structural weakening of the No. 1 tyre." [...] "The No. 1 tyre failed very early on the take-off roll", followed almost immediately by the No. 2. The latter stopped rotating [...] "for reasons not established", and the subsequent friction of the wheel assembly with the runway generated sufficient heat to start a self-sustaining fire. The crew realised there was a problem, but not the nature or seriousness of it. The aircraft was not equipped with fire or heat sensors in the wheel assembly. The first officer was recorded remarking, [...] "We gotta flat tire, you figure?" [...] According to Canadian Transportation Safety Board members interviewed for an episode of Mayday about the accident, standard procedures regarding tire failure during the takeoff roll on the DC-8 did not then (and still did not as of the episode's season 11 airing) include rejecting takeoff for tire or wheel failures, so the captain proceeded with the takeoff.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — IQS {{stands for}} Initial Quality Study. It is the {{evaluation}} of the product by customer’s point of view when final product comes after manufacturing & is <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch.</b> In IQS, all defects are recorded aggregate wise & overall IQS Score is generated. This is called Demerit score whenever it is discussed about improvement in IQS. TQM approach is followed for IQS score improvement in Harvester combine. Swaraj Division, Plant- 2, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited manufactures Tractors, Harvester combine & Forklift. This plant has a capacity to produce 500 Harvester Combines per year. IQS is done on tractor & Harvester combine. Forklift excludes from IQS. Tractor & Harvester combine have IQS score if 106 & 3406 respectively. So, harvester combine was selected for improvement as it has high score as compared to tractor. In this work, using TQM methodology, data was collected from IQS. Major defects were identified by Pareto analysis in three aggregates i. e. HPU, Supplies & Design. Cause & Effect analysis was done for major defects to find out probable causes. Possible causes were identified from probable causes using technical skills, knowledge and experience. Possible causes were tested hypothetically by actual measurements and analysis. Corrective action plans were made for the valid causes. After observing and analyzing results, correction procedures were standardized and implemented.

40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. We {{consider}} {{a situation where}} C customers each order various quantities (possibly zero in some cases) of products from P different families, which can be produced on a continuously available machine in any sequence (requiring a setup whenever production switches from one family to another). We assume that the time needed for a setup depends only on the family to be produced immediately after it, and we follow the item availability model (which implies that all units are <b>ready</b> <b>for</b> <b>dispatch</b> {{as soon as they}} are produced). However, an order is shipped only when all units required by a customer are ready. The time from the start (time zero) to the completion of a customer order is called the order lead time. The problem, which restates the original description of the customer order scheduling problem, entails finding a production schedule that will minimize the total order lead time. While this problem has received some attention in the literature, its complexity status has remained vexingly open. In this note, we show {{for the first time that}} the problem is strongly NP-hard. We proceed to give dynamic programming based exact solution algorithms for the general problem and a special case (where C is fixed). These algorithms allow us to solve small instances of the problem and understand the problem complexity more fully. In particular, the solution of the special case shows that the problem is solvable in polynomial time when C is fixed. 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
