5|$|From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew {{with the}} concept of Cool Britannia and Britpop as a {{movement}} began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve's album Urban Hymns (1997) was a worldwide hit and their commercial peak before they broke up in 1999, while Radiohead - although having achieved moderate recognition with The Bends in 1995 - achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001).|$|E

25|$|Although The Jam emerged at {{the same}} time as punk rock bands such as The Clash, The Damned, and The Sex Pistols, The Jam better fitted the mould of the new wave bands who came later, and being from just outside London rather than the city itself, they were never <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the tightly-knit punk clique. Nonetheless, it was The Clash who emerged as one of the leading early advocates of the band, and were {{sufficiently}} impressed by The Jam to take them along as the support act on their White Riot tour of 1977.|$|E

50|$|Since then, {{the scope}} of DRM has been {{expanded}} {{over the years to}} cover more functionality previously handled by user space programs, such as framebuffer managing and mode setting, memory sharing objects and memory synchronization. Some of these expansions had carried their own specific names, such as Graphics Execution Manager (GEM) or Kernel Mode-Setting (KMS), and the terminology prevails when the functionality they provide is specifically alluded. But they are <b>really</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the whole kernel DRM subsystem.|$|R
25|$|Three further lots of {{cars were}} obtained, all being open-topped {{vehicles}} with reversed stairs. The first batch was numbered 78 to 83, built by G. F. Milnes, mounted on 21E trucks, with B.T.H. equipment and 2x30 h.p. B.T.H. motors. The second batch was also built by Milnes, {{but these were}} bogie cars mounted on 22E maximum-traction trucks, also with B.T.H. equipment and 2x30 h.p. motors; they were numbered 84 to 89 and were known as the “pony wheel bogies”. The third batch was <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the same order as cars numbered 26 to 57, being similar in every respect. At the same time two works cars were obtained; they were no. 1, a water sprinkler and line clearer, and no. 2, a snowplough. Both of these had 21E trucks and 2x35 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors.|$|E

500|$|After taking Manila, MacArthur {{installed}} {{one of his}} Filipino friends, Manuel Roxas—who {{also happened}} {{to be one of}} the few people who knew about the huge sum of money Quezon had given MacArthur in 1942—into a position of power that ensured Roxas was to become the next Filipino president. Roxas had been a leading Japanese collaborator serving in the puppet government of Jose Laurel, but MacArthur claimed that Roxas had secretly been an American agent all the long. About MacArthur's claim that Roxas was <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the resistance, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that [...] "...evidence to this effect has yet to surface", and that by favoring the Japanese collaborator Roxas, MacArthur ensured there was no serious effort to address the issue of Filipino collaboration with the Japanese after the war.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{has been}} called anti-Semitic, most notably because of the {{characterization}} of Robert Cohn in the book. The other characters often refer to Cohn as a Jew, and once as a 'kike'. Shunned by {{the other members of}} the group, Cohn is characterized as [...] "different," [...] unable or unwilling to understand and participate in the fiesta. Cohn is never <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the group—separated by his difference or his Jewish faith. Critic Susan Beegel goes so far as to claim, [...] "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." [...] Hemingway critic Josephine Knopf speculates that Hemingway might have wanted to depict Cohn as a [...] "shlemiel" [...] (or fool), but she points out that Cohn lacks the characteristics of a traditional shlemiel.|$|E
500|$|... "Twist and Shout" [...] charted again, 16 {{years after}} the Beatles broke up, {{as a result of}} its {{prominent}} appearance in both this film and Back To School (where Rodney Dangerfield performs a cover version) which was released the same weekend as Ferris Bueller's Day Off. The re-released single reached #23 in the U.S; a US-only compilation album containing the track The Early Beatles, re-entered the album charts at #197. The version heard in the film includes brass overdubbed onto the Beatles' original recording, which did not go down well with Paul McCartney. [...] "I liked [...] film but they overdubbed some lousy brass on the stuff! If it had needed brass, we'd had stuck it on ourselves!" [...] Upon hearing McCartney's reaction, Hughes felt bad for [...] "offend a Beatle. But it wasn't <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the song. We saw a band [...] and we needed to hear the instruments." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Nowadays, {{organizational}} members {{manage the}} {{huge amount of}} digital documents that they exploit at work. To do that, they organize documents into individual hierarchies. Actually, these documents are <b>really</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> a company’s capital as they reflect past experiences, present competences and impending expertise. Unfortunately, even if corporate documents represent high value-added material, they still mostly remain unknown from the organization as a whole. That {{is the reason why}} this paper proposes to build a unified view of corporate documents. Our approach is complementary to current content-based ones because it relies on an original metrics related to documents usage within an organization. ...|$|R
500|$|Kaplony has {{proposed}} that Shepseskare started {{to build a}} sun temple named Ḥtp-jb-Rˁ, reading [...] "Hotepibre" [...] and meaning [...] "Satisfied {{is the heart of}} Ra". Although all the kings of the early to mid-Fifth Dynasty, from Userkaf to Menkauhor Kaiu, did build sun temples, Verner regards Kaplony's hypothesis as [...] "sheer speculation" [...] since {{it is based on the}} tentative reconstruction of a single clay seal. Verner first argues that this seal is not inscribed with Shepseskare's name but rather bears traces of a Horus name which could equally well be that of Djedkare Isesi. Second, Verner notes that the name of a sun temple is rarely found with that of the king who built it: more often it is found with the name of another king during whose reign the seal was made. Finally, he doubts that the sign reading Ḥtp, [...] "Hotep", is <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the name of a sun temple. Instead, he believes it is more probable that the seal either refers to the sun temple of Neferirkare, named St-jb-Rˁ.w, that is [...] "Setibraw"; or to that of Nyuserre, which was called Šsp-jb-Rˁ, [...] "Shesepibraw".|$|E
500|$|... "Jurassic Park" [...] was {{released}} {{as the lead}} single from Yankovic's 1993 album Alapalooza. The single did not chart in the United States. However, the song was a sales success in Canada, and peaked at number 5 on the Canadian magazine The Records single chart. The video for [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] received light rotation on MTV. Yankovic later explained {{in an interview that}} [...] " [...] played it a few times, and then just yanked it, because it wasn't <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> their sound." [...] In contrast, the single was a success on The Box and they played it [...] "incessantly". Furthermore, in Canada, the song was a massive success on MuchMusic. Due to this, Alapalooza is Yankovic's best selling album in Canada, with over 200,000 units sold, according to Music Canada. However, the video was played and remained popular on VH1 well after its release; it ranked within the Top 50 Most-Played Clips during the months of August and September 1999, according to Billboard magazine. The video for [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video at the 37th Grammy Awards, but lost to the video for [...] "Love Is Strong" [...] by The Rolling Stones. Nonetheless, it received attention in animation festivals worldwide for its use of claymation effects.|$|E

2500|$|In 1874 at the Stockholm {{meeting of}} the International Congress of Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology, a {{suggestion}} was made by A.

Hans Hildebrand in refutation pointed to two Bronze Ages and a transitional period in Scandinavia. John Evans denied any defect of continuity between the two and asserted there were three Bronze Ages, [...] "the early, middle and late bronze age." ...|$|E
2500|$|The game's humor was lauded {{among most}} critics. [...] Thierry Nguyen of 1UP.com enjoyed the character's interactions, and noted, [...] "a sort of deadpan absurdity where pretty much {{anything}} [...] gets said as naturally {{as we would}} discuss the time of day." [...] Game Revolution's Duke Ferris agreed, and stated the game was [...] "genuinely funny." [...] He then pointed out several instances of humorous quests, conversations, and actions. [...] XPlay's Rob Manuel stated that [...] "most of the thanks here should go to Ron Gilbert." [...] He then referenced two of Gilbert's previous games, The Secret of Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion. [...] Manuel went on to add, [...] "his sharp and often dark sense of humor permeates everything from quests to settings." [...] Eurogamer's Dan Pearson felt the humor was borderline irreverent and said, [...] "I can't help feel I'm not <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> DeathSpanks target audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{relatively}} {{early in}} his professional career, Lowell worried {{about the role of}} racial and ethnic minorities in American society. As early as 1887, he wrote of the Irish: [...] "What we need is not to dominate the Irish, but to absorb them.... We want them to become rich, and send their sons to our colleges, to share our prosperity and our sentiments. We do not want to feel that they are among us and yet not <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> us." [...] He believed that only a homogeneous society could safeguard the achievements of American democracy. Sometime before 1906, he became an honorary vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, an organization that promoted literacy tests and tightened enforcement of immigration laws. In 1910, he wrote approvingly in private of excluding Chinese immigrants entirely and of Southern states that denied the franchise to black citizens. Publicly he consistently adopted assimilation as the solution to absorbing other groups, limiting their numbers to levels he believed would allow American society to absorb them without being changed itself, a stance that [...] "fused liberal and racist ideas in making the case for exclusion." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Britpop {{the media}} focused on bands {{that may have}} been {{established}} acts, but had been over-looked due to focus on the Britpop movement. Bands such as Radiohead and The Verve, and new acts such as Travis, Stereophonics, Feeder and particularly Coldplay, achieved wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. These bands avoided the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Britpop scene, included The Verve and Radiohead. The music of most bands was guitar based, often mixing elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock), particularly the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Small Faces with American influences. Post-Britpop bands also utilized specific elements from 1970s British rock and pop music. Drawn from across the United Kingdom, the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centred on British, English and London life, and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height. This, beside a greater willingness to woo the American press and fans, may have helped a number of them in achieving international success. They have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person, or [...] "boy-next-door" [...] and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative.|$|E

6000|$|Tennyson {{had certain}} {{absolutely}} personal ideas, as much his own as {{the ideas of}} Browning or Meredith, though they were fewer in number. One of these, for example, {{was the fact that}} he was the first of all poets (and perhaps the last) to attempt to treat poetically that vast and monstrous vision of fact which science had recently revealed to mankind. Scientific discoveries seem commonly fables as fantastic in the ears of poets as poems in the ears of men of science. The poet is always a Ptolemaist; for him the sun still rises and the earth stands still. Tennyson really worked the essence of modern science into his poetical constitution, so that its appalling birds and frightful flowers were <b>really</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his literary imagery. To him blind and brutal monsters, the products of the wild babyhood of the Universe, were as the daisies and the nightingales were to Keats; he absolutely realised the great literary paradox mentioned in the Book of Job: [...] "He saw Behemoth, and he played with him as with a bird." ...|$|E
