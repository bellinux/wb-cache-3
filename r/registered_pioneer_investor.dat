40|$|Although {{ferromanganese}} nodules on the {{deep-ocean floor}} {{were discovered in}} 1873 during voyages of HMS Challenger, their economic potential came to light only in 1965. By now, the 1970 's "Nodule Rush " has almost come to an end. Most of the pioneer countries in this field have realized that the present techno-economic situation is {{not in favor of}} nodule mining. Therefore, the UN <b>registered</b> <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Investors</b> appear to have preserved the demarcated nodule mine sites for future use. As a spin-off of that Nodule Rush, foreign and Indian scientists explaining the mystery of nodule carpets on the sea-floor have published several research papers. In this paper we attempt to discuss the chemistry, mineralogy, morphology and allied features of the oceanic ferromanganese deposits in relation to their genesis and growth. We also discus in brief the importance of seamount ferromanganese crusts both as resources and as recorders of the paleoceano- graphic events. Oceanic ferromanganese deposits occur mainly in two forms, as nodules and as encrustations; while the nodules form a carpet on the deep-sea abyssal plains...|$|R

He {{was associated with}} several oil projects which include piping route identification, bathymetric and shallow seismic surveys and post-lay surveys in Bombay High, Bassein-Gujarat line, and Butcher Island routes for Oil and Natural Gas Commission and the Mahanadi delta survey for Oil India. For Port Trust Board of India, he conducted surveys for the ports of Mormugao, Visakhapatnam, Mangalore and Karwar. He was credited with the initiation of managanese nodule program in India and this coordinated program {{was reported to have}} earned India a place among the seven <b>registered</b> <b>Pioneer</b> <b>Investors</b> of the International Seabed Authority of the United Nations. The first bottom sediment map of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal was prepared under his supervision which served as a guide for future explorations in the region. The map identified the presence of Foraminifera, a class of amoeboid protists, which indicated the marine pollution levels and the resources of calcareous sediments in Lakshadeep sea. His studies on Lakshadeep offshores also assisted in widening the understanding of about the origin of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. He was the deputy leader of the first Indian expedition to Antarctica, under the leadership of Syed Zahoor Qasim and he coordinated the marine science programs for Dakshin Gangotri, the permanent Indian station in the southernmost continent. His studies and researches have been documented by way of a number peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 14 of them.
