5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 1872 election, Macdonald had yet to {{formulate}} a <b>railway</b> <b>policy,</b> or to devise the loan guarantees that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as Hugh Allan and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.|$|E
25|$|European {{settlers}} had {{two main}} criticisms of British South Africa Company <b>railway</b> <b>policy.</b> Firstly, that its financial arrangements unfairly benefited {{the company and}} its shareholders, and secondly, that the settlers paid for these benefits through exorbitant railway rates. Although the allegations were probably ill-founded, they caused tensions between the settlers and the BSAC. On the shorter east coast route from Beira, running expenses were high because of construction debts and because the Mozambique Company, which was granted the original concession to build the railway in 1891, imposed a transit duty of up to 3% on goods destined for Rhodesia in return for the sub-concession to the Beira Railway Company. From 1914, the European settlers had a majority in the Advisory Council, and called for the replacement of BSAC control of the railways through nationalisation. In 1923 responsible government was achieved, but rather outright nationalisation, the settler government opted for a form of public control under the Railway Act of 1926. This left BSAC as owner of the railways, which were called Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways until 1927, and Rhodesia Railways Limited after. This remained the situation until 1947, when the Rhodesian Government acquired the assets of Rhodesia Railways Limited.|$|E

500|$|Boyle and Conservative leader R. B. Bennett {{questioned}} Rutherford {{about the}} rumours, but Rutherford initially {{refused to make}} any announcement. [...] The next day, however, the rumour was confirmed when the Premier read Cushing's letter of resignation in the legislature. [...] In this letter, Cushing gave his reasons for resigning as disagreement with the government's <b>railway</b> <b>policy,</b> which he claimed was developed without his involvement or consent. [...] Rutherford disagreed with this claim, and expressed his regret for Cushing's resignation.|$|E
500|$|The scandal {{split the}} Liberal Party: Rutherford's Minister of Public Works, William Henry Cushing, {{resigned}} from his government and publicly attacked its <b>railway</b> <b>policy,</b> {{and a large}} portion of the Liberal caucus voted to defeat the government in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. [...] Although the government survived all of these votes, and Rutherford largely placated the legislature by appointing a royal commission to investigate the affair, pressure from Lieutenant-Governor George Bulyea forced Rutherford's resignation and his replacement by Arthur Sifton.|$|E
500|$|Though Cushing, as Minister of Public Works, was {{initially}} responsible for <b>railway</b> <b>policy,</b> on November 1, 1909 Rutherford {{created a new}} ministry of Railways, which he appointed himself to head. [...] In February 1910, Cushing resigned as Minister of Public Works, expressing disagreement with Rutherford's policy of offering loan guarantees to private railway builders, including the Alberta and Great Waterways (A) Railway. [...] He stated in his letter of resignation that this policy had been adopted without his knowledge or consent. [...] Rutherford accepted the resignation with regret, but publicly disagreed with Cushing's claim {{that he had been}} kept unaware of government <b>railway</b> <b>policy.</b> [...] On February 25, Cushing gave his account of the events leading to his resignation In the legislature: after responsibility for railways was removed from his department, Rutherford had offered the A guarantees of $20,000 per mile of railway constructed. [...] In making this guarantee, Rutherford had not consulted government engineers in the department of Public Works about construction costs, relying instead on the A's engineer. [...] Cushing felt that guaranteeing $20,000 per mile, regardless of actual construction costs, was unwise, and further believed that the government's reliance on the A's engineer could let the company get away with building a sub-standard railway.|$|E

500|$|Sifton was {{selected}} Premier {{in an effort}} to restore party unity, and his first cabinet reflected that. [...] There were three ministers in addition to Sifton. [...] Charles R.

[...] Duncan Marshall had been a Rutherford cabinet minister, but not one identified strongly with its <b>railway</b> <b>policy.</b> [...] Archibald J. McLean had voted with the rebels, but not been a leader among them. [...] The cabinet thus included members of both factions, but none of those who inspired such strong opinions as to be overly divisive.|$|E
500|$|Boyle followed, {{alleging that}} Rutherford had privately {{committed}} {{the government to}} the $20,000 figure as early as November 14, 1908, before a government engineer had even been appointed. [...] He also accused the government of negligence in failing to verify the paid in capital of the A before committing $7.4 million of government loan guarantees to it. [...] He closed by repeating his demand that the government expropriate the company's rights and build the line itself. [...] Cross rebutted for the government, questioning Cushing's sincerity and quoting a March 1909 speech in which the then-Minister of Public Works had defended the government's <b>railway</b> <b>policy</b> against Bennett's attacks. [...] Cross also reminded the legislature that no money was {{to be paid to}} the A until tracks were actually constructed.|$|E
500|$|Cross was re-elected in the 1909 {{election}} {{as one of}} two members elected in the newly expanded Edmonton district.

The A {{was one of several}} new railways {{to take advantage of the}} government's offer, made under considerable public pressure, of loan guarantees. Cushing and John R.

Woods, had removed papers from the government's files on the A Cross denied these charges on his deputy's behalf. Boyle followed with a motion that the assets of the A, which he believed was taking advantage of the government's guarantees to build a sub-standard railway at government expense, be expropriated. Cross led the government's opposition to the motion.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{calls from}} Clarke {{for the federal}} {{government}} to use its power of reservation to stop the legislation, Bulyea granted royal assent December 16. [...] Sifton, in his capacity as provincial treasurer, immediately tried to access the money; the Royal, Dominion, and Union banks, where the funds were deposited, refused payment. [...] Attorney-General Mitchell sued the banks; on November 4, 1911, Justice Charles Allen Stuart of the Supreme Court of Alberta found in the government's favour. [...] The Royal Bank appealed this ruling and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to use its powers of disallowance to strike down the provincial act. [...] In the meantime, Sifton announced a new <b>railway</b> <b>policy</b> that would see eight new lines constructed by private companies with the assistance of provincial loan guarantees, including several pioneer lines; this policy, in its resemblance to the Rutherford policy, met with the approval of the Cross faction, and the Liberals were once more united.|$|E
500|$|In {{speaking}} of A President William Clarke (an American), Bennett {{went on to}} say [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect, because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property without due process of the law." [...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. [...] After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of <b>railway</b> <b>policy</b> by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides?

[...] Buchanan, Marshall, Lessard, and Rutherford made no comment on the situation to either the press or the legislature, but Cross was more forthcoming: he said that Rutherford {{had told him that}} Cushing had been asked to re-enter cabinet and had accepted, leading Cross to conclude that, in light of his public conflict with Cushing, he [...] "could not, under the circumstances, remain a member of the Alberta government."

In most railway companies, the elite position was the design, construction and maintenance of locomotives. Bigger engines brought more prestige and allowed longer trains. In the Midland, the marketing department was paramount. They recognised that people wanted more frequent, shorter trains rather than an infrequent service. It concentrated on very light, very fast and frequent trains.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} three decades, {{state-owned}} railways have been reformed in many countries. The Japanese National Railways (JNR) was the first railway system to be divided and corporatized in 1987. In the following year, the Swedish State Railways (SJ) was reformed by introducing vertical separation, and this case had much influence on the stipulation of wider EU <b>railway</b> <b>policies.</b> Although the EU <b>railway</b> <b>policies</b> were stipulated based on regional context specificities, these policies and their results have been discussed even in some non-EU countries and have tended to have large impacts on the railway sector of those countries. Nevertheless, {{there are several other}} countries where the railways were reformed by different models and could improve the performance by certain measures such as inviting private investments, avoiding cross-subsidies among different divisions, liberalising the management of railways, and introducing intra-modal competition by an appropriate means. The railway sector is required to compete with other modes of transport, especially roads to attain environmental regions. When it comes to railway reform, it is essential for policy makers and experts to learn lessons from other countries' experiences. Based on the background given, this issue aims to understand the lessons from past railway reforms which the sector has experienced under different circumstances.

500|$|Railway {{development}} had {{dominated the}} premierships of Stewart's predecessors and, while losing political potency as an issue, {{it was still}} a matter that demanded his attention. [...] Though Sifton had established a <b>railway</b> <b>policy</b> in 1913 that was satisfactory to all wings of the Liberal Party, the outbreak of the First World War the following year had all but put an end to railway construction across Canada. [...] Once peace came, Albertans living near promised but as yet unbuilt lines began to clamour for their completion. [...] The private companies with whom the government had partnered, however, were in no position to undertake the construction. [...] The Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway was taken over by the Canadian Pacific Railway, with a clause in the agreement requiring the provincial government to spend $1 million to improve the route, and the Alberta and Great Waterways was taken over by Stewart's government directly (J. D. McArthur, the line's previous owner, retained an option to repurchase it, but it was never exercised).|$|E
500|$|In {{keeping with}} Sifton's policy of {{excluding}} all prominent {{players in the}} A affair from cabinet, Cross was not re-appointed (Cushing, Rutherford, and Boyle were also left out). Despite this, Cross declared his support for Sifton's government while restating his admiration for Rutherford's. In response to the A's default of its obligations to the government, Sifton introduced a bill confiscating the money the A had raised through the sale of government-guaranteed bonds. Cross, still a supporter of building the A and concerned that the bill {{did not include a}} commitment to use the money to do so, opposed it. The bill passed, but was disallowed by the courts. Sifton, left with little choice but to use the money for the purpose for which it had been raised, announced a new policy of railway construction. At the same time, he invited Cross to resume his post as Attorney-General. Boyle was also admitted to cabinet, as Minister of Education; Cushing and Rutherford, the other major players in the A affair, had withdrawn from the limelight, and neither would return to the legislature after the 1913 election. Cross accepted Sifton's offer, telling the public that Sifton's new <b>railway</b> <b>policy</b> [...] "made it proper for me to support and join his government".|$|E
500|$|Before resigning, Rutherford's {{government}} had called a Royal Commission into the Alberta and Great Waterways affair, and this commission had not {{reported by the}} time that Sifton took office. [...] Between that and the proroguing of the legislature, the new Premier enjoyed a calm that lasted until November 10, when the legislature reconvened. [...] Conservative leader Edward Michener attacked the government's speech from the throne for failing to commit itself on <b>railway</b> <b>policy</b> and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office. [...] In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach in his own party on the railway question. [...] Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of [...] "pioneer" [...] railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's emptier areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres. [...] Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A be built. [...] Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a [...] "responsible company". [...] These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.|$|E
40|$|By {{the start}} of World War I the railway {{networks}} of developed and moderately developed European countries had mostly been completed. In contrast, a common feature of the recently reborn Poland (founded on the territories previously belonging to Germany, Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and the Kingdom of SHS/Yugoslavia (which was synthesized from half-dozen entities, primarily inhabited by southern Slays) was that their railway networks were significantly growing during the interwar period {{and also in the}} decades following 1945.

At the time when Mr. Gladstone presided over the department of trade, an immense extension of the railway system was seen to be certain, and we may now smile at what then seemed the striking novelty of such a prospect. Mr. Gladstone proposed a select committee on the subject, guided its deliberations, drew its reports, and framed the bill that was founded upon them. He dwelt upon the favour now beginning to be shown to the new roads by the owners of land through which they were to pass, so different from the stubborn resistance that had for long been offered; upon the cheapened cost of construction; upon the growing disposition to employ redundant capital in making railways, instead of running the risks that had made foreign investment so disastrous. It was not long, indeed, before this very disposition led to a mania that was even more widely disastrous than any foreign investment had been {{since the days of the}} South Sea bubble. Meanwhile, Mr. Gladstone's Railway Act of 1844, besides a number of working regulations for the day, laid down two principles of the widest range: reserving to the state the full right of intervention in the concerns of the railway companies, and giving to the state the option to purchase a line at the end of a certain term at twenty-five years' purchase of the divisible profits.[166] ...|$|E
