It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all vertebrates looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic recapitulation theory that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a linear chain of being, and Karl Ernst von Baer's opposing view, stated in von Baer's laws of embryology, that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an archetype but no relation to other types or any transmutation of species. By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher Albert von Kölliker, which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence.

Heavy mineral beach sand deposits are dynamic in which the composition and the amount of reserves vary with time due to changes in coastal waves and currents. Therefore, a proper understanding of the replenishment dynamics is required to develop a comprehensive mine plan for the extraction of heavy mineral sand. This study focuses on the understanding replenishment mechanism at Verugal Beach Heavy Mineral Deposit.

30|$|Morphological and {{microstructural}} characterization {{was carried}} out by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; Hitachi S- 5200) and Cs-corrected STEM (JEM-ARM 200 F). The synthesized samples were milled using a dual-beam focused ion beam (DB-FIB; NOVA 200) operating in the range of 5 – 30  kV before TEM investigation to obtain high-resolution (HR), bright-field (BF), and electron diffraction pattern (DP) images. To investigate the emission properties of the InGaN/GaN core-shell NR array, the temperature dependence of the PL was measured as a function of temperature from 12 to 300  K in a closed-cycle helium cryostat. The excitation power dependence of the PL was measured in the power density range of 7.6 – 764  W/cm 2. For all the PL measurements, a 325 -nm continuous-wave He-Cd laser (20  mW) was used as the excitation source, and the objective lens (× 5) of a <b>reflecting</b> <b>microscope</b> was used to control the beam spot size (~ 20  μm) and simultaneously collect the signal. In this paper, we define the maximum excitation power density (= 764  W/cm 2) as 100  %. Moreover, the characterization of the electrical properties (I-V curve) and electroluminescence (EL) spectra of the 3 D LED was performed simultaneously.|$|E
30|$|From the Awa Group, Niitsuma (1976) {{observed}} goethite with a <b>reflecting</b> <b>microscope</b> in specimens {{with weak}} remanence {{and reported that}} thermal demagnetization at 200  °C was required to remove secondary remanence. These observations suggest that the secondary remanence is likely carried by goethite, which {{is characterized by a}} very high coercivity but a low Néel temperature of approximately 100 – 150  °C (O’Reilly 1984). The coercivity of goethite varies from ~[*] 25 to ~[*] 314 mT depending on its crystalline size (Dekkers 1989), and it could not be saturated even in an applied field of 57  T (Rochette et al. 2005). On the other hand, poorly crystalline nanophase goethite has low coercivity (Till et al. 2015, 2017). Although these studies indicate that the coercivity of goethite varies within a few orders of magnitude {{depending on the type of}} goethite, the secondary remanence carried by goethite is generally difficult to remove by AF demagnetization due to its high coercivity, and its thermal demagnetization is suitable. Therefore, the low-temperature component (Fig. 6 e), which is probably composed of the chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) carried by goethite, may be dominant in the NRM from polarity transition horizons where pThD is needed to remove the CRM originating from goethite. Thus, we use the virtual geomagnetic pole (VGPs) from the ChRMs obtained from the pThD results to distinguish geomagnetic polarities (Additional file 1 : Table S 1).|$|E
40|$|Magnetite {{thin film}} {{obtained}} from the hot alkaline nitrate blackening method has been utilized {{for the protection of}} steel substrate since the 1900 s. Even though this conversion coating process has been around for decades, its application is still limited to corrosion resistance in the firearms and the fasteners industry. Furthermore, {{there is a lack of}} literature that systematically analyse the effect of the parameters involved in the blackening process. For this reason, this study aims to investigate the effect of varying the blackening bath’s nitrate concentration, temperature and dwell time on the properties of the magnetite coating, especially that of wear resistance. In order to produce the magnetite coating, mild steel specimens were placed in a boiling solution made up of sodium hydroxide and sodium nitrate dissolved in water. The blackened specimens were then characterised using a battery of test; microstructure and composition analysis using a <b>reflecting</b> <b>microscope</b> and a scanning electron microscope, pin-on-disk test to analyse the wear resistance and tribological properties and corrosion resistance test using potentiodynamic polarization scanning. Consequently, it was found that the magnetite coating improves the wear resistance and corrosion properties of the steel substrate. In addition, the best magnetite coating is obtained using a blackening bath with a nitrate concentration between 25 % and 50 %, at a temperature of 140 °C and with a dwell time between 15 minutes and 30 minutes...|$|E

40|$|Using {{videotape}} techniques, we {{have observed}} the kinematic {{development of a}} variety of microstructures during experimental deformation of single crystals of stibnite (Sb 2 S 3). The crystals were deformed by flexure or uniaxial compression at room P-T conditions in a small strain device attached to the stage of a <b>reflecting</b> <b>microscope.</b> In more than 50 experimental runs, the primary microstructures produced in stibnite were deformation bands, not deformation twins as often reported in the literature. Translation gliding along (010) [001] results in visible slipbands and produces two basic types of deformation bands, each with a variety of subtypes. Kink bands form with [phi] (angle of internal rotation) [approximate, equal] 70 [deg] and perpendicular bands develop with [phi][approximate, equal] 90 [deg]. Other optical deformation features seen forming were: breccia fragments, bent and opened cleavages, and microfolds. Four stages could be seen in the kinematic development of deformation bands. During initiation, bands form by nearly instantaneous propagation of a narrow bent zone across the crystal. During later migration, the bands widen at a rate invariably slower than the rate of initiation. Termination of bands occurs when growth is impeded by intersections with grain boundaries or other deformation features. During late modification, previously formed bands with straight boundaries are sheared, bent, and compressed. Unconfined crystals tend to form kinks, whereas the perpendicular bands formed in samples confined in relatively rigid plastic. Naturally deformed stibnites show the same features. Television photomicroscopy has great potential for studying microstructures during deformation...|$|E
40|$|During {{studies on}} the {{infection}} of shoots of Pinus radiata D. Don by Diplodia pinea (Desm) Kickx, spore germination on the host surface was often much less than on glass-slides. This reduced germination was at first thought {{to be caused by}} the possible presence of inhibitory substances in the tap water used in the misting system to- which inoculated plants had been exposed. However, the tap water was found to be no different from distilled water as a medium for D. pinea spore germination. A more critical examination was made to compare spore germination on glass slides and on the host surface. Young shoots of 6 -month-old and li-year-old potted P. radiata seedlings were inoculated with D. pinea in 2 ways: (a) needles were brushed or sprayed with a spore suspension (cone. = 50 000 /ml); (b) droplets of spore suspension (12 000 - 15 000 /ml) were placed on the stem surface of potted plants laid horizontally so that the droplets stayed in place. All inoculated plants were kept in a misting chamber at 25 °C. Droplets of spore suspension were also placed on glass slides in petri dishes lined with moist filter paper. These dishes were put in the incubator at 25 °C {{as well as in the}} misting chamber. The incubation period was 6 h on slides and 6 - 24 h on the host surface; spore germination was halted by adding a drop of formalin.

40|$|The {{coupling}} of cryo-light microscopy (cryo-LM) and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) poses {{a number}} of advantages for understanding cellular dynamics and ultrastructure. First, cells can be imaged in a near native environment for both techniques. Second, due to the vitrification process, samples are preserved by rapid physical immobilization rather than slow chemical fixation. Third, imaging the same sample with both cryo-LM and cryo-EM provides correlation of data from a single cell, rather than a comparison of "representative samples". While these benefits are well known from prior studies, {{the widespread use of}} correlative cryo-LM and cryo-EM remains limited due to the expense and complexity of buying or building a suitable cryogenic light microscopy stage. Here we demonstrate the assembly, and use of an inexpensive cryogenic stage that can be fabricated in any lab for less than $ 40 with parts found at local hardware and grocery stores. This cryo-LM stage is designed for use with <b>reflected</b> light <b>microscopes</b> that are fitted with long working distance air objectives. For correlative cryo-LM and cryo-EM studies, we adapt the use of carbon coated standard 3 -mm cryo-EM grids as specimen supports. After adsorbing the sample to the grid, previously established protocols for vitrifying the sample and transferring/handling the grid are followed to permit multi-technique imaging. As a result, this setup allows any laboratory with a <b>reflected</b> light <b>microscope</b> to have access to direct correlative imaging of frozen hydrated samples...|$|R
40|$|Biosand filters in the Artibonite Valley of Haiti, the {{epicenter}} of the cholera epidemic that began in October 2010, were tested for total coliform and Vibrio cholerae removal efficiencies. While coliform are often used as an indicator organism for pathogenic bacteria, a correlation has never been established linking the concentration of coliform and V. cholerae, the causative agent for cholera. Hence, a method for field enumeration of V. cholerae was developed and tested. To this end, a plate count test utilizing membrane filtration technique was developed to measure viable V. cholerae cell concentration in the field. Method accuracy was confirmed by comparing plate count concentrations to microscopic counts. Additionally, biosand filters were sampled and removal efficiencies of V. cholerae and coliform bacteria compared. The correlation between removal efficiency and time in operation, biofilm ("schmutzdecke") composition, and idle time was also investigated. The plate count method for V. cholerae was found to accurately <b>reflect</b> <b>microscope</b> counts and was shown to be effective in the field. Overall, coliform concentration was not an appropriate indicator of V. cholerae concentration. In 90 % of the influent samples from the study, coliform underestimated V. cholerae concentration (n = 26). Furthermore, coliform removal efficiency was higher than for V. cholerae hence providing a conservative measurement. Finally, time in operation and idle time were found to be important parameters controlling performance. Overall, this method shows promise for field applications and should be expanded to additional studies to confirm its efficacy to test for V. cholerae in various source waters...|$|R
