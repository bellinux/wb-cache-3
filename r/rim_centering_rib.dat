40|$|ABSTRACT: Rubber {{trees are}} easily {{recognizable}} for being woody, medium to large-sized plants, having a typical deciduous behavior, and especially because they produce latex. The {{purpose of this}} work was to study the anatomy and morphology of the leaf, comparing rubber tree [Hevea brasiliensis (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Muell. -Arg. ] clones (RRIM 600 and GT 1) grafted on the same root stock (Tjir 1), grown under the same climatic and soil conditions. This study allowed clones to be differentiated and also provided information on the location and disposition of laticifers in the leaf tissue. Cross sections of the mesophyll, <b>center</b> <b>ribbing</b> and petiole regions were made, followed by usual permanent histological blade methods. Biometric analyses of tissue extensions in the palisade and spongy parenchymas were carried out, {{and the number of}} cells in the spongy parenchyma were counted. At the same time, biometrical analyses were made for stomata. The comparison between the clones showed that {{there were no significant differences}} in epidermal cell height, spongy parenchyma height, number of cells in the spongy parenchyma layer, and size and width of leaflets. However, variation was observed for cell thickness in the palisade parenchyma. The clone GT 1 presented greater thickness as compared to the RRIM 600 clone. GT 1 had also a greater number of stomata in comparison to RRIM 600, but they were smaller. GT 1 presented greater petiole and <b>center</b> <b>ribbing</b> diameters in the leaves and a greater amount of sclerenchyma fibers than RRIM 600...|$|R

40|$|A hot gas is {{used for}} heating the cavity surface of a mold. Different mold gap sizes were designed. The mold surface {{temperature}} was heated to above the glass transition temperature of the plastic material, and the mold then closed for melt filling. The cavity surface can be heated to 130 °C to assist the melt filling of the microfeatures. Results show that hot gas heating can improve the filling process and achieve 91 % of the high aspect ratio microgrooves (about 640. 38 μm of the maximum of 700 μm). The mold gap size strongly affects the heating speed and heating uniformity. Without surface preheating, the <b>center</b> <b>rib</b> is the highest.
