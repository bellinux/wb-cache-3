The storm caused several bayous in the Houston area to reach or exceed flood levels. Across southeastern Texas, the cyclone spawned several funnel clouds, and near IAH an EF0 tornado was <b>reported.</b> <b>Wind</b> gusts from Erin were minor across the state, peaking at 35mph (55km/h) at Palacios with an unofficial report of 39mph (63km/h) at Jamaica Beach.

5|$|Hurricane King struck Miami {{around midnight}} local {{time with a}} very compact area of strong winds. Its eye was about 5.2miles (8.4km) in diameter; {{the western edge of}} the eye moved across Miami International Airport, which <b>reported</b> <b>wind</b> gusts of 125mph (202km/h), and the eastern side struck the Miami Weather Bureau office, which {{recorded}} sustained winds of 122mph (197km/h). The principal damage zone was sharply-defined in an area 14miles (23km) in diameter; the boundaries of the damage resembled the path of a tornado, although a subsequent analysis indicated the majority of the damage was not tornadic in nature. There was one confirmed report of a damaging tornado in Davie. As it made landfall, Hurricane King produced lightning near its center, which was the first confirmed occurrence in Florida. The Weather Bureau considered King the severest hurricane since the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane to hit the area.|$|E
5|$|In Coffee County, local {{officials}} <b>reported</b> <b>wind</b> gusts had blown a carport {{into a wall}} of a house.

Reports from Cozumel indicated torrential rainfall {{and a large number}} of lightning strikes during the period of highest winds. Rainfall peaked at 7.69inches (195mm) just south of CancÃºn. Still recovering from the effects of Hurricane Gilbert two months prior, the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula received only minor damage as a result of Keith.

5|$|Onshore, winds reached 52mph (84km/h) in Norfolk, Virginia, with an {{unofficial}} report of 57mph (92km/h) near Virginia Beach.

In Elizabeth City, North Carolina, an outer rainband dropped 0.5inches (10mm) of precipitation in about twohours {{as well as}} several lightning strikes; one bolt of lightning injured two firefighters. The winds covered portions of North Carolina Highway 12 with sand, and for a day the route was closed after waves from the storm washed out about 200feet (60m) of roadway. In some locations, the waves eroded up to 20feet (6m) of beach, leaving 70homes in imminent danger. On St. Simons Island in Georgia, the storm produced a storm tide of 8.09feet (2.43m). Trace amounts of rainfall occurred in the southeastern portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{depression}} strengthened {{further and}} officially attained tropical storm status at 0000UTC on December 27, {{based on the}} analysis by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior. Shortly thereafter, an eye with a 39km (24mi) diameter became apparent on satellite imagery, along with rainbands extending southward {{to the opposite side}} of the equator. At 0600UTC, the JMA first classified the system as Tropical Storm Vamei, about 65km (40mi) northeast of Singapore, and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85km/h (50mph) at the same time. However, the JTWC upgraded Vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140km/h (85mph), based on a United States Navy ship report from within the eye; a second ship <b>reported</b> <b>wind</b> gusts of 195km/h (120mph) in the southern portion of the eyewall. The storm was small and compact, with gales extending about 45km (30mi) from its center. At about 0830UTC on December 27, Vamei made landfall approximately 60km (35mi) northeast of Singapore, in the southeastern portion of the Malaysian state of Johor. Initially, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) classified the cyclone as a tropical storm, though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall.|$|E
