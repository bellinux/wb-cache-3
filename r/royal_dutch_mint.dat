In 1959, they realized the longstanding dream of minting Esperanto coinage in denominations of one Stelo (bronze), five Steloj (yellow copper) and ten Steloj (cupronickel). Rich from worldwide commodity sales receipts, the Universal League had placed a large order for with the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>Mint</b> (Rijksmunt) in Utrecht to strike the coinage. This investment was swiftly recouped, {{with the result that}} in 1965 the League was able to issue a fourth denomination, a silver 25-Steloj coin, which also sold very well.|$|E

5000|$|A good {{illustration}} {{of the risk of}} DLC arbitrage is the position in <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> Shell—which had a DLC structure until 2005—by the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM, see also the discussion below). Lowenstein (2000) [...] describes that LTCM established an arbitrage position in <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> Shell in the summer of 1997, when <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> traded at an 8 to 10 percent premium. In total $2.3 billion was invested, half of which long in Shell and the other half short in <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> (Lowenstein, p. 99). In the autumn of 1998 large defaults on Russian debt created significant losses for the hedge fund and LTCM had to unwind several positions. Lowenstein reports that the premium of <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> had increased to about 22 percent and LTCM had to close the position and incur a loss. According to Lowenstein (p. 234), LTCM lost $286 million in equity pairs trading {{and more than half of}} this loss is accounted for by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> Shell trade.|$|R

50|$|LTCM was {{essentially}} betting that the share prices of <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> and Shell would converge because in their belief {{the present value}} of the future cashflows of the two securities should be similar. This might have happened in the long run, but due to its losses on other positions, LTCM had to unwind its position in <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> Shell. Lowenstein reports that the premium of <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> had increased to about 22%, which implies that LTCM incurred a large loss on this arbitrage strategy. LTCM lost $286 million in equity pairs trading {{and more than half of}} this loss is accounted for by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dutch</b> Shell trade.|$|R
