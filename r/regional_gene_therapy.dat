40|$|Ex-vivo <b>regional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> with {{bone marrow}} cells (BMCs) overexpressing bone {{morphogenetic}} protein- 2 (BMP- 2) has demonstrated efficacy in healing critical sized bone defects in preclinical studies. The {{purpose of this}} preclinical study was to compare the osteoinductive potential of a novel “same day” ex-vivo <b>regional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> versus a traditional two-step approach, which involves culture expansion of the donor cells before implantation. In the “same day” strategy buffy coat cells were harvested from the rat bone marrow, transduced with a lentiviral vector-expressing BMP- 2 for 1 hour and implanted into a rat femoral defect in the same sitting. There {{was no significant difference}} (P = 0. 22) with respect to the radiographic healing rates between the femoral defects treated with the “same day” strategy (13 / 13; 100 %) versus the traditional two-step approach (11 / 14; 78 %). However, the femoral defects treated with the “same day” strategy induced earlier radiographic bone healing (P = 0. 004) and higher bone volume (BV) [micro-computed tomography (micro-CT); P < 0. 001]. The “same day” strategy represents a significant advance in the field of ex-vivo <b>regional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> because it offers a solution to limitations associated with the culture expansion process required in the traditional ex vivo approach.

In this study, we investigated gene transfer in rat and human bone marrow stromal cells in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-complementary AAV vector (scAAV) system, which has higher efficiency than the single-stranded AAV vector (ssAAV) due to its unique viral genome that bypasses the rate-limiting conversion step necessary in ssAAV. Methods Self-complementaryAAV 2 encoding GFP and BMP- 2 (scAAV 2 -GFP and scAAV 2 -BMP- 2) were used to transduce human and rat bone marrow stromal cells in vitro, and subsequently the levels of GFP and BMP- 2 expression were assessed 48 hours after treatment. In parallel experiments, adenoviral and lentiviral vector mediated over-expression of GFP and BMP- 2 were used for comparison.

40|$|The most {{promising}} attempts to achieve bone regeneration artificially {{are based on}} the application of mediators such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) directly to the deficient tissue site. BMPs, as promoters of the regenerative process, have the ability to induce de novo bone formation in various tissues, and many animal models have demonstrated their high potential for ectopic and orthotopic bone formation. However, the biological activity of the soluble factors that promote bone formation in vivo is limited by diffusion and degradation, leading to a short half-life. Local delivery remains a problem in clinical applications. Several materials, including hydroxyapatite, tricalcium phosphate, demineralised bone matrices, poly-lactic acid homo- and heterodimers, and collagen have been tested as carriers and delivery systems for these factors in a sustained and appropriate manner. Unfortunately these delivery vehicles often have limitations in terms of biodegradability, inflammatory and immunological rejection, disease transmission, and most importantly, an inability to provide a sustained, continuous release of these factors at the region of interest. In coping with these problems, new approaches have been established: genes encoding these growth factor proteins can be delivered to the target cells. In this way the transfected cells serve as local "bioreactors", as they express the exogenous genes and secrete the synthesised proteins into their vicinity. The purpose of this review is to present the different methods of gene versus growth factor delivery in tissue engineering. Our review focuses on these promising and innovative methods that are defined as <b>regional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> and provide an alternative to the direct application of growth factors. Various advantages and disadvantages of non-viral and viral vectors are discussed.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundHeme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) is an {{inducible}} stress-responsive enzyme converting heme to bilirubin, carbon monoxide, {{and free}} iron, which exerts anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects. Although efficient cardioprotection after HO- 1 overexpression {{has been reported}} in rodents, its role in attenuating post-ischemic inflammation is unclear. ObjectivesThis study assessed the efficacy of recombinant adenoassociated virus (rAAV) -encoding human heme oxygenase- 1 (hHO- 1) in attenuating post-ischemic inflammation in a murine and a porcine ischemia/reperfusion model. MethodsMurine ischemia was induced by 45 min of left anterior descending occlusion, followed by 24 h of reperfusion and functional as well as fluorescent-activated cell sorting analysis. Porcine hearts were subjected to 60 min of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion before hemodynamic and histologic analyses were performed. ResultsHuman microvascular endothelial cells transfected with hHO- 1 displayed an attenuated interleukin- 6 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression, resulting in reduced monocytic THP- 1 cell recruitment in vitro. In murine left anterior descending occlusion and reperfusion, the post-ischemic influx of CD 45 + leukocytes, Ly- 6 G+ neutrophils, and Ly- 6 Chigh monocytes was further exacerbated in HO- 1 -deficient hearts and reversed by rAAV. hHO- 1 treatment. Conversely, in our porcine model of ischemia, the post-ischemic influx of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils and CD 14 + monocytes was reduced by 49 % and 87 % after rAAV. hHO- 1 transduction, similar to hHO- 1 transgenic pigs. Functionally, rAAV. hHO- 1 and hHO- 1 transgenic left ventricles displayed a smaller loss of ejection fraction than control animals. ConclusionsWhereas HO- 1 deficiency exacerbates post-ischemic cardiac inflammation in mice, hHO- 1 <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> attenuates inflammation after ischemia and reperfusion in murine and porcine hearts. <b>Regional</b> hHO- 1 <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> provides cardioprotection in a pre-clinical porcine ischemia/reperfusion model...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is a {{technique}} for correcting defective genes responsible for disease development. In the future, <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> may provide a way to cure genetic disorders, such as severe combined immunodeficiency, cystic fibrosis or even haemophilia A. Because these diseases result from mutations in the DNA sequence for specific <b>genes,</b> [...] <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> trials have used viruses to deliver unmutated copies of these genes to {{the cells of the}} patient's body. There have been a huge number of laboratory successes with <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> However, several problems of viral <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> must be overcome before it gains widespread use. Immune response to viruses not only impedes the delivery of genes to target cells but can cause severe complications for the patient. In one of the early <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> trials in 1999 this led to the death of Jesse Gelsinger, who was treated using an adenoviral vector.|$|R
40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is {{the process}} of {{introducing}} genetic material RNA or DNA into a person's cells to fight disease. <b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> treats disease by either replacing damaged or missing genes with normal ones, or by providing new genes. The concept of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> was born more than thirty years ago; however, new technology is opening the door to dramatically new possibilities in the treatment of cancers of all kinds. The long-term goal of cancer <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is to develop treatments that attack only cancer cells, thereby eliminating adverse effects on the body and improving the possibility to cure disease. <b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> may someday soon make cancer a manageable disease with nominal side effects to the patients. Furthermore, since <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> has potential for other diseases such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, sickle-cell anemia, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson's, the value of research and discovery has broad applications...|$|R
40|$|Genes are {{specific}} sequences of bases that encode instructions to make proteins. When genes are altered so that encoded proteins {{are unable to}} carry out their normal functions, genetic disorders can result. <b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is designed to introduce genetic material into cells to compensate for abnormal genes or to make a beneficial protein. This article reviews the fundamentals in <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> and its various modes of administration with an insight into the role of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> in Periodontics and future percepts and the technical and ethical issues of using <b>gene</b> <b>therapy...</b>|$|R
