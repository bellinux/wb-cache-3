50|$|In Israel, {{according}} to Sections 28 (Hearing {{arguments of the}} detainee) and Section 31 (Explanation of rights to the detainee) of the Criminal Procedure Law (Enforcement Authority—Arrests) 1996, an officer interrogating/arresting a suspect must duly warn him first {{that he does not}} have to say any thing that may incriminate him, and that any thing he will say may be used against him. According to Israeli law, the exercise of the right to remain silent may be considered as supplemental evidence in most cases, and this fact also needs to be explained to the suspect. Also the officer needs to inform the suspect that he has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> a family member or acquaintance and a lawyer of his arrest, his right for counsel, and the duration he can be held before he is released or brought before a judge.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to compare}} and {{contrast}} the approaches taken by the UK and Norway in providing employment protection for whistleblowers. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines the legislative provisions contained in the Employment Rights Act 1996 (UK) and the Work Environment Act 2005 (Norway) together with relevant case law and preparatory papers. Findings – Unlike the UK, Norway affords employees a statutory <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> wrongdoing and requires employers to develop internal reporting procedures. The authors believe that the approaches taken to protecting whistleblowers reflect the different systems of industrial relations in these two countries. Practical implications – In the light of this research {{it is suggested that}} a right to disclose wrongdoing should be introduced in the UK together with a duty on employers to show that it has not been infringed. It is also recommended that what can be reported should be more precisely defined in Norway either by law or collective bargaining. Originality/value – The paper makes proposals for the reform of legislation in both countries...|$|E
50|$|The Victims' Bill of Rights made various {{changes to}} the California Penal Code and the Welfare and Institutions Code.

40|$|The paper {{refers to}} the {{limitation}} of obedience to official orders by officials of state offices. The subject {{of the study is}} orders in relation superior — subordinate, within an administrative organ. The writer treats the order as an actual activity and not an administrative act. In the writer’s opinion, in a situation when execution of an unlawful order would expose the official to legal responsibility, he should refuse to obey. Though this rule does not result expressis verbis from § 9 of the Decree of the (Polish) Cabinet, 20 Dec. 1974, but it can be deduced from the whole of existing law and rules. The duty to report the reservations to the order giver and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the higher superior about the wrong order have also been discussed in the paper. The above mentioned legal institutions are among the basic preventive means to secure the realisation of the principle of legality and to increase the democratisation in official relations.

40|$|Louis Antonacci, an {{attorney}} for the U.

Furthermore, these international prison transfer regimes, of which the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons is but one, and which the United States is a signatory, should apply with equal force in state prison and proceedings as it does in federal prisons and proceedings. The disparate treatment of foreign nationals determined by state or federal incarceration creates a divided front in foreign policy. The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not reflect those of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers...|$|R

40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} a {{selection}} of the standards identifiable in the published work of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment ("the CPT"). Part I commences with {{an examination of the}} mandate and modus operandi of the Committee, followed by an exposition of the two fundamental principles - of confidentiality and co-operation - which inform its work. The CPT's standard-setting work is introduced by means of an examination of its evolution and rationale, the purport of standards set {{and the ways in which}} such standards find expression. Part II concerns CPT precepts on police custody. It begins with an examination of the CPT's "three fundamental safeguards against ill-treatment": the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> a third party of the fact of one's detention, of access to legal advice and to a medical examination by a doctor of one's own choosing. It then considers, in turn, the duty to inform a detainee of all his rights; the conduct of police interrogations; the electronic recording of interviews; the maintenance of custody records; and police complaints and inspection procedures. Part III is devoted to a number of matters considered under the umbrella term "imprisonment". It begins with a detailed examination of the phenomenon of prison overcrowding, its effects on detainees and the prison environment, and policies designed to eradicate it or at least mitigate its effects. There then follow two sections on recourse to and safeguards attending, the use of force and/or instruments of restraint and solitary confinement in places of detention (which places include, for the sake of completeness, police establishments, immigration detention centres, psychiatric establishments, etc.). Part IV attemptst o draw everything together, to assess the impact of CPT standards on national criminal justice and penal policy and to consider ways in which that impact might be enhanced...|$|R

The Enron case {{underscores the importance of}} encouraging employees to diversify. Workers need clear and understandable information about their pension plans to make sound decisions on retirement savings. Although disclosure rules require plan sponsors to provide participants with a summary of their plan benefits and <b>rights</b> and <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> them when benefits are changed, this information is not always clear, particularly in the case of complex plans like floor-offset arrangements. Employees, like other investors, also need reliable and understandable information on a company's financial condition and prospects. Fiduciary standards form the cornerstone of private pension protections. These standards require plan sponsors to act solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The Enron investigations should determine whether plan fiduciaries acted in accordance with their responsibilities. ...|$|R

50|$|Claire is unmoved by Norman's {{explanation}} {{and tells him}} the only way <b>to</b> make it <b>right</b> is <b>to</b> <b>notify</b> the police and bring Madison's body up from the lake. Norman pretends {{to speak with the}} police on the phone and agrees for an officer to come to the house. When he leaves to take a shower, Claire redials the phone and discovers that he called 411 (information), not 911. Norman grabs her from behind and sedates her with a paralyzing drug. He drags her to the bathtub and leaves her to drown in the rising water, so that she will appear to have committed suicide. In the midst of this Norman then confesses to Claire that his previous story had been a lie: he killed Madison to prevent her from going to the Dean about the affair and ruining his career. He intimates that he hopes Claire's death will bring him closer to her daughter Caitlin. As he leans in for a final kiss, he spots Madison's necklace around Claire's neck and tries to remove it. Claire's face takes on the image of Madison, and in shock Norman slips on the floor and bangs his head {{on the rim of the}} tub, knocking him out.|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, an {{increasing}} number of epidemiologic studies have found cohorts of workers to be at high risk of work-related chronic diseases, especially cancers. These studies frequently have led to the broad recognition of occupational hazards and eventually to the prevention of exposures to such hazards. Generally, however, the individual cohort members found to be at high risk have not been notified of study results, and programs of medical intervention or of palliative services directed at these individual workers have not been developed. Recently, the {{issue of whether or not}} workers have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be <b>notified</b> more directly about known health hazards to which they may have been exposed has emerged as a major, unresolved question in public health policy. Issues of concern include the criteria that should guide notifications; whom, when, and how to notify; and who should pay for notification and follow-up services. This commentary discusses the scientific, ethical, economic, and institutional aspects of worker notification, and describes three new demonstration projects that have provided notification and intervention for workers at high risk of bladder, colon, and lung cancer...|$|R
