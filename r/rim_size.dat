5000|$|Traditional splash cymbals, {{as first}} popularized by Gene Krupa, are 8"-12" [...] {{in size and}} medium in weight {{with little or no}} taper and {{therefore}} a thick <b>rim</b> for their <b>size.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{race was}} {{extended}} from 500 miles to 1000 kilometres in 1973. The increased {{pace of the}} cars had resulted in the 500 mile race distance being achieved earlier each year, and since Australia had converted to the metric system the increased distance was considered more appropriate than 800 km for an endurance race. To reduce the threat to public safety, homologation rules were relaxed to permit certain modifications to the race cars. Ostensibly this removed the need to build batches of high speed road cars and improved the durability of the actual race cars. The Group E Series Production Touring Car regulations, which had applied to the 1972 race, were replaced by the new Group C Touring Car regulations for 1973. [...] Upgrades were allowed to seats, lubrication systems, camshafts, carburettors, suspensions, brakes and wheel <b>rim</b> <b>sizes.</b> These changes advantaged the better resourced teams as {{a great deal of}} testing was now needed to optimize the performance of the race cars. Factory teams had the best access to improved components that were often not readily available to private competitors.|$|R
2500|$|A {{feature of}} Northern Song coinage is the sets of dui qian (...) [...] This means the {{simultaneous}} use {{of two or}} three different calligraphic styles on coins of the same period title which are otherwise identical in size of hole, width of <b>rim,</b> thickness, <b>size</b> and position of the characters and alloy. One can assume that these congruences arose from the workmanship of the different mints, but no attributions have yet been proposed.|$|R
50|$|Tires {{come with}} {{standardized}} tire code sizing information, {{found on the}} sidewalls of the tires. The first letter(s), indicate the vehicle type (P for passenger, LT for light truck). The next three digits indicate the tire's width in millimeters. The middle two digit number indicates the tire's height-to-width ratio. The next character is a letter 'R,' which indicates radial ply tires (rather than radius). followed by a final two digit number indicating the <b>rim</b> <b>size</b> for the vehicle's wheels.|$|E
5000|$|The first purpose {{made and}} commercially {{available}} trials bikes were manufactured by Montesa a mototrials company and {{were based on}} the modified bmx bikes that riders had been using. As a result of being based on BMX bikes, the rear dropout spacing is 116mm. These 20″ wheeled trials bikes have become known colloquially as Mod bikes. It should be noted that some mod bikes have a 19" [...] rear wheel to make room for a bigger tyre, but the overall tyre diameter is similar regardless of the <b>rim</b> <b>size,</b> so this is mostly important as a compatibility issue for spare parts.|$|E
50|$|The {{stance of}} a vehicle is {{determined}} by its suspension height and the fitment of the wheels in the fender arches. It may refer to any vehicle, including sports cars, pickup trucks and off-road vehicles, however it is mostly associated with lowered sports cars, sedans, hatchbacks, vans and other body styles of passenger cars. The main parameters of the vehicle's stance are suspension height and position of the wheels. Suspension height usually depends of the suspension components including springs, coilover, air bags and camber plates. Wheel position usually depends on the <b>rim</b> <b>size,</b> off-set or wheel spacers. Tire fitment also plays a big role from both visual and functional perspective.|$|E

5000|$|The [...]50 Beowulf uses a rebated rim design. This round {{is used in}} {{specialized}} AR-15 upper receivers, and the <b>rim</b> {{matches the}} <b>size</b> of the <b>rim</b> of the 7.62×39mm, allowing those parts {{to be used in}} the custom-built upper receivers.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]470 Capstick is a belted magnum {{with the}} same <b>rim</b> and belt <b>size</b> as a [...]375 H&H. The case has a length of 2.800 in, and the overall {{cartridge}} length is 3.65 in. A cartridge drawing is shown below for dimensions.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]50 GI {{is not in}} the magnum {{class and}} works at the same {{pressures}} as the [...]45 ACP.

This new brass is made by Starline Brass and is slightly shorter than a standard [...]45 ACP. The magazine well in the grip frame has thinner walls than a standard M1911 to accommodate the [...]50 GI's wider magazine, and the flame feed ramp is contoured with a more open radius for the larger-diameter [...]50-caliber bullet. Both are machined from heat-treated forgings, and the Model No. 1's hammer and sear are machined from tool steel.|$|E

5000|$|The modern tire-size designations (e.g. [...] "37-622", {{also known}} as ETRTO) are defined by {{international}} standard ISO 5775, along with corresponding <b>rim</b> <b>size</b> designations (e.g., [...] "622×19C"). Older English (inch, e.g. [...] "28 x 1 ⅝ x 1 ⅜") and French (metric, e.g. [...] "700x35C") designations are also still used, but can be ambiguous. The diameter of the tire must match {{the diameter of the}} rim, but the width of the tire only has to be in the range of widths appropriate for the width of the rim, while also not exceeding the clearances allowed by the frame, brakes, and any accessories such as fenders. Diameters vary from a large 910 mm, for touring unicycles, to a small 125 mm, for roller skiing. Widths vary from a narrow 18 mm to a wide 119 mm for the Surly Big Fat Larry.|$|E

50|$|When {{leaving the}} factory, all non-V8 MGBs were {{originally}} fitted with Pirelli Cinturato tyres (CA67). Cross-ply tyres (560-14) were standard until 1972 with radials being optional. From 1972 {{there were two}} different radial sizes factory-fitted to new cars, {{depending on whether the}} car was a roadster,(155/80x14) or a GT,(165/80x14). With the 1974.5 arrival of the rubber bumper cars the factory-fitted tyre size was simplified to 165/80x14 for all cars, irrespective of whether the car was a roadster or a GT, and also irrespective of the wheel type (wire or RoStyle). Later on during the rubber bumper production period, alloy wheels were introduced on several different limited edition models - with the final one-thousand LE models being the last cars to leave the factory with alloy wheels which, although the same 5”x14” <b>rim</b> <b>size</b> as the RoStyle, had 185/70x14 radials fitted. This wider tyre was not factory fitted to wire wheels. The factory built V8s were fitted with full profile 175HR14 tyres.|$|E
5000|$|The wheel size is the {{diameter}} of the wheel in inches where the beads of the tire sit on the wheel. This measurement does not include the rim flange. Modern road tires have several measurements associated with their size as specified by tire codes like 225/70R14. The first number in the code (e.g., [...] "225") represents the nominal tire width in millimeters. This is followed by the aspect ratio (e.g.,"70"), which is the height of the side wall expressed {{as a percentage of the}} nominal width. [...] "R" [...] stands for radial and relates to the tire construction. The final number in the code (e.g.,"14") is the <b>rim</b> <b>size</b> measured in inches. The overall circumference of the tire will increase by increasing any of the tire's specifications. For example, increasing the width of the tire will also increase its circumference, because the side wall height is a proportional length. Increasing the aspect ratio will increase the height of the tire and hence the circumference.|$|E
5000|$|A banjo {{manufacturer}} named Samuel Swaim Stewart, {{also called}} S.S., invented the banjeaurine. From Philadelphia, Stewart advertised the banjeaurine and this instrument became {{a critical part}} of banjo orchestras. The banjeaurine first hit the music scene in 1885. In banjo orchestras, the banjeaurine was responsible {{for the majority of the}} solos in musical pieces. The banjeaurine has a short neck with a scale between 19" [...] and 20", a fretboard extension that is cantilevered over the head, and either 17 or 19 frets. It is a higher pitched version of the conventional 5 string banjo. Most banjorines, especially early ones, have 12" [...] to 12-1/2" [...] diameter rims. Later models may have 11" [...] rims, a size that became a standard banjo <b>rim</b> <b>size</b> during the late 1920s. The body has a top made out of skin or synthetic, and usually an open back without a resonator. The banjeaurine has five strings. One is shorter than the others, and is called the fifth string, or thumb string. The concept of the banjeaurine is similar to that of other banjo family instruments.|$|E
40|$|We present Halpha {{spectropolarimetry}} {{observations of}} a sample of 10 bright T Tauri stars, supplemented with new Herbig Ae/Be star data. A change in the linear polarisation across Halpha is detected {{in most of the}} T Tauri (9 / 10) and Herbig Ae (9 / 11) objects, which we interpret in terms of a compact source of line photons that is scattered off a rotating accretion disk. We find consistency between the position angle (PA) of the polarisation and those of imaged disk PAs from infrared and millimetre imaging and interferometry studies, probing much larger scales. For the Herbig Ae stars AB Aur, MWC 480 and CQ Tau, we find the polarisation PA to be perpendicular to the imaged disk, which is expected for single scattering. On the other hand, the polarisation PA aligns with the outer disk PA for the T Tauri stars DR Tau and SU Aur and FU Ori, conforming to the case of multiple scattering. This difference can be explained if the inner disks of Herbig Ae stars are optically thin, whilst those around our T Tauri stars and FU Ori are optically thick. Furthermore, we develop a novel technique that combines known inclination angles and our recent Monte Carlo models to constrain the inner <b>rim</b> <b>sizes</b> of SU Aur, GW Ori, AB Aur, and CQ Tau. Finally, we consider the connection of the inner disk structure with the orientation of the magnetic field in the foreground interstellar medium: for FU Ori and DR Tau, we infer an alignment of the stellar axis and the larger magnetic field direction.
