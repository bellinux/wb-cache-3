40|$|This paper {{studies the}} coordinated control of space {{manipulators}} and their spacecraft. The dynamics of freeflying space robotic systems are written compactly as {{functions of the}} system barycentric vectors. A control technique is developed that includes requirements on a spacecraft's position and orientation {{as well as on}} its manipulator. A Transposed-Jacobian type controller with inertial feedback is developed and an example is used to demonstrate this technique. I. INTRODUCTION Free-flying space robotic systems have been proposed for use in space in which a robotic manipulator is mounted on a spacecraft with a <b>reaction</b> <b>jet</b> attitude control system [1, 2]. One control method for such systems calculates the <b>reaction</b> <b>jet</b> forces required to keep the spacecraft stationary while the manipulator achieves minimum time performance [3].

40|$|The {{motions of}} robotic {{manipulators}} mounted on spacecraft can disturb the spacecraft's positions and attitude. These disturbances can surpass {{the ability of}} the system's attitude control <b>reaction</b> <b>jets</b> to control them, for the disturbances increase as manipulator speeds increase. If the manipulator moves too quickly the resulting disturbances can exceed the saturation levels of the <b>reaction</b> <b>jets,</b> causing excessive spacecraft motions.
