40|$|A lidar {{remote sensing}} system wherein a laser signal is {{transmitted}} along an optical path through a telescope having a primary and secondary mirrors and a rotating prism at the telescope output. When the reflected signal from the target is received it is passed back through the system to a detector, where it is heterodyned with a signal from a local oscillator to detect Doppler frequency shifts in the <b>returned</b> <b>signal.</b> Since the prism is rotating, the prism will be at one position when the signal is transmitted and at another when the <b>returned</b> <b>signal</b> is received.

25|$|Stephen D. Julstrom of Shure Brothers, Inc. (Evanston, Illinois) {{was granted}} a patent in 1987 for a {{teleconferencing}} system that used special directionally gated microphones mixed automatically and sent to a distant party via telephone line. The <b>return</b> <b>signal</b> from the distant party was compared in strength to the local mix to determine which party was to be most prominent in the overall mix. Any interrupting party was given priority. Four years later, Shure would introduce the AMS4000 and AMS8000 automixers for sound reinforcement; mixers which required the use of special directional condenser microphones of the Shure AMS Series.|$|E
25|$|CH-type radar {{displays}} use a {{time base}} generator {{to produce a}} smoothly varying voltage that is fed {{to one of the}} inputs of a cathode ray tube (CRT). The time base is calibrated to move the CRT dot across the screen in the same time that echoes would be returned from objects at the radar's maximum range. The dot moves so rapidly that it looks like a solid line. The <b>return</b> <b>signal</b> is amplified and then sent into the CRT's other channel, causing the spot to deflect away from the straight line being created by the time base. For small objects, like aircraft, the deflection causes a small blip to appear on the display. The range to the target can be measured by comparing the location of the blip to a calibrated scale on the display.|$|E

The range of an individual target was represented by its location across {{the width of the}} film, the time by a dotdash code along the length. In addition to this positional information, the target's approximate radial velocity (velocity in the direction of observation) was determined by measuring the Doppler frequency shift in the radar signal when it returned.

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of the low impedance required by matching, PCB signal traces carry much more current than their on-chip counterparts. This larger current induces crosstalk primarily in a magnetic or inductive mode as opposed to a capacitive mode. To combat this crosstalk, digital PCB designers must remain acutely aware of not only the intended signal path for every signal, but also the path of <b>returning</b> <b>signal</b> current for every signal. The signal itself and its <b>returning</b> <b>signal</b> current path are equally capable of generating inductive crosstalk. Differential trace pairs help to reduce these effects.|$|R
