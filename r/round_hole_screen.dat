The optimal structural parameters of arch hole(s) at dam bottom {{can be obtained from}} hydrodynamic modeling as that two arch holes with 30 ?mm as height and 50 ?mm as radius are symmetrically dug at dam bottom with the distance between arch hole center and dam center as 205 ?mm; or the optimal structural parameters of <b>round</b> <b>hole(s)</b> can be recommended as that one <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> with 70 ?mm as diameter is dug at left of the dam bottom with the distance between hole center and dam center as 205 ?mm.

40|$|The {{derivation}} of {{the classical}} equation for flow through an orifice assumes a fixed orifice area. However, pipe materials exhibit expansion behaviour with increasing pressure, which alters the size of orifices and results in greater leakage rates. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to study the behaviour of <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> and cracks in pipes through theoretical and experimental work. The results of the study include equations derived for increased flow through <b>round</b> <b>holes</b> in pressurized cylindrical shells and pipes. The theoretical models explain the increased flow experienced due to the leak area increasing. The models incorporate material properties, shell geometry and fluid properties for both uni-axially and bi-axially stressed pipe sections. Analytical results are compared with previous finite element investigations. In addition, an experimental study into the effects of pressure on a <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> in a class 6 uPVC pipe was conducted. Conclusions are made relating to the influence of material expansion to increased flow rate through openings in pressurised cylinders. The results compared positively with those of the theoretical equations. Conclusions are made relating to the influence of <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> or crack expansion to an increased flow rate through openings in pressurised pipes. Results include the effects of geometrical and material variables on the expansion of <b>round</b> <b>holes.</b> Better explanation of the increased flow through orifices, documented by practical observations, is presented. Results indicate that <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> area is linearly related to pressure. However, testing on longitudinal cracks resulted in a non-linear relationship between crack area and internal pipe pressure. Results indicate the expansion of <b>round</b> <b>hole</b> area is minimal. Leakage however is greatly affected over extended time periods by even the smallest increase in defect area. Critical pressures before brittle fracture obtained from testing on longitudinal cracks were compared to theoretical formulation. Results show a close relationship between current theory and experimentation. Prof. K. van Zy...|$|R

30|$|The {{presence}} of the hole reduces the cluster-induced energy loss for all velocities. The value of Δ Eloss also shows {{that the effect of}} the <b>hole</b> <b>screening</b> is more significant the slower the electron. The energy loss of the electron moving at 1 a.u. decreases almost by a factor of 2 when we include the <b>hole</b> <b>screening</b> in the process. An interesting consequence is that at low velocities, the effects associated with the <b>hole</b> <b>screening</b> might become crucial in determining if the photoemission process can indeed take place or not. For example, the kinetic energy of the slowest electron considered in Table 1 is 0.5 a.u. Since the energy loss in the case without hole is 0.6 a.u., this electron cannot be photoemitted from the cluster. However, in the {{presence of}} the hole, photoemission becomes possible.|$|R
