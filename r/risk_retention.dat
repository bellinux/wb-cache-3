Fifty-nine (59) US and sixty-one (61) Hong Kong auditors employed by the Big- 4 accounting firms participated in this study. The result shows that litigation environment has a significant effect on auditors' decisions. Auditors who practice in more litigious environments tend to be less willing {{to go along with}} clients' aggressive reporting than those who practice in less litigious environments. This study also confirms that there is a significant interactive effect between litigation environment, client business <b>risk,</b> and client <b>retention</b> pressure on auditors' decisions to accept clients' aggressive reporting choices.

40|$|We defined {{retention}} of fetal membranes (RFM) in dairy ewes as failure to expel the placenta within 6 h after lambing the last lamb and designed a matched case-control study to identify {{factors that affect}} the <b>risk</b> of <b>retention.</b> For each ewe with RFM, the next ewe in the flock that lambed and expelled the placenta in < 6 h after lambing the last lamb was selected as control. Data analyzed included 92 pairs of ewes from 25 flocks comprising a total of 7275 ewes (median flocksize 270 ewes). Factors investigated for associations with RFM were induction of lambing, obstetrical assistance because of dystocia, parity, the number of liveborn lambs, the occurrence of stillbirth(s), the mean weight of the litter {{on the third day}} post-lambing and the occurrence of neonatal death in the Litter. Conditional logistic regression indicated (1) that the risk of RFM increased linearly with increasing number of liveborn lambs and (2) that the <b>risk</b> of <b>retention</b> was 4 -fold higher in ewes that received assistance at lambing than those that lambed normally.

40|$|Seventy-one {{pairs of}} ewes {{with or without}} {{retention}} of fetal membranes in the previous lambing season, were included in a cohort study of 25 flocks in southern Greece; in 27 pairs regulation of the breeding cycle was applied, whilst in the other 44 pairs natural mating took place. The following measures of reproductive performance were calculated: cycling rate, mating rate, return-to-estrus rate, abortion rate, lambing rate, total lambs born per ewe, liveborn lambs per ewe, stillbirth rate, lamb-bodyweight per ewe; furthermore, the incidence <b>risk</b> of <b>retention</b> of fetal membranes during the lambing {{examined in this study}} was also calculated. No statistically significant differences were observed in the reproductive performance among ewes that had or had not retained their fetal membranes during the previous lambing, whether the breeding cycle was regulated or not. The incidence <b>risk</b> of <b>retention</b> of fetal membranes among ewes that had not retained its placenta in the previous lambing was 1. 6 %, whilst that among ewes that had retained its placenta in the previous lactation was 0 %.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the rate of urinary retention after knee arthroplasty, the various factors involved in predicting those at <b>risk</b> for <b>retention</b> and {{to assess the impact}} of retention and catheterization on joint sepsis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all available case notes of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in a consecutive 2 -year period (2000 - 2002). Adequate data was available for 142 patients. RESULTS: 142 patients underwent total knee arthroplasty. 19 patients were catheterized preoperatively for monitoring urine output. 123 patients were not catheterized. Urinary retention occurred in 19. 7 % (28 / 142). The mean day of catheterization for retention was 0. 66. The mean duration of catheterization in patients developing retention was 3. 58 days and was 3 days in the patients catheterized pre - or perioperatively. Deep joint sepsis occurred in 2. 1 % (3 / 142) - only one had been catheterized and that was preoperatively. No case of infection had urinary retention or had a symptomatic urinary tract infection. The only factors predicting those at significant <b>risk</b> of <b>retention</b> following knee arthroplasty was a past medical history of urinary retention (p = 0. 049) and postoperative morphine requirement (p = 0. 035). No patients required urological surgical intervention at mean follow up of 1. 97 years. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the use of indwelling urinary catheterization for patients developing urinary retention after total knee arthroplasty...|$|R
30|$|Although VCE is noninvasive and can {{completely}} {{evaluate the}} small intestine {{as well as}} detect small intestinal duplications (Yang et al. 2009), DBE is {{the first choice of}} diagnostic modality to assess a duplication. There are several reasons why we recommend DBE rather than VCE. First, capsule <b>retention</b> <b>risk</b> is high in small intestinal duplication patients because ulcerated or stenotic lesions are a well-known <b>retention</b> <b>risk</b> factor of VCE. Ervin et al. reported capsule retention for several weeks in a nearby circumferential ulcerated stenotic lesion in a small intestinal duplication. Second, a small intestinal duplication opening is detected more easily by DBE than VCE, because of the ability to observe details and perform enteroclysis via the DBE scope channel. Actually, the small intestinal duplication opening was not detected by using VCE in this case, but was found by using DBE. Therefore, we should choose DBE examination rather than VCE if we suspect a small intestinal duplication.|$|R
40|$|The {{subcontracting}} {{culture in}} New Zealand {{is such that}} the same retention regime imposed on contractors is imposed on subcontractors by and large. This paradoxically fair contractual practice of back-to-back terms results in high retention rates (10 %) and long defects liability periods set from contractor’s practical completion which has caused concerns for subcontractors with no rational basis for resolving such concerns. This study investigates this phenomenon from a risk based perspective to understand the link between <b>risk</b> and <b>retentions</b> particularly in relation to current practice. Accordingly, {{it is found that}} current retention rates do not show an association with overall risk computed as a product of likelihood and consequence based on contractors’ perceptions. However, when risk is viewed through these two components, it is seen that trades with high default risks for either likelihood or consequence results in high retention rates. Additionally, it is also seen that high risk is associated with subcontractor-harsh retention regimes with some exceptions lowering the strength of this association suggesting the need to investigate such trades to understand whether there are other overwhelming reasons for such exceptions. Thus, it is concluded that <b>risk</b> and <b>retention</b> regimes are linked to this extent although for a given level of risk, subcontractor friendly or unfriendly regimes could be achieved by a mix of different retention rates and release mechanisms. In this regard, it is seen that contractors seem to prefer high retention rates than longer defects liability periods for trades which have high risk levels. A further understanding about this relationship could be developed by undertaking a study on perceived overall risk levels and perceived retention regimes. ...|$|R

2500|$|There is no {{standard}} {{to screen for}} wisdom teeth. It has been suggested, absent evidence to support routinely retaining or removing wisdom teeth, that evaluation with panoramic radiograph, starting {{between the ages of}} 16 and 25 be completed every 3 years.

These recommendations are based on expert opinion level evidence.
