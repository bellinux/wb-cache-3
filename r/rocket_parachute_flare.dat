50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} hand grenades, {{a personal}} grenade launcher {{can easily be}} used to launch flares as a signaling or illumination device. Like 40 mm smoke grenades, in the US military they are all of 40×46mm caliber, serving more of a use in the individual rather than the crew-served capacity. They also come in two main types, cluster <b>flares</b> and <b>parachute</b> <b>flares.</b> Cluster flares are used primarily for signaling, while <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> are used primarily for illumination.|$|R

50|$|From 1948-49, {{she served}} in the Israel Defense Forces' science corps, {{achieving}} the rank of second lieutenant in a scientific research unit which was developing and testing <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> which would be dropped from planes to illuminate enemy territory.|$|R
2500|$|The bridge layout was {{significantly}} altered; the biggest alteration was {{the addition of}} a two-tier director control tower that improved visibility and gave better protection to the equipment. Vertically fired [...] "snowflake" [...] <b>parachute</b> <b>flare</b> projectors were fitted to the bridge wings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Parachute</b> <b>flares</b> come in 4 colors: white (M583/A1), green (M661), red (M662), {{and orange}} (XM695). The {{parachute}} {{is designed to}} create a 7 feet per second descent, while the flare itself has a 40-second burn time. [...] The XM695 was never standardized.|$|R
5000|$|... 27 June 1952: VP-9 {{deployed}} to NAF Iwakuni, Japan. During this deployment a detachment {{was sent to}} Korea to aid in UN operations. VP-9 aircraft operated in conjunction with USMC F7F night-ﬁghter aircraft, dropping <b>parachute</b> <b>ﬂares</b> to light North Korean roads, bridges, supply dumps and convoys to aid the attacking F7Fs.|$|R
50|$|While HE is most {{used for}} {{suppress}}ion, smoke screens {{can also be}} used to suppress by obscuring the enemy's view, this is effective against an enemy with direct fire weapons. Modern smoke is impenetrable to modern thermal imaging sights. In peace support operations, illuminating with <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> has been used to thwart activities by a warring party.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} missions. The last-ditch mission is [...] "immediate suppression": Every gun in any concerned battery immediately fires whatever round and fuse is loaded, possibly from someone else's, or more than one callsign's mission. The FO may end up getting <b>parachute</b> <b>flares,</b> white phosphorus illumination, DPICM, and VT-HE rounds on the target in the same shot.|$|R
50|$|During {{his second}} {{pass over the}} Indian Ocean, Glenn found that the Indian Ocean {{tracking}} ship was in heavy weather. The tracking station had planned to release balloons for a pilot observation experiment, but instead the ship fired star-shell <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> as Friendship 7 passed overhead. Glenn was able to observe the flashes of lightning from storms in the area {{but was unable to}} see the flares.|$|R
50|$|A Magnum 501 <b>rocket</b> powered <b>parachute</b> {{system is}} under {{development}} for the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Unrotated {{projectile}} a British <b>rocket</b> launched <b>parachute</b> aerial mine {{system for}} ship defence.|$|R
25|$|On 1 August 1950 the 8th started flying night {{intruder}} missions. The 8th flew {{this type}} of mission {{for the remainder of}} the war except for an occasional special mission. Late in August the Air Force began flare missions over North Korea. B-29 Superfortresses would release <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> at 10,000 feet that ignited at 6,000 feet, whereupon co-operating B-26 bombers attacked any enemy movement discovered in the illuminated area.|$|R
50|$|A major early {{employer}} was the Hitt Fireworks Company (1905-1960s) {{located at}} what is now Hitt's Hill Park. It employed 200 workers in the 1930s and was credited for firework displays at several world's fairs and Fourth of July celebrations. During World War II it produced smoke screens and <b>parachute</b> <b>flares.</b> The Hitt Fireworks Company also provided pyrotechnic effects for some major release films including Gone with the Wind.|$|R
50|$|The fuze {{action is}} {{initiated}} by impact, elapsed time after firing or proximity to a target. In {{most cases the}} fuze action causes detonation of the main high explosive charge in a shell or a small charge to eject a carrier shell’s contents. These contents may be lethal, such as the now-obsolete shrapnel shell or modern sub-munitions, or non-lethal such as canisters containing a smoke compound or a <b>parachute</b> <b>flare.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Illumination {{projectiles}} are base-ejecting rounds which deploy {{a bright}} <b>parachute</b> <b>flare</b> ideally 600 meters {{above the ground}} and illuminates an area of approximately 1 grid square (1,000 square meters). Illumination rounds are often {{used in conjunction with}} HE rounds, to illuminate the target area so that HE rounds can be fired more effectively. Illumination rounds can also be used during the daytime to mark targets for aircraft. The M485 Illumination round burns for 120 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|... 138th Brigade {{was once}} again in support during the Battle of Ramicourt (3 October), taking up the attack during the afternoon, with 4th Leicesters passing through Ramicourt itself and then {{advancing}} over open ground to reach a sunken road at Montbrehain occupied by the Sherwood Foresters {{and a variety of}} other detachments. The battalion took up position along the railway embarkment from Ramicourt to Montbrehain and held it through the night under attack by German aircraft using <b>parachute</b> <b>flares.</b>|$|R
50|$|The forward firing GPMGs were {{electrically}} operated, {{being fired}} by the pilot and aimed using a rudimentary system of drawing a small cross on the windscreen with a chinagraph pencil. In sandy conditions, these weapons could jam, which necessitated one of the free crew leaning out of the cockpit door and 'booting' the offending weapon {{in the hope of}} clearing it. This procedure was not strictly in accordance with the flight reference cards. The L7A1 pintle-mounted weapon was operated by a door gunner.In the anti-tank role, four SS.11 ATGWs were carried; these could be carried in conjunction with the pintle-mounted GPMG. During the Falklands campaign, the SS.11 achieved some success, being used to attack Argentine positions on 14 June 1982. For night time reconnaissance, the Scout could carry four 4.5 in <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> mounted on special carriers. In addition, two smaller <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> could be carried to allow emergency landings at night. These were fitted on the starboard rear fuselage on a special attachment point. About 150 Scout helicopters were acquired for the Army Air Corps and were operated by them up until 1994.|$|R
25|$|Another {{problem was}} navigation. As night-flying aids {{in a day}} fighter were rudimentary, an {{elaborate}} system of visual aids to navigation had to be established, encompassing light beacons, searchlight patterns, flak guns firing combinations of various tracer colours through the clouds and <b>parachute</b> <b>flares.</b> To {{make up for the}} lack of visual aids initially, converted bomber pilots had to be used, because they already had experience with navigating at night. Another navigation aid was simply the Allied bombing target; a city illuminated as it burned would guide the fighters to their target.|$|R
5000|$|American Legion, {{still lay}} off [...] "Red" [...] Beach {{in the predawn}} hours of the 9th, too, and began observing heavy gunfire commencing at 01:48 to the northwestward. Lookouts also saw flares and tracers, with <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> brightly {{lighting}} up the area to the northeastward. Transport Group [...] "X-ray" [...] ceased discharging cargo and darkened ship, remaining shut down {{for the rest of}} the night, crews at general quarters. American Legion men did not know it at the time, but they were witnessing the disastrous Battle of Savo Island, in which three American heavy cruisers were sunk, one American heavy cruiser damaged and an Australian heavy cruiser sunk.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{protecting}} helicopter troop assaults {{and supporting}} ground actions, the Mi-24 also protected convoys, using rockets with flechette warheads to drive off ambushes; performed strikes on predesignated targets; {{and engaged in}} [...] "hunter-killer" [...] sweeps. Hunter-killer Mi-24s operated at a minimum in pairs, but were more often in groups of four or eight, to provide mutual fire support. The Mujahideen learned to move mostly at night to avoid the gunships, and in response the Soviets trained their Mi-24 crews in night-fighting, dropping <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> to illuminate potential targets for attack. The Mujahideen quickly caught on and scattered {{as quickly as possible}} when Soviet target designation flares were lit nearby.|$|R
5000|$|Privateers {{were also}} used during the Korean War to fly [...] "Firefly" [...] night {{illumination}} missions dropping <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> to detect North Korean and Chinese seaborne infiltrators. In addition, Privateers were used by the US Navy for signals intelligence (SIGINT) flights off of {{the coast of the}} Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. On 8 April 1950, Soviet La-11 fighters shot down a US Navy PB4Y-2 Privateer (BuNo 59645) over the Baltic Sea, off the coast of Liepāja, Latvia. Named the Turbulent Turtle, the aircraft was assigned to Patrol Squadron 26 (VP-26), Det A [...] The French also used Privateers as bombers during the Indochina War.|$|R
50|$|In 1946 it was {{returned}} to RAF control and was assigned to No. 53 Maintenance Unit RAF and became a maintenance sub-unit of No. 94 MU RAF which had its HQ at RAF Great Ashfield. Stored on the runways and in the buildings, were 250 lb., 500 lb., 2000 lb., and 4,00 lb. bombs, balloon cable cutting cartridges, depth charges, 7-inch <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> and German ammunition. The latter two items were eventually taken to 53 MU at RAF Pulham, and destroyed there. Some time in July 1949, the site {{was taken over by}} 53 MU until Bungay's closure in 1955. The airfield was eventually put up for sale and disposed of in 1961/1962.|$|R
50|$|Sicard left Pearl Harbor on 24 September for a {{new area}} of operations, the Southwest Pacific. She escorted ships to Nouméa and Espiritu Santo, and then {{continued}} to Purvis Bay {{where she and her}} sisters, Gamble (DM-15) and Breese (DM-18), formed a fast mine-laying group. The group sortied on 31 October to plant an offensive minefield off Bougainville Island. Just as the group completed its mission and began to retire early in the morning of 2 November, it was illuminated by <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> from enemy aircraft. Soon a friendly cruiser force steamed by at high speed in the opposite direction and opened fire on an invisible enemy. Sicards group had unknowingly helped bring the opposing forces together for the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay.|$|R
2500|$|Bomber Command {{attacked}} Wilhelmshaven with 177 aircraft—129 Lancaster, 40 Halifax {{and eight}} Short Stirlings on 11/12 February 1943. The Pathfinders {{found that the}} Wilhelmshaven area was covered by cloud. The British marked the target by <b>parachute</b> <b>flares</b> using H2S. The naval ammunition depot at Mariensiel {{to the south of}} Wilhelmshaven blew up and caused widespread damage in the naval dockyard and in the town. Zorner engaged a Lancaster [...] west northwest of Borkum and claimed it shot down over the North Sea. Zorner was the only pilot in the Luftwaffe to claim a victory on this night. One of the three crews lost in the operation flew in Lancaster I, DX-D, of No. 57 Squadron RAF. Sergeant K. T. Dutton and his six crewmembers disappeared and were listed [...] "lost without trace." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first of}} the British {{aircraft}} took off at around 17:20 hours CET for the [...] journey. This {{was a group of}} Lancasters from Bomber Command's 83 Squadron, No. 5 Group, acting as the Pathfinders, or flare force, whose job it was to find Dresden and drop magnesium <b>parachute</b> <b>flares,</b> known to the Germans as [...] "Christmas trees", to light up the area for the bombers. The next set of aircraft to leave England were twin-engined Mosquito marker planes, which would identify target areas and drop 1,000-pound target indicators (TIs)" [...] that created a red glow for the bombers to aim at. The attack was to centre on the Ostragehege sports stadium, next to the city's medieval Altstadt (old town), with its congested and highly combustible timbered buildings.|$|R

50|$|The cockpit {{walls and}} windows are very thick, able to {{withstand}} an engine explosion. Additionally, the cockpit is detachable and is equipped with two <b>rocket</b> propelled <b>parachutes</b> (main and back-up).

50|$|During trials, ceasefires {{with the}} German flak units were arranged, to prevent {{friendly}} fire {{but it became}} apparent that co-ordination of ceasefires with Wilde Sau operations was difficult. To remove this threat from their own flak, the fighters were limited to certain altitudes, so the German flak could avoid firing on them.Another problem was navigation. As night-flying aids in a day fighter were rudimentary, an elaborate system of visual aids to navigation had to be established, encompassing light beacons, searchlight patterns, flak guns firing combinations of various tracer colours through the clouds and <b>parachute</b> <b>flares.</b> To make up for the lack of visual aids initially, converted bomber pilots had to be used, because they already had experience with navigating at night.

50|$|Some water <b>rockets</b> have <b>parachute</b> {{or other}} {{recovery}} system {{to help prevent}} problems. However these systems can suffer from malfunctions. This is often taken into account when designing rockets. Rubber , Crumple zones, and safe launch practices can be utilized to minimize damage or injury caused by a falling rocket.|$|R
