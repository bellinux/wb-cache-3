Clinical reactions were mild, but were more noticeable in vaccinated non-immune subjects than in control subjects.

40|$|The {{responses}} of seven hpv- 77 rubella vaccinees to initial challenge with “wild” rubella virus have been {{compared with their}} responses to rechallenge with Brown strain rubella virus and to the {{responses of}} five “natural” immunes to initial Brown strain challenge. Previous exposure to “wild” rubella virus 220 days post vaccine-induced immunity had resulted in six of the seven vaccinees experiencing asymptomatic reinfection. On “rechallenge” none of the previously “reinfected vaccine immunes” demonstrated clinical, virologic or serologic evidence of reinfection. These data {{are consistent with the}} conclusion that persons with vaccine-induced immunity may be assured of more prolonged and solid immunity to rubella without having to suffer the clinical disease if they are reinfected with nonattenuated rubella virus. Rigidly controlled experiments, designed to study the practicality and safety of immunization with live <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine(s),</b> followed by deliberate challenge of vaccinees with “wild” or low tissue culture passage rubella virus, seem warranted. In addition, these data indicate that it is imperative that a distinction should be made between “vaccine immunes” and previously “reinfected vaccine immunes” in any evaluation of long term <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine(s)</b> efficacy and vaccine-induced antibody decay...|$|R

2500|$|The cell {{cultures}} of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccine,</b> {{are derived from}} tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the principle of double effect, originated by Thomas Aquinas, holds that actions with {{both good and bad}} consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination. The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying that Catholics have [...] "a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems". The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available, it is acceptable for Catholics to use the existing vaccine, writing, [...] "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible." ...|$|E

40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{introduction}} of the first vaccines more than 150 years ago, there has been opposition to vaccines, in spite of convincing evidence of benefit. The tradeoff between the public health benefits of vaccines, which accrue to large numbers of people, versus the possible negative consequences of vaccines in small numbers of individuals has been exemplified recently by the claims by some that the measles, mumps, and <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccines</b> given to large numbers of children cause autism. Despite a decade of serious scientific investigation of this claim that has yielded no supportive evidence, the anecdotal accounts of numerous parents stand in contradistinction to the claim that this vaccine is safe.

40|$|Immunisation {{has proved}} to be a {{generally}} safe and effective means of disease control, particularly where environmental approaches are impractical. Recent developments in vaccine production, aimed at selecting or synthesising in pure form the antigens needed to evoke a protective response, give hope of more effective and less toxic vaccines in future. Adequate trials of improved vaccines may, however, be difficult to carry out under modern conditions. Policies for the use of vaccines are sometimes controversial, particularly when there is concern about reactions, as with pertussis vaccine. Acceptance rates for measles and <b>rubella</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the UK have hitherto been disappointingly low and need to be increased if the aims of elimination of measles and congenital rubella are to be achieved.

Results: Data from Italy, France, and New Zealand indicated rises in the in-cidence of IDDM occurred between 24 to 48 months after the introduction of the hepatitis B immunization in young chil-dren.
