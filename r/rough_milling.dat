40|$|Abstract. For {{effective}} <b>rough</b> <b>milling,</b> an optimized criterion {{is required}} to select the feedrate. In this study, a method to obtain the most appropriate reference cutting force for <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> was developed. The reference cutting force was determined by considering the transverse rupture strength of the tool material and {{the area of the}} rupture surface. A finite element method analysis was performed to accurately calculate the area of the rupture surface. Using the analyzed results, the effect of various cutting parameters on the chipping phenomenon was determined. The calculation method for the reference cutting force considered the area of the rupture surface, the effect of the rake angle, and the axial depth of cut. The experimental results clearly show that the reference cutting force obtained from the proposed method met the desired constraints...|$|E

40|$|Increasing the {{efficiency}} of rough machining operations can produce significant productivity improvement in mould and die making {{because most of the}} metal is removed in the roughing stage. In this paper, a high-efficiency 2. 5 -dimensional <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> strategy for mould core machining is presented. The strategy consists of three different tool paths. The first tool path is generated {{on the basis of the}} convex hull boundary of a machining region. Owing to the absence of concave tool path segments, the convex hull based tool path can eliminate the chip load fluctuation problem encountered in corner cutting. The second tool path is an enhanced unidirectional straight-line tool path, which has the virtue of maintaining a steady cutting resistance throughout. The large staircases left behind by these two tool paths are refined by using the third tool path which is a contour-parallel tool path that cuts the mould core layer by layer in an upward manner. After applying these three tool paths, the stock material left on the mould core surface can be post-processed by the subsequent finish milling operation. A case study is illustrated to demonstrate the practicality of the presented <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> strategy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|This work {{looks at}} the milling of complex pockets bounded by NURBS surface. The bulk of the {{material}} removal is achieved during <b>rough</b> <b>milling,</b> which is followed by semi-finishing and finishing operations. The former usually takes {{up the bulk of}} the machining time, and therefore it is interesting to study methods to reduce <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> time. Earlier research has studied this problem in terms of optimization of tool paths for a given tool. We propose that in most cases, proper selection of multiple tools can reduce this time significantly. The greedy tool heuristic presented in this thesis is a new approach for determination of the machining volume that should be allocated to different tools selected from among a large set of available tools. Subsequent machining planning can then be performed by repeated application of standard 2 D milling algorithms. This new approach in milling of complex shapes promises, such as modern moulds and casting patterns will reduce machining time.

Trochoïds and plunge milling are new types of strategies which have found practical applications in hard materials <b>rough</b> <b>milling,</b> especially die manufacturing. On a productivity point of view, they were not favourable until the development of high-speed machine tools. This paper aims at evaluating the potential of trochoïdal milling and plunge cutting strategies in rough pocket millings.

40|$|In <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> of {{sculptured}} surface parts, decisions on process parameters concern feedrate, spindle speed, cutting speed, width of cut, raster pattern angle {{and number of}} machining slices of variable thickness. In this paper three <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> objectives are considered: minimum machining time, maximum removed material and maximum uniformity of the remaining volume {{at the end of}} roughing. Owing to the complexity of the modelled problem and the large number of parameters, typical genetic algorithms cannot achieve global optima without defining case-dependent constraints. Therefore, to achieve generality, a hierarchical game similar to a Stackelberg game is implemented in which a typical Genetic Algorithm functions as the leader and micro-Genetic Algorithms as followers. In this game, one of the leader's parameters is responsible for creating a follower's population and for triggering the optimisation. After properly weighing the three objectives, the follower performs single-objective optimization in steps and feeds the leader back with the objective values as they appear prior to weighing. Micro-Genetic Algorithm (follower) chromosome consists of the distribution of machining slice thickness, while the typical Genetic Algorithm (leader) consists of the milling parameters.

40|$|During {{the primary}} {{transformation}} in wood industry, logs {{are faced with}} conical <b>rough</b> <b>milling</b> cutters commonly named slabber or canter heads. Chips produced consist of raw materials for pulp paper and particleboard industries. The process efficiency of these industries partly comes from particle size distribution. However, chips formation is greatly dependent on milling conditions and material variability. Thus, this study aims at better understanding and predicting chips production in wood milling. The different mechanisms of their formation are studied through orthogonal cutting experiments at high cutting speed for beech and Douglas fir. Within these conditions, ejection of free water inside wood can be observed during fragmentation, particularly on beech. As previously seen in quasi-static experiments, chip thickness {{is proportional to the}} nominal cut thickness. Moreover, the grain orientation has a great influence on the cutting mechanisms, so as the nominal cut and the grows rings widths. This chip fragmentation study finally allows the improvement of the cutting conditions in <b>rough</b> <b>milling.</b> In order to optimize machine design as well as cutting geometry, a geometrical model of a generic slabber head is developed.

40|$|The {{quality control}} in hot strip mills usually include thickness, width, shape, flatness, yield strength, tensile strength, ductility, etc [...] This {{research}} takes the width {{control at the}} <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> of a hot strip mill {{as an example of}} AI applications for the quality control of the hot strip. The width control consists of the bar-to-bar width control for the mean width of bars, the in-bar width control for the width variation within bars and the head/tail width control for reducing the crop loss at the crop-shear in front of the finishing mills. Back-Propagation (BP) neural networks and Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural networks were applied to model and predict the bar-to-bar width and the in-bar width. The training and the testing of the neural networks are based on the data collected from the BHP Steel SPPD <b>roughing</b> <b>mill.</b> Bias and momentum are used in the learning process of BP networks for speeding up the learning process. Also Cauchy method is applied here to avoid the local minimum of the learning process. Moreover, polynomial regression models were developed for the comparison between the neural network models and the regression models. The comparison is also conducted for the performances between the BP networks and the RBF networks. The factor analysis both by BP networks and the regression models are used to show the most effective parameters for the width variation. The performance of the head 2 ̆ 6 tail stroking system is dependent on the original head/width shape of the incoming bar and the trace of the edger roll for the stroking. The original shapes can be classified as a limited number of basic shapes. On the other hand, the trace of the edger roll for the stroking can be represented by three parameters. Based on expert knowledge, BP neural networks are set up for representing the relationships between the basic shapes and the stroking parameters. Well trained networks can be used to automatically identify the original shapes and then provide the suitable parameters for the stroking system. The results of training and testing by some data from the BHP Steel <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> are provided. General Regression neural networks are also proposed here for the comparison between these two kinds of networks. An approach of Fuzzy Logic Controllers (FLC) is suggested for the bar-to-bar width control. In the set-up (learning) process of the FLC, it is found that BP method can lead to the failure of the learning. In order to overcome this problem, a hybrid learning algorithm is proposed for the set-up of the FLC. This algorithm includes a self-organised learning phase, a supervised learning phase and a mixed learning phase. The methods of the self-organised learning used here are the competitive learning and the input-output product-space clustering. This hybrid methodology is used to generate initial fuzzy rules and initial membership functions, to adjust membership functions and to refine final fuzzy rules. It is applied to the learning of the FLC for the bar-to-bar width model. Guide-lines to develop the expert system for all quality items at the hot strip mills are provided in this thesis. Under these guide-lines a prototype expert system is developed for the width control of the <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> of a hot strip mill. This expert system is built on G 2 system introduced by Gensym Corporation. Neural network models for the bar-to- bar width, in-bar width and head/tail width can be deployed to C programs which are recalled by the expert system. A rule-based system for the <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> width monitoring is integrated into this expert system. The results of the test running of the expert system by the raw data collected from the <b>roughing</b> <b>mill</b> are shown through the photos of the main window work-spaces provided in this thesis. Further study on applications of BP neural networks is included in this thesis. It addresses the choice of architectures, the choice of training strategies and the problems of convergence and generalisation. The results of the study confirm that the outcome of the learning for BP neural networks is related to many factors. These factors include the formations of input and output variables for BP networks, the number of layers and nodes per layer, the type of transfer functions, the learning rule, the sample sizes of training and testing, as well as the number of training cycles.
