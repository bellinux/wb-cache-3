40|$|This article {{examines}} how multiracial individuals negotiate their different and sometimes conflicting <b>racial</b> <b>identities.</b> Drawing from previous work on bicultural identity integration (see Benet-Martinez and Haritatos, 2005), {{we proposed a}} new construct, multiracial identity integration (MII), to measure individual differences in perceptions of compatibility between multiple <b>racial</b> <b>identities.</b> We found that MII is composed of two independent subscales: that describes whether different <b>racial</b> <b>identities</b> are perceived as disparate, and that describes whether different <b>racial</b> <b>identities</b> are perceived as in conflict. We also found that recalling positive multiracial experiences increased MII, while recalling negative multiracial experiences decreased MII. These findings have implications for understanding the psychological well-being of multiracial individuals, {{and the development of}} social policy and programs catered to this population...|$|R

25|$|The {{question}} of the race of ancient Egyptians was raised historically {{as a product of}} the early racial concepts of the 18th and 19th centuries, and was linked to models of racial hierarchy primarily based on craniometry, anthropometry and genetics. A variety of views circulated about the <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> of the Egyptians and the source of their culture. These were typically identified in terms of a distinction between the Caucasoid and Negroid racial categories. Some scholars argued that ancient Egyptian culture was influenced by other Afroasiatic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa, the Maghreb or the Middle East, while others pointed to influences from various Nubian groups or populations in Europe.|$|E

500|$|Margaret Beale Spencer and Vinay Harpalani (2008) {{argue that}} {{usage of the}} term [...] "acting white" [...] by black {{teenagers}} does not reflect their cultural values; rather, it is a manifestation of their <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> development, experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure. [...] Spencer and Harpalani employ William E. Cross's (1991) Nigrescence framework and contend that black teenagers' use of [...] "acting white" [...] in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers' {{use of the term}} [...] "nerd": {{the only difference is that}} black teenagers express it in racialized terms, as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure, they are grappling with <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> and what it means to be [...] "black". [...] Expressions such as [...] "acting white" [...] may or may not reflect black teenagers' cultural values, and their usage is sometimes counterintuitive: for example, Ogbu (2003) himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of [...] "acting white" [...] by her black peers because [...] "like white people, she did not have to process her hair." [...] These kind of examples show that accusations of [...] "acting white" [...] are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes (although such accusations may reflect these attributes). [...] Rather, [...] "acting white" [...] is just a manifestation of <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> development for black children and teenagers, who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be [...] "black"—in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles. That is also why such accusations are less common among black adults, who have come to greater resolution regarding <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> issues.|$|E

500|$|Catherine Hoad {{finds the}} issue of {{national}} and <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> central to Viking metal. For instance, she writes that when Trafford and Pluskowski claim that Manowar could not claim religious or <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> with the Vikings when the band had a lead singer with the [...] "'less than wholly Scandinavian name of Joey di Maio', [...] are approaching a more complex and racially-charged issue than their offhandedness would suggest." [...] While Viking imagery may be readily appropriated, according to Hoad {{the definition of a}} [...] "true" [...] Viking is quite rigid, a rigidity which non-Nordic, and especially non-White, musicians must contend with. As an example, she cites the Brazilian band Viking Throne, which claims legitimacy through European ancestry and historical references to explorations of South America by Nordic countries, and quotes their front-man, Count Nidhogg: [...] "Some people understand perfectly that it doesn't matter where you live, what's really important is your heritage and ancestry. Even living in a South American country as Brazil we all have European blood." [...] Hoad argues that Viking Throne illustrates the cultural importance of claiming Viking ancestry, a culture that operates on largely geographic lines. In contrast to Viking Throne, she cites the band Slechtvalk, which is well known for its brand of Christian Viking metal, but is rarely criticized as inauthentic by the scene. Hoad speculates that the European ethnicity of the band is enough to compensate for its otherwise counter-intuitive music.|$|E

Angelou promoted the importance of hard work, a common theme in slave narratives, throughout all her autobiographies, in order to break the African-American stereotype of laziness.

500|$|Angelou portrays Momma as {{a realist}} whose patience, courage, and silence ensured the {{survival}} {{and success of}} those who came after her.

In addition, Angelou's description of the strong and cohesive black community of Stamps demonstrates how African Americans subvert repressive institutions to withstand racism. Arensberg insists that Angelou demonstrates how she, as a Black child, evolves out of her [...] "racial hatred", common in the works of many contemporary Black novelists and autobiographers.

500|$|A central {{division}} {{within the}} Heathen movement concerns {{the issue of}} race. Some groups adopt a [...] "universalist" [...] perspective which holds that the religion is open to all, irrespective of ethnic or <b>racial</b> <b>identity,</b> while conversely, others adopt a racialist attitude—termed [...] "folkish" [...] within the community—by viewing Heathenry as a religion with inherent links to a Germanic race that should be reserved explicitly for people of Northern European descent. Some folkish Heathens further combine the religion with explicitly racist and white supremacist perspectives. Although the term [...] "Heathenry" [...] is used widely to describe the religion as a whole, many groups prefer different forms of designation, influenced by their regional focus and their attitude to race. While some groups venerating Scandinavian deities use Ásatrú or Forn Sed, those adopting folkish perspectives tend to favor the terms Odinism, Wotanism, or Odalism.|$|E

500|$|Scholars such as Claudia Tate suggest {{there is}} a theme of jealousy {{throughout}} the novel. Irene displays it here when deciding whether to expose Clare or not [...] "She was caught between two allegiances, different, yet the same. Herself. Her race. Race! The thing that bound and suffocated her. Whatever steps she took, or if she took none at all, something would be crushed. A person or the race. Clare, herself, or the race. Or, it might be, all three. Nothing, she imagined, was ever more completely sardonic.” Larsen uses jealousy as {{the main source of}} conflict in the novel, and uses race solely as a vehicle for Irene to potentially rid herself of Clare.

500|$|Contrasting {{with this}} binary division, Gardell divides Heathenry in the United States {{into three groups}} {{according}} to their stances {{on the issue of}} race: the [...] "anti-racist" [...] group which denounces any association between the religion and <b>racial</b> <b>identity,</b> the [...] "radical racist" [...] faction which sees it as the natural religion of the Aryan race that cannot rightly be followed by members of any other racial group, and the [...] "ethnic" [...] faction which seeks a middle-path by acknowledging the religion's roots in Northern Europe and its connection with those of Northern European heritage. The religious studies scholar Egil Asprem deemed Gardell's threefold typology [...] "indispensable in order {{to make sense of the}} diverging positions within the broader discourse" [...] of Heathenry. The religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein also adopted this tripartite division, although she referred to the groups as the [...] "racial-religious", [...] "a-racist", and [...] "ethnicist" [...] factions respectively.|$|E
500|$|The Cassandra Cain {{version of}} Batgirl, {{depicted}} as a biracial character (Half White and half Chinese), is notable {{as one of the}} most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, [...] "Cassandra's <b>racial</b> <b>identity</b> is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent." [...] The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian women in particular. The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the One Year Later event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: [...] "They didn't present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn't answer." ...|$|E
