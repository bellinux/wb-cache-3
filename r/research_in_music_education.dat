40|$|Calls {{for more}} male {{teachers}} are prevalent in current gender debates in education. A dominant argument {{in this debate}} is that boys are often alienated from school {{because of a lack}} of male role models in feminised areas of the school curriculum and in primary schools. Little research has investigated male teachers 2 ̆ 7 accounts of their work within feminised environments. Drawing on data collected <b>in</b> two <b>research</b> studies <b>in</b> <b>music</b> <b>education,</b> this paper focuses on accounts given by male teachers about (a) practices adopted specifically to work with boys and (b) the role of the male music teacher. Analysis of these data suggests that some male teachers working in feminised areas of the school curriculum adopt practices which, rather than challenging dominant constructions of masculinity, sometimes reinforce gender stereotypical behaviours in boys. We argue that calls for increasing the number of male teachers in feminised areas of schooling need also to be informed by open discussion of the underlying assumptions about masculinity which teachers themselves bring to their work...|$|R

Analysis of seven top-tier <b>music</b> <b>education</b> journals published from 1984 to 2007 suggested that women published below the expected frequency and that quantitative research comprised 78. 93 % of published articles.

40|$|In {{addition}} {{to the effects of}} the rise of pop, jazz and world music and the explosive development of music technology over the past five decades, the context for <b>research</b> <b>in</b> post-secondary <b>music</b> <b>education</b> has perhaps changed most significantly with the integration of conservatoires in university environments. Although some may regard the union of post-secondary music learning and academia as a marriage of convenience (the bride beautiful, artistic, but without means; the groom perhaps a little dull, but a stable provider), it has also created new and exciting avenues for research. The possibilities to bring practice and research closer are evident <b>in</b> the <b>research</b> activities indicated by post-secondary institutions for music teaching and learning in general, and particularly by universities, where one would expect to find most research activity.

A unit of work involving composition and improvisation activities with pupils aged 11 - 14 was videotaped for each teacher. Participants were invited to comment on the videotapes during interviews, which were subsequently analysed using content analysis {{with the assistance of the}} computer programme NVivo. Teachers were also asked to reflect on specific instances that had shaped the direction of their musical outlook by completing a Musical Career Path questionnaire. It was observed that their experiences fell into three strands, namely musical, teacher-education, and professional teaching. The influence of these strands on the teachers??? thinking is discussed in four sections that refer to a four-fold framework outlined from the literature review: their perceptions of (a) creative pupils, (b) an environment that fosters creativity, (c) the creative process, and (d) creative musical products. Data analyses indicate that the most influential strand is ???musical???. Participants with composing experience and practical knowledge of different music styles were more articulate at describing the environment for creativity and how this might be assessed in pupils??? work. Educational implications based on these findings are considered in the conclusion...|$|R

30|$|This notwithstanding, {{the modest}} amount of <b>research</b> into PP <b>in</b> <b>music</b> <b>education</b> {{completed}} {{so far has}} been promising. Research at the student level has studied the experience of flow during music practice and has also studied the effect of pre-performance PP interventions on performance. For example, Fritz and Avsec (2007) reported that when undergraduate music students experienced flow during their music practice, this was linked to increases in positive emotions and life satisfaction. Broomhead et al. (2012) tested the effect of a PP teaching technique on the expressive performance of 155 junior high singers. The PP intervention involved a pre-performance routine of breathing and silent repetition of the words “bold”, “confident”, and “free”. Students in the PP group outperformed their junior high school singing peers who did not use the PP technique. More specifically, the PP group was rated by judges in a blind rating as having exhibited significantly superior expressive performance, dynamics, performance factors, and timing.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reflects}} on the development process of two Live Coding languages, Blackwell’s Palimpsest and Aaron’s Sonic Pi, {{from the perspective of}} practice-led arts and craft research. Although informed by prior <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>education,</b> <b>music,</b> end-user programming and visual languages, these projects do not apply those principles through conventional software engineering processes or HCI techniques. As is often the case with practice-led research, the development process itself provides an opportunity for reflection on the nature of software as a craft – both for live-coding researchers, and for users of the live-coding systems that we create. In reflecting, we relate our own practice to recent perspectives on software as material, and on the role of craft as an element of interaction design research. The process that we have followed to support this analysis could be applied by other developers wishing to engage in similar reflection...|$|R
