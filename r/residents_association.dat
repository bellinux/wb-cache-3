Increasingly {{the difference between the}} canal and the river became less obvious, although it is still possible to identify remains of the original locks. The threat to the remains which the construction of the M3 motorway posed spurred the Winchester Tenants and <b>Residents</b> <b>Association</b> and the local branch of the Inland Waterways Association into action in 1975, with both suggesting that the waterway could be restored. The two groups later co-operated, and the Itchen Navigation Preservation Society was formed.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Government of Canada told the Harbor Commission {{that it was}} cutting its subsidy of the airport. In {{response}} to the subsidy cut {{and a decline in}} annual traffic, the Harbour Commission board faced with what it saw as only two options: expand or close the airport, chose to expand the airport. In November 1989, the Harbor Commission voted to build a temporary passenger terminal and allow access to four more airlines at the airport: Air Ontario, Simo Air, Intair and Canadian Partner. The Commission planned to increase flights by 120 per day and increase the number of passengers by 500,000. It would also impose a $1.50 per user fee on the carriers to fund the improvements and cover the operating deficit. Toronto City Council voted to approve the expansion, but wanted a 90-flight per day limit. Air Ontario's president William Deluce announced it would start 14 flights a day between the island, Montreal and Ottawa. While the expansion had the approval of the harbour commission and city council, it awoke opposition to the airport from the Toronto Island <b>Residents</b> <b>Association,</b> who felt that there would be too many flights, leading to noise and air pollution and it would contravene the 1983 operating agreement.|$|E
