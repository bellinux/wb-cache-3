40|$|Corruption in {{developing}} states reduces {{the effectiveness of}} foreign aid that is allo-cated to them, because government officials in corrupt countries use this money for private rather than public purposes. Despite this, existing studies do not find different aid policies from donor governments toward corrupt and less corrupt recipients. How-ever, most of these studies have not taken account of variation among donor states. This is an important omission, because donor states behave differently. This article argues that the responsiveness of donor states to corruption in <b>recipient</b> <b>states</b> depends on their own level of corruption: less corrupt donor states allocate more aid to less corrupt <b>recipient</b> <b>states</b> than to corrupt recipients, whereas corrupt donor states do not make such a clear distinction. This proposition is tested by both pooled ordinary least squares and fixed effects estimations. The data support the argument that corruption levels in donor states determine their reaction to corruption in <b>recipient</b> <b>states...</b>|$|R
40|$|As the {{influence}} of Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) is increasing in the world economy, the legal problems between the possessing <b>States</b> and <b>recipient</b> <b>States</b> become very important. The famous Santiago Principles are self-pledges of the governance and activities of SWFs by the possessing States and do not regulate the legal problems between the possessing <b>States</b> and the <b>recipient</b> <b>States.</b> This article considers the following relevant problems {{from the point of}} international law: (A) restrictions on foreign investment, (B) sovereign immunity, (C) taxation and (D) responsible investment. As to (A), although restrictions on foreign investment for national security reasons is generally permitted under international law, they should be guided by the principles of non-discrimination, transparency of policies and predictability of outcomes, proportionality of measures and accountability of implementing authorities. As to (B), when SWFs are involved in a civil action concerning holding shares in a company, they cannot enjoy jurisdictional immunity. This is because holding shares come under participation on companies in the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property. As to (C), there is no established rule of customary international law whether SWFs are granted exemption from taxation in <b>recipient</b> <b>States.</b> State practice is mixed. Some States including Japan do not categorically grant exemption from taxation to SWFs, but grant it to specific SWFs based on bilateral tax treaties. As to (D), Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global and New Zealand Superannuation Fund are faithful to the method of responsible investment. The heart of its responsible investment lies in the disinvetement and negative screening in particular. The disinvestment does not constitute unlawful intervention under international law. Finally, the balance of interests between the possessing <b>States</b> and the <b>recipient</b> <b>States</b> has to be kept in order to attain an equitable result. The concept of equity, although somewhat ambiguous, can {{play an important role in}} this field...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the question whether}} and in which cases {{it is possible to}} settle disputes arising from investment contracts concluded between a foreign investor and a <b>recipient</b> <b>State</b> through the dispute settlement procedure (typically, arbitration) provided in international investment agreements (IIAs) concluded between the investor's State of nationality and the <b>recipient</b> <b>State.</b> The issue of whether the arbitration based on IIAs can deal with disputes over investment contracts arises in cases in which the IIA contains an observance of commitments clause (Section I) or a general dispute settlement clause (Section II). Arbitral precedents are contradictory in each case {{to the point that it}} is not possible at the current stage to talk about a "jurisprudence constante" or a "common view. " In face of this rather confusing situation, this paper, going back to the basic principles of the treaty interpretation, advocates an interpretation faithful to the text and offers concrete suggestions with regard to the ways in which observance of commitments clauses and general dispute settlement clauses should be drafted. Even in cases in which either of these clauses is included, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that investment companies will waive their right to resort to arbitration based on IIAs. It is therefore necessary to clarify the circumstances under which such a waiver is deemed to have been made (Section III). ...|$|E

40|$|A core {{result of}} the aid {{allocation}} literature is {{that the quality of}} governance in recipient countries does not affect the amounts of foreign aid received. Donor countries may still give aid to poorly-governed countries because of a dilemma they face: those countries most in need typically also lack proper institutions. This paper argues that donors try to resolve this dilemma by delivering aid through non-state actors. Using aid shares as well as absolute amounts of aid allocated through different channels and considering different dimensions of governance, we provide evidence that bypassing governments via NGOs and multilateral organizations is indeed a response to weak <b>recipient</b> <b>state</b> institutions. The effect is stronger in aid sectors where donors can more easily switch between channels, and for the group of donors that have been dubbed 'like-minded' to indicate their specific focus on recipient need...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{resources}} {{trust funds}} have been employed {{in the developed world}} since the 1970 s in order to achieve a fair allocation of revenues and promote social growth. This model has been applied recently in developing economies, however lacking transparency and democratic oversight. As a result of increased public spending and depletion of the funds' assets, instead of economic growth, Dutch disease set in when oil prices fell. The World Bank-inspired Chad trust fund is the only of its kind with some external oversight and a contractual obligation by the <b>recipient</b> <b>state</b> to use the fund's earnings for social development. The idea is commendable, but implementation has been slack and if this model is to work in the future the Bank must condition similar loans to full external oversight, otherwise the whole operation will remain a farce...|$|E

In addition, the article substantiates the necessity to draw a clear-cut distinction between soft power sources and instruments and shows possible shortcomings that research can have should this distinction fail to be made. Finally, the paper discusses the impact of a competitor’s presence on a soft power strategy and specifies the terms under which disregarding this impact may engender a wrong conclusion...|$|E

30|$|That {{only the}} most {{productive}} firms see a gain to FDI rather than exporting shows that the transaction costs involved in setting up operations in another country are a real concern. Benfratello and Sembenelli (2006) found that technology transfers to foreign subsidiaries only take place when there are large technology differences between the foreign owner and the subsidiary, and not when the technology differences are smaller. This suggests—again—that there are important transactions costs involved, and that the gains from technology transfers have to be large {{in order to make}} it worthwhile to overcome the costs involved. Ford et al. (2008), comparing impacts of FDI on productivity in different US states, found that the level of human capital in the <b>recipient</b> <b>state</b> mattered for the productivity impact, again suggesting that conditions in the recipient area (other than those of the subsidiary firm receiving the investment) are crucial.|$|E
40|$|Global {{growth of}} nuclear energy in the 21 st century is {{creating}} new challenges to limit {{the spread of nuclear}} technology without hindering adoption in countries now considering nuclear power. Independent nuclear states desire autonomy over energy choices and seek energy independence. However, this independence comes with high costs for development of new indigenous fuel cycle capabilities. Nuclear supplier states and expert groups have proposed fuel supply assurance mechanisms such as fuel take-back services, international enrichment services and fuel banks in exchange for <b>recipient</b> <b>state</b> concessions on the development of sensitive technologies. Nuclear states are slow to accept any concessions to their rights under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. To date, decisions not to develop indigenous fuel cycle capabilities have been driven primarily by economics. However, additional incentives may be required to offset a nuclear state’s perceived loss of energy independence. This paper proposes alternative economic development incentives that could help countries decide to forgo development of sensitive nuclear technologies. The incentives are created through a nuclear-centered industrial complex with “symbiotic” links to indigenous economic opportunities. This paper also describes a practical tool called the “Nuclear Materials Exchange” for identifying these opportunities...|$|E
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the effect of}} US foreign policy on the internal security dynamics of aid recipient states. I draw upon the international security and contentious politics literatures to analyze how US foreign assistance affects the ability of recipient countries to employ violence against their citizens. I argue that {{as a consequence of}} fungibility—the diversion of aid for use as a general government resource—foreign aid may increase the likelihood of state violence through its effect on the state’s coercive capacity. I further hypothesize that the coercive effects of foreign aid are conditioned by the political institutions of the <b>recipient</b> <b>state</b> and its past history of conflict. I test this argument through multiple case studies and a time-series cross-national dataset of annual US bilateral foreign aid and various measures of state violence and repression for approximately 110 developing countries during the period of 1976 to 2008. This research links the study of political violence with the changing nature of international relations and provides considerable insight into international influences on intrastate conflict. Additionally, I provide an explanation for why failing states persist, despite the high levels of international assistance they receive, and further suggest that foreign aid undermines development by creatin...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, Western donors {{have been}} {{following}} a strategy of democracy promotion to Africa that involves giving assistance to both the state and the non-state actors including governments (as part of good governance program), parliaments, courts, political parties, civil society, electoral management bodies, election observation missions etc. The paper explores both the positive and the negative impacts of such assistance to African emerging democracies by using Ethiopia as a case study. The paper primarily deals with three sub-sectors of democracy promotion program: assistances to political parties, international election observation missions, and civil society. In this study, I argue that human rights and self interest (economic, political or both) shape the foreign aid policy of Western donors including democracy assistance. Moreover, the paper attempts to prove that democratic reversals or backsliding and human rights abuses in the <b>recipient</b> <b>states</b> can trigger aid reduction or termination only when the <b>recipient</b> <b>states</b> are neither economically nor strategically valuable to the Western donors...|$|R
