40|$|A fault {{detection}} model based on One-Class Support Vector Machine {{was established to}} solve the large difference in sample size between the normal data and fault data of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers.</b> During the model training process, only the normal samples were needed to be learned, and an accurate identification of abnormal was achieved, which may {{solve the problem of}} lack of fault samples in practice. By comparison experiments between different kernel functions and kernel parameter optimization, a {{fault detection}} model of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> based on One-Class Support Vector Machine was established, and the test results show that the model has a high recognition rate against abnormal of 97. 4 % and zero false alarm rate...|$|R
5000|$|Refrigerated cargo units - Container {{vessels are}} {{equipped}} with power source for specific places to plug in the <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> known as [...] "reefers", hence, the reefer containers places are known and are usually the first type of containers to consider in the stowage plan.|$|R
50|$|The {{workers were}} loading farm produce, {{primarily}} peaches and plums, from a walk-in cooler into a refrigerated truck. The produce was for export over the border.

50|$|Data loggers {{are often}} {{small enough to}} be placed inside an {{insulated}} shipping container or directly attached to a product inside a refrigerator truck or a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>container.</b> These monitor {{the temperature of the}} product being shipped. Some data loggers are placed {{on the outside of the}} package or in the truck or intermodal container to monitor the air temperature. Placement of data loggers and sensors is critical: Studies have shown that temperatures inside a truck or intermodal container are strongly affected by proximity to exterior walls and roof and to locations on the lading.|$|E
50|$|The Tsingtao Express is 335.47 m long, with {{a beam of}} 42.80 m, {{and drought}} of 14,610 m. This ship has a double bottom design giving it a {{capacity}} of 8749 TEU, 730 {{of which may be}} <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers.</b> It was completed and christened on April 26, 2007.|$|R

50|$|According to the CIA's The World Factbook, {{there were}} about 38,000 {{registered}} merchant ships {{in the world in}} 2010, of which about 920 were designed as refrigerated cargo ships. Because of the proliferation of self-contained <b>refrigerated</b> <b>container</b> systems on container ships, there are many more ships than those designed for only refrigerated cargo that are also carrying some refrigerated cargo. As of 2010, the countries with the largest numbers of reefer ships in their registries are the world's two most prominent flags of convenience: Panama with 212 and Liberia with 109.|$|E
50|$|The {{organisation}} {{was founded}} in 2001 by Nooralhaq Nasimi.

From 1999, he studied English at Lewisham College, before undertaking a programme at the South Bank University to study the English legal system. The organisation was formally established in 2001 in Lewisham {{with the help of}} local MPs and organisations. Nasimi was granted asylum in the UK in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Refrigerated</b> <b>container</b> {{ships are}} {{specifically}} designed to carry containerised unit loads where each container has its individual refrigerated unit. These containers are nearly always twenty-foot equivalent units (often called TEU) that are the size of [...] "standard" [...] cargo containers that are loaded and unloaded at container terminals and aboard container ships. These ships differ from conventional container ships in their design, power generation, and electrical distribution equipment. They need provisions made for powering each container's cooling system. Because of their ease of loading and unloading cargo many container ships are now being built or redesigned to carry refrigerated containers.|$|E
5000|$|Full size {{intermodal}} containers equipped with these [...] "cryogenic" [...] systems can maintain their temperature for the 30 days needed for sea transport. Since {{they do not}} require an external power supply, cryogenically <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> can be stored anywhere on any vessel that can accommodate [...] "dry" [...] (un-refrigerated) ocean freight containers.|$|R
25|$|Other {{than the}} standard, general purpose container, many {{variations}} exist {{for use with}} different cargoes. The most prominent of these are <b>refrigerated</b> <b>containers</b> (a.k.a. reefers) for perishable goods, that make up six percent of the world's shipping boxes. And tanks in a frame, for bulk liquids, account for another 0.75% of the global container fleet.|$|R
2500|$|The cargo {{consists}} {{mainly of}} intermodal <b>containers,</b> <b>refrigerated</b> shipping <b>containers,</b> {{as well as}} break bulk cargo.
