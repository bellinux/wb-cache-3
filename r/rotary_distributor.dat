50|$|Some later {{versions}} of the 2.9 L capacity unit use a Bosch VE-style <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> injection pump with electronic control and have a significantly different combustion chamber as they use direct injection.|$|E
50|$|Around the 1970s {{the primary}} breaker points were largely {{replaced}} with a Hall effect sensor or optical sensor. As this is a non-contacting device and the ignition coil is controlled by solid state electronics, {{a great amount of}} maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor shaft bearing life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 12B {{was a short}} lived {{engine that}} was {{produced}} for the Mazda RX-2, and the RX-3. It had increased reliability from previous series, and it introduced a single distributor. This {{was the beginning of}} the single <b>distributor</b> <b>rotary</b> engines, before that, the 12A and 10A were both twin distributor wankels.The improved 12B was quietly introduced in 1974.|$|R
50|$|For use on {{cars and}} light trucks, the <b>rotary</b> pump or <b>distributor</b> pump was developed. It uses a single {{injection}} cylinder driven from an axial cam plate, which injects into the individual fuel lines via a rotary distribution valve. Later incarnations {{such as the}} Bosch VE pump vary the injection timing with crankshaft speed to allow greater power at high crank speeds, and smoother, more economical running at slower revolution of crankshaft. Some VE variants have a pressure-based system that allows the injection volume to increase over normal to allow a turbocharger or supercharger equipped engine to develop more power under boost conditions.|$|R
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz OM604 is a 2.0 and 2.2 litre {{inline-four}} cylinder (R4/I4) double {{overhead camshaft}} (DOHC) diesel engine with indirect injection manufactured by Mercedes-Benz between 1993 and 1998. It replaced the single overhead camshaft (SOHC) OM601 engine.Unlike other Mercedes Benz diesels {{at the time that}} used a Bosch inline injection pump the OM604 used the Lucas electronically controlled <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> injection pump (EVE) which is less reliable.The seals of the Lucas injection pumps become brittle over time and leak. Since the replacement of the entire injection pump is very expensive, a repair kit is offered in which the affected seals are replaced.|$|E
50|$|The Endura-DE engine {{features}} a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which {{means there is}} a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a toothed belt driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the fuel injection pump is rotated by a second toothed belt driven from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is a <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> type most typically made by Lucas CAV.|$|E
50|$|The Endura-DI engine {{features}} a cast iron block and direct injection style cylinder head, {{which means the}} combustion chamber is {{in the top of}} the piston crown. This engine makes use of aluminium for many other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening 8 valves via shim-and-bucket followers, and the camshaft is driven by a toothed belt which is driven from a sprocket on the diesel injection pump; unusually this pump is driven via gemini (twin) chains from the crankshaft. The diesel injection pump is an electronically controlled <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> type most typically made by Bosch.|$|E
50|$|The Volvo FL6 {{is powered}} by Volvo’s D6B 180-250 hp, six-cylinder {{turbocharged}} intercooled diesel engine. The control system had a major update, with Volvo's TEA electronics architecture {{to bring it to}} line with the rest of its bigger cousins. Inline fuel injection pump was replaced with the EDC <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> pump from Bosch with the identical horsepower; despite the loss of supercharger from the previous D6A engine. The cruise control, automatic exhaust brake and accelerator now became the so-called fly by wire as standard. Full integration {{with the rest of the}} vehicle system such as Electronic Suspension Control and ABS made it much more efficient and user friendly.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or electric fuel lift pump feeds a Stanadyne <b>Rotary</b> <b>Distributor</b> Injection pump at low pressure. The distributor injection pump controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series injection pumps on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of injection pumps in their light trucks. A mechanical DB4 series injection pump can be found on some 6.5L marine engines.|$|E
5000|$|To {{test his}} theory, Joseph, {{with the help}} of his oldest son, B.C. Oppenheim, knocked the end out of a cigar box and built a small rotary paddle {{distributor}} into that open end. Each of the paddles on the <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> was set at a different angle. Then, Joseph and his son filled the cigar box with chaff and operated the small distributor with power from the drive wheel of a sewing machine. The test was successful. The chaff was thrown in a wide pattern. After several other tests, Oppenheim became convinced that he had an idea that could be designed into manure unloaders. [...] When Kramer’s machine shop was destroyed by fire and his business failed, Oppenheim obtained Kramer’s patent in exchange for forgiving a loan he had made to Kramer and then obtained a patent for his own new idea. [...] Thus the widespread modern manure spreader was born.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain an {{adequate}} mathematical model of vehicle hydro-mechanical steering which is   equipped with a steering mechanism combined with power steering and a <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b>   it is initially     necessary to get current consumption values in the units of hydraulic scheme which are determined by dynamic changes of flow passages of pressure and drain circuits according to turning angle of the distributor. Such characteristics are usually determined experimentally. The paper   proposes   a sequence which is recommended for determination of consumption characteristics which is formed with due account of multi-directional k inematic perturbations, mechanical clearance, possible emergence of hydraulic backlash and desired throttling law. The factors account {{makes it possible to}} obtain an acceptable mathematical analogue of a hydro-mechanical steering for execution of robust investigations.   </p...|$|E
40|$|The present article {{refers to}} the {{implementation}} of a new technology of rotary vane vacuums pumps in a filling machine of beer. The reason why the vacuum is applied to the bottle is to remove the oxygen in its interior and thereby sustain the allowed values of TPO Total Packing Oxygen, preventing oxidation of the product and lose their organoleptic characteristics. This is a process that until now was performed with liquid ring vacuum pumps using water as a liquid sealant and that after 10 years of continuous work have lost their capacity to generate the vacuum required by the system and must be replaced necessarily. Presenting two alternatives, maintaining the same technology for the vacuum pumps, or change to rotary vane vacuum pumps. I first analyzed the performance curves of existing vacuum pumps for comparison with the rotary vane and certify that can generate the same levels of vacuum and then compared in a matrix of all parameters involved decision to finally decide for the rotary vane vacuum pumps and proceed with the selection of power, tank and other accessories needed to completed the system. The result is a new technology of a <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> pumps to generate the required vacuum with less power and also avoids the waste of water as a measure of commitment to the environment...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{systems are}} often {{subjected}} to pressure drops, which {{may lead to}} cavitation. In systems such as power steering, hoist loads, or ventricular assist devices, distributors are generally used. Significant pressure losses can happen in a distributor due to gap and overlap, which may lead to cavitation development. However, this issue is almost never included in the conception of the distributors. In this study, the multibubble model of the modified Rayleigh–Plesset equation {{is applied to the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> of an oil hydraulic system. The influence of the overlap length, the gap, the rotation speed, and distributor inlet pressure on the cavitation and particularly the interactions between bubbles at cavitation inception are studied. The study highlights a critical length of the overlap; over this value, the overlap length influences significantly the cavitation duration and the void fraction. More generally, some geometrical details have a strong influence on cavitation. Optimization of these details in engine parts, taking account the occurrence of cavitation, would be an appropriate solution to reduce its effects. The study also demonstrates that the growth of small bubbles may be delayed by the interactions with the nearby bigger ones, even if the ambient pressure is lower than their theoretical critical pressure. They eventually collapse at the first moments of the cavitation development. However, if the ambient pressure drops further, that is, beyond a critical pressure, a small bubble gains enough inertial energy to overcome these interaction phenomena and thus to grow. The growth of small bubbles increases the interactions between bubbles and slows down the growth of nearby bigger ones. The results show that the interactions between bubbles are of primary importance in the first moments of the cavitation development, which suggests that they should be taken into account in the definition of the critical pressure...|$|E
