5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from May through July, during the cold, <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> {{resulting}} in birth and peak lactation {{coinciding with the}} time that fruit is the most plentiful. The gestation period of ruffed lemurs is the shortest of the family Lemuridae, averaging 102 days (with a range of 90 to 106 days). Gestation in the wild last slightly longer than in captivity, averaging 106 days. Just like the mating season, parturition is also seasonal, synchronized {{to the end of}} the cold, dry season and the start of the productive hot, <b>rainy</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E

5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape during the <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms}} of soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow during high tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E

5|$|Each year, some East African {{populations of}} blue {{wildebeest}} have a long-distance migration, seemingly timed {{to coincide with}} the annual pattern of rainfall and grass growth. The timing of their migrations in both the rainy and dry seasons can vary considerably (by months) from year to year. At the end of the wet season (May or June in East Africa), wildebeest migrate to dry-season areas in response to a lack of surface (drinking) water. When the <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> begins again (months later), animals quickly move back to their wet-season ranges. Factors suspected to affect migration include food abundance, surface water availability, predators, and phosphorus content in grasses. Phosphorus is a crucial element for all life forms, particularly for lactating female bovids. As a result, during the <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> wildebeest select grazing areas that contain particularly high phosphorus levels. One study found, in addition to phosphorus, wildebeest select ranges containing grass with relatively high nitrogen content.|$|E
5|$|Monsoon or <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> lasting from July to September.

Oribi {{have been observed}} feeding on flowers and Boletus mushrooms. Groups of oribi congregate in the <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> when grasses are abundant.|$|E
5|$|The Garden of Words is {{considered}} a romance and drama film. It opens {{at the start of}} the <b>rainy</b> <b>season</b> in Tokyo with , a 15-year-old student and aspiring shoemaker, opting to skip his first class and sketch shoe designs in the garden at Shinjuku Gyoen. There he encounters , a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work and enjoying beer and chocolate. When she notices the school crest on his uniform, Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. After Yukari expresses an interest in Takao's shoemaking, he decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> Takao stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific coast {{features}} a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers {{because of the}} southeast seasonal wind.

40|$|The {{effects of}} palm bunch ash (PBA) and mineral {{fertilizer}} application on grain yield and nutrient uptake in maize and soil chemical properties were studied {{in both the}} major and minor <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> in the semi-deciduous forest agro-ecological zone of Ghana. In both the major and minor <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> the response of maize to four levels (0, 2, 4, and 6 tons per hectare) of palm bunch ash and 200 kg per hectare of NPK (15 - 15 - 15) application was evaluated using randomised complete block design. Results of the study showed that application of palm bunch ash significantly (P< 0. 05) increased soil pH, soil phosphorus, and exchangeable cations. Maize grain yield varied significantly (P< 0. 05) among the different treatments in both the major and minor <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons.</b> The highest maize grain yield of 4530 and 6120 [*]kg[*]ha- 1 was obtained at PBA application rate of 2 tons ha- 1 for the major and minor <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons,</b> respectively...|$|R
50|$|Blunthead tree snakes are polygynandrous reptiles. Mating seasons {{can vary}} {{depending}} on the <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of their habitat. Some snakes mate year round while some snakes’ mating season may be synced with the wet and <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> of their environment. For example, in areas with long <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> these snakes tend to show a much longer mating season compared to snakes in areas with shorter <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons.</b> These snakes are oviparous or egg-laying animals that have little or no embryonic development within the mother. Some Blunthead tree snakes exhibit continuous reproduction depending on the environment that they live in. However, in an area that has seasonal rainfall, egg laying and hatching positively correlates with the <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons.</b> In Guatemala and Mexico for example, female snake lay their eggs between June and July. These eggs will hatch around July and August, which are the typically <b>rainy</b> <b>seasons</b> in these countries. On the other hand, snakes in Brazil exhibit continuous reproduction. The eggs are laid anywhere from November to January and start to hatch around March throughout August. Both male and female blunthead tree snake reach sexual maturity about 2 years after hatching or at around 620mm SVL (Snout-Vent Length). The female snake can have anywhere from one to three eggs, typically called a clutch, per breeding season {{depending on the size of}} the snake, its food habits, and environmental factors. Because these snakes are oviparous the female will leave her eggs after laying them. These animals do not present parental care traits.|$|R

5|$|The dam {{discharges}} its reservoir {{during the}} dry season between December and March every year. This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage. It also improves shipping conditions.

5|$|There is {{very limited}} data on reproduction. Young are {{probably}} born near {{the start of the}} <b>rainy</b> <b>season,</b> in November–December, when food is plentiful. Six bats were caught at the roost site in Kianjavato, of which only one was a male; this led Bates and colleagues to suggest that the species may be polygynous, with groups consisting of a male and multiple females.|$|E
