I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did <b>realize,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E

He finally reroutes a circus into the Griffins' backyard, saving the day - that is, until he reveals to Lois that he gave Meg permission to go to a party at her friend's house. Lois, who wanted the whole family together for Stewie's party, is upset with Peter for letting Meg go. What Peter and Lois don't <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Meg's [...] "party" [...] is actually a cult meeting where all the members are about to commit group suicide.|$|E
500|$|Clark's adoptive father. Snyder {{explained}} his {{reason for his}} casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: [...] "I think the thing you realize {{when you look at}} Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of {{get a sense of how}} tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at." ...|$|E

She is terrified. Scared that if she lets her emotions out, they will overtake her and she will be hurt. And you can’t hate her. Because it's so incredibly human and understandable." [...] Yang's friendship with Meredith has been looked upon as [...] "sisterhood", and Yang has repeatedly referred to the former as [...] "her person". This led to the two being dubbed [...] "the twisted sisters". At the conclusion of season three, the duo went on a [...] "honeymoon" [...] together, and Rhimes called it her favorite detail of the finale.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I {{can tell you is that}} the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|From the {{beginning}} of spring training, Heyward endured lingering shoulder soreness. [...] After collecting just four hits in 41 at bats in May, the Braves performed a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan on May 12 which revealed an inflamed rotator cuff but no structural damage. [...] He rested and received a cortisone injection, but aggravated the injury days later during batting practice. [...] The Braves placed him {{on the disabled list}} (DL) on May 22. [...] Public criticism from teammate Chipper Jones for not playing through his injuries followed the next month. [...] Said Jones, [...] "I think where Jason might have erred was the comment that he made, 'I'm not coming back until it doesn't hurt anymore.' ... What Jason needs to <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Jason at 80 percent is a force, and Jason at 80 percent is better than {{a lot of people in}} this league." [...] Jones later explained that he reassured Heyward in a phone call that he did not intend to misrepresent Heyward's efforts to rehabilitate.|$|E

"The {{fact was}} earnest," [...] our friend maintained, [...] "but {{the spirit in}} which it <b>was</b> <b>realized</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of a brotherly persuasion that I would see the affair in its true light, as a joke <b>that</b> <b>was</b> on me.

500|$|Tammareddy Bharadwaja said [...] "Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera {{did well}} at the box office, {{the rest of the}} {{industry}} started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film. But what they don't <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe." [...] Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior. The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera. Producer Natti Kumar said [...] "If a hero delivers a hit, producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops. It's the same story with movies. Since Magadheera became a hit, every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores. They don't work on the script, story or relevance. It is a pure display of graphics, heroes' abs and grandeur. The plot is lost. Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then, but why will people want to see the same things again?".|$|E
2500|$|Horkheimer {{opposed it}} to {{traditional}} theory, {{which refers to}} theory in the positivistic, scientistic, or purely observational mode—that is, which derives generalizations or [...] "laws" [...] about {{different aspects of the}} world. Drawing upon Max Weber, Horkheimer argued that the social sciences differ from the natural sciences inasmuch as generalizations cannot be easily made from so-called experiences because the understanding of a [...] "social" [...] experience itself is always fashioned by ideas that are in the researchers themselves. What the researcher does not <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> s/he is caught in a historical context in which ideologies shape the thinking; thus, theory would conform to the ideas {{in the mind of the}} researcher rather than to the experience itself: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2015, {{after the}} {{disbanding}} of Mars Hill, an executive elder {{of the church}} stated that [...] "There has been much talk about the abusive and coercive culture at Mars Hill. What many people do not <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{some of the very}} people who were calling for an end to this type of abuse were using abusive tactics." [...] The executive elder stated that he was blackmailed by a staff who asked for more severance pay. He also stated that [...] "former Mars Hill elders were working to file formal charges against me also.

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many {{technical}} jobs were seen as nerdy. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as laid-back and diverse amongst sex, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, webcasting, blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative and relaxed. [...] What many don't <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don't have steady jobs. Work in this field has become project-based. Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem as a carefree life from the outside, but it is not. [...] New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first thing}} to <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the pawn {{may be able to}} queen unassisted by his king, simply by {{advancing}} to the queening square before the opposing king can capture or block the pawn. The rule of the square is useful in determining whether the pawn can queen unassisted, or whether the king can stop the pawn. In this position, the pawn is on the fifth square from the queening square (counting the queening square itself). [...] A square of five by five squares with the queening square in one corner and the pawn in an adjacent corner can be imagined. (Often, the easiest method of constructing the square is to draw a diagonal mentally from the pawn to the last rank; this is the diagonal of the square). [...] If the black king can move into this square, he can stop the pawn, otherwise the pawn wins the race. In this position, if it is Black's move, he can move to b4 and enter the square, therefore he can stop the pawn. If it is White's move, the pawn advances, the square shrinks to four by four, and the king cannot move into the square, so the pawn queens [...] See [...] for further discussion on the rule of the square.|$|E
2500|$|Albini's lyrics drew {{criticism}} for apparent racism and homophobia. Racism {{was a frequent}} theme in Big Black songs, influenced partly by the sharp racial divisions present in Chicago at the time. The word [...] "darkie" [...] appeared in {{the first line of}} the Lungs EP, but Albini defended its use as a comical term, saying [...] "in a way that's a play on the concept of a hateful word. Can a word that's so inherently hilarious be hateful? I don't know." [...] He similarly defended his use of gay jokes and the word [...] "fag": [...] "Given how intermingled the gay and punk subcultures were, it was assumed by anyone involved that open-mindedness, if not free-form experimentation, was the norm. With that assumption under your belt, joke all you like. The word 'fag' isn't just a gay term, it's funny on its own — phonetically — like the words 'hockey puck,' 'mukluks,' 'gefilte fish,' and 'Canada. Some critics viewed these defenses as mere justifications for actual deep-seated racism, homophobia, and misogyny on Albini's part, given his level of familiarity with the subject matter, but he insisted that he was not a prejudiced person and was merely satirizing those impulses that rational, civilized persons normally suppress in the course of social interaction: [...] "So once that's given, once you know what you think, there's no reason to be ginger about what you say. A lot of people, they're very careful not to say things that might offend certain people or do anything that might be misinterpreted. But what they don't <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the point of all this is to change the way you live your life, not the way you speak." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bascom, {{commander}} of Company C, 7th Infantry, knew {{from experience that}} only Chiricahua would go east.

60|$|I had {{not been}} at Sanstead House two days before doubts began to creep in on this point. What the boy, observing the assistant-master {{standing}} about in apparently magnificent idleness, does not <b>realize</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the unfortunate is really putting in a spell of exceedingly hard work. He is 'taking duty'. And 'taking duty' is a thing to be remembered, especially by a man who, like myself, has lived a life of fatted ease, protected from all the minor annoyances of life by a substantial income.|$|E
