A new magazine was constructed, comprising a large, brick-built building divided into three <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> storing gunpowder, specially designed to keep the powder dry. The exterior gun emplacements were also redesigned, reusing the 1806 foundations; the two surviving emplacements, in the north-east and north-west bastions, date from 1859.|$|E

5|$|Building {{began in}} 1909, using oak from the estate, {{metalwork}} from local blacksmiths, and stone quarried locally, {{brought to the}} site by a private railway line. Barnsley insisted that no machines would be used, so instead of using a saw powered by steam engine, the wood was hand-sawn in a saw pit. The east wing was completed by 1915, and the Biddulphs moved into them, with the reception rooms finished around the same time. Despite {{the grandeur of the}} building, the Biddulph's lived in some small rooms and fitted the large reception <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> community use. Biddulph also built some cottages {{at the site of the}} old manor house at Rodmarton around the same time.|$|E

5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only <b>rooms.</b> <b>For</b> sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's.

40|$|Labour {{influences}} the liveability of organic sheep farms and {{the sustainability of}} this activity on rural areas. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse work flexibility of organic suckler sheep farms using the criterion 'room for manoeuvre in time'. A survey about work organisation was conducted on 14 organic sheep farms in the central region of France to quantify work durations and tasks carried out by different categories of workers in order to calculate the <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre in time. Statistical analysis was performed to analyse variability in <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre. A cluster analysis conducted on four variables describing <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre in time over the year classified the farms into three groups. The results show that the <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre in time per person displayed a broad variability according to the farms (396 to 1, 199 h per year). The amount of routine work per person of the basic group was one factor explaining the differences. Results show different ways to obtain <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre in time and its temporal distribution over the year, among organic suckler sheep farms. Three repartitions were identified. Group 1 was characterised by a low <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre in winter, corresponding to the period of lambing in the sheep barn. The high routine workload was carried out self-sufficiently by the basic group. Group 2 had a high <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre over the year. The farmers delegated a part of the routine work during holidays. Group 3 had a low <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre over the year. These farms had lambings throughout the year due to several different lambing periods. Their low <b>room</b> <b>for</b> manoeuvre was also explained by a farmer's dual jobholding or by diversification of farm activities (slaughter, direct sales). The paper concludes identifying potential labour solutions to increase the flexibility of work organisation such as simplification of flock management or delegation...|$|R
5|$|On 21 May 1887, two new {{buildings}} were completed {{at the hospital}} and the Prince and Princess of Wales came to open them officially. Princess Alexandra wished to meet the Elephant Man, so after a tour of the hospital, the royal party went to his <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> an introduction. The princess shook Merrick's hand and sat with him, an experience that left him overjoyed. She gave him a signed photograph of herself, which became a prized possession, and she sent him a Christmas card each year.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1940, {{during the}} Blitz bombing {{campaign}} against Britain, {{it was decided}} to increase the protection of the Cabinet War Rooms by the installation of a massive layer of concrete known as 'the Slab'. Up to 5 feet (1.5 metres) thick, the Slab was progressively extended and by spring 1941 the increased protection had enabled the Cabinet War Rooms to expand to three times their original size. While the usage of many of the War Rooms' individual rooms changed {{over the course of the}} war, the facility included dormitories for staff, private bedrooms for military officers and senior ministers, and <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> typists or telephone switchboard operators.|$|E

The gallery, which overflows into the royal apartments, contains works by Raphael, Titian, Perugino (Lamentation over the Dead Christ), Correggio, Peter Paul Rubens, and Pietro da Cortona. The character of the gallery is still that of a private collection, and the works of art are displayed and hung much {{as they would have}} been in the grand <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> which they were intended rather than following a chronological sequence, or arranged according to school of art.|$|E
