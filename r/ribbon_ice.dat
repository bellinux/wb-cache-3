50|$|On May 28, 2010, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> {{announced}} a new project called 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling (Jūkyū-ji Joshi Puroresu), an internet streaming channel on Ustream. The show airs Fridays at 19:00 Japan time (10:00 UTC). The original concept of the show saw <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> rookie Sayaka Obihiro being assigned full-time to the project and facing <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> wrestlers in weekly matches. The concept was abandoned on August 26, 2011, when the project was officially brought under the <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> banner, with Obihiro again becoming a regular member of the <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> roster and the 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling turning into a regular professional wrestling program with no distinct concept.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2012, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with Japanese pop group hy4_4yh (Hyper Yo-yo). The partnership led to the group making musical appearances at <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> events, performing Maki Narumiya's new entrance theme and, on March 7, the two promoting the first [...] "Hyper Ribbon" [...] event, which featured both matches and musical performances. On December 12, 2012, Neoplus officially announced the creation of Corazon Joshi Puroresu, Ice Ribbon's sister promotion, which has a more theatrical take on professional wrestling. Following Sayaka Obihiro's December 2012 departure from <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon,</b> the promotion put 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling on hiatus as it considered {{the future of the}} program. On January 4, 2014, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> was dealt another blow, when Hikaru Shida announced she was also leaving the promotion the following March. On January 22, longtime freelancer Mio Shirai signed a contract with <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon.</b> Following her September 2015 retirement, she became a referee and trainer for <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon.</b> On January 3, 2016, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> original Aoi Kizuki announced her departure from the promotion.|$|R
50|$|From its inception, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> {{had a close}} {{relationship}} with NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling, which saw <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> workers Emi Sakura, Aoi Kizuki and Makoto make regular appearances for the promotion, while NEO wrestlers like Etsuko Mita, Tanny Mouse and Yoshiko Tamura also made several appearances for <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon.</b> The relationship lasted until NEO folded on December 31, 2010, with Emi Sakura, Hikaru Shida, Makoto and Tsukasa Fujimoto appearing at the promotion's final event. Starting in late 2010, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> was involved in a year-long interpromotional storyline rivalry with the Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion, which saw <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> and Sendai Girls' wrestlers make regular appearances for the opposing promotion. Through its relationships with American promotion Chikara and the British Pro-Wrestling: EVE, Ice Ribbon's wrestlers have also made appearances in the United States and the United Kingdom. Currently, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> has {{close relationship}}s with the DDT Pro-Wrestling (DDT), Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW), JWP Joshi Puroresu, Pro Wrestling Wave and Reina Joshi Puroresu promotions.|$|R
5000|$|On December 14, 2011, Ice Ribbon's founder Emi Sakura {{announced}} that she was leaving the promotion for [...] "personal reasons" [...] following the January 7, 2012, event in Sendai. Following Sakura's departure, Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto took over the training duties at the <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> dojo. The initial training program, from which one can graduate to become an official <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> trainee, is currently run by <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> wrestler 235. During 2012, Ray, Sayaka Obihiro, and <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> originals Hikari Minami and Riho also left <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon,</b> while Dorami Nagano went inactive to concentrate on her studies. To combat {{the decreasing number of}} wrestlers on its active roster, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> introduced the first six wrestlers trained by Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto: Eri Wakamatsu, Fumiko Sato, Risa Okuda, Rutsuko Yamaguchi, Oshima Kujira and Shoko Hotta. Wakamatsu and Hotta, along with Ayano Takeda and Hiroko Terada, two other Shida and Fujimoto trainees who debuted before the end of 2012, all had quit their professional wrestling careers by April 2013. Risa Sera (renamed from Risa Okuda) is still active.|$|R

5000|$|On January 4, at the <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> show in Shin-Kiba 1st Ring, Matsumoto {{teamed up}} with <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> wrestler Hamuko Hoshi to face Nanae Takahashi and Mai Ichii for the {{recently}} vacated International Ribbon Tag Titles. Matsumoto and Hoshi were successful in winning the tag titles.|$|R
5000|$|Before leaving <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon,</b> Toyota {{suggested}} that Tsukushi should {{form a new}} tag team with Tsukasa Fujimoto; the two followed the suggestion and dubbed their new team [...] "Dropkickers". On October 15, Dropkickers wrestled Chisako and Sachiko to a twenty-minute time limit draw; as a result, the title was once again declared vacant. The following day, Tsukushi defeated Riho to earn the right to represent <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> at Sendai Girls' Joshi Puroresu Dantai Taikou Flash tournament, a single-elimination tournament, where different joshi promotions battled each other. On October 27, Team <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> (Tsukushi, Emi Sakura, Hikari Minami, Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto) was eliminated from the tournament {{in the first round}} by Team Sendai Girls' (Meiko Satomura, Dash Chisako, Kagetsu, Miyako Morino and Sendai Sachiko), when Tsukushi was pinned by Chisako. On December 2, Tsukushi defeated Kurumi to regain the IW19 Championship. The rivalry between <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> and Sendai Girls' culminated on December 25 at RibbonMania 2011, where Tsukushi and Emi Sakura faced Meiko Satomura and Sendai Sachiko in a match for the vacant International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. Tsukushi won the match for her team and <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> by pinning Sachiko, thus winning the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship for the first time. However, as Sakura had announced just prior to the match that she would be leaving <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> the following month, her and Tsukushi's reign lasted only three days before they lost the title to Hikaru Shida and Maki Narumiya. On January 7, 2012, Tsukushi defeated Sakura in her <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> farewell match.|$|R
5000|$|Ray {{made her}} debut for her trainer Emi Sakura's <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> {{promotion}} on June 1, 2008, when she teamed with Mai Ichii to defeat Sakura and Kazumi Shimouma in the tag team main event. Her next <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> appearance {{took place on}} February 23, 2011, when she began wrestling regularly for the promotion. Ray quickly began feuding with <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> Triple Crown Champion Tsukasa Fujimoto, pinning her in a tag team match on February 26, only Ray's second match back in the promotion. After unsuccessfully challenging Fujimoto for the ICE×60 Championship on March 21, Ray teamed with Emi Sakura five days later to defeat Fujimoto and Hikaru Shida for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. After the match, Ray officially named <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> her new home promotion, ending her freelancing days. During the next two months, Ray and Sakura went on to successfully defend the title four times; against Hikari Minami and Yoneyamakao Lee on April 9, Riho and Tsukushi on April 16, Hikaru Shida and Syuri on May 5 and Makoto Oishi and Neko Nitta on May 18. On June 1, Ray and Sakura lost the title to the Lovely Butchers (Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi). Afterwards, Ray began feuding with Chii Tomiya, which lasted until Tomiya left <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> in late August. In January 2012, Ray formed the tag team Mascara Voladoras (Spanish for the [...] "Masked Female Flyers") with fellow masked wrestler, JWP representative Leon. They would wrestle together not only in <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon,</b> but also JWP and Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling. After not appearing for <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> for three months, Ray returned to the promotion on May 5 at Golden Ribbon 2012, teaming with Marines Mask II in the Go! Go! Golden Mixed Tag Tournament, from which they were eliminated {{in the first round}} by the team of Dynasty and Hikari Minami. On May 14, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> announced that Ray had quit the promotion to once again become a freelancer.|$|R

50|$|Originally, 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling {{was kept}} {{separate}} from <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon,</b> but on August 26, 2011, {{the program was}} brought under the <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> banner and the IW19 Championship recognized as an <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> championship. With the move, the title underwent some changes, including an addition of a nineteen-year age limit and a three-year experience limit and the abolishment of a rule, where a champion must defend the title at least once every four weeks. However, in January 2012, the age and experience limits were seemingly abandoned, when Hamuko Hoshi, 29 years old, Lady Afrodita, 21 years old, Maki Narumiya, 25 years old, Sayaka Obihiro, 25 years old, Tomoki Yagami, 29 years old, and Tsukasa Fujimoto, 28 years old, all entered a number one contender's tournament. During the next ten months, the IW19 Championship was defended once every ten weeks against the winner of an eight-woman single-elimination tournament. On January 7, 2013, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> officially put 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling on hiatus as it considered {{the future of the}} program, following the departure of its original operator, Sayaka Obihiro. On May 18, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> announced a 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling event for June 22, which would see the first defense of the IW19 Championship in six months. This episode would air through Niconico as opposed to Ustream. At the end of the June 22 broadcast, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> officially announced the ending of the 19 O'Clock Girls ProWrestling program, although the promotion looked to hold future events on Niconico. As a result, the IW19 Championship was retired on July 14, 2013, when IW19 Champion Tsukasa Fujimoto defeated ICE×60 Champion Tsukushi in a championship unification match.|$|R

Other than that, collaborating with a TV program called [...] "Muscle Venus" [...] and a film in 2009 called [...] "Three Count" [...] <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> recruited and trained some actresses as wrestlers. Among them, Hikaru Shida, Miyako Matsumoto, and Tsukasa Fujimoto are still active as wrestlers too. <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> has gained some attention for training and debuting underage children as wrestlers. For example, Riho and Kurumi made their debuts {{at the age of}} nine, while Hikari Minami and Tsukushi were eleven and twelve, respectively, when they made their debuts.|$|R

5000|$|Former {{dancer and}} alum of Ochanomizu University, Narumiya began {{training}} {{for a career in}} professional wrestling under Emi Sakura, who gave her the ring name [...] "Narumiya" [...] after the Chronicles of Narnia films. She made her debut on March 19, 2011, working for Sakura's <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> promotion, losing to Mochi Miyagi. Just two days later Narumiya wrestled at her first major <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> event, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> March 2011, where she, Riho and Tamako faced Hikari Minami, Kurumi and Tsukushi in a six-woman elimination tag team match. Narumiya was eliminated from the match by Minami, after which her team was defeated, when Tsukushi pinned Riho. On April 20, Narumiya picked up her first win on April 20, defeating Miyako Matsumoto. Narumiya then teamed with Matsumoto at her second major event, Golden Ribbon 2011 on May 5, where the two defeated Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi, with Narumiya pinning Hoshi for the win. Narumiya's following months consisted mainly of losses, with her picking up her only wins against fellow newcomer Dorami Nagano. During June, Narumiya formed the N3 stable with Meari Naito and Neko Nitta, who debuted around the same time as her. N3 wrestled several matches together during the summer, but lost all of them, including three-on-one handicap matches against Hikaru Shida on June 8 and Tsukasa Fujimoto on June 15.|$|R

5000|$|In February 2011, Sakura {{formed a}} tag {{team with the}} debuting Ray, her first ever trainee from the Gatokunyan dojo. On March 19, Sakura and Ray {{defeated}} Muscle Venus in a non-title match to earn a match for the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship on March 26, where they became the new champions. On April 10, Sakura attempted to become a double champion, but her match for the IW19 Championship with Tsukushi ended in a nineteen-minute time limit draw. On June 1, Sakura and Ray lost the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship to the Lovely Butchers (Hamuko Hoshi and Mochi Miyagi) in their fifth defense. Sakura regained the title from the Lovely Butchers on August 13, teaming with Makoto, who had just announced that she was leaving <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> to join the Smash promotion on a full-time basis. After the two had successfully defended the title against Hikari Minami and Riho on August 17, Sakura defeated Makoto in her <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> farewell match on August 21, after which the International Ribbon Tag Team Championship was vacated.

On October 27, Sakura led Team <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> to Sendai Girls' Joshi Puroresu Dantai Taikou Flash tournament, a single-elimination tournament, where different joshi promotions battled each other. <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon,</b> represented by Sakura, Hikari Minami, Hikaru Shida, Tsukasa Fujimoto and Tsukushi, was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by their rival, Team Sendai, represented by Meiko Satomura, Dash Chisako, Kagetsu, Miyako Morino and Sendai Sachiko. On December 14, Sakura surprisingly announced that she was leaving <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> for [...] "personal reasons" [...] following the January 7, 2012, event in Sendai. The storyline rivalry between <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> and Sendai Girls' ended on December 25 at RibbonMania 2011, where Sakura and Tsukushi defeated Meiko Satomura and Sendai Sachiko to win the vacant International Ribbon Tag Team Championship. However, Sakura's and Tsukushi's reign would last only three days, before they lost the title to Hikaru Shida and Maki Narumiya. On January 7, 2012, Sakura was defeated by Tsukushi in her <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> farewell match.|$|R

From the start, <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon</b> had a close relationship with the NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling promotion, which led to Sakura and some of her trainees making semi-regular appearances with the promotion. In storyline, the partnership was explained with a relationship between Sakura and NEO president Tetsuya Koda. On February 18, 2007, the Sakura Ribbon Army, a team of Sakura and some of her trainees and friends, defeated the NEO Machineguns Army in a seven-on-seven battle royal, earning Sakura and Koda the right to marry each other and unify NEO and <b>Ice</b> <b>Ribbon.</b> However, after pleading from her trainees, Sakura turned on Koda and abandoned him at the altar, ending the storyline.
