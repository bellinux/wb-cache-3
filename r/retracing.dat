5|$|The {{irregular}} Nefyn Coaches service 8b has {{an early}} morning weekday Nefyn–Tudweiliog–Llangwnnadl–Penygroeslon–Rhydlios bus, which operates only during school holidays. On Wednesdays throughout the year, a return journey runs the Rhydlios–Porth Or–Uwchmynydd–Aberdaron–Penycaerau–Y Rhiw–Botwnnog–Mynytho–Llanbedrog–Pwllheli route. On other weekdays a Nefyn–Tudweiliog–Llangwnnadl–Penygroeslon–Aberdaron–Uwchmynydd bus runs. On Wednesdays during school terms, an afternoon journey runs on the Y Rhiw–Botwnnog–Mynytho–Llanbedgrog–Pwllheli route. At weekends, a Saturday morning bus operates Nefyn–Dinas–Rhos-ddu–Brynmawr–Sarn Meyllteyrn–Pant–Uwchmynydd.

5|$|Paterson's worms are {{an attempt}} to {{simulate}} the behaviour of prehistoric worms. These creatures fed upon sediment {{at the bottom of}} ponds and avoided <b>retracing</b> paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but, because food occurred in patches, it was in the worm's interest to stay near previous trails. Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding how close to travelled paths to stay, when to turn, and how sharp a turn to make. In 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails, and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple set of rules to study idealized worms on regular grids.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To read {{efficiently}} with {{a simple}} hand or stand magnifier, people with visual impairment have to move (navigate) the device along each line (forward phase) {{and back to the}} correct position {{at the start of the}} next line (<b>retrace</b> phase). Page navigation difficulties have been implicated as limiting factors when reading with hand and stand magnifiers, but have not been objectively measured. METHODS: Magnifier movements were recorded using a 3 SPACE Isotrak system for 43 participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who read two short stories using their habitual hand or stand magnifier. Page navigation was quantified in terms of magnifier movements and navigation errors for the forward and <b>retrace</b> phases. Visual acuities and visual fields were measured, and magnifier usage and page navigation difficulties were surveyed. RESULTS: During the forward phase, participants primarily used either a straight (47 %) or diagonal downward (46 %) movement, whereas during the <b>retrace</b> phase, the majority (56 %) used a downward movement. On average, forward navigation time was four times longer than <b>retrace</b> navigation time (p< 0. 001). The most common navigation error was incorrect positioning of the magnifier at the end of the <b>retrace</b> movement. Near word acuity correlated strongly with forward time (r= 0. 78), and moderately with <b>retrace</b> time (r= 0. 53) and forward errors (r= 0. 50). Vertical field of view correlated with <b>retrace</b> errors (r=- 0. 53). Participants' estimates of page navigation difficulties were not predictive of objective measures of performance. CONCLUSIONS: We quantified page navigation strategies and difficulties of people with AMD reading with magnifiers. <b>Retrace,</b> which presents the most common difficulty, is not well predicted by vision measures or magnifier characteristics; future studies should investigate the relationship between motor skills and navigation performance, and the impact of training or devices on reducing <b>retrace</b> navigation difficulties...|$|R

5|$|Hamdanid {{relations}} with Byzantium collapsed completely in 985–986, after the Fatimids took the Byzantine fortress of Balanyas. Sa'd al-Dawla refused to continue paying tribute. As a result, the Byzantines under Bardas Phokas invaded his territory and sacked Killis before <b>retracing</b> their steps and marching south to an unsuccessful siege of Apamea. In retaliation, Sa'd al-Dawla sent his troops to raze the famous monastery of Qal'at Sim'an. However, soon after that, in May 986, {{the prospect of}} an imminent conclusion of a peace between Byzantium and Egypt forced Sa'd al-Dawla to return to his earlier allegiance, and he re-affirmed his tributary status on the same terms as before. This did not prevent Sa'd al-Dawla from supporting the Byzantine general Bardas Skleros in his second rebellion against Basil II, once he was released from Buyid captivity in December 986, nor of recognizing Fatimid suzerainty in the same month, especially as Byzantium now descended into a civil war that lasted until 989.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} <b>retracing</b> old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in a snowy environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E

50|$|For this reason, it is {{necessary}} to shut off the electron beam (corresponding to a video signal of zero luminance) during {{the time it takes to}} reorient the beam from the end of one line to the beginning of the next (horizontal <b>retrace)</b> and from the bottom of the screen to the top (vertical <b>retrace</b> or vertical blanking interval). The horizontal <b>retrace</b> is accounted for in the time allotted to each scan line, but the vertical <b>retrace</b> is accounted for as phantom lines which are never displayed but which are included in the number of lines per frame defined for each video system. Since the electron beam must be turned off in any case, the result is gaps in the television signal, which can be used to transmit other information, such as test signals or color identification signals.|$|R
40|$|Execution trace is an {{important}} tool in computer architecture research. Unfortunately, existing trace collection techniques are often slow (due to software tracing overheads) or expensive (due to special tracing hardware requirements). Regardless of the method of collection, detailed trace files are generally large and inconvenient to store and share. We present <b>ReTrace,</b> a trace collection tool based on the deterministic replay technology of the VMware hypervisor. <b>ReTrace</b> operates in two stages: capturing and expansion. <b>ReTrace</b> capturing accumulates the minimal amount of information necessary to later recreate a more detailed execution trace. It captures (records) only non-deterministic events resulting in low time and space overheads (as low as 5 % run-time overhead, as low as 0. 5 byte per thousand instructions log growth rate) on supported platforms. <b>ReTrace</b> expansion uses the information collected by the capturing stage to generate a complete and accurate execution trace without any data loss or distortion. <b>ReTrace</b> is an experimental feature of VMware Workstation 6. 0 currently available in Windows and Linux flavors for commodity IA 32 platforms. No special tracing hardware is required. We have three key results. First, we find that trace collection can be done both efficiently and inexpensively. Second, deterministic replay is an effective technique for compressing large trace files. Third, performing the trace collection at the hypervisor layer is minimally invasive to the collected trace while enabling tracing of the entire system (user/supervisor level, CPU, peripheral devices). <b>ReTrace</b> is a rapidly evolving technology. We would like to use this paper to solicit feedback on the applicability of <b>ReTrace</b> in computer architecture research to help us refine our future development plans. ...|$|R
