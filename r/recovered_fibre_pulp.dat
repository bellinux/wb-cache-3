40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{advantages}} of using hardwood short <b>fibre</b> <b>pulp</b> (eucalyptus) as alternative to softwood long <b>fibre</b> <b>pulp</b> (pinus) and polymer fibres, traditionally used in reinforcement of cement-based materials. The effects of cellulose fibre length on microstructure and on mechanical performance of fibre-cement composites were evaluated before and after accelerated ageing cycles. Hardwood <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> were better dispersed in the cement matrix and provided higher number of fibres per unitary weight or volume, in relation to softwood long <b>fibre</b> <b>pulp.</b> The short reinforcing elements lead to an effective crack bridging of the fragile matrix, which contributes to {{the improvement of the}} mechanical performance of the composite after ageing. These promising results show the potential of eucalyptus short fibres for reducing costs by both the partial replacement of expensive synthetic fibres in air curing process and the energy savings during pulp refining.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the characterisation and reuse of <b>fibres</b> <b>recovered</b> from end of life thermoset composites by fluidised bed thermal processing. Emphasis is placed on the properties of <b>recovered</b> glass <b>fibres</b> and their reuse in a dough moulding compound and a tissue product. The need for a recycling process is demonstrated by a survey of the market for thermoset composites with particular consideration given to the potential growth in automotive applications. A study of processes developed to recycle such materials and the effect on the structural properties of composites containing such recyclate shows that a process capable of generating recyclate of greater value is required, particularly for the case of contaminated materials. A review of investigations into the effect of prior heat treatment on the mechanical properties of glass fibres shows that their strength will be reduced by a deterioration of the fibre surface during fluidised bed thermal recovery but that their stiffness is likely to be unaffected. The implications of these effects on possible applications for the <b>recovered</b> <b>fibres</b> are described. Tests are reported on the structural properties of laminates containing heat treated glass cloth which show that there is a strength reduction which is both time and temperature dependent but that modulus is not significantly affected. Strength loss increases with up to 20 minutes heating but then remains constant. In some cases the strength loss can be reduced by resizing the cloth. Measurement of the properties of <b>fibres</b> <b>recovered</b> using the fluidised bed process shows that the <b>recovered</b> <b>fibre</b> strength decreases with increasing processing temperature. Glass and carbon <b>fibres</b> <b>recovered</b> at 450 °C retain approximately 50 % and 80 % of their virgin strengths respectively. The Young's modulus of the <b>recovered</b> <b>fibres</b> is shown to be largely unaffected by the process for both glass and carbon fibres. Investigation of the lengths of the <b>recovered</b> glass <b>fibres</b> by image analysis techniques suggests that their distribution depends on the structure of the composite and the method of size reduction. A weighted mean fibre length of 3. 5 mm to 5. 5 mm is possible with the apparatus described in this thesis. The reduced reinforcement potential of the <b>recovered</b> <b>fibres</b> is confirmed by experiment. <b>Recovered</b> glass <b>fibres</b> are used to displace virgin fibres in a dough moulding compound. At replacement levels of up to 50 % there is no significant effect on the mechanical properties of a compression moulded plate. Above this level, tensile, flexural and impact strengths are reduced and with complete replacement the reduction is by approximately 40 %, 50 % and 70 % respectively. These results are confirmed on a pilot plant scale. <b>Recovered</b> glass <b>fibres</b> can be successfully incorporated with virgin fibres into a veil. Replacement of virgin fibres reduces both wet and dry strength because the <b>recovered</b> <b>fibres</b> are both shorter and weaker. The permeability of the veil is found to depend on its porosity and not its <b>recovered</b> <b>fibre</b> content.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out the reasons why the long <b>fibres</b> of mechanical <b>pulp</b> do not seem to reinforce paper as effectively as chemical reinforcement pulp. A preliminary laboratory trial showed that artificially increasing the average fibre length of TMP pulp by adding long fibres extracted from the same pulp increased the tear index, but decreased the tensile strength, internal bond strength and the fracture energy. Increasing the average fibre strength with chemical (NBSK) <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> improved all of those properties considerably. In the second trial fibre properties and reinforcement ability of various mechanical pulps were investigated. It was shown that fibre dimensions of mechanical <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> did not differ essentially from chemical <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres.</b> The biggest differences were in the properties characterizing the cell wall structure. This was clearly seen in fibre flexibility and fibre swelling (WRV), for instance. Mechanical <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> are evidently more damaged than chemical <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> which is seen as a much lower fibre strength (zero-span tensile strength). The reinforcement potential, on the grounds of fracture energy, tear strength and tensile strength of handsheets was much lower for mechanical <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> than for chemical pulp. In the third trial, mechanical (MRP) and chemimechanical reinforcement pulp (CMRP) was manufactured from Norway spruce (P. abies) on a pilot scale. The focus was to increase fibre flexibility, bonding ability and maintain the fibre length and strength. The runnability of LWC base paper made from the trial pulps was tested using the KCL AHMA runnability tester. In spite of the good strength properties of the trial pulps, they did not have the same overall reinforcement ability than chemical pulp. The sulphonated trial pulp (CMRP) gave the same tensile stiffness and tensile strength as the chemical pulp. However, the fracture properties and extensibility of the paper was worse with it. The lower average length of the trial pulps did not explain the difference totally. Scaling the fibre length with the zero-span tensile strength improved the explanatory power essentially. It was concluded that the low fibre strength is the basic reason for the poorer reinforcement ability of mechanical <b>pulps</b> <b>fibres</b> over chemical ones...|$|R
