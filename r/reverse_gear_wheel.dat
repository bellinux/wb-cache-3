50|$|The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, {{powerful}} and compact. It had one front wheel, with solid rubber tyre, and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, by evaporation.

5000|$|The first commercially {{successful}} light-weight petrol-powered {{general purpose}} tractor was built by Dan Albone, a British inventor in 1901. He filed for a patent on 15 February 1902 for his tractor design and then formed Ivel Agricultural Motors Limited. The other directors were Selwyn Edge, Charles Jarrott, John Hewitt and Lord Willoughby. He called his machine the Ivel Agricultural Motor; the word [...] "tractor" [...] did not come into common use until later. The Ivel Agricultural Motor was light, powerful and compact. It had one front wheel, with solid rubber tyre, and two large rear wheels like a modern tractor. The engine used water cooling, by evaporation. It had one forward and one <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b> A pulley <b>wheel</b> on the left hand side allowed it {{to be used as}} a stationary engine, driving a wide range of agricultural machinery. The 1903 sale price was £300. His tractor won a medal at the Royal Agricultural Show, in 1903 and 1904. About 500 were built, and many were exported all over the world. The original engine was made by Payne & Co. of Coventry. After 1906, French Aster engines were used.|$|R

5000|$|The {{development}} of articulated locomotives {{was a major}} impetus to the {{development of}} power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> instead of just one on a simple locomotive. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features. In British use, locking cylinders remained in use. The Hadfield <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> with added locking cylinder.Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{powerful}} horse mill for four horses; probably English ponies, as modern heavy horses were not yet fully bred in the 1830s. Each of the four heavy oak beams connecting the central axle to the four horse shafts runs from beside the axle to the under-surface of the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and crosses the other three in a grid pattern between the axle and <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> thus supporting the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> and creating a rigid structure at the same time. They project for many feet beyond the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and require wooden stretchers to stabilise them. From the ends of these beams hang the horse shafts. The bottom ends of these shafts are quite low, which may indicate the use of ponies rather than early heavy horses.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for the two-dimensional scanning of a surface {{by means of a}} light beam and a mirror (4) rotatable about two axes perpendicular to each other. One axis is an optical axis (A-A) along which a light beam emitted by a light source runs. The rotating movements of the mirror (4) are caused by two drive motors (1, 2), whereby the rotating movement of the mirror is transferred onto the optical axis (A-A) perpendicular to the standing axis (B-B) via a differential gear (5). The differential gear (5) has two intermeshing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> (10, 11). The mirror (4) is arranged in a mirror holder (3) connected to a hollow shaft rotatable about the axis (B-B). One <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> (11) of the differential gear (5) is attached to the mirror (4) and the other <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> (10) is connected to the drive shaft (12) of the second drive motor (11).

25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> A large horizontal <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road <b>wheels.</b> Two small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|R

40|$|Additive manufacturing, {{especially}} SLM, {{provides a}} suitable technology for manufacturing complex parts. This enables innovative product design for resource efficiency and effectiveness via light weight design or functional integration.

The cooling and lubrication system is improved by implementing internal conformal cooling channels via additive manufacturing. This way a volume reduction of the lubricant is pursued resulting in greatly diminished oil churning, windage, and squeezing losses. As a consequence, overall transmission efficiency can be increased by employing an innovative functional <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> design.
