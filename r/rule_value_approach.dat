40|$|The Fubini-Furlan-Rossetti sum {{rule for}} pion photoproduction on the nucleon is {{evaluated}} by dispersion relations at constant t, and the corrections to the sum rule {{due to the}} finite pion mass are calculated. Near threshold these corrections {{turn out to be}} large due to pion-loop effects, whereas the sum <b>rule</b> <b>value</b> is closely <b>approached</b> if the dispersion integrals are evaluated for sub-threshold kinematics. This extension to the unphysical region provides a unique framework to determine the low-energy constants of chiral perturbation theory by global properties of the excitation spectrum.

40|$|The IT {{industry}} {{has struggled with}} performance in the last 10 years. Tools, processes, and techniques have been developed in attempts to improve performance. Three {{of the most recent}} proposed solutions which have shown previous results of success include decreasing the size of projects, using agile project management, and using the best <b>value</b> <b>approach.</b> This paper will focus on differentiating between the three approaches and introduces the latest solution, the best <b>value</b> <b>approach.</b> After analyzing the three approaches, the paper proposes that the best <b>value</b> <b>approach</b> {{is the only one that}} requires the utilization of expertise. Using a case study of Schuberg Philis, the paper proposes that the Schuberg Philis model uses the agile approach but has most of the characteristics of the best <b>value</b> <b>approach.</b> In the course of the study and analysis, the Schuberg Philis company has moved from the agile approach to the Best <b>Value</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{identifies}} {{barriers to}} realizing a stewardship relation {{instead of a}} classic principal–agent relation between client and vendor through implementation of an innovative procurement and risk management method, the Best <b>Value</b> <b>approach.</b> This approach focuses on calculus-based trust development {{through the use of}} metrics and alignment of goals and risks between client and vendor. Barriers to realizing a stewardship relation are analysed {{with the use of a}} theoretical framework that incorporates agency theory and stewardship theory. Data was collected in 2013 and 2014 through project documentation and interviews for four case studies at the Dutch Highways Agency. Collected data was used to analyse the roles of the client and vendor, the scope and level of the products and the overall process of the clarification phase of the Best <b>Value</b> <b>approach</b> to identify barriers in practice. Case study findings are analysed and explained by agency theory and stewardship theory. From a theoretical perspective the Best <b>Value</b> <b>approach</b> shows large similarities with stewardship theory. In practice, however, the cases show that the often traditional background of project teams and the lack of experience with Best Value result in a control-oriented relationship between client and vendor characterized by information asymmetry, lack of transparency and distrust. These characteristics of the relationship between client and vendor inhibit the realization of a stewardship relation using the Best <b>Value</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R
