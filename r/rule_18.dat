2500|$|Jones was {{not only}} a consummately skilled golfer but {{exemplified}} the principles of sportsmanship and fair play. In {{the first round of the}} 1925 U.S. Open at the Worcester Country Club near Boston, his approach shot to the 11th hole's elevated green fell short into the deep rough of the embankment. As he took his stance to pitch onto the green, the head of his club brushed the grass and caused a slight movement of the ball. He took the shot, then informed his playing partner Walter Hagen and the USGA official covering their match that he was calling a penalty on himself. Hagen was unable to talk him out of it, and they continued play. [...] After the round and before he signed his scorecard, officials argued with Jones but he insisted that he had violated <b>Rule</b> <b>18,</b> moving a ball at rest after address, and took a 77 instead of the 76 he otherwise would have carded. Jones' self-imposed one-stroke penalty eventually cost him the win by a stroke in regulation, necessitating a playoff, which he then lost. Although praised by many sports writers for his gesture, Jones was reported to have said, [...] "You might as well praise me for not robbing banks." ...|$|E
