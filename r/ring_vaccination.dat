25|$|Since the {{adoption}} of mass and <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination,</b> complexities and challenges to herd immunity have arisen. Modelling of the spread of infectious disease originally {{made a number of}} assumptions, namely that entire populations are susceptible and well-mixed, which do not exist in reality, so more precise equations have been developed. In recent decades, it has been recognized that the dominant strain of a microorganism in circulation may change due to herd immunity, either because of herd immunity acting as an evolutionary pressure or because herd immunity against one strain allowed another already-existing strain to spread. Emerging or ongoing vaccine controversies and various reasons for opposing vaccination have made herd immunity to either not be established or to disappear in certain communities, allowing preventable diseases to persist in or return to these communities.|$|E
2500|$|The term herd {{immunity}} {{was first used}} in 1923 to refer to an entire population's immunity, in reference to research examining disease mortality in mouse populations {{with varying degrees of}} immunity. Herd immunity was first recognized as a naturally occurring phenomenon in the 1930s when A. W. Hedrich published research on the epidemiology of measles in Baltimore and took notice that after many children had become immune to measles, the number of new infections temporarily decreased, including among susceptible children. In spite of this knowledge, efforts to control and eliminate measles were unsuccessful until mass vaccination using the measles vaccine began in the 1960s. Mass vaccination, discussions of disease eradication, and cost–benefit analyses of vaccination subsequently prompted more widespread use of the term {{herd immunity}}. In the 1970s, the theorem used to calculated a disease's herd immunity threshold was developed. During the smallpox eradication campaign in the 1960s and 1970s, the practice of <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination,</b> of which herd immunity is integral to, began as a way to immunize every person in a [...] "ring" [...] around an infected individual to prevent outbreaks from spreading.|$|E

50|$|Another {{effective}} way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small-world networks. In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main {{focus is on the}} prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV {{is an example of the}} successful implementation of this treatment method. 6 Another example is the use of <b>ring</b> culling or <b>vaccination</b> of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot-and-mouth virus in 2001.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The United States (US) has re-instituted {{smallpox}} vaccinations {{to prepare}} for an intentional release of the smallpox virus into the civilian population. In an outbreak, {{people of all ages}} will be vaccinated. To prepare for the impact of large-scale <b>ring</b> and mass <b>vaccinations,</b> we conducted a systematic review of the complication and mortality risks of smallpox vaccination. We summarized these risks for post-vaccinial encephalitis, vaccinia necrosum (progressive vaccinia), eczema vaccinatum, generalized vaccinia, and accidental infection (inadvertant autoinoculation). Methods Using a MEDLINE search strategy, we identified 348 articles, of which seven studies met our inclusion criteria (the number of primary vaccinations and re-vaccinations were reported, sufficient data were provided to calculate complication or case-fatality risks, and comparable case definitions were used). For each complication, we estimated of the complication, death, and case-fatality risks. Results The life-threatening complications of post-vaccinial encephalitis and vaccinia necrosum were at least 3 and 1 per million primary vaccinations, respectively. Twenty-nine percent of vaccinees with post-vaccinial encephalitis died and 15 % with vaccinia necrosum died. There were no deaths among vaccinees that developed eczema vaccinatum; however, 2. 3 % of non-vaccinated contacts with eczema vaccinatum died. Among re-vaccinees, the risk of post-vaccinial encephalitis was reduced 26 -fold, the risk of generalized vaccinia was reduced 29 -fold, and the risk of eczema vaccinatum was reduced 12 -fold. However, the risk reductions of accidental infection and vaccinia necrosum were modest (3. 8 and 1. 5 fold respectively). </p...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Simulation {{models can}} offer {{valuable}} {{insights into the}} effectiveness of different control strategies and act as important decision support tools when comparing and evaluating outbreak scenarios and control strategies. An international modelling study was performed to compare a range of vaccination strategies in the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Modelling groups from five countries (Australia, New Zealand, USA, UK, The Netherlands) participated in the study. Vaccination is increasingly being recognized as a potentially important tool in the control of FMD, although there is considerable uncertainty as to how and when it should be used. We sought to compare model outputs and assess the effectiveness of different vaccination strategies in the control of FMD. Using a standardized outbreak scenario {{based on data from}} an FMD exercise in the UK in 2010, the study showed general agreement between respective models in terms of the effectiveness of vaccination. Under the scenario assumptions, all models demonstrated that vaccination with 'stamping-out' of infected premises led to a significant reduction in predicted epidemic size and duration compared to the 'stamping-out' strategy alone. For all models there were advantages in vaccinating cattle-only rather than all species, using 3 -km <b>vaccination</b> <b>rings</b> immediately around infected premises, and starting vaccination earlier in the control programme. This study has shown that certain vaccination strategies are robust even to substantial differences in model configurations. This result should increase end-user confidence in conclusions drawn from model outputs. These results can be used to support and develop effective policies for FMD control...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} disease with significant economic consequences, for which urgent and rational decisions are essential. It is a great concern for countries worldwide where livestock industries are important, regardless of the current FMD status. This thesis addressed {{the problems in the}} existing decision support systems used by the current FMD-free countries, with a particular focus on New Zealand. Because the exact source of infection is uncertain in the spatially and temporally concentrated focus of an FMD epidemic, it is challenging to predict the behaviour of FMD and determine the best control alternatives within a given susceptible population. The studies proposed a new approach for descriptive spatio-temporal analyses of local spread patterns, which was applied to the data from the FMD outbreaks in Cumbria (UK, 2001), Miyazaki (Japan, 2010), and Andong (Republic of Korea, 2010). The analyses identified herd-specific risk factors of local spread: size of a susceptible premises, infectious premises with pigs and susceptible premises with cattle were positively associated with hazard of local spread in all the three epidemics. In addition, the adjusted hazard of local spread varied markedly by outbreak. The UK FMD epidemic in 2001 had the highest hazard of local spread. The findings highlight the needs of care in interpolating the local spread probabilities from one epidemic for use of disease modelling for a different susceptible population. Detailed investigation of the FMD epidemic in Japan in 2010 illustrated a dynamic change in the patterns of local spread during the epidemic prior to emergency vaccination, suggesting contribution of human activities in addition to purely environmental factors to local spread. A stochastic spatial simulation model, using the local spread parameters derived from the analyses showed a high predictive accuracy, in terms of demographical, temporal and spatial patterns of infection. The model indicated that emergency vaccination {{played an important role in}} mitigating potentially unwanted outcomes of an epidemic, such as disease spread outside the prefecture. In addition, the model predicted that both epidemiological and economic consequences of the epidemic could have been reduced by earlier application of vaccination with a smaller <b>vaccination</b> <b>ring</b> for the epidemic in Japan in 2010. To enhance contingency planning for FMD, a disease simulation modelling system was developed, by adding an economic module to the existing FMD simulation model for New Zealand. The modelling system allowed estimation of the direct and macroeconomic costs of a simulated FMD epidemic. Analyses of data generated by the disease simulation modelling system indicated that vaccinate-to-die was economically preferred to stamping-out alone or vaccinate-to-live, for a simulated FMD epidemic in the Auckland Region with local spread potential similar to that of the Cumbria outbreak in 2001, which had a high potential of developing into a large epidemic, indicated by a high density of premises, a high cumulative number of IPs, or a high estimated dissemination rate, and local spread patterns similar to Cumbria outbreak (2001). Vaccinate-to-live was economically suboptimal under the current OIE standard regarding recovery of FMD-free status. The results were robust to the uncertainty in the resource capacity, vaccination effectiveness, and the early scale of an epidemic, but sensitive to the choice of vaccination radius. VTL was always economically suboptimal under the current OIE code, but would be advantageous if the OIE’s waiting period was shortened by 3 months. Using more refined parameters, future work is required to investigate other potentially more advantageous options, such as vaccination applied to specific species or in alternative prioritisation. The studies presented in this thesis demonstrated that simulation models that incorporated the current best epidemiological and economic knowledge might enhance contingency planning and decision making for the management of FMD. Simulation models could also be used as the quantitative basis of communication with decision makers and stakeholders, which would then encourage informed discussion around disease control measures...|$|R

The vaccine was proven safe at multiple sites in North America, Europe, and Africa, but several volunteers at one trial site in Geneva, Switzerland, developed vaccine-related arthritis after about 2 weeks, and about 20-30% of volunteers at reporting sites developed low-grade post-vaccine fever, which resolved within a day or two. Other common side-effects were pain at the site of injection, myalgia, and fatigue. The trial was temporarily halted in December 2014 due to possible adverse effects, but subsequently resumed. As of April 2015, a Phase 3 trial with a single dose of VSV-EBOV began in Liberia after a successful Phase 2 study in the West Africa country. On 31 July 2015, preliminary results of a Phase 3 trial in Guinea indicated that the vaccine appears to be [...] "highly efficacious and safe." [...] The trial used a <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> protocol that first vaccinated all the closest contacts of new cases of Ebola infection either immediately or after 21 days.

5000|$|An Independent Inquiry into Foot and Mouth Disease in Scotland {{initiated}} by the Royal Society of Edinburgh was chaired by Professor Ian Cunningham. This embraced not only the scientific aspects of the outbreak, but also economic, social and psychological effects of the event. The costs to Scottish agriculture of the FMD outbreak were estimated to be £231m {{and the loss of}} gross revenue to tourism to be between £200-250m for Scotland as a whole. There should be a regional laboratory in Scotland, and priority be given to the development of testing procedures. The delay in imposing a ban of all movements until the third day after confirmation, the use of less than transparent modelling techniques and the failure to call on more than a fraction of the considerable relevant scientific expertise available in Scotland were criticised. The case for emergency protective vaccination, without subsequent slaughter, was supported by the evidence and it was recommended that contingency plans should include emergency barrier, or <b>ring.</b> <b>vaccination</b> as an adjunct to slaughter in clinical cases. Reservations about the consumption of meat and milk from vaccinated animals were unjustified. The importance of biosecurity at all times and throughout the agricultural industry was emphasised and SEERAD (The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department) should take the lead in establishing standards to be applied in normal times and at the start of an outbreak. A Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) should be appointed and a [...] "Territorial Veterinary Army" [...] formed from professionals to be called upon should need arise. Burial of carcasses, where conditions permit, is the preferred option for disposal of slaughtered animals. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) should have a clear role in contingency planning and management of any future emergency. There was a need for operational guidelines for slaughtermen. In formulating movement restriction, the dispersed nature of many holdings should be taken into account. There should be a clear and consistent strategy for compensation for slaughtered animals. The closing down of the country initially for no more than three weeks and then reopening in non-affected areas was recommended. Great importance was placed on contingency planning, on the need for regular exercises and on the setting up of an independent standing committee to monitor the maintenance of effective planning. In all, some twenty seven recommendations were made to the Scottish Executive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{smallpox}} <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> models {{based on}} contact tracing over a network suggest that <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> would be effective, {{but have not}} explicitly included response logistics and limited numbers of vaccinators. Methods We developed a continuous-time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission, including network structure, post-exposure vaccination, vaccination of contacts of contacts, limited response capacity, heterogeneity in symptoms and infectiousness, vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination, more rapid diagnosis due to public awareness, surveillance of asymptomatic contacts, and isolation of cases. Results We found that even in cases of very rapidly spreading smallpox, <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> (when coupled with surveillance) is sufficient in most cases to eliminate smallpox quickly, assuming that 95 % of household contacts are traced, 80 % of workplace or social contacts are traced, and no casual contacts are traced, and that {{in most cases the}} ability to trace 1 – 5 individuals per day per index case is sufficient. If smallpox is assumed to be transmitted very quickly to contacts, it may at times escape containment by <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination,</b> but could be controlled in these circumstances by mass vaccination.

In particular, shortening the time from symptoms onset to hospitalisation to 2 - 3 days on average through improved contact tracing procedures, adding a 2 km spatial component to the vaccination ring, and decreasing human mobility by quarantining affected areas might contribute increase our ability to contain outbreaks with effective reproduction number up to 2. 6.

In the United States, where the interim policy {{in the event of a}} smallpox attack is based on <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination,</b> 6 we have argued that localized mass vaccination from the moment an attack is recognized would result in far fewer casualties than <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination,</b> including deaths that result from vaccination itself. 7 In this commentary, we closely examine a figure based on historical data reported by Foege et al 8, 9 documenting smallpox control and eradication in West and Central Africa. This figure has been resurrected as empirical proof of the effectiveness of <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination,</b> and presented in important meetings addressing smallpox response policy in the United States 10. It is important that data offered to garner support for a policy position stand on their own as presented, and indeed it was the public presentation of this figure that prompted our investigation.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{stochastic}} {{model for the}} spread of smallpox after {{a small number of}} index cases are introduced into a susceptible population. The model describes a branching process for the spread of the infection and the effects of intervention measures. We discuss scenarios in which <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> of direct contacts of infected persons is sufficient to contain an epidemic. <b>Ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> can be successful if infectious cases are rapidly diagnosed. However, because of the inherent stochastic nature of epidemic outbreaks, both the size and duration of contained outbreaks are highly variable. Intervention requirements depend on the basic reproduction number (R 0), for which different estimates exist. When faced with the decision of whether to rely on <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination,</b> the public health community should be aware that an epidemic might take time to subside even for an eventually successful intervention strategy. Recently, concerns about a bioterror attack with the smallpox virus or other infectious disease agents have risen (1, 2). While new vaccines with fewer adverse consequences are being developed (3), the existing vaccines, which have potential side effects and may be lethal, are the only vaccines available (4, 5). In the United States during the recent voluntary smallpox vaccination program, a limited number of healthcare workers volunteered for vaccination because of the risks associated with vaccination and the low for infection (6). If an outbreak occurs, vaccination strategies include <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> around diagnosed cases of smallpox or a mass vaccination to begin as soon as the first cases are diagnosed. Without natural smallpox infections, practical experience with <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> against smallpox cannot be gained; accounts of the vaccination programs that eradicated smallpox in the 1970 s are the only source of information (7). Combined with information collected during the last decades of smallpox circulation, mathematical modeling offers a tool to explore various vaccination scenarios if an outbreak occur...|$|E

40|$|Behavior-incidence {{models have}} been used to model {{phenomena}} such as free-riding vaccinating behavior, where nonvaccinators free ride on herd immunity generated by vaccinators. Here, we develop and analyze a simulation model of voluntary <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> on an evolving social contact network. Individuals make vaccination decisions by examining their expected payoffs, which are influenced by the infection status of their neighbors. We find that stochasticity can make outcomes extremely variable (near critical thresholds) and thus unpredictable: some stochastic realizations result in rapid control through <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> while others result in widespread transmission. We also explore the phenomenon of outcome inelasticity, wherein behavioral responses result in certain outcome measures remaining relatively unchanged. Finally, we explore examples where ineffective or risky vaccines are more widely adopted than safe, effective vaccines. This occurs when such a vaccine is unattractive to a sufficient number of contacts of an index case to cause failure of <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination.</b> As a result, the infection percolates through the entire network, causing the final epidemic size and vaccine coverage to be higher than would otherwise occur. Effects such as extreme outcome variability and outcome inelasticity have implications for vaccination policies that depend on individual choice for their success and predictability...|$|E
40|$|As {{a devastating}} Ebola {{outbreak}} in West Africa continues, non-pharmaceutical control mea-sures including contact tracing, quarantine, and case isolation are being implemented. In addition, public health agencies are scaling up efforts to test and deploy candidate vac-cines. Given the experimental nature and limited initial supplies of vaccines, a mass vacci-nation campaign {{might not be}} feasible. However, <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> of likely case contacts could provide an effective alternative in distributing the vaccine. To evaluate ring vaccina-tion as a strategy for eliminating Ebola, we developed a pair approximation model of Ebola transmission, parameterized by confirmed incidence data from June 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Our results suggest that if a combined intervention of case iso-lation and <b>ring</b> <b>vaccination</b> had been initiated in the early fall of 2014, up to an additional 12...|$|E
