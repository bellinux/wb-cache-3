5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George <b>Rathmann,</b> Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: <b>Rathmann</b> had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the underlying causes of inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gatesâ€“ who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George <b>Rathmann,</b> seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E
5|$|Icos Corporation (trademark ICOS) was an American {{biotechnology}} {{company and}} the largest biotechnology company in the U.S. state of Washington, before it was sold to Eli Lilly and Company in 2007. It was founded in 1989 by David Blech, Isaac Blech, Robert Nowinski, and George <b>Rathmann,</b> {{a pioneer in the}} industry and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and co-founder of Amgen, Icos focused on the development of drugs to treat inflammatory disorders. During its 17-year history, the company conducted clinical trials of twelve drugs, three of which reached the last phase of clinical trials. Icos also manufactured antibodies for other biotechnology companies.|$|E

Hornets driven by NASCAR aces Herb Thomas, Dick <b>Rathmann,</b> Al Keller, Frank Mundyand, and Tim Flock won 27 NASCAR races driving for the Hudson team.|$|E
25|$|Astronaut Alan Shepard, a {{long time}} Corvette owner, was invited by then GM Chief Engineer Zora Arkus-Duntov to drive {{pre-production}} Corvette models. General Motors executives later gave Shepard a 1972 model with a Bill Mitchell interior. Jim <b>Rathmann,</b> a Melbourne, Florida Chevrolet dealer and winner of the 1960 Indy 500, befriended astronauts Shepard, Gus Grissom, and Gordon Cooper. <b>Rathmann</b> convinced GM President Ed Cole {{to set up a}} program which supplied each astronaut with a pair of new cars each year. Most chose a family car for their wives and a Corvette for themselves. In his memoir Last Man On The Moon, Gene Cernan describes how this worked. The astronauts received brand-new Corvettes which they were given the option to purchase at a 'used' price after they'd been driven 3000 miles. Alan Bean recalls Corvettes lined up in the parking lot outside the astronaut offices at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and friendly races between Shepard and Grissom along the Florida beach roads and beaches themselves as local police turned a blind eye.|$|E
2500|$|Jim <b>Rathmann,</b> winning {{all three}} heats, was {{declared}} the race winner, although Jimmy Bryan had finished {{only a minute}} and a half behind <b>Rathmann</b> on aggregate time. [...] <b>Rathmann</b> averaged a speed of [...] over the 500miles. [...] Several thousand more spectators attending the 1958 running of the event than had attended the previous year.|$|E
2500|$|Jim <b>Rathmann</b> {{served as}} a reserve driver for the John Zink Watson-Offy. [...] He practiced, but did not race.|$|E
2500|$|Eleven {{cars were}} entered {{for the final}} heat, joined by Fangio and Gregory who had both {{repaired}} their cars. [...] Fairman chose not {{to continue in the}} Lister-Jaguar, while Hawthorn started the #12 Ferrari in place of Musso. [...] <b>Rathmann</b> once again led at the start, followed by Bryan and Foyt. [...] Fangio's car lasted only two laps before his fuel pump failed and he was forced to retire. [...] Hawthorn suffered the same methanol inhalation problems as Musso and relinquished his car to Phil Hill after 24 laps. [...] Moss, after bringing his Maserati up to fourth place, suffered steering failure on Lap 41, crashing into the guard rails {{at the top of the}} banking. [...] <b>Rathmann</b> led straight to the finish, ahead of Bryan. [...] Hill brought the Ferrari up to third before giving the car back to Hawthorn, who finished the race in third.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{practice}} {{run on the}} new track {{began on}} February 6, 1959. On February 22, 1959, 42,000 people attended the inaugural Daytona 500, and its finish was as startling as the track itself: Lee Petty beat Johnny Beauchamp in a photo finish that took three days to adjudicate. When the track opened it was the fastest race track to ever host a stock car race, until Talladega Superspeedway opened 10 years later. April 4, it would host a [...] Champ Car event, also, which saw Jim <b>Rathmann</b> beat Dick <b>Rathmann</b> and Rodger Ward, and, with an average speed , {{was at the time}} the fastest motor race ever. It was also the occasion of Daytona's first fatality: George Amick, attempting to overtake for third late in the race, hit a wall and was killed. April 5, a scheduled [...] sports car event (shortened to [...] by darkness) was won by Roberto Mieres and Fritz d'Orey, who shared a Porsche RSK, which proved more durable than more potent competition.|$|E
2500|$|Heat two {{began with}} {{thirteen}} of the fourteen cars which {{had completed the}} first heat, Masten Gregory chose to not return with the Jaguar but Rodger Ward was able to repair his car and compete. [...] Fangio planned to race, but his team had not completed engine repairs {{by the end of}} the hour and a half break. [...] Maurice Trintignant, who had completed the first heat in the Sclavi & Amos Kuzma-Offenhauser, chose to be relieved by rookie A. J. Foyt for the rest of the race. [...] <b>Rathmann</b> led the field to the start and remained in the lead throughout. [...] Musso once again remained with the top drivers, but pitted after only nineteen laps to be replaced, this time by Phil Hill whose Ferrari had retired in the first heat. [...] Moss, Veith, Bryan, and Troy Ruttman all fought for second place, eventually led to the finish by Veith, nearly 20 seconds behind winner <b>Rathmann.</b> [...] Moss' Maserati suffered engine trouble and dropped back at the finish, earning fifth.|$|E
2500|$|American {{drivers and}} teams won {{the event in}} both the years {{in which it was}} run. [...] Jimmy Bryan won the 1957 event, while Jim <b>Rathmann</b> swept the 1958 race. [...] Although some Formula One teams did {{participate}} and even built special cars specifically for the event, several withdrew over safety concerns. [...] Continued concern over the speeds on the track and the cost of the event led to the race being canceled after the 1958 running.|$|E
2500|$|Juan Manuel Fangio started {{practice}} early {{by setting}} {{one of the}} first laps around the circuit on Wednesday in a USAC entry loaned to him. [...] Jim <b>Rathmann</b> set the fastest lap of the day with a time of 54.4 seconds, or [...] [...] Monza was drenched by rain on Thursday when official practice began, but Fangio chose to use the circuit anyway and set a lap speed over , while the American teams chose to not run.|$|E
2500|$|Sunday was race day, {{once again}} running as three 63-lap heats. [...] Problems {{occurred}} early for Fangio {{as he was}} forced to withdraw from the first heat after his team discovered that his Offenhauser engine had a cracked piston. [...] The other eighteen cars took the rolling start and, as in the year before, the Jaguars' gearing allowed them to jump to the early lead before Ferrari's Musso and several USAC drivers reclaimed it {{before the end of the}} first lap of the race. [...] Eddie Sachs and Musso traded off the lead over the next several laps before Sachs remained in the lead, Jimmy Bryan also slipping into second. [...] <b>Rathmann</b> worked his way through the field and took the lead from Sachs on Lap 11. [...] Sachs was forced to drop from second place a few laps later when he broke a connecting rod, giving second to Musso. [...] Musso however also dropped back after succumbing to methanol fumes, pitting on Lap 27 and handing the car to Mike Hawthorn. [...] <b>Rathmann</b> continued to lead until the finish, followed by Bryan, Veith, and the Moss Maserati in fourth. [...] Musso, who returned to his Ferrari on the final lap, brought the car home in sixth, three laps behind.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rathmann</b> {{drove in}} 3 NASCAR Strictly Stock/Grand National races from 1949 to 1951, {{competing}} in one race {{in each of}} those years. He debuted in 1949 at Langhorne. Starting 13th in the race, <b>Rathmann</b> slid to 32nd {{by the end of the}} race. In 1950, <b>Rathmann</b> raced at the prestigious Daytona Beach Road Course. Starting 17th in this event, <b>Rathmann</b> finished a career-best 12th, two laps down. In his final race in 1951, <b>Rathmann</b> started a career-best 9th at Detroit. He finished 52nd in this race.|$|E
50|$|The green flag {{came back}} out on lap 10 with Jim <b>Rathmann</b> leading and Dick <b>Rathmann</b> running second. The Rathman {{brothers}} battled wheel to wheel over the final ten laps, with Jim holding off Dick for the victory. The margin of victory was approximately 60 feet. <b>Rathmann</b> swept both races for the day, and earned $9,950 in prize money. <b>Rathmann,</b> however, was issued a $100 penalty for not properly slowing down during the yellow light period for Rodger Ward's crash.|$|E
50|$|Jim <b>Rathmann,</b> winning {{all three}} heats, was {{declared}} the race winner, although Jimmy Bryan had finished {{only a minute}} and a half behind <b>Rathmann</b> on aggregate time. <b>Rathmann</b> averaged a speed of 268.367 km/h over the 500 miles.

50|$|Rodger Ward {{took the}} lead from laps 7-11. Jim <b>Rathmann</b> reassummed the lead on lap 12, setting a blistering, record-setting pace. <b>Rathmann</b> claimed the {{slipstream}} slingshot his car ahead of Ward, despite believing that Ward's car might have been running better. Ward stated that he lacked the practice time that <b>Rathmann</b> had on the course, and was reluctant to open up his car to its full potential. Even <b>Rathmann</b> claimed {{he was trying to}} take things easy, and despite leading and setting such a fast pace, he was not going as fast as he believed he could have. <b>Rathmann</b> and Ward ran 1st-2nd through the remainder of the race, pulling away {{from the rest of the}} field.|$|E
50|$|Jim <b>Rathmann</b> (July 16, 1928 - November 23, 2011), born Royal Richard <b>Rathmann,</b> was an American {{race car}} driver {{who won the}} Indianapolis 500 in 1960.|$|E
50|$|On {{the final}} lap, Jim <b>Rathmann</b> led Rodger Ward. Over a half-lap behind was Bob Christie in third, George Amick in fourth, and Dick <b>Rathmann</b> further behind in fifth. As <b>Rathmann</b> and Ward were {{approaching}} the checkered flag, the spectacular and breathtaking race {{appeared to be}} completed without serious incident. However, at the same instant, a horrific crash occurred on the backstretch, taking the life of George Amick.|$|E
5000|$|Started {{first row}} centered, <b>Rathmann</b> {{ran in the}} front the entire race. From the midway point on, <b>Rathmann</b> and fellow driver Rodger Ward were locked in a neck and neck duel for first. Tire wear became an issue as the race wore on and <b>Rathmann</b> {{was able to keep}} his wheels fresh long enough to outrace Ward to the finish. The race {{featured}} the most recorded lead changes in the [...] "Indy 500" [...] history.|$|E

50|$|On Friday February 13, Jim <b>Rathmann</b> {{took to the}} track, {{turning a}} lap of 170.06 mph. <b>Rathmann</b> {{compared}} the track to Monza, {{where he had been}} victorious in the Race of Two Worlds. Champ Car testing was put on hold for a week, in order to allow NASCAR exclusive use of the track for the next several days. <b>Rathmann</b> planned to return for one last attempt at a record. Meanwhile, Lee Petty would go on to with the Inaugural Daytona 500.|$|E
50|$|Ward battled Jim <b>Rathmann</b> for {{the lead}} in the 1960 Indianapolis 500. In one of the epic duels in Indy 500 history, Ward and <b>Rathmann</b> {{exchanged}} the lead 14 times before Ward slowed on lap 197 to nurse his frayed right front tire to the finish. <b>Rathmann,</b> also struggling with worn-out tires after such a furious pace, took the lead on lap 197 and the two drivers limped home in what is still {{regarded as one of the}} greatest duels for the win in Indianapolis 500 history.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} half, Ward had {{caught up to}} <b>Rathmann,</b> with Johnny Thomson close behind in third. <b>Rathmann</b> and Ward swapped the lead several times, but {{meanwhile}} Ward was hoping that the pace would slow down, {{in order to save}} his tires to the end. After stalling in the pits earlier, the hard charge Ward made {{to get back to the}} front was a concern, as he was afraid he had worn out his tires prematurely. Ward was aware of Rathmann's tendencies as a driver, and allowed <b>Rathmann</b> to pass him for the lead. <b>Rathmann</b> was known for charging hard to take the lead, but once he was in the lead, would often back the pace down. Ward's prediction came true, but it was at the expense of losing ground to third place. Johnny Thomson was now catching up.|$|E
