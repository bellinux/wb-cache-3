5|$|The {{golden jackal}} {{is both a}} {{predator}} and a scavenger, and an omnivorous and opportunistic forager with a diet that varies according to its habitat and the season. In Bharatpur, India, over 60% of its diet was measured to consist of rodents, birds, and fruit. In the Kanha Tiger Reserve, 80% of its diet consists of rodents, reptiles and fruit. Vegetable matter forms part of the jackal diet, and in India they feed intensively on the fruits of Buckthorn (Ziziphus), Dogbane (Carissa carvanda), Java plum (Syzygium cumini), and the pods of mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) and the golden <b>rain</b> <b>tree</b> Cassia fistula.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of large grazing {{animals in the}} Cenozoic contributed {{to the spread of}} grasses. Without large grazers, fire-cleared areas are quickly colonized by grasses, and with enough <b>rain,</b> <b>tree</b> seedlings. Trees eventually outcompete most grasses. Trampling grazers kill seedling trees but not grasses.|$|E
500|$|On {{hearing of}} Messiaen's death in 1992, Takemitsu {{was interviewed by}} telephone, and still in shock, [...] "blurted out, 'His death leaves a crisis in {{contemporary}} music!'" [...] Then later, in an obituary written for the French composer in the same year, Takemitsu further expressed his sense of loss at Messiaen's death: [...] "Truly, he was my spiritual mentor... Among the many things I learned from his music, the concept and experience of color and the form of time will be unforgettable." [...] The composition <b>Rain</b> <b>Tree</b> Sketch II, {{which was to be}} Takemitsu's final piano piece, was also written that year and subtitled [...] "In Memoriam Olivier Messiaen".|$|E
5000|$|Around 1937-1957, many <b>rain</b> <b>trees</b> {{were to be}} {{cut down}} to {{allocate}} the area for new buildings and enhance cleanliness. The King Bhumibol Adulyadej recognized the dramatic {{decrease in the number}} of <b>rain</b> <b>trees.</b> Hence on January 15, 1962, the king planted five trees that he brought from Hua Hin in front of the university auditorium and said: [...] "Hence I give these five trees as eternal memorial" [...] (จึงขอฝากต้นไม้ไว้ห้าต้นให้เป็นเครื่องเตือนใจตลอดกาล).|$|R

500|$|Several {{recurring}} musical motives can {{be heard}} in Takemitsu's works. In particular the pitch motive E♭-E-A {{can be heard}} in many of his later works, whose titles refer to water in some form (Toward the Sea, 1981; <b>Rain</b> <b>Tree</b> Sketch, 1982; I Hear the Water Dreaming, 1987). [...] When spelt in German (Es-E-A), the motive {{can be seen as a}} musical [...] "transliteration" [...] of the word [...] "sea". Takemitsu used this motive (usually transposed) to indicate the presence of water in his [...] "musical landscapes", even in works whose titles do not directly refer to water, such as A Flock Descends into the Pentagonal Garden (1977; see ex. 5).|$|E
500|$|With Category4 {{winds of}} , Diana {{threatened}} {{to become the}} most intense hurricane to strike North Carolina since Hurricane Hazel in 1954. However, it looped and weakened just offshore and made landfall as a Category 2 hurricane. Because of this, Diana only caused $65.5million in damage (1984USD) due to heavy flooding from up to [...] of <b>rain,</b> <b>tree</b> damage, and downed power lines. Most of the damage was experienced between Wilmington, North Carolina and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. [...] The Carolina Power and Light Brunswick Nuclear Power Plant recorded winds of over 75mph, making Hurricane Diana the first hurricane to bring hurricane force winds to a nuclear power plant. Some yard damage was seen, but the plant was mostly unaffected.|$|E
500|$|Takemitsu's words here {{highlight}} his changing stylistic trends {{from the}} late 1970s into the 1980s, which {{have been described as}} [...] "an increased use of diatonic material [...] references to tertian harmony and jazz voicing", which do not, however, project a sense of [...] "large-scale tonality". Many of the works from this period have titles that include a reference to water: Toward the Sea (1981), <b>Rain</b> <b>Tree</b> and Rain Coming (1982), riverrun and I Hear the Water Dreaming (1987). Takemitsu wrote in his notes for the score of Rain Coming that [...] "... the complete collection [...] entitled [...] "Waterscape" ... it was the composer's intention to create a series of works, which like their subject, pass through various metamorphoses, culminating in a sea of tonality." [...] Throughout these works, the S-E-A motive (discussed further below) features prominently, and points to an increased emphasis on the melodic element in Takemitsu's music that began during this later period.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{recognizable}} {{feature of the}} school is the Big School (built in 1909), a building with pseudo Greco-Roman architecture fronted by a rugby field. The school is built to accommodate 100 students initially, but in 1910, there were 139 boys in the School Register, 124 of them boarders. Thus, the planning {{for the construction of}} the Preparatory School was considered and it was referred to as the Sekolah Kechil. The block was completed by 1913 when it took in its first boarders. It was then referred to as the Prep school. It admitted boys who had completed Standard 4 and were being [...] "prepared" [...] for secondary school boarding experience by completing their Standard 5 and Form Remove at the Prep School. In 1955, the West and East Wing, as well as the administration block and Clock Tower were added. The administrative block (New School) was opened by High Commissioner for the Federation of Malaya, Donald MacGillivray, in 1955. The West and the East Wing, with the Overflow, make up what is now called the Big School. Two more hostel blocks, the Pavilion and New Hostel were built in 1963 and 1972 respectively; the latter houses second former. Another prominent feature of the school is the Big Tree, a <b>rain</b> <b>tree</b> (Samanea saman) in front of the East Wing that is said to be as old as the school itself.|$|E
