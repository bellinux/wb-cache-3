2500|$|The {{anti-tank}} {{gate was}} a <b>rolling</b> <b>barrier</b> which slid from a slot in a fortified concrete housing {{along the side}} of the road, forming a barrier some meters from the post's blockhouse. The road and post occupied a narrow shelf between a cliff and a steep slope to the sea. The gate housing included two small arms ports, while the blockhouse could cover the gate and the road beyond with its guns firing through embrasures in the heavy concrete guardpost. [...] Tunnels in the cliff wall behind the post contained a magazine, living quarters, and an escape tunnel, like a Maginot ouvrage on a much smaller scale.|$|E
60|$|The deep {{breathing}} of {{the wind}} swept by them, but no human sound responded to his shout. They had already fallen, between two seas, into a deep vale of water, where the narrow view extended no farther than the dark and <b>rolling</b> <b>barriers</b> on either side.|$|R
2500|$|The {{prevention}} of escapes {{was a key}} priority at crossing points such as Marienborn. It {{was not possible to}} simply drive through the gap in the border fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle barriers mounted at chest height. These could (and did) kill drivers who attempted to ram through them. As a last resort, massive <b>rolling</b> <b>barriers</b> (Kraftfahrzeugschnellsperre) [...] long and weighing six tons apiece could be catapulted across the carriageway using hydraulic rams. They were capable of stopping a 50-ton truck travelling at [...] The guards at border crossings were, as elsewhere, authorised to use weapons to stop escape attempts.|$|R
5|$|It was not {{possible}} to simply drive through the gap in the fence that existed at crossing points, as the East Germans installed high-impact vehicle <b>barriers</b> and mobile <b>rolling</b> <b>barriers</b> that could (and did) kill drivers that attempted to ram them. Vehicles were subjected to rigorous checks to uncover fugitives. Inspection pits and mirrors allowed the undersides of vehicles to be scrutinised. Probes were used to investigate the chassis and even the fuel tank, where a fugitive might be concealed, and vehicles could be partially dismantled in on-site garages. At Marienborn there was even a mortuary garage where coffins could be checked to confirm that the occupants really were dead. Passengers were checked and often interrogated about their travel plans and reasons for travelling. The system used simple technology and was slow, relying largely on vast card indexes recording travellers' details, but it was effective nonetheless; during the 28years of operation of the Marienborn complex, no successful escapes were recorded.|$|R
25|$|The Casemate du Pont Saint Louis was an {{advanced}} defensive work supported by Cap Martin and manned by the 96th BAF. It {{was the only}} fortification directly on the seacoast, located at the frontier between France and Italy, and was intended to block any advance along the coastal road. The CORF-designed post was equipped with a <b>rolling</b> anti-tank <b>barrier,</b> a 37mm anti-tank gun, and two twin machine guns.|$|R
50|$|Bridge {{barrier is}} {{designed}} to restrain vehicles from crashing {{off the side of}} a bridge and falling onto the roadway, river or railroad below. It is usually higher than roadside barrier, to prevent trucks, buses, pedestrians and cyclists from vaulting or <b>rolling</b> over the <b>barrier</b> and falling {{over the side of the}} structure. Bridge rails are usually multi-rail tubular steel barriers or reinforced concrete parapets and barriers.|$|R
5000|$|Compared with Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec, {{graphics}} {{are greatly}} improved (despite {{running on the}} same PlayStation 2 hardware). The physics are also greatly improved, with the major upgrade that cars now experience body movement, such as pitching (forwards and backwards <b>rolling)</b> under braking. <b>Barriers</b> have considerably more friction {{to slow down the}} cars in GT4 (in an attempt to stop the use of [...] "wall riding"), but there is minimal friction between cars, so the advantage obtained by running into the side of another car (instead of braking) is still present. Each of the Driving Missions and Special Conditions events give a 5-second penalty for hitting the walls or opponents' cars in this way, where the car's speed is restricted to 50 km/h (31 mph) until the timer disappears when it reaches zero.|$|R
