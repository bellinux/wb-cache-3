5000|$|A crucial {{event in}} the {{political}} life of Serbia and in political publicist writing as well, was the St. Andrew's Assembly, which was held in Belgrade {{at the end of}} 1858. The battle of the bourgeoisie and liberal intelligentsia for constitutionality and parliamentarism started with it. After the Assembly two basic political streams were formed, the liberal and the conservative, which fought between themselves for influence among the people through the newspapers. Prince Milos, who was already growing old, occasionally supported liberals and occasionally conservatives, to finally come to rely on the conservatives. It is important that both sides had a chance to present their ideas and programme. The foundations of modern Serbian publicist writing were laid down in that short period(1859). The most eminent journalists were the writer Matija Ban, on the side of conservatives, and the politician Vladimir Jovanović, on the side of liberals. Danilo Medaković had to steer his newspapers between the two at times, not favouring one party over the other.Medaković's business continued to thrive and from 1859 onwards he conducted it mainly through his deputies, Jovan Đorđević, who took over the management of the newspaper [...] "Srpski dnevnik", and Platon Atanacković, who ran the printing and publishing end. Medakovic managed to obtain a renewal of his exclusive patent with <b>reversion</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> to his son Bogdan. Father and son lived in Belgrade until 1862 when he returned to Novi Sad. Danilo Medaković also had a house at Zagreb to which he retired in 1878, and there he died ten years later (1888). Though at one point, he contemplated leaving Zagreb. Greatly disturbed by the situation in Croatia, particularly by the anti-Serbian mood, the aged Danilo Medakovic, who had moved recently to Zagreb from Novi Sad {{to spend the rest of}} his days there, wrote to a friend on February 28, 1878:"The rabid feelings against the Serbs which have reached such a pitch here have gotten on my nerves so much so that I myself am considering moving away from here" [...] (cited in Đorđe Popović, [...] "Dr. Danilo Medaković", Otadzbina IX, No. 36, page 613).|$|E
5000|$|An {{outstanding}} {{figure in}} the printing trade {{towards the end of}} the sixteenth century was Christopher Barker, a shrewd businessman who managed to acquire the most lucrative of all patents, namely the Bible patent. Born around 1529, Barker was a wealthy member of the Drapers’ Company with powerful friends at court, for he was closely connected with the Walsingham family. He is thought to have been the grand nephew of Sir Christopher Barker, a former Garter King of Arms, which would explain his wealth, since the various properties of Sir Christopher ultimately passed into the possession of his nephew, Edward Barker, thought to have been the printer’s father.Barker became interested in the printing trade and is first heard of as a publisher in 1569. In 1576 he started on his career as a Bible printer, having obtained a privilege to print the Geneva version of the Bible in England. In 1577 he purchased from Sir Thomas Wilkes, Clerk of the Privy Council, an extensive patent which included the Old and New Testament in English, with or without notes, of any translation. The full patent granted to Barker the office of royal printer of all statutes, books, bills, Acts of Parliament, proclamations, injunctions, Bibles, and New Testaments, in the English tongue of any translation, all service books to be used in churches, and all other volumes ordered to be printed by the Queen or Parliament.Barker’s business continued to thrive and from 1588 onwards he conducted it mainly through his deputies, George Bishop and Ralph Newbery. On the disgrace of Wilkes in 1589, Barker managed to obtain a renewal of his exclusive patent with <b>reversion</b> <b>for</b> <b>life</b> to his son Robert. Father and son lived in London at Bacon House in Noble Street, Aldersgate. Christopher Barker also had a house at Datchet, to which he retired after 1588, and there he died in 1599. He and his deputies had supplied the country with about seventy editions of the Scriptures between 1575 and 1599 and they were accurate and well printed. He was succceeded in the post of royal printer by his son Robert.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} of transfers from workers to shareholders in the firm's decision to terminate their overfunded defined benefit pension plans. In contrast to earlier studies, I find evidence that firms terminate their pension plans to relieve themselves of implicit promises to workers of future compensation.

The period covers the restructuring and reform of the JSE in the early 2000 s {{to the end of}} global financial market crisis in late 2008 / 2009, which can be regarded as a complete economic cycle. The performances of the winner and loser portfolios are evaluated by assessing their cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) over a 24 -month holding period. The test results show no evidence of mean <b>reversion</b> <b>for</b> winner and loser portfolios formed based on prior returns of 12 months or less. However, test results show evidence of significant mean <b>reversion</b> <b>for</b> the winner and loser portfolios constructed based on their prior 24 months and 36 months returns. In addition, the study reveals that the mean reversion is more significant for longer-formation-period portfolios as well as for longer holding periods. The examination of the cumulative loser-winner spreads obtained from the contrarian portfolios based on the constituents’ prior 24 month and 36 month returns indicates that the contrarian returns increase for portfolios formed between 2004 and 2006, and declines thereafter {{towards the end of the}} examination period. The deterioration of contrarian returns coincides with the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 and the subsequent global financial crisis in 2008.
