40|$|International audienceTCAS <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> {{generation}} process during level-off {{situation is}} overviewed and illustrated {{on a real}} situation captured through mode S radar with RA downlink service. It underlines that one common type of <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> is that which is issued when aircraft are expected to level-off 1000 feet apart, and are converging at the same time. These <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories,</b> often subsequently classed as ?operationally unnecessary? from an air traffic control standpoint, can be perceived as disturbing by controllers and by pilots. This issue has been tackled in this paper by proposing a method to prevent RA triggering during level off situation. This method {{is based on the}} setting of the altitude at which the autopilot switches towards the altitude capture mode and on an intrinsic parameter of the autopilot altitude capture mode, namely its natural frequency. It is shown that applying the proposed method to the illustrative example prevents the issuance of <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> when aircraft are expected to level-off 1000 feet apart. The method which is presented is one of the simplest options, and allows altitude capture without triggering <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> for vertical speeds up to 3000 feet/min. Nevertheless, the time needed by the aircraft to capture the cleared flight level is increased. Consequently, future work will focus on improving the time needed to capture the cleared flight level under the constraint to keep positive the distance between the autopilot altitude capture dynamic and the boundary of the RA zone...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{pair-wise}} distributed conflict resolution strategy that resolves aircraft encounters in a provably safe coordinated way. In this approach, each aircraft independently computes {{a list of}} <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> based only on its state information and the state information of the traffic aircraft. Effective coordination between the two aircraft is achieved without communicating their intentions or negotiating a solution. The strategy is safe {{in the sense that}} the aircraft will not maneuver into each other while follow-ing their respective <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories.</b> Furthermore, the strategy will keep the aircraft separated even if only one aircraft maneuvers. This feature provides an additional layer of safety that mitigates potential conflicts when one aircraft does not maneuver due to equip-ment failure or other factors. The algorithm that implements the resolution strategy is not computationally intensive and is ideally suitable for distributed airborne deployment. The mathematical development has been formalized and mechanically verified in the Program Verification System (PVS). Low fidelity simulations have shown that the proposed approach is effective even in cases of multiple aircraft conflicts in a heavily crowded airspace. I...|$|R
5000|$|Aircraft {{performance}} {{in general and}} current performance capabilities in particular (due to active aircraft configuration) are not taken into account during the negotiation and creation of <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> (as {{it is the case}} for differences between different types of aircraft, e.g. turboprop/jet vs. helicopters), so that it is theoretically possible that <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> are issued that demand climb or sink rates outside the normal/safe flight envelope of an aircraft during a certain phase of flight (i.e. due to the aircraft's current configuration). Furthermore, as all traffic is being dealt with equally, there's no distinction taking place between different types of aircraft, neglecting the option of exploiting aircraft-specific (performance) information to issue customized and optimized instructions for any given traffic conflict (i.e. by issuing climb instructions to those aircraft that can provide the best climb rates, while issuing descend instructions to aircraft providing comparatively better sink rates, thereby hopefully maximizing altitude change per time unit, that is separation). As an example, TCAS can order an aircraft to climb when it is already at its service ceiling for its current configuration.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{demonstrate}} a high-level approach to modeling and analyzing complex safety-critical systems through {{a case study}} in the area of air traffic management. In particular, we focus our attention on the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) [11, 12]; an on-board conflict detection and resolution system which alerts pilots to the presence of nearby aircraft that pose a mid-air collision threat and issues conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories.</b> Due to the complexity of the TCAS software and the hybrid nature of the closed-loop system, the traditional testing techniques through simulation do not constitute a viable verification approach. To aid people in analyzing and designing such systems, we advocate defining high-level mathematical system models that capture the behavior not only of the software, but also of the airplanes, sensors, and pilots— that is, high-level hybrid system models. In particular, we show how the core components of this complex system can be captured by relatively simple Hybrid I/O Automata (HIOA) [9, 10], which are amenable to formal analysis. We then outline a methodology for establishing conditions under which the conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories</b> issued by TCAS guarantee sufficient separation in altitude for aircraft involved in mid-air collision threats. Although our results are intended only as illustrations of high-level modeling and analysis techniques, the TCAS system models provide a foundation for study {{of a wide range of}} properties of the system’s behavior...|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{designated}} TCAS II Enhanced, TCAS III was envisioned as {{an expansion}} of the TCAS II concept to include horizontal <b>resolution</b> <b>advisory</b> capability. TCAS III was the [...] "next generation" [...] of collision avoidance technology which underwent development by aviation companies such as Honeywell. TCAS III incorporated technical upgrades to the TCAS II system, and had the capability to offer traffic advisories and resolve traffic conflicts using horizontal as well as vertical manouevring directives to pilots. For instance, in a head-on situation, one aircraft might be directed, [...] "turn right, climb" [...] while the other would be directed [...] "turn right, descend." [...] This would act to further increase the total separation between aircraft, in both horizontal and vertical aspects. Horizontal directives would be useful in a conflict between two aircraft close to the ground where there may be little if any vertical maneuvering space.|$|E
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{efficiency}} of free flight will benefit from automated conflict prediction and <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories.</b> Conflict prediction is based on trajectory prediction and is less certain the farther in advance the prediction, however. An estimate is therefore needed of {{the probability that a}} conflict will occur, given a pair of predicted trajectories and their levels of uncertainty. This paper presents a method to estimate that conflict probability. The trajectory prediction errors are modeled as normally distributed, and the two error covariances for an aircraft pair are combined into a single, equivalent covariance of the relative position. A coordinate transformation is then used to derive an analytical solution. Numerical examples and a Monte Carlo validation are presented...|$|R

50|$|The {{accident}} {{raised questions}} on how pilots must react when they receive conflicting {{orders from the}} TCAS and from air traffic control (ATC). TCAS was a relatively new technology {{at the time of}} the accident, having been mandatory in Europe since 2000. When the TCAS issues a <b>resolution</b> <b>advisory</b> (RA), the pilot flying should respond immediately by direct attention to RA displays and maneuver as indicated, unless doing so would jeopardize the safe operation of the flight, or unless the flight crew can assure separation with the help of definitive visual acquisition of the aircraft causing the RA. In responding to a TCAS RA that directs a deviation from assigned altitude, the flight crew should communicate with ATC as soon as practicable after responding to the RA. When the RA is removed, the flight crew should advise ATC that they are returning to their previously assigned clearance or should acknowledge any amended clearance issued.|$|E

40|$|Continuing {{demand for}} the use of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) has put {{increasing}} pressure on operations in civil airspace. The need to fly UAS in the National Airspace System (NAS) in order to perform missions vital to national security and defense, emergency management, and science is increasing at a rapid pace. In order to ensure safe operations in the NAS, operators of unmanned aircraft, like those of manned aircraft, may be required to maintain separation assurance and avoid loss of separation with other aircraft while performing their mission tasks. This experiment investigated the effects of varying levels of automation on UAS operator performance and workload while responding to conflict resolution instructions provided by the Tactical Collision Avoidance System II (TCAS II) during a UAS mission in high-density airspace. The {{purpose of this study was}} not to investigate the safety of using TCAS II on UAS, but rather to examine the effect of automation on the ability of operators to respond to traffic collision alerts. Six licensed pilots were recruited to act as UAS operators for this study. Operators were instructed to follow a specified mission flight path, while maintaining radio contact with Air Traffic Control and responding to TCAS II <b>resolution</b> <b>advisories.</b> Operators flew four, 45 minute, experimental missions with four different levels of automation: Manual, Knobs, Management by Exception, and Fully Automated. All missions included TCAS II <b>Resolution</b> <b>Advisories</b> (RAs) that required operator attention and rerouting. Operator compliance and reaction time to RAs was measured, and post-run NASA-TLX ratings were collected to measure workload. Results showed significantly higher compliance rates, faster responses to TCAS II alerts, as well as less preemptive operator actions when higher levels of automation are implemented. Physical and Temporal ratings of workload were significantly higher in the Manual condition than in the Management by Exception and Fully Automated conditions...|$|R
