500|$|Larter {{appeared}} in Glamour along with fellow actresses Rachel Bilson and Diane Lane in 2007. When {{asked if she}} still wishes she had the same body she had at 20 she replied, [...] "No. I actually think I look better now because I feel so much better about myself now. And that's what's so exciting. As you get older, you get better.... Look at all these incredible women, like Vanessa Redgrave, who are still so beautiful. The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> they embrace who they are." [...] She has appeared {{on the covers of}} Shape, Cosmopolitan, Allure, Glamour, Lucky, InStyle, Maxim and Entertainment Weekly.|$|E
500|$|A {{large portion}} of the episode was based on the ancient {{astronaut}} theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received, {{despite the fact that the}} [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" [...] story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But we rarely do. And the <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side with respect." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were later revisited in the two season nine episodes [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially {{slated for}} a March 2, 2012 release, {{the film was}} pushed by Paramount Pictures to a ten-month delay for January 11, 2013. Co-producer Kevin Messick later said: [...] "We’d {{finished}} it but we were still discussing adding a coda scene, which {{we were able to}} shoot. And there was always the consideration that Jeremy [...] had Avengers and Bourne coming out. So the studio made a wise strategic move in finding a good release date for us." [...] Wirkola said that [...] "the main <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> they wanted to wait on Jeremy. He was cast before , Bourne and The Avengers. They wanted to wait until after those. I was, of course, disappointed then, but actually it helped because we came in under budget" [...] and so the delay enabled him to re-add and shoot an additional scene that is set in the desert and which was cut from his original screenplay. The first trailer for the film was released on September 5, 2012.|$|E
5000|$|The RD580 was codenamed [...] "Manta". The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> {{of the use}} of {{aquarium}} fishes for codenames within ATI.|$|R
60|$|Bun. So I proceeded, and said, My first <b>reason</b> <b>was,</b> <b>because</b> it <b>was</b> not {{commanded}} in the Word of God, {{and therefore}} I could not use it.|$|R
60|$|M. Belloc {{said the}} <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> there <b>was</b> in it more genuine faith {{than in any}} book. And we {{branched}} off into florid eloquence touching paganism, Christianity, and art.|$|R
500|$|The {{portions}} of the episode about the alien shard and Mulder's telepathic abilities allude to the ancient astronaut theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings visited Earth and made contact with humans in antiquity or prehistory. Spotnitz was surprised that the show received few complaints, even though the [...] "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"Amor Fati" [...] story arc heavily suggested that aliens developed the notions of God and religion. He praised {{the manner in which}} the show handled this subject, saying, [...] "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But we rarely do. And the <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side [...] with respect." [...] Spotnitz later identified the combination of science and religion as [...] "a conjunction of science and mysticism, of aliens and religion, that we're starting to develop. It's deliberate on our part, to help bring all the mythologies together into one story line." [...] The ancient astronaut themes were revisited in two season nine episodes: [...] "Provenance" [...] and [...] "Providence".|$|E
2500|$|In 2017 he {{was asked}} if he {{believed}} in destiny. Alonso replied [...] "I believe things happen because they have to happen. All the things that happen in a race or happen in a championship or in your life, there is maybe a reason behind. And that <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> better times are coming, and I prefer to think that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chris Hutchins, a biographer of Putin, {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} the Russian president and Abramovich as like that between a father and a favorite son. Abramovich himself says that when he addresses Putin he uses the Russian language's formal [...] "Вы" [...] (like Spanish [...] "usted", German [...] "Sie", Italian [...] "lei" [...] or French [...] "vous"), as opposed to the informal [...] "ты" [...] (Spanish [...] "tú", German [...] "du", Italian [...] "tu" [...] or French [...] "tu"). Abramovich says that the <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> 'he is more senior than me'. Within the Kremlin, Abramovich is referred to as [...] "Mr A".|$|E
30|$|Devin: Oh, Nordstrom! It’s by far my favorite, {{and one of}} the <b>reasons</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{they carry}} unique items. Their {{customer}} service is at a level that I wouldn’t mind paying full price for some items.|$|R
60|$|A third <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> {{the sight}} of the Honorable Freddie had {{reminded}} her that R. Jones had said he had written her poetry. That thought, too, had contributed toward the smile which so dazzled Ashe.|$|R
50|$|Samnang Samnang stopped writing around 2014. This {{was due to}} her {{not being}} able to get a {{publishing}} deal that would allow her to write for Khmer readers. Another <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of problems with copyright violations.|$|R
2500|$|Formulaic {{language}} {{is more likely}} to occur at the beginning of utterance or phrase and the <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> it is presumed that there is a greater demand on planning processes at these junctures. Features of formulaic language, like filled pauses or repetitions, are most likely to occur immediately prior to the onset of a complex syntactic constituent. Filled pauses are also likely after the initial word in a complex constituent, especially after function words. Therefore, listeners might {{be able to use the}} presence of a recent filled pause to predict that an ambiguous structure, and this trait is in favor of a more complex analysis [...]|$|E
2500|$|As for why the {{complete}} 538 polling database {{had not been}} released publicly, Silver responded: [...] "The principal <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> I don't know that I'm legally entitled to do so. The polling database was compiled from approximately eight or ten distinct data sources, which were disclosed in a comment which I posted shortly after the pollster ratings were released, and which are detailed again {{at the end of}} this article. These include some subscription services, and others from websites that are direct competitors of this one. Although polls contained in these databases are ultimately a matter of the public record and clearly we feel as though we have every right to use them for research purposes, I don't know what rights we might have to re-publish their data in full".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Joint Forces Command, then {{caretaker}} of U.S. Military Joint Warfighting doctrine, {{noted the}} failure of US Army's Theater EBO software development and issued memorandum and a guidance documents from then commander, Marine General James Mattis, on Effects Based Operations. In these documents dated 14 August 2008 Mattis said, [...] "Effective immediately, USJFCOM will no longer use, sponsor or export the terms and concepts related to EBO...in our training, doctrine development and support of JPME (Joint Professional Military Education)." [...] Mattis went on to say, [...] "...we must recognize that the term [...] "effects-based" [...] is fundamentally flawed, has far too many interpretations and {{is at odds with}} the very nature of war to the point it expands confusion and inflates a sense of predictability far beyond that which it can be expected to deliver." [...] The Mattis directive did not distinguish between various versions of EBO within the United States military, but it did state that the memorandum does not address the NATO version of EBO--implying that the <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> [...] "NATO's policy focuses on the whole of government/Comprehensive Approach. Since the release of the Mattis EBO memo, he has reportedly indicated that the intent was not to make an assessment of the Air Force version of EBO, so the critical assessment seems to be levied against a brand of EBO taught by his command.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2017 {{more than}} 100 female journalists, female politicians, actresses {{and other women}} called for an {{advertisement}} boycott of geenstijl. The stated <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of the sex fantasies, some violent that appear in the comments section.|$|R
50|$|Models {{presented}} in 2008 showed the VHS being STANAG magazine compatible. This was changed shortly after to accept HK G36 magazines. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the Croatian military has more G36s (which the VHS will replace) than M16-type rifles.|$|R
50|$|In the end, {{whether or}} not it was due to the {{direction}} described, this tank was not selected for production. Perhaps the greater <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of the Chi-Ha being selected two years prior and it was already advancing in production.|$|R
60|$|Your last <b>reason</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> of 'several {{untoward}} opinions,' {{the gospel}} is very unsuccessful (p. 174).|$|E
60|$|I. Mas. The <b>reason</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> {{you know}} she does not regard you enough to appear, if you awaked her.|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN: Here's {{another for}} you. (He frowns) The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> the {{fundamental}} and the dominant {{are separated by}} the greatest possible interval which...|$|E
5000|$|The album {{failed to}} chart in the United States, {{shifting}} only 35,000 units despite its [...] "slick, arena-friendly rock sound", which Simon Price <b>reasoned</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of {{the arrival of}} bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden as the [...] "new rock-megastar elite".|$|R
5000|$|After placing 6th at the 1984 Olympia, the IFBB {{suspended}} him {{for three}} years as punishment for his participation at the World Championship competition of a rival federation, the WABBA. (The real <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Samir had an argument {{with one of the}} officials over mistreatment.) ...|$|R
25|$|The Rest House {{has been}} in debates many times {{over whether or not}} it should be preserved. In 1995, the city decided to {{demolish}} the building, but the plan was put aside. One of the <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> of the announcement of the A-bomb Dome as a World Heritage site.|$|R
60|$|Pala. Well, madam, I am convinced, that 'tis {{best for}} {{us not to}} have enjoyed; but, gad, the strongest <b>reason</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> I can't help it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is foolish of me," [...] she remarked. [...] "You {{will think}} so too, when I {{tell you that}} my only <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> of a likeness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (5.) A fifth <b>reason</b> <b>is,</b> <b>because</b> God {{would have}} by the Publican's {{conversion}} others affected with the displays and discoveries of wonderful grace, {{but not to}} cloud and cover it with lessening of sin.|$|E
50|$|From 1932 {{until its}} {{abolition}} in 1965, the Municipal Borough of Barnes in London used feathers {{based on those}} of the Prince of Wales on its coat of arms. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the then Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII and Duke of Windsor) {{was born in the}} borough.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the poor}} reception, Bally/Midway {{considered}} canceling the game altogether, but the game was given a second chance for two reasons. The first one <b>was</b> <b>because</b> the game's creator Jack Haeger had already spent {{so much of the}} budget on the clay animation and the second <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> one of the testers suggested to make it into a Pac-Man-like game.|$|R
25|$|The out of Asia theory later {{fell into}} decline, {{one of the}} <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Franz Weidenreich merged the Asia {{hypothesis}} into the multiregional origin of modern humans, extending many other regions into his theory from the Old World with gene flow between various populations which influenced many anthropologists of the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> {{it comes}} from the rocks. Barberry thought it best to keep on the rocks, I suppose. Maybe he thought he would get stuck in the mud with the cases if he got on soft ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] {{retorted}} Grandfather Frog. [...] "The <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> he doesn't fly. He hasn't any wings. What he does do is {{to coast}} on the air. He's the greatest jumper and coaster in the Green Forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “This very case {{shows that}} it is reasonable. Here you want to plant a part before you have got the ground prepared. The real <b>reason</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> you are tired of digging; not because you are really of opinion {{that that would be}} a better plan. You have not the means of judging whether it is, or is not, now, time to begin to put in seeds.” ...|$|E
50|$|On July 1, 2008, WNNJ-FM officially {{changed its}} call letters to WNNJ. The <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> 1360 WNNJ {{modified}} its format and changed its call letters to WTOC. Because the FM station no longer shared call letters with an AM station, FM {{will no longer}} be part of the call letters for 103.7.|$|R
50|$|On 26 May 26, 1853, Frederick married Alexandra's first cousin, Princess Anna of Prussia (1836-1918), at Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin. Although {{they had}} six {{children}} together, Frederick and Anna were never emotionally close, {{and it is}} speculated that one <b>reason</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Fritz <b>was</b> unable to overcome his grief for his first wife.|$|R
50|$|The out of Asia theory later {{fell into}} decline, {{one of the}} <b>reasons</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> Franz Weidenreich merged the Asia {{hypothesis}} into the multiregional origin of modern humans, extending many other regions into his theory from the Old World with gene flow between various populations which influenced many anthropologists of the time.|$|R
