Among these diseases, arthropod transmitted ones are major threats to the health of man and animals, and play an important role in the world economy [1]. The pathogens involved include parasites, such as Plas-modium or lymphatic filariosis, and arboviruses, like chi-kungunya, dengue, <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley,</b> yellow <b>fever,</b> Japanese Encephalitis and West Nile viruses. Traditional means of controlling the spread of arbovirus infections include the vaccination of susceptible vertebrates and mosquito control. However, in many cases such measures are either unavail-able or ineffective. To successfully implement a strategy to block the virus at the insect stage, further knowledge of virus/vector interactions is required. Studies in this fiel...|$|R

25|$|Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola virus disease, Lassa fever virus, <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>fever,</b> Marburg {{virus and}} Bolivian hemorrhagic fever are highly {{contagious}} and deadly diseases, with the theoretical {{potential to become}} pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector, and the vector only has a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly quarantine vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first issue}} {{contained}} a broad mix of research including papers on bacteriophages, the plant viruses, tobacco mosaic and potato virus X, {{and the animal}} viruses, influenza, <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> <b>fever</b> and poliovirus. Authors included Renato Dulbecco, Alfred Hershey, Raymond Latarjet, André Michel Lwoff and Marguerite Vogt, among others. The journal had an international authorship from the start, with authors from the United States and France, two major centres of phage research at that date, as well as Japan. The early content was biased towards virus structure and replication, which made up two-thirds of the content in the mid-1960s, but have gradually been replaced by research into pathogenesis, immunity and interactions with the host cell, which made up {{more than two-thirds of}} the journal in 1999. The early journal was particularly known for publishing research into plant viruses. Wagner writes [...] "our competitor, Virology, had emphasized plant viruses to such a degree that this area had become a paramount part of their publishing effort and most plant virologists looked upon Virology as their journal." [...] This focus changed over time, and by 1999, animal viruses were the subject of over 88% of the journal's content.|$|E

40|$|An {{asymmetric}} tectonic fabric was delineated by narrow-beam bathymetric {{profiles in}} a 180 -km 2 {{area of the}} Mid-Atlantic Ridge crest at lat 26 °N. Features of the tectonic fabric are a continuous <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> offset by small (< 10 -km) transform faults and minor fracture zones expressed as valleys with intervening ridges that trend normal and oblique to {{the two sides of}} the <b>rift</b> <b>valley.</b> The discharge zone of a postulated sub-sea-floor hydrothermal convection system is focused by faults on the southeast wall of the <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> and driven by intrusive heat sources beneath the <b>rift</b> <b>valley.</b> The <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> has a double structure consisting of linear segments, bounded by ridges, and basins at the intersections of the minor fracture zones. The double structure of the <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> acts like a template that programs the reproduction of the tectonic fabric. The minor fracture zones form an asymmetric V about the <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> at variance with the symmetric small circles formed by major fracture zones. To reconcile the asymmetry of minor fracture zones with the symmetry of major fracture zones, it is proposed that the minor fracture zones have been preferentially reoriented by an external stress field attributed to interplate and intraplate motions. Major fracture zones remain symmetric under the same stress field owing to differential stability between minor and major structures of oceanic lithosphere...|$|R
