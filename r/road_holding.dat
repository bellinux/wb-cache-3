5|$|The squad {{turned in}} a decent ride in the stage 2 team time trial, {{finishing}} ninth of 22 teams. The result installed Vinokourov into 27th place, 32 seconds off the race lead. Vinokourov took third in stage 4 on the Mûr-de-Bretagne, one of only ten riders to finish together {{at the front of}} the race. He moved up six places to 18th with this result. In stage 8 on Super Besse, Vinokourov and 's Juan Antonio Flecha put in an attack that constituted a clear bid to take the yellow jersey. Starting the day 32 seconds back of race leader Thor Hushovd, Vinokourov surged past Flecha and all remaining members of the morning breakaway other than eventual stage winner Rui Costa. He occupied second position on the <b>road,</b> <b>holding</b> a sufficient time gap that he could take the race leadership, until he was reabsorbed by the depleted front peloton and finished at the back of that group. The result did, however, move Vinokourov up to 11th.|$|E
2500|$|The {{swinging}} {{arms are}} mounted with large bearings to [...] "cross tubes" [...] that run {{side to side}} across the chassis; combined {{with the effects of}} all-independent soft springing and excellent damping, keeps the road wheels in contact with the road surface and parallel to each other across the axles at high angles of body roll. A larger than conventional steering castor angle, ensures that the front wheels are closer to vertical than the rears, when cornering hard with a lot of body roll. The soft springing, long suspension travel and the use of leading and trailing arms means that as the body rolls during cornering the wheelbase {{on the inside of the}} corner increases while the wheelbase on the outside of the corner decreases. As the corning forces put more of the car's weight on the inside pair of wheels the wheelbase extends in proportion, keeping the car's weight balance and centre of grip constant. promoting excellent <b>road</b> <b>holding.</b> The other key factor in the quality of its <b>road</b> <b>holding</b> is the very low and forward centre of gravity, provided by the position of the engine and transmission.|$|E
2500|$|Popular Science, in a four-car road test, {{considered}} the Premier {{one of the}} sportiest sedans (by measure of <b>road</b> <b>holding</b> and drive precision) available on the American market.

[...] "The Premier was for its size, the lightest car that Chrysler built at the time , the stiffest (torsionally), and the best riding almost [...] of wheel travel vs. 4.5 for the K-cars that underpinned every Chrysler car then available. It benefited from decades of Renault experience with front-wheel-drive, and a good example will still impress even today." [...] The engineering levels achieved in the Premier are arguably the most refined in a sedan that was then produced by AMC or Chrysler.|$|E

2500|$|Archduke Charles {{had already}} made {{preparations}} for a French attack, occupying the strategic village of Caldiero, through which passed the main Lombardian road ('the Verona road') and deploying no less than 58 cannons and 24 mortars. The Austrian forces were divided into three main groups: to the right, Joseph Anton Freiherr von Simbschen occupied the heights of Colognola and the ravine of San Zeno, where his cavalry was massed; in the centre, General Count Heinrich von Bellegarde covered the Verona <b>road,</b> <b>holding</b> the entrenchments north of the road as well as Monte Rocca and Ponterotta, {{to the south of}} the road; the left was formed by Prince Heinrich XV of Reuss-Plauen's forces, which extended the Austrian line to Chiavighette and had the detached division of General Joseph Armand von Nordmann cover the Adige in front of Chiavica del Christo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{new body}} for 1970 added inches and pounds to the Torino. All cars grew by about [...] in length, and now rode on a [...] {{wheelbase}} (station wagons used a [...] wheelbase). The wheel track was widened , {{to help the}} Torino improve its <b>road</b> <b>holding</b> abilities. Although the track was widened, the suspension remained unchanged from the 1969 models. Weight was up for most models by at least [...] The competition suspension and heavy-duty suspension packages remained as options. The competition suspension package featured extra-heavy-duty front and rear springs ( [...] per inch front, and [...] per inch rear), Gabriel shocks (rear shocks staggered on 4-speed cars), and a large 0.95" [...] front sway bar (0.75" [...] standard on other suspensions). In a 1970 Motor Trend test of a Torino Cobra, Motor Trend described the competition suspension as [...] "completely different: The car goes through tight turns in a confidence-inspiring controlled slide. It's all very smooth and unusual." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspension}} also automatically accommodates differing payloads in the car- {{with four}} people and cargo {{on board the}} wheelbase increases by around 4cm (2in) as the suspension deflects, and the castor angle of the front wheels increases {{by as much as}} 8 degrees thus ensuring that ride quality, handling and <b>road</b> <b>holding</b> are almost unaffected by the additional weight. On early cars friction dampers (like a dry version of a multi-plate clutch design) were fitted at the mountings of the front and rear swinging arms to the cross-tubes. Because the rear brakes were outboard, they had extra tuned mass dampers to damp wheel bounce from the extra unsprung mass. Later models had tuned mass dampers ("batteurs") at the front (because the leading arm had more inertia and [...] "bump/thump" [...] than the trailing arm), with hydraulic telescopic dampers / shock absorbers front and rear. The uprated hydraulic damping obviated the need for the rear inertia dampers. It was designed to be a comfortable ride by matching the frequencies encountered in human bipedal motion.|$|E

2500|$|For 1960 while Enzo Ferrari {{adopted a}} {{conservative}} attitude, claiming [...] "the horses pull the car rather than push it." [...] It was probably disinformation: {{at the same}} time Ferrari was preparing for 1961 by designing mid-engined F2 and F1 cars. The Italian front-engined red cars were not only being effectively beaten by the British teams, but thoroughly outclassed- the British rear mid-engined cars had considerably better <b>road</b> <b>holding</b> than the front-engined cars. Although down on power, the British cars' superior handling and lesser demands on tires more than made up the power deficit. It was obvious to everyone that rear-mid engined cars were the way to go at that point in time. Lotus and BRM introduced mid-engined machines. Walker's team switched to a Lotus 18 chassis. Moss gave Lotus its first Formula One victory at Monaco but his season was ruined by a serious crash at Spa, Belgium. Brabham took a second title with his Cooper, but Moss returned in time to win the final race of the season, the U.S. Grand Prix at Riverside, California.|$|E

60|$|At short distances--and {{they were}} entirely too short--all along the road, were groups of neat and comely children, with their wares nicely and temptingly {{set forth in}} the grass under the shade trees, and as soon as we {{approached}} they swarmed into the <b>road,</b> <b>holding</b> out their baskets and milk bottles, and ran beside the carriage, barefoot and bareheaded, and importuned us to buy. They seldom desisted early, but continued to run and insist--beside the wagon while they could, and behind it until they lost breath. Then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their trading-post again. After several hours of this, without any intermission, it becomes almost annoying. I do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit. However, there were plenty of these, loaded with dusty tourists and piled high with luggage. Indeed, from Lucerne to Interlaken we had the spectacle, among other scenery, of an unbroken procession of fruit-peddlers and tourists carriages.|$|E
