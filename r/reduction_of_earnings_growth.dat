40|$|Abstract. Any {{economic}} {{transition to}} a market economy involves labor market reforms. These labor market reforms can include higher returns to human capital as well as an increased willingness to make human capital investments. To separate these two effects we use stochastic frontier analysis to obtain a latent efficiency measure. Using data from China, our decomposition results suggest that approximately 60 percent of the total change in earnings is the result of greater labor market efficiencies, 20 percent <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> can be attributed to higher levels of human capital, and 20 percent <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> can be attributed to exogenous change...|$|R

We also show that errors in CFO expectations <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> are predictable from past earnings and other data, pointing to extrapolative structure of expectations and suggesting that expectations may not be rational. This evidence, like earlier findings in finance, points to the usefulness of data on actual expectations for understanding economic behavior...|$|R

When private information is one-dimensional (for example when short-term earnings are common knowledge while long-term earnings are private information) a separating equilibrium does not exist. When private information is two-dimensional a separating equilibrium may exist where firms with a higher rate <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> issue debt and firms with a low rate <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> issue equity.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the cross-sectional {{implications of the}} inflation illusion hypothesis for the post-earnings-announcement drift. The inflation illusion hypothesis suggests that stock market investors fail to incorporate inflation in forecasting future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> rates, and this causes firms whose <b>earnings</b> <b>growths</b> are positively (negatively) related to inflation to be undervalued (overvalued). We argue and show that the sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> to inflation varies monotonically across stocks sorted on standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) and, consistent with the inflation illusion hypothesis, show that lagged inflation predicts future <b>earnings</b> <b>growth,</b> abnormal returns, and <b>earnings</b> announcement returns <b>of</b> SUE-sorted stocks. Interestingly, controlling for the return predictive ability of inflation weakens the ability of lagged SUE to predict future returns of SUE-sorted stocks.

40|$|Between 1980 and {{the early}} 1990 s the {{variability}} <b>of</b> labor <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> rates across the prime-age working population fell significantly. This decline and timing are consistent with other macro and micro observations about growth variability that are collectively {{referred to as the}} "Great Moderation. " The variability <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> is negatively correlated with age at any point in time, and the U. S. working age population got older during this period because the Baby Boom was aging. However, the decrease in variability was roughly uniform across all age groups, so population aging is not the source of the overall decline. The variance of log changes also declined at multi-year frequencies {{in such a way as}} to suggest that both permanent and transitory components <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> shocks became more moderate. A simple identification strategy for separating age and cohort effects shows a very intuitive pattern of permanent and transitory shocks over the life cycle, and confirms that a shift over time in the stochastic process occurred even after controlling for age effects.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{voluntary}} disclosure and dividends signal future earnings for decline <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> firms. It seeks to inform regulators (and managers) about the potential benefits of increased disclosure and increased dividends to investors for firms that suffer an earnings decline after a sustained period <b>of</b> annual <b>earnings</b> <b>growth.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The event study methodology is used to examine the behaviour of 33 non-financial UK firms after a decline <b>of</b> their sustained <b>earnings</b> <b>growth.</b> It also uses the computerised content analysis to count the number of forward-looking sentences in the annual report narratives. It calculates changes in disclosure and dividends in the year <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> declines and examine their association with the abnormal future earnings. Findings – Consistent with prior research, it is found that increasing dividends does not convey value relevant information about future earnings for decline <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> firms. However, based on disclosure signalling theory, it is found that increasing levels of forward-looking information in annual report narratives is an important mechanism for signalling future earnings for these firms. Practical implications – For an effective communication with the stock market in the years <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> decline after sustained period of growth, managers should give high priority to developing an appropriate and complete set of forward-looking information in their annual reports. This will enable investors to better anticipate firms' future prospects. The results suggest that if forward-looking statements in annual report narratives contain value relevant information for investors, then regulators should consider a compulsory narrative section (i. e. operating and financial review) in the annual report. Originality/value – This paper is the first to study the value relevance of voluntary disclosure for decline <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> firms.

40|$|Abstract We use {{residual}} income (RI) to decompose <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> into growth in RI, growth in invested capital and other components and use this decomposition to explain stock returns. Our approach provides {{a significant increase}} in explanatory power vis-à-vis a regression of returns on levels and changes in earnings. While the market values growth in RI more than growth in invested capital, it still undervalues growth in RI and overvalues growth in invested capital. Earnings growth from growth in RI is more persistent, while <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> from growth in invested capital is more likely to reverse. Future returns are positively associated with growth in RI and negatively associated with growth in invested capital. A trading rule based on these findings generates significant hedge returns that persist after controlling for known risk factors. Hence, RI, a measure long recommended by accountants, allows investors to differentiate and evaluate different sources <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Prior {{research}} shows that firms generating <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> by improving profitability create shareholder value, while firms generating <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> through investment destroy value. This paper examines whether compensation committees consider this while determining CEO compensation. We first confirm prior results that growth from increased profitability is perceived by markets to add value while growth from investment does not. While growth from increased profitability is positively associated with compensation, so is growth from investment. The presence of institutional ownership increases the weight on growth from increased profitability, but does not reduce the weight on growth from investment. Further, value-oriented institutional ownership increases the sensitivity of compensation growth to growth from increased profitability and reduces the sensitivity to growth from investment. Contrarily, growth-oriented institutional ownership increases the sensitivity of compensation growth to growth from investment. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the nature <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> <b>growth</b> in determining executive compensation...|$|R
