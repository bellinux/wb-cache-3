5|$|In August 2016, the US {{government}} granted {{permission to}} US-based start-up Moon Express {{to land on}} the Moon. This marked {{the first time that a}} private enterprise was given the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The decision is regarded as a precedent helping to define regulatory standards for deep-space commercial activity in the future, as thus far companies' operation had been restricted to being on or around Earth.|$|E
5|$|The enpassant capture {{must be made}} on {{the very}} next turn or the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so is lost. Like any other move, if an enpassant capture is the only legal move available, it must be played. En passant capture is a common theme in chess compositions.|$|E
5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} Schengen Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi if they tried to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E

5|$|In the serial, the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and {{his companions}} Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) are {{travelling}} back {{to the space station}} via transmat beam from a previous story to return to the TARDIS, when they are intercepted by the Doctor's race, the Time Lords, and are directed to Skaro to the time of the Daleks' creation.

5|$|Sir James Shaw, 1st Baronet (26 August 1764 – 22 October 1843), became Lord Mayor of London in 1805. From humble {{beginnings}} in a farming {{family in}} Ayrshire, {{he became a}} successful merchant and politician; he was a relation of Robert Burns and used his wealth to support Burns's orphaned children. As Lord Mayor of London, he led the funeral procession of Lord Nelson in 1806, having established his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so and was created baronet twice, in 1809 and 1813. While later Chamberlain of London, he almost lost his own fortune due to injudicious investments, and died, exonerated, in 1843.|$|E
5|$|The Killigrews {{controlled}} the castle for several decades, with John Killigrew's son and grandson continuing in turn as the captain there until 1605. The captains of Pendennis frequently argued {{with those of}} St Mawes and in 1630 a legal dispute broke out about the rights to search and detain incoming shipping: both castles argued {{that they had a}} traditional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The Admiralty eventually issued a compromise, proposing that the castles share the searching of the traffic.|$|E

5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} two squares {{from its}} starting position {{and there is}} an opponent's pawn on an adjacent file next to its destination square, then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant (in passing), and move to the square the pawn passed over. This can only be done on the very next move, otherwise the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so is forfeit. For example, in the animated diagram, the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5, and the white pawn on f5 can take it via en passant on g6 (but only on White's next move).|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Toy Story 2 in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen's {{agreement}} that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement, despite their own <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. After the two companies were unable {{to agree on a}} new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan move forward on sequels with/without Pixar, and put Toy Story 3 into pre-production at Disney's new CGI division Circle 7 Animation. However, when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following the 2006 merger of the companies, he put all sequels on hold and Toy Story 3 was cancelled. In May 2006, it was announced that Toy Story 3 was back in pre-production with a new plot and under Pixar's control. The film was released on June 18, 2010, as Pixar's eleventh feature film.|$|E
5|$|Madzimbamuto petitioned for {{the right}} to appeal against his {{detention}} to the Privy Council in London; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway. It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution, and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Elinder Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice JR Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies's ruling on 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana. Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974.|$|E

5|$|Russell replaces Mill's {{analysis}} with {{an examination of}} the issue from four perspectives: the perspective of the governor, the citizen, the innovator, and the philosopher. The rational governor is always threatened by revolutionary activities, and can always be expected to ban speech which calls for assassination. Yet the governor would be advised to allow freedom of speech to prevent and diminish discontent among the subjects, and has no reason to suppress ideas which are unrelated to his governance, for instance the Copernican doctrine of heliocentrism. Relatedly, the citizen mainly understands free speech {{as an extension of the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> peaceably that which could only otherwise be done through violence (Russell 1938:179–182).|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} of the strong Mexican resistance to his proposed modifications, Webster instructed Letcher to negotiate the most favorable terms to which the Mexicans would agree. On January 25, 1851, Letcher signed a second treaty that was slightly more favorable to the Americans. During the time it had taken both sides to negotiate the treaty, however, public sentiment in Mexico had turned decidedly against any form of treaty with the United States regarding Tehuantepec. On May 22, 1851, the Mexican government declared the agreement with the American investors null on grounds that the provisional government which granted {{it did not have}} the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Letcher attempted to negotiate a new treaty to re-acquire the rights nullified by the Mexican government, but by February 14, 1852, he reported that he did not expect to be able to reach any kind of agreement. He returned home in August 1852.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Æthelheard died in 805 and was {{succeeded by}} Wulfred. Wulfred was given freedom to mint coins {{that did not}} name Coenwulf on the reverse, {{probably}} indicating that Wulfred was on good terms with the Mercian king. In 808 there was evidently a rift of some kind: a letter from Pope Leo to Charlemagne mentioned that Coenwulf had not yet made peace with Wulfred. After this no further discord is mentioned until 816, when Wulfred presided over a council which attacked lay control of religious houses. The council, held at Chelsea, asserted that Coenwulf {{did not have the}} right to make appointments to nunneries and monasteries, although both Leo and his predecessor, Pope Hadrian I, had granted Offa and Coenwulf the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. Coenwulf had recently appointed his daughter, Cwoenthryth, to the position of abbess of Minster-in-Thanet. Leo died in 816, and his successor, Stephen IV, died the following January; the new pope, Paschal I confirmed Coenwulf's privileges but this did not end the dispute. In 817 Wulfred witnessed two charters in which Coenwulf granted land to Deneberht, bishop of Worcester, but there is no further record of Wulfred acting as archbishop for the rest of Coenwulf's reign. One account records that the quarrel between Wulfred and Coenwulf led to Wulfred being deprived of his office for six years, with no baptisms taking place during that time, but this may have been an exaggeration, with four years being the more likely term of the suspension.|$|E
