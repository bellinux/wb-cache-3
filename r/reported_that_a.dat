5|$|Early on November 20, the JTWC <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> {{tropical}} depression had developed. Shortly thereafter, MFR <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> tropical disturbance had formed. The low moved west-southwest while gradually deepening. Late on November 20, MFR upgraded the system into a moderate tropical storm. The storm failed to intensify further {{as it had}} moved onshore northern Madagascar. By November 21, MFR estimated that the storm weakened back into a disturbance. After emerging into the Mozambique Channel, Anety reportedly re-intensified back to moderate tropical storm status. While making its closest approach to the African mainland, the storm resumed weakening while turning back southeast. On November 23, both agencies stopped monitoring the system.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{original}} invasion threat passed, Sandown continued in military use into the 17th century. A 1616 survey nonetheless <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> range of repairs were needed, {{at an estimated}} total cost of £437, while a 1634 survey noted that work estimated at £1,243 was required. In contrast, an inspection in 1635 showed the castle to be in reasonable structural condition, but antiquated in design. A report produced in 1641 suggested that £8,000 of investment was required in the three castles of the Downs, including £3,000 for additional sea defences.|$|E

5|$|As {{construction}} progressed {{with the}} theme park in early 2013, {{the owners of the}} park gave no details about the roller coaster other than that it would be the largest roller coaster in India. Even after the Roller Coaster Database <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> Bolliger & Mabillard Floorless Coaster would be built at the park, the owners still released no details. In April 2013, the first pieces of the roller coaster were erected. By the end of August, all of the coaster's track was installed.

5|$|By 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> further two tank fires {{had been}} {{extinguished}}, {{but that one}} of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.|$|E
5|$|Deathrow {{received}} largely favorable reviews. Reviewers {{praised the}} game's fast-paced action, and surround sound, but complained {{of its high}} difficulty curve, generic soundtrack, and lack of online multiplayer. Some critics felt the game's use of profanity was excessive, while others {{thought it was a}} highlight. Reviewers considered the game's concept and mechanics similar to other series, specifically Speedball. IGN and TeamXbox both named Deathrow an Editor's Choice. The game won the TeamXbox 2002 Breakthrough Game of the Year award and the IGN 2002 Best Game Nobody Played. IGN later <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> sequel would be unlikely due to the original's low revenue. Southend dissolved in 2013.|$|E

5|$|From summer 2005, {{the media}} had linked Cissé with a move away from Anfield. Speculation {{intensified}} as the season went on. In early June 2006, it was <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> transfer to Olympique de Marseille had been agreed. The very same day Cissé broke his leg during France's final warm up match against China on 7 June 2006. It was thought that even though a relatively quick recovery was expected, Cissé's transfer would be postponed until at least the January transfer window. However, the two teams agreed a loan deal in July 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> woodcutter had {{recently}} {{tried to cut}} {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it to lean out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also reported that around 1895, cuts had been made to tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
