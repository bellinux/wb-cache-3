The project gradually grew {{to become one of}} the first national centers for synchrotron radiation in the United States and, eventually, an independent laboratory in charge of its own accelerator machine and organizationally a part of SLAC. This article tells the story of the first two decades of these activities, when the synchrotron <b>radiation</b> <b>activities</b> operated parasitically on the SLAC site, entirely peripheral to SLAC’s main scientific mission in high energy physics. The article’s meticulously detailed account of the history of the parasitic period of synchrotron radiation at SLAC constitutes an important and interesting piece of modern science history, complementing previous efforts in this journal and elsewhere to chronicle the history of the U.

Most importantly, the article communicates an alternative interpre- tative perspective on the institutional change of Big Science labs, consciously and consistently keeping its analysis at a micro level and emphasizing the incremental small-step changes of local actors in their everyday negotiations and deliberations. Not at all disqualifying or seeking to replace historical accounts framed with reference to macro developments of grand long-term change in science and science policy at the end of the previous century, but rather seeking to complement them, this article contributes with a worm’s-eye view on change and advances the argument for a further exploration of such viewpoints in the historical analysis of institutional transformation in science...|$|R
50|$|The {{underwater}} {{nuclear tests}} Wahoo and Umbrella gathered scientific data {{that helped the}} Department of Defense understand the effects of nuclear weapons on Navy ships. Some of the key points found were that underwater nuclear blasts create less fallout due to the absorption of radioactive material {{in the water and}} vaporized droplets.(76) Direct gamma radiation was found to be extremely low, but the base surge was found to be highly radioactive as it passed measurement devices. Smaller radiation concentrations followed in waves mimicking the initial base surge. Almost all free-field <b>radiation</b> <b>activity</b> was found to disappear after fifteen minutes allowing for return to normal operations. The impact of shock waves was less than prior expected. The damage from the shockwave was found to be negligible on the destroyers at the ranges tested, but equipment failure from the blast could immobilize the ships.

In addition, there are unexpected scenarios resulting from possible accidents, or where dangerous material is hidden for terrorism attacks using nuclear weapons.

40|$|International audienceRespiratory-induced organ {{motion is}} a {{technical}} challenge to PET imaging. This motion induces displacements and deformation of the organs tissues, which {{need to be}} taken into account when reconstructing the spatial <b>radiation</b> <b>activity.</b> Classical image-based methods that describe motion using Deformable Image Registration (DIR) algorithms cannot fully take into account the non-reproducibility of the respiratory internal organ motion nor the tissue volume variations that occur during breathing. In order to overcome these limitations, various biomechanical models of the respiratory system have been developed in the past decade as an alternative to DIRapproaches. In this paper, we describe a new method of correcting motion artefacts in PET imagereconstruction adapted to motion estimation models such as those based onthe finite element method (FEM). In contrast with the DIR-based approaches, the <b>radiation</b> <b>activity</b> was reconstructed on deforming tetrahedral meshes. For this, we have re- formulated the tomographic reconstruction problem by introducing atime-dependent system matrix based calculated using tetrahedral meshes instead of voxelized images. The MLEM algorithm was chosen as the reconstruction method. The simulationsperformed in this study show that the motion compensated reconstruction based on tetrahedral deformable meshes has the capability to correct motion artefacts. Results demonstrate that, in the case of complex deformations, when large volume variations occur, the developed tetrahedral based method is more appropriate than the classical DIR-based one. This method can be used, together with biomechanical models controlled by external surrogates, to correct motion artefacts in PET images and thus reducing the need for additional internal imaging during the acquisition...|$|E
