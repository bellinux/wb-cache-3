50|$|On {{the infant}} Queen Mary's {{ascension}} to the throne, Anne's father, James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, became Regent of Scotland until 1554, when he surrendered the post to Mary's mother Mary of Guise. Mary of Guise visited France in 1551. On her return in December, Anne was bought magnificent clothes to join Guise's household as a lady-in-waiting and maid of honour. The clothes included; a grey velvet gown; a crimson velvet gown with gold passmenterie; four hoods and sets of sleeves; red stockings; with a sponge, a <b>rubbing</b> <b>brush</b> {{and a pair}} of knives. Her father had already bought her several fine gowns, all paid for from the royal exchequer. Anne became ill through March and April 1552; however, she recovered, perhaps with the help of drugs bought from Guise's apothecary and surgeon costing £20. At this time her servants were Effame Hamilton, Gilbert Ruthven and William Forrester. Effame, who was called Anne's keeper, sewed her clothes and kept the fire in Anne's chamber. Anne's older sister Barbara married Alexander Gordon, Lord Gordon. Lady Gordon and Lady Anne travelled with Mary of Guise to the west of Scotland in March 1553. Soon after, their father resigned the regency to Mary of Guise, and thereafter the Crown records no longer documented Anne's expenses.|$|E

In addition, my responses to the natural environment inform my abstract, expressionistic, mixed media paintings. Using oil paint in a nontraditional way, I <b>rub,</b> <b>brush,</b> and manipulate paper surfaces to create subtle texture and color. Then, I add a vast range of materials such as resin, varnish, and enamel to build depth and layers.

50|$|Many {{members of}} Salvia have trichomes (hairs) {{growing on the}} leaves, stems, and flowers, which help to reduce water loss in some species. Sometimes the hairs are glandular and secrete {{volatile}} oils that typically give a distinct aroma to the plant. When the hairs are <b>rubbed</b> or <b>brushed,</b> some of the oil-bearing cells are ruptured, releasing the oil. This often results in the plant being unattractive to grazing animals and some insects.|$|R
40|$|Touch [...] both {{touching}} {{another and}} being touched [...] {{is a primary}} form of communication. By old age, both the need {{and the desire for}} specific amounts and kinds of touching are well established for the individual. The present study was designed to obtain information about what elderly women in nursing and retirement homes report to be liked and disliked types of touching. Participants who volunteered for this study were 32 ambulatory females 65 years of age or older who were living in nursing or retirement homes. Each participant was shown a set of 20 photos and sketches depicting a staff person touching an elderly woman in various ways, and asked to rate their liking for the particular type of touching on a one to five scale ranging from 2 ̆ 2 like very much 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 dislike very much. 2 ̆ 2 The set of photos and sketches included ten comparable scenes with one-half showing a male staff member and the other half showing a female staff member touching an elderly woman. Scenes included: foot massage, helping to stand, back <b>rub,</b> <b>brushing</b> hair, arm around shoulder, holding hand, helping to dress, stroking cheek, helping with toileting, and helping with a shower...|$|R

50|$|Blistering {{agents are}} {{chemical}} substances used to irritate tissues, leading to inflammation, increased circulation, necrosis, and scarring. They may be applied topically or injected. The {{most commonly used}} external (topical) blistering agents contain iodine, mercuric iodide, or turpentine, which are <b>rubbed</b> or <b>brushed</b> onto the skin overlaying the site of injury, and while they cause scaling of the skin, they tend to produce only low levels of soreness. Stronger blistering solutions may be made using red mercuric iodide. These {{require the use of}} a neck cradle, and the horse risks laminitis and lymphangitis if not walked regularly. Blistering is used for a variety of lameness problems, including splints, curbs, sore shins, tendonitis, suspensory desmitis, and sesamoiditis.|$|R

Brushing is a mechanical process wherein a fine metal <b>brush</b> <b>rubs</b> the fabric to raise fine fibres from the loosely spun yarns {{to form a}} nap. Typically, flannel has a nap on either one side or both sides. If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form.|$|R

The hanging tassel rest just above the figure's right ear, giving the impression that it has hooked the head and is pulling it sideways. The gold railings suggest in the top right suggest the corner of a room, while those in the center background may be the headboard of a bed. The upper half is largely void of detail, while the lower portion, particularly the lower third has been heavily reworked, and consists of a blending of white, gray and black pigments.|$|R
25|$|Mischocyttarus flavitarsis is {{a social}} paper wasp found in western North America. Their nests can be found both in forests close to rivers or in close {{proximity}} to human life under the eaves of roofs. Despite the fact that M. flavitarsis nests are frequently in close contact with humans, M. flavitarsis typically will not sting, but rather ram into the threatening individual. Their colony cycle typically begins before May and will last until October. The queen will then seek a hibernation site for the winter. Perched near female hibernation sites are males with whom the female will mate. The males have claimed their territory by <b>rubbing</b> sternal <b>brushes</b> along the border of the site, leaving a chemical that deters other individuals from approaching. M. flavitarsis feed on arthropods, nectar, and animal carcasses and are often prey to birds, ants, and praying mantis.|$|R
2500|$|In a male {{receptive}} partner, being anally penetrated {{can produce}} a pleasurable sensation due to the inserted penis <b>rubbing</b> or <b>brushing</b> against the prostate (also known as the [...] "male G-spot") through the anal wall. This can result in pleasurable sensations {{and can lead to}} an orgasm in some cases. Prostate stimulation {{can produce a}} [...] "deeper" [...] orgasm, sometimes described by men as more widespread and intense, longer-lasting, and allowing for greater feelings of ecstasy than orgasm elicited by penile stimulation only. The prostate is located next to the rectum and is the larger, more developed male homologue (variation) to the female Skene's glands. [...] However, though the experiences are different, male orgasms by penile stimulation are also centered in the prostate gland. It is also typical for a man to not reach orgasm as a receptive partner solely from anal sex.|$|R

Dispersion procedures used or recommended for soils or sedi-ments are reviewed in terms of their contributions to this end. The general subject of dispersion is then related to the underlying principles, and a group of procedures which most nearly accord with these principles are experimentally compared. From the results obtained, a general routine of dispersion for fine-grained sediments i offered. The routine is arranged in two sequences, and inchldes soaking in water, <b>rubbing</b> with a <b>brush,</b> shak-ing, heating to boiling, and washing out foreign electrolytes.

40|$|Brush seals are {{designed}} to survive transient rotor <b>rubs.</b> Inherent <b>brush</b> seal flexibility reduces frictional heat generation. However, high surface speeds combined with thin rotor sections may result in local hot spots. Considering large surface area and accelerated oxidation rates, frictional heat at bristle tips is another major concern especially in challenging high-temperature applications. This study investigates temperature distribution in a brush seal {{as a function of}} frictional heat generation at bristle tips. The two-dimensional axisymmetric computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis includes the permeable bristle pack as a porous medium allowing fluid flow throughout the bristle matrix. In addition to effective flow resistance coefficients, isotropic effective thermal conductivity as a function of temperature is defined for the bristle pack. Employing a fin approach for a single bristle, a theoretical analysis has been developed after outlining the brush seal heat transfer mechanism. Theoretical and CFD analysis results are compared. To ensure coverage for various seal designs and operating conditions, several frictional heat input cases corresponding to different seal stiffness values have been studied. Frictional heat generation is outlined to introduce a practical heat flux input into the analysis model. Effect of seal stiffness on nominal bristle tip temperature has been evaluated. Analyses show a steep temperature rise close to bristle tips that diminishes further away. Heat flux conducted through the bristles dissipates into the flow by a strong convection at the fence-height region...|$|R
30|$|The primary outcome {{variable}} {{was the difference}} in anaerobic bacterial load of the implant surface before and after mechanical and chemical debridement and decontamination. After flap deflection and granulation tissue removal, a sample {{was obtained from the}} implant surface by <b>rubbing</b> a sterilized <b>brush</b> (Microbrush® International, Grafton, WI, USA) across the implant surface (Tpre). A second sample was obtained after mechanical debridement, decontamination of the implant surface with the test or control substance, and subsequent rinsing with sterile saline (Tpost). After sampling, the top part of the brush was cut off and collected in a vial containing reduced transport fluid [33]. From every implant presenting peri-implantitis, separate samples were obtained. All microbiological samples were processed within 24  h [34]. The total anaerobic bacterial load and the presence and numbers of the periodontal pathogens [35] Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, and Campylobacter rectus were determined by laboratory technicians who were blind to treatment allocation.|$|R
50|$|A high-torque, {{insulated}} electric motor, usually {{rated at}} 250-750 W (⅓ to 1 horsepower) for a domestic unit, spins a circular turntable mounted horizontally above it. Induction motors rotate at 1,400-1,800 rpm {{and have a}} range of starting torques, depending on the method of starting used. The added weight and size of induction motors may be of concern, depending on the available installation space and construction of the sink bowl. Universal motors rotate at higher speeds (about 2,800 rpm), have high starting torque, and are usually lighter, but are noisier than induction motors, partially due to the higher speeds and partially because the commutator <b>brushes</b> <b>rub</b> on the slotted commutator. Contaminated water leaking on to the commutator can lead to major damage, which is why most garbage disposals today use induction motors. The higher starting torque of those appliances with a permanent magnet motor ensures in most cases {{that there will be no}} blockage.|$|R

When {{you have}} neither time for careful study nor for Düreresque detail, sketch the outline with pencil, then dash {{in the shadows}} with the brush boldly, trying {{to do as much}} as you {{possibly}} can at once, and to get a habit of expedition and decision; laying more color again and again into the tints as they dry, using every expedient which your practice has suggested to you of carrying out your chiaroscuro in the manageable and moist material, taking the color off here with the dry brush, scratching out lights in it there with the wooden handle of the <b>brush,</b> <b>rubbing</b> it in with your fingers, drying it off with your sponge, etc. Then, when the color is in, take your pen and mark the outline characters vigorously, in the manner of the Liber Studiorum. This kind of study is very convenient for carrying away pieces of effect which depend not so much on refinement as on complexity, strange shapes of involved shadows, sudden effects of sky, etc.; and it is most useful as a safeguard against any too servile or slow habits which the minute copying may induce in you; for although the endeavor to obtain velocity merely for velocity's sake, and dash for display's sake, is as baneful as it is despicable; there are a velocity and a dash which not only are compatible with perfect drawing, but obtain certain results which cannot be had otherwise. And it is perfectly safe for you to study occasionally for speed and decision, while your continual course of practice is such as to insure your retaining an accurate judgment and a tender touch. Speed, under such circumstances, is rather fatiguing than tempting; and you will find yourself always beguiled rather into elaboration than negligence.|$|R
