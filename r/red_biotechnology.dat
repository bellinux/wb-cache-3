Recent increases in EU activities and the proximity to market stage of the first plant-made pharmaceuticals, some of which from EU based companies, represent a call to action for EU regulators. Drawing on the North American debate on molecular farming it will be argued that both the rationale of and the risk issues associated with molecular farming will differ significantly from those of first generation GM crops. Based on these differences, the suitability of the existing regulatory framework, which essentially was developed in response to the arrival of insecticide and herbicide tolerant crops for food and feed use, is discussed. Possible options for adapting the already complex EU regulatory system to cater for molecular farming are examined. It will be argued that the policy challenges posed will inevitably spark a broader public debate. As an issue for debate, molecular farming is located at two crossroads: of the risk debate on agricultural biotechnology and the sustainability debate on renewables and greening of industry and of <b>red</b> and green <b>biotechnology.</b> Complex scientific, technical and legal issues, new issues at stake and a new pattern of actors are likely to give EU regulators a difficult time. molecular farming, industrial crops, biotechnology policy, risk assessment, GMO regulation...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{biotechnology}} is {{a driving}} force and a full grown industry in the international economy with ongoing and rapid innovations. The emphasis of this dissertation is on the valorization of red biotech, i. e. pharmaceutical and healthcare applications. Belgium has firmly established itself as an international <b>red</b> <b>biotechnology</b> country, with a world class biotechnology industry in the Flanders and Wallonia bioRegions. Developing a domestic biotechnology industry - and hence new biotechnology firms - can be influenced by regional policy. The pharmaceutical-biotechnology regional and sectoral innovation system is characterized as an international and dynamic network architecture involving numerous players engaged in drug discovery. Regional governments and dedicated public and private network organizations have supported emerging new biotechnology firms by providing critical resources and by promoting an institutional environment that has enabled partnerships between universities, highly specialized research centers, small science based academic spin-offs and corporate spin-outs and large global pharmaceutical companies. Both policy and big firms {{look at the new}} biotechnology firms from a strategic point of view. The policy objective is the emergence of new and sustainable firms in the region; the big firms objective is the filling or renewal of the pipelines of products. New biotechnology firms are both beneficiaries and targets of strategic partnering alliances with large and global (bio) pharmaceutical companies. A number of the Belgian new biotechnology firms hold a nodal position as “ most preferred partner ” with multiple alliances in dynamic R&D networks. They have a high degree of integration into global technological networks through strategic alliances. Strategic alliances and open innovation are commonly leveraged.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} extent to which {{corporations}} currently increase the voluntary disclosures in triple bottom line (TBL) reports. Although research already has provided substantial contributions as to why and how firms apply TBL reporting, there remains limited understanding of the motivations for and against making voluntary disclosures. Drawing from literature in environmental management and accounting as well as international auditing, this work focuses on guidance, boundarysetting and external assurance for TBL reports. An inductive case study approach is applied to investigate the credibility of TBL reporting by contrasting the competing predictions from legitimacy theory and voluntary disclosure theory on voluntary disclosures. A set of firm and industry specific factors are identified that are expected to determine a firm’s level and extent of reporting. The sample comprises nine US and EU <b>red</b> <b>biotechnology</b> corporations which aligned their TBL reporting to the GRI reporting standards in at least part of their TBL reports that were published between 2000 and 2009. An initial attempt is made to systematically investigate the credibility of TBL reporting to develop the model of voluntary disclosures. The empirical findings of this case study suggest that current guidance, boundary-setting and assurance for TBL reports are not sufficient to increase the credibility, comparability and reliability of reporting. Voluntary disclosure theory can serve to provide economic motivations, while legitimacy theory is helpful to provide a legitimating motivation. The findings support the notion that the economics-based factors better explain the secrecy strategy of providing mainly soft disclosures. The increase of disclosure levels maybe is considered sufficient to respond to public pressure. This work concludes by suggesting some directions of research in the areas of boundary-setting and assurance that have academic and practical implications...|$|E

Marinomonas mediterranea, for example, has proven to be one such useful microorganism.

Finally, an enzyme very specific for l-lysine, which oxidises this amino acid in epsilon position and that has received a new EC number (1. 4. 3. 20), has also been described for M. mediterranea.

40|$|The {{application}} of membranes in life sciences, e. g. {{in red and}} white biotechnology, has increased lately with the advanced understanding of membrane processes. <b>Red</b> <b>biotechnology</b> is applied to medical processes for human health care such as the production of antibodies. White or also-called industrial biotechnology deals with industrial processes e. g. the production of chemicals and fuels. Especially downstream processing for product recovery and purication is very cost-intensive. In situ product recovery (ISPR) presents a form of process integration where the formation and {{the separation of the}} product take place in one reactor thereby reducing costs. By combining these two steps, ISPR leads to higher productivities and yields and it enables continuous operation. Using membranes for ISPR is advantageous since a continuous product recovery and cell retention can be ensured at the same time with easy scale-up. This thesis presents a novel ISPR process named reverse-flow diafiltration. This process offers a long-term stable operation characterized by low transmembrane pressures. It features submerged hollow-fiber membranes which are integrated in the fermenter. Two liquid streams are exchanged alternatingly over the same membrane in a reverse-flow operation mode: One supplies the nutrient solution (inside-out filtration), the second one extracts product solution (outside-in filtration). As a result no net flux over the membrane occurs and cake-layer formation by particle accumulation is kept low. In addition no permeate is wasted for backflushing the membrane. A short emptying interval in-between the two steps using air or permeate respectively are applied, for emptying the inside dead volume of the membrane lumen to improve product yield. This concept of reverse-flow diafiltration is tested with different media such as model yeast suspension, fungi fermentation broth and antibody fermentation broth. A scale-up to three parallel membranes is conducted. Also high-flux microfiltration membranes, namely microsieves and micromeshes, are tested. A proof of principle of reverse-flow diafiltration is conducted using model yeast suspension at different cell concentrations. The concept shows much lower transmembrane pressures than conventional dead-end filtration with backflush. To empty the dead volume of the membrane lumen, different emptying modes are assessed. It is shown that emptying with permeate leads to a more effective emptying and stable operation than air emptying. RFD with permeate emptying is adapted to a continuous fermentation process for itaconic acid production using the fungi cells of Ustilago maydis. Also for such complex suspensions, RFD offers much higher fluxes and permeabilities than conventional dead-end filtration. Also for antibody fermentation reverse-flow diafiltration was successfully applied. Here the challenge was to prevent protein adsorption, enable stable fluxes and provide cell retention at the same time. The process was successfully operated for two weeks applying a wide range of dilution rates. The reverse-flow diafiltration process is very promising for future ISPR applications towards continuous fermentation processes. It enables stable filtration performance and product recovery values over longer time periods than conventional submerged processes. It is promising especially for more complex fermentation suspensions such as fungi suspensions, characterized by high viscosity and filamentous organisms. Also for shear-sensitive organisms, such as mammalian cells, RFD offers an advantage eliminating the need for high cross-flow velocities. In terms of capacity, RFD can already compete with state-of-the-art technology such as settlers, tangential-flow filtration or spin filters. During the last years a trend in biotechnology towards single-use systems has evolved providing a higher flexibility to market demand. An integrated single-use recovery device such as a membrane module could enable long-term continuous product recovery. Here submerged membranes using the reverse-flow diafiltration concept offer a great opportunity...|$|E
40|$|Findings of New Regionalism {{show that}} economy an {{orientation}} towards innovation becomes crucial to ensure regional development. Regions in which innovative processes are concentrated {{are marked by}} intense internal as well as external processes of interaction. As processes of regionalisation and globalisation are taking place simultaneously, the organisations and actors involved in the innovation process are integrated into regional, national and global networks, thereby transcending spatial scales. Regions are also gaining political importance due to such processes of regionalisation and decentralisation. Therefore regions have become units that design regional policies oriented towards fostering innovation in cooperation with higher level elements of the political multi-level system. Regional governance as a hardly institutionalised mode of regulation and cooperation links agents in a horizontal as well as vertical perspective and {{is a symbol of}} the increased degree of regional self-governance. In the context of European integration border regions receive increasing attention because of their rise in number as well as their relay function for area development. They symbolize the European idea of cross-border networking but face tough The increasing cross-border interaction reveals national differences in political systems and this open border effect impedes further integration. The integration into national systems and multi-scalar innovation systems leads – especially in border regions – to a tangible external influence. The combination of horizontal and vertical networks, the possibilities of self-governed political decision making, external influence and of spatial as well as integrated s potentials of development result in a very high complexity. As an eclectic concept the regional innovation system integrates those changes in the economic and political system and defines the region as a platform for innovation processes and their governance from an economic, socio-institutional and political perspective. Regional innovation systems consist of an innovation architecture, i. e. of the institutions, companies and supporting organisations that take part in the process of creating, diffusing and exploiting new knowledge. The interaction is embedded into a socio-institutional environment and creates non-codified knowledge. Context as well as content thereby become regionally specific and bound values. Border and Proximity research provide analytical frameworks to analyse the geographical, functional and relational proximities as well as distances across national borders. In this framework, proximity is understood as a high degree of congruence and is associated with high potentials for cross-border development. Relational distance is reflected in cognitive, institutional, social, cultural and organisational attributes, which influence inter-organisational innovation processes and trans-border knowledge exchange as contextual factors. Relational distance hampers trans-border integration and furthers (promotes) spatial fragmentation. Trans-border regional governance {{has the potential to be}} a crucial instrument to overcome trans-border barriers if specifically directed strategies of regional and innovation policy are formulated. Apart from horizontal networking it also enables vertical coordination with the national and supranational multi-level system. Regional governance contributes to compensating the deficits in the political and administrative consolidation and in the representation of border regions. In the case of <b>red</b> <b>biotechnology</b> in the border region Euregio Meuse-Rhine it was possible to identify functionally and technologically similar characteristics and developments in the partial spaces. Concerning geographical proximity, the spatial and structural premises and requirements for a symmetrical integration and the creation of knowledge externalities exist. However, only few innovation-based cross-border interactions can be traced. Instead, local and scarcely linked networks have developed at the different science locations. In the past impulses for cross-border cooperation came from Interreg-projects which were part of the EU’s regional policy. However, beyond these impulses no regional cross-border governance structures and processes have been established. A dualism of geographical, functional and technological proximity on the one hand and relational distance as well as cross-border governance deficits on the other can be observed...|$|E
40|$|For ages, {{biotechnology}} {{has been}} opening doors in food technology. Now it promises even more, {{but can we}} be sure {{to stay on top}} of it? Scene One: In the teeming market place it is still early, in the cool that persists only until the sun forces open the doors of the day. Market women swap prices and excess supplies, some displaying new types of fruit and vegetables. A man dismissed as eccentric in his nearby village tries to convince seed merchants to try samples of his new seeds. Urchins scamper, and merchants amble, some into dark doorways whence pour the sounds of laughter and drinking vessels clashing. From behind the stalls of the fisherwomen emanate the odours of fermented fish, and through the doors of the bakeries comes the smell of fresh-baked bread. Where could this be, and when? Maybe in the bustling market of Babylon, thousands of years ago, in what is now Iraq? Or in the harbour of Moroni, in the Comoros Islands, twenty years ago? Or in the dapper little town of St Louis, on Senegal s northern coast, today? Scene Two: An open space, from which the market was banished to an out-of-town site, and where the railway station has become a shopping and conference centre. A single street vendor stands with his single cart, displaying the municipality s license to sell, proffering odour-free and probably not-too-fresh bread. Conference delegates, harangued by people shouting about their ideological wares, are allowed free passage through a police cordon after listening (or not) to a stream of passion, a lecture or, in some cases, an insult or two. Where? A dapper little town, St Louis, in the State of Missouri, in the United States of America. When? Over the third weekend of May 2003, scene of a world agricultural congress, barricaded by anti-biotechnology demonstrators. What links these two scenes, and countless others? Biotechnology. By definition, biotechnology is any technology that involves the manipulation of biological systems. Thus, whilst many people today use the term biotechnology to mean, solely, the genetic modification of organisms, it in fact covers a much wider range of interventions. Even before people could apply a scientific label to them, the ancient practices of fermentation still widely used today are in fact biotechnology. Simple acts of brewing or making bread are examples of a technology that, for some today, is a code word for danger. Biotech does not cover just in vitro techniques (p 1) which are now used, amongst thousands of other applications, to prepare elements of pharmaceuticals for growth in host plants such as tobacco pharming it s called. In Sidoma region near Awassa, Ethiopia, the corm or stem base of the ensete banana plant Ensete ventricosum is grated and then fermented with the decorticated leaf sheaf. The resulting kocho starch can be stored for long periods, and is used in bread-making. Photos: N. Cattlin © Holt Studios (top), CIRAD (bottom) Red, white In general terms, the definition of biotechnology prepared by the Convention on Biological Diversity is an apt summary: "any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use". In other words, it can apply to any sphere of life, and not only to agriculture. As in many a complex subject, people use the notion of colours to try to simplify the issues involved. Just as there are blue boxes and green boxes of resolutions to be addressed in the current multilateral trade negotiations (see Spore 100), so there are colours of biotechnology: red, white and green. <b>Red</b> <b>biotechnology</b> covers the group of biotechnologies used in the production of pharmaceuticals, for use by humans or other mammals (hence the red). Whilst not directly agricultural, they have obvious implications for veterinary services. White biotechnology is used to describe the emerging group of technologies that produce enzymes for such products as cleaning materials and that are expected soon to be used in the manufacture of fibres or bio-plastics; these, too, will impinge upon agricultural space. The scenarios may seem fantastic right now, but they are perhaps nearer than many would like to believe. A survey by The Economist in March 2003 concluded that "white biotechnology could revolutionise the use to which the countryside is put, shifting it away from growing food and towards growing raw materials for industry. " and green Where do things stand with biotech applications in agriculture green biotechnology - in ACP economies? It is wise first to define the scope of the topic. The broad definition of biotechnology in fact covers many of the tools and techniques that are commonplace in agriculture and food production, according to a benchmark statement by FAO. "Interpreted in a narrow sense, which considers only new DNA techniques (see Spore 94), molecular biology and reproductive technological applications, the definition covers a range of different technologies such as gene manipulation and gene transfer, DNA typing and cloning of plants and animals. " It is the development of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) which has become the focus of a heated debate, involving the two most flammable fuels that can be thrown onto any fire morality and money. The FAO has argued that genetic engineering has the potential to increase production and productivity in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and help in the development of new vaccines. Tissue culture, continues FAO, has produced plants that are increasing crop yields by providing farmers with healthier planting material, of, for example, banana and maize. Genetic modification techniques also provide new research methods to assist in the conservation and characterization of biodiversity, and in refining breeding for some traditionally intractable agronomic problems such as drought resistance and improved root systems. Recent articles in Spore about taro, maize and various fruits attest to this, as more research is carried out on them in all ACP regions. From the tissue culture laboratories of the Science Research Council in Kingston, Jamaica, to the taro germplasm labs in Fiji, the extensive biotech work on maize in South Africa and the field trials of the African section of the International Service for Agro-biotech Applications in Kenya, there is no fear, there are no doubts, about the technology. The daily concerns of those scientists and their policy-makers are about developing sufficient technical capacity to master the technology, and maintaining ownership and control intellectually, economically, politically. There, public-private partnerships are far preferable to private research alone. Shouting matches There are broad concerns, or at least recognised doubts, about the implications of the spread of GMOs: with their increased resistance to diseases and environmental stresses, will they upset the ecosystem? Will their contact be benign, or contaminating? Will biodiversity be lost, and will traditional cultivars be displaced by genetically modified ones? A future issue of Spore will examine these issues in detail. It is, though, by asking such questions that we approach borderlines in discussions, where an ill-chosen word can turn a debate into a dialogue-of-the-deaf. Some recent dialogues and policy moves in southern Africa, where genetically modified cereals in food aid shipments were hastily barred, seem to have been stirred up deliberately, and sometimes a tad economical with the truth. Did they not know that we have nothing to fear, but fear itself? Under the recent Biosafety Convention, each nation is allowed to bar imports of foods containing GMOs, whilst elsewhere in the nation scientists seek to deepen their knowledge of, for example, tissue culture. As with many other conventions, the issue for many ACP countries is not so much content as implementation: institutional capacity and human resource development, in short. The European laws which require packaging to show the GMO content of food have had the effect of imposing a moratorium on GMO trade throughout Europe and in most ACP and other developing countries, as well as a moratorium on in situ research. How long this will last is an open question, if the anti-protectionist principles of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are applied with the fullest vigour possible. Whether through trade liberalisation, or market forces, or a tacit supremacy of scientific assurance over civil society paranoia, biotechnology in its various forms and colours will become more available in ACP countries. Holding up a panicky hand will not stop it. Being prepared, and being able to be master and mistress of our science, will enable us to control and channel it. Otherwise, our children will have the right to ask of us: Where were you in the moratorium, what did you do? The draft Code of Conduct on Biotechnology, currently moving through FAO s procedural channels, calls for: determining the benefits and risks of each individual GMO a case-by-case approach on the biosafety of each product or process prior to its release evaluating the effects on biodiversity, environment and food safety ensuring that developing countries, and resource-poor farmers in particular, benefit more from biotech research and continued access to diverse genetic materialFor ages, biotechnology has been opening doors in food technology...|$|E
