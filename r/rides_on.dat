5|$|The goal of {{each level}} {{is to protect}} Baby Mario, who <b>rides</b> <b>on</b> Yoshi's back. If Yoshi is hit by an enemy or obstacle, Baby Mario will float off into a bubble and a timer will start {{counting}} down. If the player fails to recover Baby Mario before the counter reaches zero, Baby Mario will be taken away by Koopas and Yoshi will lose a life. The timer can recover up to ten seconds, and Yoshi can collect stars {{to increase the amount}} of time on the counter. However, if Yoshi falls into a bottomless pit, gets crushed, or comes into contact with spikes or lava, he will automatically lose a life. In some areas, players can collect a Starman that transforms Baby Mario into Super Baby Mario. During these areas, players take control of Baby Mario who, for a short period, is invincible, can run on walls and ceilings, and can float using his cape. Additionally, some areas transform Yoshi into various vehicles, such as a helicopter or digger, allowing him to reach otherwise inaccessible areas for a short amount of time.|$|E
