5|$|Marine mammals were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans historically {{for food}} and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took this to a much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the †Steller's sea cow (along with subsistence hunting) and the †Caribbean monk seal. Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low <b>reproductive</b> <b>output,</b> population recovery has been very slow.|$|E

Despite {{the importance of}} water temperatures in the epidemiology of marine diseases, for the parasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis, the effect {{of high and low}} temperatures has not been methodically investigated. Here, we examined the effects of a wide temperature range (3 – 20 °C) on L. salmonis larval development, adult body size, <b>reproductive</b> <b>outputs,</b> and infestation success. Further, we tested if dispersal of salmon lice differed with two temperature-dependent development times to the infective stage (30 and 60 degree-days) using an individual-based dispersal model. Development times followed universal models of temperature dependence described for other marine ectotherms. Water temperatures had a negative relationship with development times, adult body size, and <b>reproductive</b> <b>outputs,</b> except at 3 °C, where larvae failed to reach the infective stage and all parameters were decreased, indicating low temperatures are more detrimental than high temperatures. The predictable effect of temperatures on lice development and reproduction will have important applications, such as predicting dispersal and population connectivity, to assist in controlling lice epidemics...|$|R
5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their <b>reproductive</b> <b>output</b> even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E

This allowed us to test whether invasive species that alter habitat structure affect reproduction in addition to previously recorded changes in density. Reproductive traits (female mass, cocoon mass, number and volume of eggs, hatched cocoon as a proxy of reproduction date) were studied in both invaded and natural salt marshes during 2007 and 2008 in the Mont St-Michel Bay (France).

25|$|Energy {{investment}} by workers {{required to produce}} reproductives is considerable.

25|$|There are {{arguments}} against the disposable soma theory.

Though by decreasing energy expenditure the damage generated (by free radicals, for instance) {{is expected to be}} reduced and the total energy budget might indeed be reduced, but the investment in repair function might still be relatively the same. But dietary restriction has not been shown to increase lifetime reproductive success (fitness), because when food availability is lower, <b>reproductive</b> <b>output</b> is also lower.

In peat-forming habitats major floristic changes followed the extinction. Earliest Stephanian (Late Pennsylvanian) dominance-diversity patterns were highly variable temporally; several different plant groups that were of minor importance in Westphalian mires became major framework dominants, with high coal to coal variability. Ultimately opportunistic tree ferns, previously subdominant, became the dominant elements.

Chronic exposure to pollutants is thought to compromise survival rate and long-term <b>reproductive</b> <b>outputs</b> in these long-lived organisms, thus inducing population decline. However, the demographic consequences of contaminant exposure are largely theoretical because of the dearth of long-term datasets. This study aims to test whether adult survival rate, return to the colony and long-term breeding performance were related to blood mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), by using a capture-mark-recapture dataset on the vulnerable wandering albatross Diomedea exulans. We did not find evidence for any effect of contaminants on adult survival probability. However, blood Hg and POPs negatively impacted long-term breeding probability, hatching and fledging probabilities. The proximate mechanisms underlying these deleterious effects are likely multifaceted, through physiological perturbations and interactions with reproductive costs. Using matrix population models, we projected a demographic decline {{in response to an}} increase in Hg or POPs concentrations. This decline in population growth rate could be exacerbated by other anthropogenic perturbations, such as climate change, disease and fishery bycatch. This study gives a new dimension to the overall picture of environmental threats to wildlife populations...|$|R

25|$|The {{effect of}} mating on female fitness may vary {{depending}} upon the kind of benefit that the females receive from males through of their choices. Direct benefits include nutritional resources {{to be used by}} females, donation of foods to mates, males offering prey to the female, seen in scorpion flies and dance flies. Several orthopteran species, butterflies, flies, and beetle males can donate secretions or nutritional substances to the females which are transferred in the ejaculate or produced by male glands which can contribute to increase female fecundity. In the green-veined white (Pieris napi), a virgin male can transfer an ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. Females utilize the nutrients transferred from the male in order to increase their nutrients. These nutrients essentially contribute to ensure successful egg production.

40|$|International audienceAmong {{parasitic}} platyhelminths {{with complex}} life cycles, {{it has been}} well documented that transmission opportunities are the main forces shaping the diversity of life-history traits and parasite developmental strategies. While deviations in the development pathway usually involve shortening of life cycles, their extension may also occur following perception of remaining time by parasites. Polystoma gallieni, the monogenean parasite of Hyla meridionalis, is able to trigger two alternative developmental strategies depending on the physiological stage of the tadpoles upon which larvae attach. The distribution and <b>reproductive</b> <b>outputs</b> of both resulting phenotypes were surveyed to address questions about the dynamics of transmission in natural environments. Because modifications in the completion of life cycles can have drawbacks which may perturb the dynamic equilibrium of the resulting host-parasite systems, experimental infestations were also performed to assess parasite-parasite interactions. Our results suggest that the bladder adult phenotype, which involves transmission between frogs and tadpoles, is supplied secondarily by the branchial phenotype which involves transmission between tadpoles and metamorphs. They also support the occurrence of finely tuned trade-offs between hosts and parasites and highlight positive trends behind the extension of direct life cycles, in which host-derived signals account for the remaining time to achieve parasitic transmission...|$|R
