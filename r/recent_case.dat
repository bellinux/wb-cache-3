25|$|Supporters of the {{greenway}} {{claim that}} use of a greenway will protect the trackbed from adverse possession claims and will not preclude reinstatement of the disused sections of line as a working railway in the future.

25|$|In a more <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> an {{internal}} investigation at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune determined that there was evidence of misconduct by Dr. Gopal Kundu, but an external committee was then organised which dismissed the allegation, and the NCCS issued a memorandum exonerating the authors of all charges of misconduct. Undeterred by the NCCS exoneration, the relevant journal (Journal of Biological Chemistry) withdrew the paper based on its own analysis.|$|E
25|$|Many {{countries}} recognize {{eminent domain}} {{to a much}} lesser extent than the English-speaking world or do not recognize it at all. Japan, for instance, has very weak eminent domain powers, {{as evidenced by the}} high-profile opposition to the expansion of Narita International Airport, and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave, one well-known <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> being that of Roppongi Hills.|$|E

In a 2005 referendum, the voters of Austin, Texas, approved a smoking ban in indoor public places within the city. The plaintiffs, owners of several city bars, filed suit in the Western District of Texas seeking to have the ordinance overturned on several grounds, including vagueness.|$|E
25|$|Following R v Gibbins & Proctor, and {{the passing}} of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, it became a {{criminal}} offence to neglect a child in a way which would likely cause injury or risk to health. It is still likely however that following the more <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> of R v Stone & Dobinson, a conviction for manslaughter or murder would arise, where the neglect or lack of care by a parent is either intentional, or grossly negligent.|$|E
25|$|More <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> {{law from}} the UK tends {{to refer to}} a duty of public {{authorities}} to act fairly rather than to natural justice. One aspect of such a duty is the obligation on authorities in some cases to give effect to procedural legitimate expectations. These are underpinned by the notion that a party that is or will be affected by a decision can expect that he or she will be consulted by the decision-maker before the decision is taken.|$|E

Some {{members of the committee}} were skeptical of Noriega's assertion that the <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> wasn't indicative of a larger problem in the MBPD, and provided examples of other cases.|$|E
25|$|Human induced {{climate change}} {{resulting}} from the greenhouse effect may result in an alteration of the structure and function of savannas. Some authors have suggested that savannas and grasslands may become even more susceptible to woody plant encroachment {{as a result of}} greenhouse induced climate change. However, a <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> described a savanna increasing its range at the expense of forest in response to climate variation, and potential exists for similar rapid, dramatic shifts in vegetation distribution as a result of global climate change, particularly at ecotones such as savannas so often represent.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, {{according}} to a new naming scheme, East Wenshui Road station was renamed Dabaishu station. The scheme stressed naming stations after existing toponyms, sights and attractions (if any) rather than simply after neighbouring vertical streets, making it easier for visitors to find these places. In this particular case, the renaming aimed also to eliminate possible confusion between Wenshui East Road and Wenshui Road, a newer station of Line 1. However, in a more <b>recent</b> <b>case,</b> the same type of confusion occurred at Yingao West Road station of Line 3 and Yingao East Road station of Line 10.|$|E

25|$|When hearing {{civil and}} {{criminal}} matters, the Court of Appeal usually sits with three Judges of Appeal, one of whom may be the Chief Justice. However, the Court may also sit with a greater uneven number of Judges of Appeal. This is done in cases of unusual difficulty or importance. As of December 2010 the Court had sat twice with a bench of five judges. The more <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> was the 1995 decision Public Prosecutor v. Tan Meng Khin, in which the Court overruled its own decision handed down the previous year that had set out a different interpretation of section 40(3) of the Penal Code.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy {{more than any}} other Dharmic faith loses more credence when viewed {{in light of the fact}} that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of The World as Will and Representation in 1818. Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence. Other scholarly work questions how similar Schopenhauer's philosophy actually is to Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|More {{research}} is needed to fully elucidate the lifecycle, but both larvae and adults appear to be infective. One <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> reported finding adult worms in the duodenum, which is the first presentation of adult worms not in the upper respiratory region. The adult worms might have been coughed up and reswallowed before settling in the duodenum. The development from larvae to adults is about three weeks, but the existence of a larval pulmonary cycle is uncertain. Intermediate hosts, although not fully known, may be earthworms (an intermediate host for the genus Syngamus), snails, or arthropods. Other than intermediate hosts, no mention of other biological or mechanical vectors has been made.|$|E

25|$|According {{to figures}} updated in April 2012, the World Health Organization {{reports that there}} were 1,352 cases of wild polio in 20 {{countries}} in 2010. Reported cases of polio were down 95% in Nigeria (to a historic low of 21 cases) and 94% in India (to a historic low of 42 cases) compared to the previous year, with little change in Afghanistan (from 38 to 25 cases) {{and an increase in}} cases in Pakistan (from 89 to 144 cases). An acute outbreak in Tajikistan gave rise to 460 cases (34% of the global total), and was associated with a further 18 cases across Central Asia (Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan) and the Russian Federation, with the most <b>recent</b> <b>case</b> from this region being reported from Russia 25 September. These were the first cases in the WHO European region since 2002. The Republic of Congo (Brazzaville) saw an outbreak with 441 cases (30% of the global total). At least 179 deaths were associated with this outbreak, which {{is believed to have been}} an importation from the ongoing type 1 outbreak in Angola (33 cases in 2010) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (100 cases).|$|E

The convicted pair, sentenced to the maximum of 14 years of hard labour each, were pardoned two weeks later following the intervention of United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. In May 2012, then-President Joyce Banda pledged to repeal laws criminalising homosexuality.|$|E
