40|$|This thesis clarifies the {{rationale}} for the protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> organisations and attempts to provide a theoretical basis for reforming the current regime. This research explores the formation and contents of legislation for protecting the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> organisations and analyses the current issues by means of a comparative study of Australian and Japanese law. The thesis starts with an introduction setting out the parameters of the argument, examination of previous research in relation to the topic, explanation of two approaches to the protection <b>of</b> broadcasters’ <b>rights,</b> the hypothesis, the scope, the material covered and the structure of the thesis. It then provides a detailed explanation of the key concepts (broadcasting, broadcasting organisation and the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> organisations). The research analyses the legal context in which those concepts operate in order to establish the scope of the legal inquiry into the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> organisations. The thesis then examines the international conventions and transnational legislation regarding protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> organisations in order to provide a complete picture of the current situation at the international level. Following analysis of the present situation, the thesis examines the new communication technologies and critically reviews the ongoing discussions for the reform of the current international protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> organisations by the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights in the World Intellectual Property Organisation. The thesis argues that the problems that broadcasting organisations are currently facing stem from the unsatisfactory understanding of {{the rationale}} for the protection <b>of</b> broadcasters’ <b>rights.</b> The thesis further argues from the analysis of the Australian Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) as representative of the common law or copyright approach that {{the rationale for}} the protection <b>of</b> broadcasters’ <b>rights</b> are in transition. This view is further advanced by the findings obtained as a result of analysis of the Japanese Copyright Law as representative of the civil law approach. The research reveals that the rationale for protection under Japanese law has long been misconceived. The research concludes that the current difficulties in considering the effective reform of the protection <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> organisations both at the international and national level arose out of the lack of understanding of the rationale for protection...|$|R

5000|$|When Al-Ahly {{announced}} that their satellite channel {{will have the}} exclusive satellite <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> airing the team's domestic games {{but they will be}} broadcast terrestrially as usual the problem began. After that EFA have earlier announced their rejection of Al-Ahly's proposal that club's channel and ESC would be the only satellite broadcaster due to the Association's running contract with other satellite networks to air all league games. After that Al-Ahly president Hassan Hamdy confirmed that the club is still keen on maintaining their <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> exclusive satellite <b>broadcasting</b> to the club's league football games. On October, 2008 A Bahraini corporation has made a bid of EGP 200 million to acquire the Egyptian League broadcasting exclusive rights, The company is also interested in televising and promoting the Egyptian cup games as well as Egypt's international matches, It is worth noting that the EFA's current EGP 18-million deal with several satellite channels will run out {{by the end of the}} ongoing season. After that several TV networks have decided to sue the Egyptian FA (EFA) and the public Radio and TV Union (ERTU) after being prevented from broadcasting a league game for Ahly. Zamalek chairman Mohamed Amer said his club might follow in the footsteps of arch-rivals Al-Ahly in demanding the exclusive rights to broadcast their home league games. January, 2009 Egyptian Football Association (EFA) president Samir Zaher said that the league games' broadcasting row will be resolved before the upcoming Cairo derby. On April, 2009 the Egyptian FA reached an agreement with IMG Media Company to sell the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> the Premier League next season, The company made an amazing offer, guaranteeing at least a EGP 140million revenue. They will also cost us nothing if they failed to reach that target. Before the Egyptian Super Cup, Egyptian FA president Samir Zaher said the local Super Cup between Al-Ahly and Haras El Hodood, which is scheduled for 21 July, would not be televised as the row over broadcasting rights intensified, TV viewers will not be able to watch the season curtain-raiser after a seven-member committee failed to reach an agreement with the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) over airing domestic games for next season, As the committee, which includes several clubs like Cairo duo Al-Ahly and El Zamalek in addition to the FA, did not accept the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU)'s offer to broadcast league and cup matches for EGP90 million. After 4 days the ERTU has acquired the <b>broadcasting</b> <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> the Super Cup match between Al-Ahly and Haras El Hodood for EGP1.25 million, The first week of the Egyptian premier league have not been broadcasting on the cable channels but only on the state TV channels. On 19 August 2009 (the second week of the league) Egyptian premier league clubs did not allow the state TV to air Wednesday's Egyptian Premier League matches after both parties failed to reach an agreement over the ongoing broadcasting saga, Only the first-half of Haras El Hodood and El Geish match was broadcast while usual TV viewers had to listen to radio to follow game between title holders Al-Ahly and Ittihad El-Shorta. Zamalek will follow in the footsteps of those teams after deciding not to broadcast Thursday's match against Petrojet as Zamalek's spokesman Sabri Serag said on the club's official website. [...] Finally after nearly two years and half the Egyptian Premier League broadcasting saga had been resolved, on Thursday 20 August 2009 this means that Thursday's league games will be broadcast live. Local Channel 2 and the Egyptian Satellite Channel are entitled to broadcast games for free, while private cable networks will be charged EGP 8million each per season.|$|R
