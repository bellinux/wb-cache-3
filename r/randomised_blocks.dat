There was a quadratic effect (p 0. 05) by feed supplementation, except for colour and general appearance.

Analysis {{of variance}} is a method of considerable complexity and subtlety, with many different variations, each of which applies in a particular experimental context. Hence, it is possible to apply the wrong type of ANOVA to data and, therefore, to draw an erroneous conclusion from an experiment. This article reviews the types of ANOVA most likely to arise in clinical experiments in optometry including the one-way ANOVA ('fixed' and 'random effect' models), two-way ANOVA in <b>randomised</b> <b>blocks,</b> three-way ANOVA, and factorial experimental designs (including the varieties known as 'split-plot' and 'repeated measures').

40|$|Thinning {{experiments}} {{are difficult to}} analyse thoroughly. Problems arise because different densities are deliberately created {{at the outset of}} the trial. Multiple measures, usually unevenly spaced in time, are subsequently obtained from the experiment. Consequently, analyses of variance are essentially irrelevant because of the very nature of the treatments, and co variance is compromised in that post-thinning covariates will be strongly correlated with treatments. Efficient analyses can be obtained, however, by modelling each plot through time by use of sigmoid functions or orthogonal polynomials, then analysing the respective coefficients by ANOVA or discriminant techniques. These latter ideas were applied to a dataset obtained from a Pinus radiata D.

However, in many experiments, investigators have overlooked the feasibility of applying these microorganisms to the furrow together with the seed, and the effect of bacterial concentration on phytostimulation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of doses of an inoculant based on Azospirillum brasilense, applied to the seed furrow when planting maize, combined with different doses of nitrogen fertiliser. The experiment was carried out in the field, in soil of the cerrado region of Brazil. An experimental design of <b>randomised</b> <b>blocks</b> in bands was adopted, comprising nitrogen (40, 100, 200 and 300 kg ha- 1) and doses of an A. brasilense-based liquid inoculant applied to the seed furrow (0, 100, 200, 300 and 400 mL ha- 1).

Point estimates for heritability ranged from 0. 51 to 0. 72. On the basis of common knowledge, it may be assumed that on average each radial sample within a stem showed a consistent trend of density increasing with age, as xylem was deposited further and further from the pith.

There was a linear relationship between plant age and plant height and between plant age and crown diameter for both sabiá and gliricidia trees. In the taungya system, left rows produced more green ears than middle and right rows, but grain yield was higher in middle rows.

Genetic variability exists among the evaluated genotypes. The most consistant clustering method was that employing average linkage between clusters. Among the characteristics assessed, mean boll weight presented the highest contribution to genetic diversity, followed by elongation at rupture.

The dehydration curve was determined in the whole plant for ten times until the baling. The zero time corresponded to the plant before cutting, which occurred at 11 : 00 and the other collections were carried out at 8 : 00, 10 : 00, 14 : 00, and 16 : 00. The experimental design was <b>randomised</b> <b>blocks</b> with two intensities of conditioning (high and low) and ten sampling times, with five replications. The high and low intensities related to adjusting the deflector plate of the free iron fingers (8 and 18 cm). In order to determine gas exchanges during Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration, there were evaluations of mature leaves, which {{were placed in the}} upper middle third of each branch before the cutting, at every hour for 4 hours. A portable gas analyser was used by an infrared IRGA (6400 xt). The analysed variables were photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), transpiration (T), water use efficiency (WUE), and intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi). In the second part of this study, the nutritional value of Tifton 85 hay was evaluated, so <b>randomised</b> <b>blocks</b> were designed in a split plot through time, with two treatments placed in the following plots: high and low intensity of cutting and five different time points as subplots: cutting (additional treatment), baling and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. Subsequently, fungi that were in green plants as well as hay were determined and samples were collected from the grass at the cutting period, during baling, and after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage. It was observed that Tifton 85 bermudagrass dehydration occurred within 49 hours, so this was considered the best time for drying hay. Gas exchanges were more intense before cutting, although after cutting they decreased until ceasing within 4 hours. The lowest values of acid detergent insoluble nitrogen were obtained with low conditioning intensity after 30 days of storage, 64. 8 g/kg DM. The in vitro dry matter of Tifton 85 bermudagrass did not differ among the storage times or the conditioning intensities. There was no fungi present in the samples collected during the storage period up to 90 days after dehydration, with less than 30 colony forming units found on plate counting.

40|$|Browsing by {{mammalian}} herbivores is a {{major problem}} in plantation forestry. Seedlings are most vulnerable to browsing during establishment, making protection crucial during this period. Aside from reducing herbivore numbers, browsing can be controlled through the application of tree guards or chemical repellents. These methods are generally short-term options. A promising, potentially longer-term method of reducing browsing damage on plantations is to plant individuals with enhanced natural browse resistance. This requires the development of a rapid, cost-effective means of identifying germplasm with enhanced resistance. Here we present such a screening methodology. We planted Eucalyptus globulus seedlings from 22 different seedlots in <b>randomised</b> <b>blocks</b> along edge rows of six operational plantations. Seedlings were monitored for mammal browsing damage and growth for 2 years. Natural variation between E. globulus seedlots resulted in significant variation in {{the extent to which they}} were browsed.
