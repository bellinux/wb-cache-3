Several automation tools {{in term of}} hardware and software are necessary for successfully <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of a machine. This paper presents a prototype of workpiece holding attachment for <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of milling process by self configuration the workpiece setup. The prototype is designed with mechanism to reorient the work surface into machining spindle direction with high positioning accuracy. Variety of parts geometry is hold by attachment to perform single setup machining. Pin type with array pattern additionally clamps the workpiece surface from two opposite directions for increasing the machining rigidity. Optimum pins configuration for conforming the workpiece geometry with minimum deformation is determined through hybrid algorithms, Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Prototype with intelligent optimization technique enables to hold several variety of workpiece geometry which is suitable for machining low of repetitive production in <b>remote</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Increasing {{the demand}} for {{effectively}} use of the production facility requires the tools for sharing the manufacturing facility through <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of the machining process. This research introduces the methodology of machining technology for direct <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of networked milling machine. The integrated tools with virtual simulation, remote desktop protocol and Setup Free Attachment for <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> of milling process are proposed. Accessing and monitoring of machining operation is performed by remote desktop interface and 3 D virtual simulations. Capability of <b>remote</b> <b>operation</b> is supported by an auto setup attachment with a reconfigurable pin type setup free technology installed on the table of CNC milling machine to perform unattended machining process. The system is designed using a computer server and connected to a PC based controlled CNC machine for real time monitoring. A client will access the server through internet communication and virtually simulate the machine activity. The result has been presented that combination between real time virtual simulation and remote desktop tool is enabling to operate all machine tool functions and as well as workpiece setup. ...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the fastest}} growing {{segments}} in the world of process automation is <b>remote</b> <b>operations</b> management. As the name implies, <b>remote</b> <b>operations</b> refers to the management of automation assets that are located in or are dispersed throughout remote geographic locations where it is difficult or impossible to send personnel. This is not limited to remote offshore oil platforms and oil and gas pipelines. It can also include tank farms and terminals, water and wastewater treatment facilities, and any industry or application that requires remote access to automation assets FOUNDATION for <b>Remote</b> <b>Operations</b> Management (ROM) is a suite of technologies and additions to the FOUNDATION fieldbus specification that provide for both a wireless and wired infrastructure for remote assets and applications. FOUNDATION for ROM provides for direct access to information and diagnostics in wireless and remote I/O devices. Conversely, FOUNDATION for ROM can take the data from those devices and place into the FOUNDATION fieldbus environment for data management and quality. FOUNDATION fieldbus is much more than just a communications protocol. The user layer allows for all kinds of flexibility and standardization of data management, and it is all built around the requirements of process automation. FOUNDATION for <b>Remote</b> <b>Operations</b> Management provides an open path for integration of multiple wireless and wired networks, from conventional remote I/O to ISA 100.11a and WirelessHART™, and enables direct access to device information and diagnostics. It extends the range and capabilities of Foundation fieldbus to encompass many more devices throughout the plant — regardless of their communications technology.|$|E
