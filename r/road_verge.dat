Residents identified nuisance and illegal parking and excessive speed as {{of concern in}} the area, {{as well as the}} antisocial use of mini motos, quad bikes and motorcycles on the Kennet towpath. Measures to alleviate nuisance parking were introduced in early 2015 with a ban on parking on the <b>road</b> <b>verge.</b> In June 2015, signs were installed on the lane to Southcote Mill to warn motorcycle users of their prohibition on that right of way.|$|E

40|$|Effect of {{different}} mowing regimes on butterflies and diurnal moths on <b>road</b> <b>verges.</b> — In northern and central Europe <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> offer alternative habitats for declining plant and invertebrate species of semi– natural grasslands. The quality of <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> as habitats depends on several factors, {{of which the}} mowing regime {{is one of the}} easiest to modify. In this study we compared the Lepidoptera communities on <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> that underwent three different mowing regimes regarding the timing and intensity of mowing; mowing in mid–summer, mowing in late summer, and partial mowing (a narrow strip next to the road). A total of 12, 174 individuals and 107 species of Lepidoptera were recorded. The mid–summer mown verges had lower species richness and abundance of butterflies and lower species richness and diversity of diurnal moths compared to the late summer and partially mown verges. By delaying the annual mowing until late summer or promoting mosaic–like mowing regimes, such as partial mowing, the quality of <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> as habitats for butterflies and diurnal moths can be improved...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{of species}} distribution, {{abundance}} and habitat affinities {{is crucial for}} red-list assessment, conservation and habitat management. In Central Finland, we studied Collembola in three habitat types, namely non-grazed meadows, pastures and <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> using pitfall traps. Altogether, 9, 630 Collembola individuals were recorded. These belonged to 12 families, 34 genera and 60 species. The number of specimens was clearly higher in meadows than in pastures or <b>road</b> <b>verges.</b> The number of species, however, was higher in meadows and <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> (40 and 39 species, respectively) than in pastures (33 species). The overall species number is comparable to other large-scale sampling schemes in similar habitats. We recorded a few abundant species (Spatulosminthurus flaviceps, Sminthurus viridis and Sminthurus nigromaculatus) that have been previously recorded from very different biotopes. In conclusion, biodiversity inventories of soil fauna, {{as well as other}} biota, should also include marginal habitats, which often host peculiar communities...|$|R

40|$|International audienceRoad {{construction}} creates new habitats for {{a variety}} of species. In intensive farming landscapes, <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> may be the only suitable habitat for rodents. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} other road-related landscape elements (RRLEs), such as excavation slopes or the central islands of roundabouts, and their importance in a rodent territory. This study investigated all types of RRLE in terms of rodent abundances and habitat quality. RRLEs were compared with the semi-natural elements of the studied landscape using a capture-mark-recapture protocol. Four species and 3154 individuals were captured over a period of four months. Relative abundance and habitat quality were higher in RRLEs than in semi-natural elements. Mapping of the landscape showed that 86 % of crop fields are accessible to Microtus arvalis (and almost 100 % for Apodemus sylvaticus) from <b>road</b> <b>verges.</b> Our results highlight the importance of <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> and all other RRLEs in the conservation of species diversity in intensive farming landscapes...|$|R
50|$|The main {{disadvantage}} of a <b>road</b> <b>verge</b> {{is that the}} right-of-way must be wider, increasing {{the cost of the}} road.

40|$|Excessive {{accumulation}} of sediment‐associated organic matter in river beds has detrimental impacts on aquatic ecology, including fish. Sediment and source {{samples were collected}} from 3 headwater tributaries of the River Itchen, in southern England. Near infrared spectra and bulk stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes were employed as fingerprint properties to quantify the relative contributions from catchment‐based (farmyard manures/slurries, damaged <b>road</b> <b>verges,</b> and septic tanks) and channel‐based (decaying instream vegetation, watercress farms, and fish farms) sources. The findings suggested that over {{the duration of the}} sampling period, the final estimated median relative contributions in the Candover Stream subcatchment were in the order: farmyard measures/slurries 74 % > decaying instream vegetation 15 % > watercress farms 6 % > septic tanks 3 % > damaged <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> 2 %. For the River Arle subcatchment, corresponding estimated median relative contributions were in the order: watercress farms 40 % > farmyard manures/slurries 28 % > decaying instream vegetation 21 % > fish farms 7 % > damaged <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> and septic tanks 2 % each. Similar contributions were estimated for the Tichborne Stream subcatchment: watercress farms 36 % > farmyard manures/slurries 26 % > decaying instream vegetation 26 % and damaged <b>road</b> <b>verges</b> and septic tanks at 6 % each. These source apportionment estimates will contribute to stakeholder engagement and targeted management interventions...|$|R
