The role of HBHA in macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection, however, is less well known. Here, we show that recombinant HBHA produced by Mycobacterium smegmatis effectively induces apoptosis in murine macrophages. DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, caspase activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage were observed in apoptotic macrophages treated with HBHA. Enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Bax activation were essential for HBHA-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by a <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>viability</b> <b>of</b> macrophages pretreated with N-acetylcysteine, a potent ROS scavenger, or transfected with Bax siRNA. HBHA is targeted to the mitochondrial compartment of HBHA-treated and M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages.

40|$|Transcriptional {{inactivation}} of {{the budding}} yeast centromere {{has been a}} widely used tool in studies of chromosome segregation and aneuploidy. In haploid cells when an essential chromosome contains a single conditionally inactivated centromere (GAL-CEN), cell growth rate is slowed and segregation fidelity is reduced; but colony formation is nearly 100 %. Pedigree analysis revealed that only 30 % of the time both mother and daughter cell inherit the GAL-CEN chromosome. The reduced segregation capacity of the GAL-CEN chromosome is further compromised upon reduction of pericentric cohesin (mcm 21 ∆), as reflected in a further diminishment of the Mif 2 kinetochore protein at GAL-CEN.

METHODS: A tract of about 2 cm of tubular gastric acellular matrix was inserted with bilateral anastomosis in an isolated ileal loop, which was located in endoabdominal position through a short subcutaneous tunnel. Twelve animals were analyzed at each of the time-points ranging from 1 to 6 weeks after surgery.

A proteome-wide screen performed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that Ypp 1 physically {{interacts with the}} plasma-membrane associated phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase Stt 4. Here we demonstrate that phenotypes of ypp 1 and stt 4 conditional mutants are identical, namely osmoremedial temperature sensitivity, hypersensitivity to cell wall destabilizers and defective organization of actin. We go on to show that overexpression of STT 4 suppresses the temperature sensitive growth defect of ypp 1 mutants. In contrast, overexpression of genes encoding the other two phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinases in yeast, Pik 1 and Lsb 6, do not suppress this phenotype. This implies a role for Ypp 1 in Stt 4 -dependant events at the plasma membrane, {{as opposed to a}} general role in overall metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate. Use of a pleckstrin homology domain sensor reveals there are substantially less plasma membrane associated 4 -phosphorylated phosphoinositides in ypp 1 mutants, in comparison to wild-type cells. Furthermore, in vivo labelling with [3 H]inositol indicates a dramatic reduction in the level of phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate in ypp 1 mutants. This is the principal cause of lethality at non-permissive conditions in ypp 1 mutants, as limiting the activity of the Sac 1 phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate phosphatase leads to <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>viability.</b> Additionally, the endocytic defect associated with elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 4 -phosphate in sac 1 Δ cells is restored in combination with a ypp 1 mutant, consistent with the opposing effects these two mutations have on levels of this phosphoinositide...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of modern {{therapeutic}} and technological advances, the surgeon {{has the ability to}} salvage even the most severely injured lower limbs. However, the success of replantation nowadays is no longer measured simply on the basis of <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>viability</b> but also on functional outcome compared with primary amputation with early prosthetic fitting, the risk to the patient during and after replantation and the overall time of treatment which should not exceed 2 years. Although every major limb replantation has to be considered individually, the decision-making process for reconstruction (replantation/revascularisation) versus amputation with subsequent early prosthetic fitting should be determined by objective criteria. Based on personal experience and an extensive literature search, an algorithm for treatment of amputation or amputation-like injuries to the lower leg has been developed and tested in a clinical study. A 100 % viability success rate was achieved. There was not only {{a significant increase in the}} percentage of ''functional extremities'' but also a doubling in grade I results. Moreover, there was a 50 % reduction in patients presenting a ''non-functional extremity'', and no patient required a secondary re-amputation. The replantation risk (e. g., risk of severe systemic disturbance during and/or after replantation) was about 16. 6 % (2 / 12) in our study. There was a significant decrease in the postoperative complication rate and no patient died during or after replantation.

Using a deficiency of the 67 A 2 to 67 D 11 - 13 region, Df(3 L) AC 1, we screened 8700 diepoxybutane-treated chromosomes and 7800 ethyl methanesulfonate-treated chromosomes for visible and lethal mutations throughout this interval and recovered 74 independent recessive lethal mutations, but no visible mutations. One of the lethal mutations, d 29 A 6, was identified as an overlapping deficiency extending from 66 F 3 to 67 B 1. An additional 6000 diepoxybutane-treated chromosomes were screened for lethality over d 29 A 6, yielding another four lethal mutations within the 67 A 2 -B 1 subinterval. These 78 lethal mutations, along with two others isolated in other laboratories, define 23 essential loci [...] 6 within the 67 A 2 -B 1 subinterval and 17 within the 67 A 2 to D 11 - 13 subinterval.

40|$|Wilson {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder of hepatic copper metabolism caused by mutations in {{a gene encoding}} a copper-transporting P-type ATPase. To elucidate {{the function of the}} Wilson protein, wild-type and mutant Wilson cDNAs were expressed in a Menkes copper transporter-deficient mottled fibroblast cell line defective in copper export. Expression of the wild-type cDNA demonstrated trans-Golgi network localization and copper-dependent trafficking of the Wilson protein identical to previous observations for the endogenously expressed protein in hepatocytes. Furthermore, expression of the Wilson cDNA rescued the mottled phenotype as evidenced by a reduction in copper accumulation and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> cell <b>viability.</b> In contrast, expression of an H 1069 Q mutant Wilson cDNA did not rescue the mottled phenotype, and immunofluorescence studies showed that this mutant Wilson protein was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Consistent with these findings, pulse–chase analysis demonstrated a 5 -fold decrease in the half-life of the H 1069 Q mutant as compared with the wild-type protein. Maintenance of these transfected cell lines at 28 °C resulted in localization of the H 1069 Q protein in the trans-Golgi network, suggesting that a temperature-sensitive defect in protein folding followed by degradation constitutes the molecular basis of Wilson disease in patients harboring the H 1069 Q mutation. Taken together, these studies describe a tractable expression system for elucidating the function and localization of the copper-transporting ATPases in mammalian cells and provide compelling evidence that the Wilson protein can functionally substitute for the Menkes protein, supporting the concept that these proteins use common biochemical mechanisms to effect cellular copper homeostasis...|$|R

In addition to enzyme substitution, we report the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>viability</b> through {{introduction of the}} human ADA gene. The ADA gene is subject to complex developmental and tissue-specific regulation. To include the cis-regulatory elements necessary for correct regulation of the human ADA gene, a large transgenic locus constituting the human ADA gene with 10 kb of 5 ′ and 4 kb of 3 ′ flanking sequences was generated by co-injection of two overlapping DNA fragments into murine zygotes. Probably {{as a result of}} extrachromosomal (homologous) recombination between the fragments, one of the two transgenic lines contained a reconstituted, functional human ADA gene. As in man, human ADA expression generally was low in these transgenic mice, but high in the thymus, spleen and gastro-duodenal part of the gut. Apparently, all cis-regulatory elements essential for a human expression pattern were incorporated in the transgene and were functional in the murine background. Similarly to man, the upper alimentary tract of the transgenic mice revealed low human ADA activity in contrast to extremely high levels of murine ADA. The human gene probably lacks the cis-regulatory elements that target high level murine ADA expression to the murine upper alimentary tract. ADA-deficient mice rescued by introduction of the human ADA transgene appeared histologically and immunologically normal. Apparently, human ADA can complement murine ADA in all tissues, even in the epithelium of the upper alimentary tract where human ADA activity is as much as 70 -fold lower than murine ADA activity in wild-type mice.

40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScMethamphetamine (MA), {{also known}} as ‘Tik’, has {{detrimental}} short- and long-term psychological and morphological effects on {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). The lipophilic nature of MA allows it to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which normally plays a protective role in limiting solute exchange (including narcotics) into the neuronal tissue. Numerous studies have indicated that MA not only crosses the BBB but is implicated in distorting its crucial role in that it increases the permeability of the endothelial cells and thereby compromises its core homeostatic function. The speculated mechanism by which MA elicits its effects involves elevated ROS production which may be reversed by antioxidant treatment. Rooibos herbal tea (Aspalathus linearis) which is well documented for its antioxidative properties and ROS scavenging abilities may therefore be the ideal candidate to reverse the harmful ROS-induced effects of MA. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the in vitro ameliorating potential of fermented rooibos (Rf) against the MA-induced effects on mouse brain endothelial (bEnd 5) cells by utilizing various assays (trypan blue exclusion and XTT viability assays) and physiological parameters (cell numbers, viability, monolayer permeability and cell cycle phases) over a period of 96 hrs. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test with P< 0. 05 denoted as significant. Once-off exposure to physiological MA concentrations and Rf resulted in % viability similar to controls by 96 hrs with suppression observed only when the cells were exposed to daily MA (0. 1 - 1000 μM) (P≤ 0. 0063). Exposure to supraphysiological concentrations (≥ 100 μM) of MA greatly suppressed viability (P≤ 0. 0463). Both daily and once-off treatment to the combinations initially resulted in increased viability however by 96 hrs was similar to- or exceeding the controls (P≤ 0. 0180). MA exposure also resulted in decreased live cell numbers (P≤ 0. 0339) with no effect when exposed to Rf by 96 hrs. The combinations resulted in cell numbers comparable to controls. Dose-dependent increases in electrical resistance were observed in response to singular MA and Rf treatment with lower MA concentrations displaying significant decreases (P≤ 0. 0064). Similar trends were observed with combinations however greater resistance was observed. Increased G 1 -phase populations (P≤ 0. 0495) in response to singular MA and Rf exposure was noted followed by decreased S-phase fractions (P≤ 0. 0356). While MA decreased G 2 -M phase cells (P≤ 0. 0498) it was unaffected by Rf. In contrast, the combination of MA and Rf decreased events in the G 1 -phase (P≤ 0. 0483), with an increased S-phase population (P≤ 0. 0415). In conclusion, the single compounds displayed mirroring effects, decreasing the cells’ permeability and causing G 1 -phase arrest. The modulatory effects of Rf in combination with MA was illustrated with the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>viability</b> and live cell numbers comparable to that of controls, and a more restrictive monolayer as well as reversal of the G 1 -phase arrest. Findings suggest that Rf may reverse the adverse effects of MA on the BBB...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{regulatory}} accepted alternative method to fully replace the Draize rabbit eye irritation test on the living animal in risk assessment of chemicals, testing of pharmaceuticals and toxicological safety assessment of cosmetics. The toxicity of chemical substances with severe eye irritation potential can be evaluated by several validated in vitro assays (BCOP-assay, ICE-method) {{in the framework of}} a tiered testing strategy that is recommended by the OECD. Very mild irritants may soon be identified by commercially available, three-dimensional models of the corneal epithelium that are currently under validation (EpiOcularTM Modell, SkinEthik HCETM Modell). However, the gap between mild and moderate eye irritation potential has to be closed by new alternative methods. The high sensitivity of the three-dimensional epithelial models, as well as the call for a mechanistically based method that considers the depth of the corneal injury and therefore covers the whole severity range of toxic reactions (Jester et al., 2001), demands an implementation of other corneal structures, such as stroma and endothelium, in an organotypic in vitro model of the human cornea. The aim of the present work was to optimise an already existing full-thickness-model of the human cornea, which was established by Zorn-Kruppa et al. from three SV 40 -immortalised human cell lines, with respect to their culture conditions and to adapt this endothelial (EC) -, keratocyte (HCK) - and epithelial (HCE) -cell line to a common serumfree culture medium. EC and HCK were characterised with regard to the preservation of organotypic features despite SV 40 -immortalisation, depending on the culture medium and its serum content. The EC-cell line was examined with regard to intercellular contact inhibition, which is an important feature of primary endothelial cells that allows them to establish and sustain an organotypic monolayer after reaching confluency (Joyce et al., 2002). The keratocyte cell line HCK was characterised in monolayer culture and after embedding in the stromal collagen-matrix. Phenotype and functionality were studied with respect to the presence of serum and growth factors. The work focussed on the HCK transformation into fibrotic phenotypes, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts after stimulation with TGF since those phenotypes are involved in corneal wound healing in vivo (Fini und Stramer, 2005, Jester et al., 1999). In contrast to the results for HCK and HCE, FCS showed to be mandatory for EC proliferation. Hence the adaptation of the EC to serum-free culture conditions was not possible. Contact inhibition experiments demonstrated that EC are unable to build an organotypic monolayer and to cease proliferation due to intercellular contact. This is possibly caused by the failure of mechanisms involved in cell cycle control {{as a result of the}} immortalisation by transfection with the SV 40 -large-T-antigen, a viral oncoprotein. Therefore, the morphologically exact rebuilding of an endothelial monolayer during the reconstruction of the three-dimensional full-thickness-model of the human cornea developed by Zorn-Kruppa is not possible for now. An implementation of the EC in a serum-free corneal construct could not be realized at the moment, as shown by the present results. After the adaptation to a newly developed serum-free medium the keratocyte cell line HCK retained its proliferation capacity and returned to a quiescent, non-contractile phenotype, caused by serum deprivation. The serum containing standard medium on the one hand stimulated HCK growth but on the other hand caused a loss of the keratocyte morphology and induced the transformation into fibrotic phenotypes, fibroblasts and -SMA containing myofibroblasts. This resulted from the TGF-content of fetal calf serum (FCS), which is known to stimulate myofibroblast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Embedding HCK in the stromal collagen-matrix reduced -SMA expression under serum-free as well as under serum-containing conditions, when compared to monolayer cultures. This finding points at a dedifferentiation of the myofibroblast phenotype and is possibly based on the loss of intercellular mechanotension due to collagen contact. The stimulation with TGF 1 (2 ng/ml) reduced HCK proliferation and led to a transformation into highly contractile myofibroblasts that caused a strong, macroscopically visible contraction of the stromal equivalents under serum-free as well as under serum containing conditions. In contrast, quiescent keratocytes are not contractile. Therefore, the area of the serum-free stromal equivalents remained constant. Consequently, stromal collagen-gel-contraction reflected the phenotype of the matrix-incorporated HCK. This facilitates the evaluation of the phenotypical changes in stroma-embedded HCK on the basis of their contractile features and makes the serum-free stromal construct an ideal component of a mechanistic in vitro wound-healing model. Finally, a complex in vitro test model was reconstructed from the stromal equivalent characterised in this work and an epithelium characterised by Seeber et al. (SE-model) as well as a simple three-dimensional epithelial model (EPI-model). Both models were built in cell culture inserts and their sensitivity against two detergents with known eye irritation potential was compared. Viablity measurements after exposure to TritonX- 100 showed an advantage of the SE-model over the EPI-model as the SE-model’s ET 50 -results were similar to those from commercially available epithelial models. In contrast, exposure to benzalkoniumchloride (BAC) revealed a comparably high sensitivity for both models. This finding is possibly related to an alternative toxicity mechanism of BAC, which is primarily based on strong cell membrane damage. Preliminary experiments focussing on the regenerative capacity of the EPI- and SE-model after tissue damage with TritonX- 100 did not show a complete <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> <b>viability</b> in between the 48 hours observation period which was possibly caused by a delayed toxic effect of TritonX- 100. To prove the suitability of those reconstructed in vitro cornea-models for the evaluation of the irritation potential of chemicals as well as for the detection of a persistent toxic effect by analysing tissue regeneration, a representative range of substances with different physico-chemical properties has still to be tested...|$|E
40|$|Populations of the red-cockaded {{woodpecker}} (Picoides borealis) {{have experienced}} massive declines since European colonization of North America. This {{is due to}} extensive habitat loss and alteration. Logging of old-growth pine forests and alteration of the fire regime throughout the historic range of the species were the primary causes of population decline. Listing of the red-cockaded woodpecker under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, and increased emphasis on management of non-game species have resulted in efforts to recover remnant populations of the red-cockaded woodpecker {{in many parts of}} its historic range. Due to extensive research and adaptive management initiatives much is now known about the elements required for both short- and long-term management of viable populations of red-cockaded woodpeckers. A short-term strategy is crucial because currently available habitat, in nearly all populations, is poor in 1 or more critical respects. Consequently, almost all populations require immediate attention in the short term, to insure suitable midstory and understory conditions, adequate availability of suitable cavities, and <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> demographic <b>viability</b> through improvements in number and distribution of breeding groups. Management techniques including artificial cavities, cavity entrance restrictors, translocation of birds, prescribed fire, and mechanical and chemical control of woody vegetation are available to achieve these needs. In the long term, cost-effective management of red-cockaded woodpecker populations requires a timber management program and prescribed fire regime that will produce and maintain the stand structure characteristic of high quality nesting and foraging habitat, so that additional intensive management specific to the woodpeckers is no longer necessary. Timber management that achieves this goal and still allows substantial timber harvest is feasible. The implementation of a red-cockaded woodpecker management strategy, as outlined above, represents appropriate ecosystem management in the fire-maintained pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States and will ultimately benefit a great number of additional species of plants and animals adapted to this ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|We have cloned and sequenced the {{structural}} genes encoding the delta 5, 6 sterol desaturase (ERG 3 gene) and the 14 alpha-methyl sterol demethylase (ERG 11 gene) from Candida glabrata L 5 (leu 2). Single and double mutants of these genes {{were created by}} gene deletion. The phenotypes of these mutants, including sterol profiles, aerobic viabilities, antifungal susceptibilities, and generation times, were studied. Strain L 5 D (erg 3 delta::LEU 2) accumulated mainly ergosta- 7, 22 -dien- 3 beta-ol, was aerobically viable, and remained susceptible to antifungal agents but had a slower generation time than its parent strain. L 5 LUD (LEU 2 erg 11 delta::URA 3) strains required medium supplemented with ergosterol and an anaerobic environment for growth. A spontaneous aerobically viable mutant, L 5 LUD 40 R (LEU erg 11 delta::URA 3), obtained from L 5 LUD (LEU 2 erg 11 delta::URA 3), was found to accumulate lanosterol and obtusifoliol, was resistant to azole antifungal agents, demonstrated some increase in resistance to amphotericin B, and exhibited a 1. 86 -fold increase in generation time in comparison with L 5 (leu 2). The double-deletion mutant L 5 DUD 61 (erg 3 delta::LEU 2 erg 11 delta::URA 3) was aerobically viable, produced mainly 14 alpha-methyl fecosterol, and had the same antifungal susceptibility pattern as L 5 LUD 40 R (LEU 2 erg 11 delta::URA 3), and its generation time was threefold {{greater than that of}} L 5 (leu 2). Northern (RNA) analysis revealed that the single-deletion mutants had a marked increase in message for the undeleted ERG 3 and ERG 11 genes. These results indicate that differences in antifungal susceptibilities and the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> aerobic <b>viability</b> exist between the C. glabrata ergosterol mutants created in this study and those sterol mutants with similar genetic lesions previously reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae...|$|R

40|$|Advances in genome {{sequencing}} and comparative genomics have uncovered ancient duplications in the genomes of many extant organisms. Evidence for large regional duplications is observed in eukaryotic organisms that include yeast, plants, fish, and humans. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of paralogous duplications within these organisms provides {{support for a}} single duplication event of the entire genome. The prevalence of genomic duplications lends credence to proposals that suggest that evolution is driven by polyploidization. This evidence must be balanced by recent experiments that demonstrate that newly formed polyploid genomes manifest problems in genomic stability, gene regulation, and development. In {{order to determine the}} consequences of nascent duplications of the entire genome, I created isogenic polyploid strains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These newly formed polyploids do not grow abnormally during exponential growth. Furthermore, they are not increased or decreased in their sensitivity to a variety of stresses including oxidative stress, high osmolarity, salt stress, toxic ions, and growth at high temperatures. However, polyploid strains of S. cerevisiae rapidly lose <b>viability</b> under conditions <b>of</b> nutrient deprivation. In contrast to isogenic haploids that remain viable for weeks and even months, tetraploid yeast are completely inviable after approximately 10 - 15 days in synthetic media. Analysis of the growth patterns of haploid and tetraploid cells during stationary phase reveals that tetraploids are defective for growth arrest during nutrient deprivation. (cont.) Furthermore, alterations that impede their inappropriate mitotic growth, such as deletion of the G 1 cyclin, CLN 3, can restore viability in tetraploids during stationary phase. The stationary phase defects found in tetraploid cells are notably similar to those observed in haploid cells that constitutively activate the glucose sensing Ras/cAMP pathway. In addition, all of these defects are suppressed by overexpression of the Ras/cAMP pathway inhibitor, RPII. Although these data suggest a role for RPIH in the <b>restoration</b> <b>of</b> tetraploid <b>viability,</b> the precise function remains elusive. Nevertheless, RPI 1 may define a compensatory change that permits the survival of nascent polyploid organisms. by Alexis Albert Andalis. Thesis (Ph. D.)
