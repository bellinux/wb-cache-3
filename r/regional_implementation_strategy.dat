40|$|This {{document}} {{provides suggestions}} for an overall strategic framework to achieve {{implementation of the}} Code of Practice for Forest Harvesting in Asia-Pacific. Once implemented the Code will optimise the benefits offered by the region's natural production forests and contribute to their sustainable management for the continuing benefit of {{the community as a}} whole. The goals and objectives of this Regional Strategy are expressed as eight strategies for implementation. (1) Encourage appropriate public and political support for implementation of the Code. (2) Develop awareness and support for the Code at the regional and national policy- making levels by stakeholders. (3) Development of a forest sector that is educated and trained in Code implementation. (4) Encourage {{the development and implementation of}} national codes based on the Asia-Pacific Code. (5) Establishment of demonstration and training forests. (6) Implementation of monitoring and auditing systems. (7) Collation of past and present research results allowing development of appropriate research activities and directions in support of sustainable forest management. (8) Further development and implementation of sustainable forest management practices in Asia-Pacific. A time frame for implementation of the <b>Regional</b> <b>Implementation</b> <b>Strategy</b> has also been detailed.

40|$|Triage is an {{efficient}} system that emergency departments (EDs) use {{to sort out}} presenting patients {{on the basis of}} the speed with which they need treatment. Because triage is not used consistently in the EDs of Latium, a region in central Italy, the regional Public Health Agency (PHA) planned and implemented a regional model of triage in all EDs. This manuscript describe the <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy.</b> The PHA activated the "Regional Triage Program [...] RTP" including: development and testing of a "triage section" in the computerized EDs clinical chart; production of an operational handbook for the RTP for triage health professionals (HPs); implementation of an continuum educational program on the "RTP" in all EDs of Latium. The computerized triage section was tested and implemented in all EDs in the region. The handbook for triage HPs was produced. The educational program, has been ongoing since 2008 in all regional EDs. Selected HPs, identified as "facilitators", were trained on how to implement the RTP. They will organize, in their own EDs, small groups of nurses to conduct on-site training of the RTP. The RTP was received with enthusiasm by most HPs, however its introduction into current practice could be hampered by organizational/structural problems and conflicts between nurses and doctors. Next actions of the regional program will be to overcome the possible above mentioned troubles...|$|E
40|$|Background: Postgraduate medical {{education}} (PGME) curricula are being redesigned across the western world. Aim: This {{study examined the}} implementation process (what works where and why) of new competency-based PGME curricula and relevant factors influencing this process. Methods: In a nationwide project (2006 - 2010) in the Netherlands, competency-based PGME curricula were implemented for residents in Pediatrics and Obstetrics & Gynecology. The authors conducted 25 semi-structured interviews and used a multi-level theoretical framework to guide coding. Results: The implementation process proved to be highly dynamic, non-linear, and influenced by many factors. These could be divided into attributes of the innovations/adopters, the implementation process, and the organization. The context determined the speed, quality, {{and direction of the}} process and how a factor affected the process. Conclusions: We identified specific features of PGME innovation: the challenge of implementing other competencies than that of the medical expert; the importance of <b>regional</b> <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> and educational support; the balance between training and patient care; and the need for regional inter-organizational networks of hospitals. The authors recommend: design the curriculum with the needs of the users in mind; facilitate knowledge sharing; organize educational support; translate the national curriculum to the local workplace; and promote regional inter-organizational networks between hospitals...|$|R

40|$|Preface In {{the region}} of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), {{population}} ageing is the dominant demographic trend of this century. Simultaneously, other pertinent demographic developments such as declining fertility, increasing age at family formation, and changing family patterns also challenge many areas of public policy. The policy responses have to include reconciliation of work and family life and measures to facilitate flexibility in life-course transitions among education, work and retirement. Equally important is to promot intergenerational solidarity and collaboration, and ensure gender equality in family, community and society at large. In the UNECE <b>Regional</b> <b>Implementation</b> <b>Strategy</b> for the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (2002) and in the León Ministerial Declaration “A Society for All Ages: Challenges and Opportunities” (2007), UNECE member States have committed themselves to respond to challenges and opportunities of their ageing societies. In 2008, UNECE established the Working Group on Ageing – an intergovernmental body with the mandate to coordinate and streamline implementation of major international policy documents on ageing. In order to provide knowledge base for population policy measures, the UNECE initiated in 2000 and continue to coordinate the Generations and Gender Programme (GGP). GGP has two main pillars: the first pillar is the system of national Generations and Gender Surveys (GGS), and the second pillar is the contextual database that provides information on macrolevel factors influencing demographic trends. GGP also serves as an important source of data in various programme elements of the Working Group on Ageing. One of the many international research initiatives based on GGP data is the Multilinks project led by the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute. Multilinks is specifically designed to support sound policymaking through new insights into how changing social contexts are affecting social integration and intergenerational solidarity in different European countries. Relying on the conceptual framework of that project, and based on the examples of policies and programmes from UNECE countries, the Working Group on Ageing held an in-depth discussion on intergenerational relationships at its second meeting in 2009. This report is derived from this in-depth discussion. It also summarises the most relevant research findings in the area of intergenerational family relationships. UNECE is grateful to the author and UNECE member States for contributing to this report. UNECE also wishes to acknowledge the financial support from the European Commission, which was essential for establishing and functioning the Multilinks research project. It is expected that this report will be of interest to a broad audience concerned with matters of intergenerational relationships, and will increase awareness about the need for policy measures for promoting greater solidarity among family members of all ages...|$|E
40|$|Public Policy and Ageing in Northern Ireland: Identifying Levers for Change Judith Cross, Policy Officer {{with the}} Centre for Ageing Research Development in Ireland (CARDI) ��������Introduction Identifying {{a broad range}} of key public policy {{initiatives}} as they relate to age can facilitate discussion and create new knowledge within and across government to maximise the opportunities afforded by an ageing population. This article looks at how examining the current public policy frameworks in Northern Ireland can present opportunities for those working in this field for the benefit of older people. Good policy formulation needs to be evidence-based, flexible, innovative and look beyond institutional boundaries. Bringing together architects and occupational therapists, for example, has the potential to create better and more effective ways relevant to health, housing, social services and government departments. Traditional assumptions of social policy towards older people have tended to be medically focused with an emphasis on care and dependency. This in turn has consequences for the design and delivery of services for older people. It is important that these assumptions are challenged as changes in thinking and attitudes can lead to a redefinition of ageing, resulting in policies and practices that benefit older people now and in the future. Older people, their voices and experiences, need to be central to these developments. The Centre for Ageing Research and Development in Ireland The Centre for Ageing Research and Development in Ireland (CARDI) (1) is a not for profit organisation developed by leaders from the ageing field across Ireland (North and South) including age sector focused researchers and academics, statutory and voluntary, and is co-chaired by Professor Robert Stout and Professor Davis Coakley. CARDI has been established to provide a mechanism for greater collaboration among age researchers, for wider dissemination of ageing research information and to advance a research agenda relevant to the needs of older people in Ireland, North and South. Operating at a strategic level and in an advisory capacity, CARDI�۪s work focuses on promoting research co-operation across sectors and disciplines and concentrates on influencing the strategic direction of research into older people and ageing in Ireland. It has been strategically positioned around the following four areas: Identifying and establishing ageing research priorities relevant to policy and practice in Ireland, North and South;Promoting greater collaboration and co-operation on ageing research in order to build an ageing research community in Ireland, North and South;Stimulating research in priority areas that can inform policy and practice relating to ageing and older people in Ireland, North and South;Communicating strategic research issues on ageing to raise the profile of ageing research in Ireland, North and South, and its role in informing policy and practice. Context of Ageing in Ireland Ireland �۪s population is ageing. One million people aged 60 and over now live on the island of Ireland. By 2031, it is expected that Northern Ireland�۪s percentage of older people will increase to 28 % and the Republic of Ireland�۪s to 23 %. The largest increase will be in the older old; the number aged 80 + is expected to triple by the same date. However while life expectancy has increased, {{it is not clear that}} life without disability and ill health has increased to the same extent. A growing number of older people may face the combined effects of a decline in physical and mental function, isolation and poverty. Policymakers, service providers and older people alike recognise the need to create a high quality of life for our ageing population. This challenge can be meet by addressing the problems relating to healthy ageing, reducing inequalities in later life and creating services that are shaped by, and appropriate for, older people. Devolution and Structures of Government in Northern Ireland The Agreement (2) reached in the Multi-Party Negotiations in Belfast 1998 established the Northern Ireland Assembly which has full legislative authority for all transferred matters. The majority of social and economic public policy such as; agriculture, arts, education, health, environment and planning is determined by the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont. There are 11 Government Departments covering the main areas of responsibility with 108 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLA�۪s). The powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly do not cover ��� reserved�۪ matters or ��� excepted�۪ matters. These are the responsibility of Westminster and include issues such as, tax, social security, policing, justice, defence, immigration and foreign affairs. Northern Ireland has 18 elected Members of Parliament (MP�۪s) to the House of Commons. Public Policy Context in Northern Ireland The economic, social and political consequence of an ageing population is a challenge for policy makers across government. Considering the complex and diverse causal factors that contribute to ageing in Northern Ireland, there are a number of areas of government policy at regional, national and international levels that are likely to impact in this area. International The Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (3) and the Research Agenda on Ageing for the 21 st Century (4) provide important mechanisms for furthering research into ageing. The United Kingdom has signed up to these. The Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing commits member states to a systematic review of the Plan of Action through Regional Implementation Strategies. The United Kingdom�۪s <b>Regional</b> <b>Implementation</b> <b>Strategy</b> covers Northern Ireland. National At National level, pension and social security are high on the agenda. The Pensions Act (5) became law in 2007 and links pensions increases with earnings as opposed to prices from 2012. Additional credits for people raising children and caring for older people to boost their pensions were introduced. Some protections are included for those who lost occupational pensions as a result of underfunded schemes being wound up before April 2005. In relation to State Pensions and benefits, this Act will bring changes to state pensions in future. The Act now places the Pension Credit element which is up-rated in line with or above earnings, on a permanent, statutory footing. Regional At regional level there are a number of age related public policy initiatives that have the potential to impact positively on the lives of older people in Northern Ireland. Some are specific to ageing such as the Ageing in an Inclusive Society (6) and others by their nature are cross-cutting such as Lifetime Opportunities: Governments Anti-Poverty Strategy for Northern Ireland (7). The main public policy framework in Northern Ireland is the Programme for Government: Building a Better Future, 2008 - 2011 (PfG) (8). The PfG, is the overarching high level policy framework for Northern Ireland and provides useful principles for ageing research and public policy in Northern Ireland. The PfG vision is to build a peaceful, fair and prosperous society in Northern Ireland, with respect for the rule of law. A number of Public Service Agreements (PSA) aligned to the PfG confirm key actions that will be taken to support the priorities that the Government aim to achieve over the next three years. For example objective 2 of PSA 7 : Making Peoples�۪ Lives Better: Drive a programme across Government to reduce poverty and address inequality and disadvantage, refers to taking forward strategic action to promote social inclusion for older people; and to deliver a strong independent voice for older people. The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) have recently appointed an Interim Older People�۪s Advocate, Dame Joan Harbison to provide a focus for older peoples issues across Government. Ageing in an Inclusive Society is the cross-departmental strategy for older people in Northern Ireland and was launched in March 2005. It sets out the approach to be taken across Government to promote and support the inclusion of older people. The vision coupled with six strategic objectives form the basis of the action plans accompanying the strategy. The vision is: ���To ensure that age related policies and practices create an enabling environment, which offers everyone the opportunity to make informed choices so that they may pursue healthy, active and positive ageing. �۝ (Ageing in an Inclusive Society, Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, 2005) Action planning and maintaining momentum across government in relation to this strategy has proved to be slower than anticipated. It is proposed to refresh this Strategy in line with Opportunity Age ��� meeting the challenges of ageing in the 21 st Century (9). There are a number of policy levers elsewhere which can also be used to promote the positive aspects of an ageing society. The Investing for Health (10) and A Healthier Future:A 20 Year Vision for Health and Well-being in Northern Ireland (11), seek to ensure that the overall vision for health and wellbeing is achievable and provides a useful framework for ageing policy and research in the health area. These health initiatives have the potential to positively impact on the quality of life of older people and provide a useful framework for improving current policy and practice. In addition to public policy initiatives, the anti-discrimination frameworks in terms of employment in Northern Ireland cover age as well as a range of other grounds. Goods facilitates and services are currently excluded from the Employment Equality (age) Regulations (NI) 2006 (12). Supplementing the anti-discrimination measures, Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (13), unique to Northern Ireland, places a statutory obligation on public authorities in fulfilling their functions to promote equality of opportunity across nine grounds, one of which is age(14). This positive duty has the potential to make a real difference to the lives of older people in Northern Ireland. Those affected by policy decisions must be consulted and their interests taken into account. This provides an opportunity for older people and their representatives to participate in public policy-making, right from the start of the process. Policy and Research Interface ���Ageing research is vital as decisions in relation to policy and practice and resource allocation will be made on the best available information�۝. (CARDI�۪s Strategic Plan 2008 - 2011) As outlined earlier, CARDI has been established to bridge the gap to ensure that research reaches those involved in making policy decisions. CARDI is stimulating the ageing research agenda in Ireland through a specific research fund that has a policy and practice focus. My work is presently focusing on helping to build a greater awareness of the key policy levers and providing opportunities for those within research and policy to develop closer links. The development of this shared understanding by establishing these links between researchers and policy makers is seen as the best predictor for research utilization. It is important to acknowledge and recognise that researchers and policy makers operate in different institutional, political and cultural contexts. Research however needs to ���resonate�۪ with the contextual factors in which policy makers operate. Conclusions Those working within the public policy field recognise all too often that the development of government policies and initiatives in respect of age does not guarantee that they will result in changes in actual provision of services, despite Government recommendations and commitments. The identification of public policy initiatives as they relate to age has the potential to highlight persistent and entrenched difficulties that social policy has previously failed to address. Furthermore, the identification of these difficulties can maximise the opportunities for progressing these across government. A focus on developing effective and meaningful targets to ensure measurable outcomes in public policy for older people can assist in this. Access to sound, credible and up-to-date evidence will be vital in this respect. As well as a commitment to working across departmental boundaries to effect change.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{effective}} implementation of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) depends critically {{on the extent}} to which the strategies that are deployed for implementing the guidelines promote provider acceptance of CPGs. Such <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> can be classified into two types based on whether they primarily target providers (e. g., academic detailing, grand rounds presentations) or the work context (e. g., computer reminders, modifications to forms). This study investigated the independent and joint effects of these two types of <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> on provider acceptance of CPGs. Methods Surveys were mailed to a national sample of providers (primary care physicians, physician assistants, nurses, and nurse practitioners) and quality managers selected from Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs). A total of 2, 438 providers and 242 quality managers from 123 VAMCs participated. Survey items measured <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> and provider acceptance (e. g., guideline-related knowledge, attitudes, and adherence) for three sets of CPGs [...] chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, and major depressive disorder. The relationships between <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> types and provider acceptance were tested using multi-level analytic models. Results For all three CPGs, provider acceptance increased with the number of <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> of either type. Moreover, the number of workflow-focused strategies compensated (contributing more strongly to provider acceptance) when few provider-focused strategies were used.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prognostic {{models in}} {{reproductive}} medicine {{can help to}} identify subfertile couples who would benefit from fertility treatment. Expectant management in couples with {{a good chance of}} natural conception, i. e., tailored expectant management (TEM), prevents unnecessary treatment and is therefore recommended in international fertility guidelines. However, current implementation is not optimal, leaving room for improvement. Based on barriers and facilitators for TEM that were recently identified among professionals and subfertile couples, we have developed a multifaceted <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy.</b> The goal {{of this study is to}} assess the effects of this <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> on the guideline adherence on TEM. METHODS/DESIGN: In a cluster randomized trial, 25 clinics and their allied practitioners units will be randomized between the multifaceted <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> and care as usual. Randomization will be stratified for in vitro fertilization (IVF) facilities (full licensed, intermediate/no IVF facilities). The effect of the <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy,</b> i. e., the percentage guideline adherence on TEM, will be evaluated by pre- and post-randomization data collection. Furthermore, there will be a process and cost evaluation of the <b>strategy.</b> The <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> will focus on subfertile couples and their care providers i. e., general practitioners (GPs), fertility doctors, and gynecologists. The <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> addresses three levels: patient level: education materials in the form of a patient information leaflet and a website; professional level: audit and feedback, educational outreach visit, communication training, and access to a digital version of the prognostic model of Hunault on a website; organizational level: providing a protocol based on the guideline. The primary outcome will be the percentage guideline adherence on TEM. Additional outcome measures will be treatment-, patient-, and process-related outcome measures.

These were used to develop a tailored <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> using the Innovation-Contingency Model. Then, this strategy was assessed on its perceived feasibility by members of the organization it was tailored to. Method. This study had a sequential embedded QUAN(qual) mixed-methods design. Implementation diagnostics were examined quantitatively by use of six self-reported questionnaires. The perceived feasibility of the tailored <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> was assessed qualitatively in a focus group. Results of both types of data were combined by use of interpretive integration. For both methods, participants were selected by purposive sampling. Results. Implementation diagnostics (N= 96) indicated that there was lack of shared perceptions of person-centred care and team- and development-orientedness needed further development. Therefore, a consensus strategy followed by a co-evolution strategy was developed. This tailored <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> was deemed feasible by members of the organization (N= 8) it was tailored to. Conclusions. In this study, the Innovation-Contingency model’s method was refined. This method {{led to the development of}} a feasible <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> to reach a person-centred culture change. Recommendations. To improve elderly care in the organization, the developed tailored <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> should be used. Mixed-method design is recommended for future implementation research...|$|R

Expectant management in couples with {{a good chance of}} natural conception, i. e., tailored expectant management (TEM), prevents unnecessary treatment and is therefore recommended in international fertility guidelines. However, current implementation is not optimal, leaving room for improvement. Based on barriers and facilitators for TEM that were recently identified among professionals and subfertile couples, we have developed a multifaceted <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy.</b> The goal {{of this study is to}} assess the effects of this <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> on the guideline adherence on TEM. In a cluster randomized trial, 25 clinics and their allied practitioners units will be randomized between the multifaceted <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> and care as usual. Randomization will be stratified for in vitro fertilization (IVF) facilities (full licensed, intermediate/no IVF facilities). The effect of the <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy,</b> i. e., the percentage guideline adherence on TEM, will be evaluated by pre- and post-randomization data collection. Furthermore, there will be a process and cost evaluation of the <b>strategy.</b> The <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> will focus on subfertile couples and their care providers i. e., general practitioners (GPs), fertility doctors, and gynecologists. The <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> addresses three levels: patient level: education materials in the form of a patient information leaflet and a website; professional level: audit and feedback, educational outreach visit, communication training, and access to a digital version of the prognostic model of Hunault on a website; organizational level: providing a protocol based on the guideline. The primary outcome will be the percentage guideline adherence on TEM. Additional outcome measures will be treatment-, patient-, and process-related outcome measures. This study will provide evidence about the effectiveness and costs of a multifaceted <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> to improve guideline adherence on TEM.

40|$|Functional {{reactive}} programming (FRP) is {{an elegant}} approach to declaratively specify reactive systems. However, the powerful abstractions of FRP have historically {{made it difficult}} to predict and control the resource usage of programs written in this style. In this paper we give a simple type theory for higher-order functional reactive programming, as well as a natural <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> for it. Our type theory simplifies and generalizes prior type systems for reactive programming. At the same time, we give a an efficient <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> which eagerly deallocates old values, ruling out space and time leaks, two notorious sources of inefficiency in reactive programs. Our language neither restricts the expressive power of the FRP model, nor does it require a complex substructural type system to track the resource usage of programs. We also show that for programs well-typed under our type system, our <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> of eager deallocation is safe: we show the soundness of our type system under our <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy,</b> using a novel step-indexed Kripke logical relation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> are {{the ways}} in which {{information}} about a new service innovation are shared with those employees who must execute on the innovation. This article examines the relationship between innovation success and the frequency of use of various <b>strategies</b> for the <b>implementation</b> of two specific nationwide service innovations in the North American hotels of a global lodging chain. Cost and service quality–based innovations were found to rely on different <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies,</b> suggesting that the connection between an <b>implementation</b> <b>strategy</b> and success depends on the type of innovation. In the hotel chain studied, the most successful strategy for implementing quality innovations was individual counseling, while rewards and focus groups were most strongly associated with success when implementing cost-based innovations. A mix of execution <b>strategies</b> including <b>implementation</b> by persuasion, leader intervention, participation, and even edict were linked to service innovation success. Participative employee-centered <b>implementation</b> <b>strategies</b> emerged as the most critical in the diffusion of service innovations...|$|R
