The freeze on U.S. economic aid, the suspension of the Commercial Import Program and various capital works initiatives were lifted. The United States quickly moved to recognise Thơ and Minh.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jews and other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosed with a {{brain tumor}} in March 2017, Noriega {{suffered}} complications during surgery, and died two months later. Generally described as a military dictatorship, Noriega's rule in Panama was marked by <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> media, {{an expansion of the}} military, and the persecution of political opponents, effectively controlling the outcomes of any elections. He was known for his complicated relationship with the U.S., being described as being its ally and nemesis at the same time. He has been called one of the best-known dictators of his time, and compared to authoritarian rulers such as Muammar Gaddafi and Augusto Pinochet.|$|E

5|$|Luigi Pirandello's 1913 novel I vecchi e {{i giovani}} (The Old and the Young) retraces {{the history of}} the failure and <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fasci Siciliani in the period from 1893-94. Although Pirandello was not an active member of this movement, he had close ties of {{friendship}} with some of its leading ideologists: Rosario Garibaldi Bosco, Enrico La Loggia, Giuseppe De Felice Giuffrida and Francesco De Luca.|$|E
5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief {{in the existence of}} a superior master race. The Nazis postulated the existence of a racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and were responsible for the exploitation and <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aryan race.|$|E
5|$|The social <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1950s {{resulted}} in a cultural revolution in Greenwich Village. A cohort of poets, later named the Beat poets, wrote about the evils of the social organization at the time, glorifying anarchy, drugs, and hedonistic pleasures over unquestioning social compliance, consumerism, and closed mindedness. Of them, Allen Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs—both Greenwich Village residents—also wrote bluntly and honestly about homosexuality. Their writings attracted sympathetic liberal-minded people, as well as homosexuals looking for a community.|$|E

5|$|Born in Johannesburg {{and brought}} up near London, Clarke joined the Royal Artillery as an officer in 1916 but {{transferred}} to the Royal Flying Corps after finding {{he was too young}} to fight in France. He spent the First World War learning to fly, first in Reading and then Egypt. Clarke returned to the Royal Artillery in 1919 and had a varied career doing intelligence work in the Middle East. In 1936 he was posted to Palestine, where he helped organise the British <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1936 Arab uprising. During the Second World War, Clarke joined John Dill's staff and proposed and helped implement, an idea for commando raids into France– an early form of the British Commandos.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E
5|$|Although it had {{abandoned}} the cause of Poniatowski's reforms, the Familia did not receive the support it expected from the Russians, who continued to press for the dissidents' rights. Meanwhile, some factions now rallied {{under the banner of}} the Bar Confederation, aimed against the dissidents, Poniatowski and the Russians. After an unsuccessful attempt to find allies in Western Europe (France, England and Austria), Poniatowski and the Familia {{had no choice but to}} rely more heavily on the Russian Empire, which treated Poland as a protectorate. In the War of the Bar Confederation (1768–1772), Poniatowski supported the Russian army's <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bar Confederation. In 1770, the Council of the Bar Confederation proclaimed him dethroned. The following year, he was kidnapped by Bar Confederate sympathizers and briefly held prisoner outside of Warsaw, but managed to escape. Faced with the weakness of Poland and continuing chaos, Austria, Russia and Prussia decided to intervene militarily, in exchange for significant territorial concessions from the Commonwealth – a decision they made without consulting Poniatowski or other Polish parties.|$|E

5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Ruanda-Urundi (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a UN Trust Territory after the Second World War, with {{a mandate to}} oversee eventual independence. Tension escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 Rwandan Revolution: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses, forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a referendum in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy. Rwanda was separated from Burundi and gained independence in 1962. Cycles of violence followed, with exiled Tutsi attacking from neighbouring countries and the Hutu retaliating with large-scale slaughter and <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tutsi. In 1973, Juvénal Habyarimana took power in a military coup. Pro-Hutu discrimination continued, but there was greater economic prosperity and a reduced amount of violence against Tutsi. The Twa remained marginalised, and by 1990 were almost entirely {{forced out of the}} forests by the government; many became beggars. Rwanda's population had increased from 1.6million people in 1934 to 7.1million in 1989, leading to competition for land.|$|E
5|$|Thus Mu'tazilism became closely {{identified}} with the new regime of al-Mu'tasim, and adherence to Mu'tazilism was transformed into an intensely political issue, since to question it was to oppose {{the authority of the}} Caliph as the God-sanctioned imām. While Mu'tazilism found broad support, it was also passionately opposed by traditionalists, who held that the Quran's authority was absolute and unalterable as the literal word of God, as well as providing a vehicle for criticism by those who disliked the new regime and its elites. In the event, the active <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditionalists was without success, and even proved counterproductive: the beating and imprisonment {{of one of the most}} resolute opponents of Mu'tazilism, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, in 834, only helped to spread his fame. By the time al-Mutawakkil abandoned Mu'tazilism and returned to traditional orthodoxy in 848, the strict and conservative Hanbali school had emerged as the leading school of jurisprudence (fiqh) in Sunni Islam.|$|E
5|$|Van Roey {{made many}} of the church's {{resources}} available for hiding Jews, but was prevented from publicly condemning {{the treatment of the}} Jews by his peers, who feared a Nazi <b>repression</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church. German attempts to involve the Belgian authorities and local government in its implementation began to arouse protest from 1942. The Committee of Secretary-Generals, a panel of Belgian senior civil servants tasked with implementing German demands, refused from the outset to enforce anti-Jewish legislation. In June 1942, a conference of the 19 mayors of the Greater Brussels region refused to allow its officials to distribute yellow badges to Jews in their districts. At great personal risk, the mayors, led by Joseph Van De Meulebroeck, sent a letter protesting the decree to the German authorities on 5 June. The refusal of Brussels' council, and later that of the city of Liège, to distribute badges allowed many Jews to go into hiding before the deportations began.|$|E

50|$|Cadmium {{is known}} to be carcinogenic, {{possibly}} due to reduction of DNA repair.
