2500|$|Discovered by divers {{from the}} French Navy Diving School in 1967, the archaeological {{investigations}} of the Roman wreck at Madrague de Giens constituted the first large scale, “truly scientific underwater excavation carried out in France”. The wreck lies at around 18 to 20 metres depth {{off the coast of}} the small fishing port of La Madrague de Giens on the Giens peninsula, east of Toulon, on the southern Mediterranean coast of France. Sunk around 75-60 BCE, the vessel {{has been found to be}} “a large merchantman of considerable tonnage - 400 tons deadweight with a displacement of around 550 tons”, making it one of the largest Roman wrecks excavated, [...] with only the wreck at Albenga, Italy (around 600 tons deadweight) exceeding it at the time of its discovery. [...] The vessel wrecked at Madrague de Giens measured around 40 metres in length; “showed a sharp bottom with “wine glass” section and a prominent keel creating a large leeboard”; displayed extended <b>raking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stem</b> and stern; and had two masts. The hull was characterised by a reverse stempost in the shape of a ram with a big cutwater which “must have given... craft high-performance sailing qualities”. The ship sunk while transporting a large cargo of wine and black glazed pottery from Italy. It is not known why it sank.|$|R
