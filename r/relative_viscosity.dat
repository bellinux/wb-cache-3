40|$|Couette flow {{has been}} widely used in many {{industrial}} and research processes, such as viscosity measurement. For the study on thixotropic viscosity, step-loading, which includes (1) step shear stress and (2) step velocity conditions, is widely used. Transient stages of Couette flow under both step wall shear stress and step wall velocity conditions were investigated. The <b>relative</b> coefficient of <b>viscosity</b> was proposed to reflect the transient process. <b>Relative</b> coefficients of <b>viscosity,</b> dimensionless velocities and dimensionless development times were derived and calculated numerically. This article quantifies the <b>relative</b> coefficients of <b>viscosity</b> as functions of dimensionless time and step ratios when the boundary is subjected to step changes. As expected, {{in the absence of}} step changes, the expressions reduce to being functions of dimensionless time. When step wall shear stresses are imposed, the <b>relative</b> coefficients of <b>viscosity</b> changes from the values of the step ratios to their steady-state value of 1. but With step-increasing wall velocities, the <b>relative</b> coefficients of <b>viscosity</b> decrease from positive infinity to 1.

During the very initial stage, the <b>relative</b> coefficients of <b>viscosity</b> under step wall velocity conditions is further from 1 than the one under step wall shear stress conditions but the former reaches 1 faster. Dimensionless development times grow with the step ratio under the step-rising conditions and approaches the constant value of 1. 785 under the step wall shear stress condition, and 0. 537 under the step wall velocity condition respectively. The development times under the imposed step wall shear stress conditions are always larger than the same under the imposed step wall velocity conditions...|$|R

40|$|Perturbation viscometry {{measures}} the pressure {{changes in a}} gas mixture flowing through a capillary tube when the flow is perturbed by adding a small flow {{of one of the}} pure components. The pressure upstream of the capillary rises because of the increase in flow and then rises or falls because of the change in viscosity. These pressure changes are measured accurately and their ratio gives the rate of change of viscosity with composition. The <b>relative</b> <b>viscosities</b> of the pure components of the gas mixtures are then calculated by integration of the gradients measured across the composition range. Measurements of the viscosity-composition relationships for binary gas mixtures of argon, nitrogen and helium at 98. 5 °C have been made together with some measurements on ternary mixtures. Perturbation viscometry gives more information than needed to just calculate the viscosity ratios. The extra information {{can be used in a}} series of checks to confirm the accuracy and consistency of the data produced. Consistency tests originally developed for binary gas mixtures have been applied to the measurements. Four more tests specific to ternary mixtures have been devised. The most rigorous of these involves integration of the gradient data between the same points over different paths. The closure error quantifies the error in each of the calculated <b>relative</b> <b>viscosities.</b> These tests show the results to be of very high quality with errors of less than 0. 2 %. The ability to identify and quantify the errors in this way is unique to perturbation viscometry and gives additional confidence.

For a specified temperature, the <b>relative</b> <b>viscosity</b> nonlinearly increases with enlarging diameter of SWCNTs. For a given diameter, the <b>relative</b> <b>viscosity</b> of water inside the SWCNTs increases with increasing temperature. An approximate formula of the <b>relative</b> <b>viscosity</b> with consideration of the size and the temperature effects is proposed, which can avoid the time-consuming MD simulations and should be significant for the research on the water flow inside the nanochannels. Furthermore, {{the amount of the}} hydrogen bonds of water confined in SWCNTs is also computed. The results suggest that the relative amount of the hydrogen bonds has similar profile with the <b>relative</b> <b>viscosity,</b> which demonstrates the present predictions of the <b>relative</b> <b>viscosity.</b> The computations in this study reveal that the trend of the size dependence is almost insensitive to the temperature, whereas the size-dependent extent could vary with the temperature.
