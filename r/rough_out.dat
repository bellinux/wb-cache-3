25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used to <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> coarse pitched gears and sprockets. It {{is commonly used}} on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|E
25|$|A hard hammerstone {{would first}} {{be used to}} <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> {{the shape of the}} tool from the stone by {{removing}} large flakes. These large flakes might be re-used to create tools. The tool maker would work around the circumference of the remaining stone core, removing smaller flakes alternately from each face. The scar created by the removal of the preceding flake would provide a striking platform for the removal of the next. Misjudged blows or flaws in the material used could cause problems, but a skilled toolmaker could overcome them.|$|E

25|$|The {{company also}} {{manufactures}} clothing {{and a full}} range of other cricket equipment. Many professional cricketers use its bats and have had endorsement deals with the company, including Quinton de Kock (South Africa), Shane Watson (Australia), England's former star spinner Graeme Swann, as well as former international captains Graeme Smith (South Africa), South Africa's high profile test opener, Steve Waugh (Australia), Stephen Fleming (New Zealand), Michael Vaughan (England) and Anil Kumble (India). Gunn & Moore bats are almost exclusively made in England, distinguishing the company others which manufacture a large percentage of their bats outside of Great Britain. Gunn and Moore use a former Mauser rifle factory copying lathe, originally used to make the stocks for small arms, to <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> the blades; the machine was brought back from Germany after World War 1.|$|E

2500|$|Carson {{described}} the Nexus energy ribbon {{as the true}} villain of the film; ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural analog. [...] "When creating something from scratch, it's always important to <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> the whole thing [...] {{because there are so}} many paths you can explore, it's easy to get bogged down," [...] recalled effects co-superviosr Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the [...] from The Undiscovered Country. Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory simulation. The airfoil-shaped core of the undulating ribbon was enhanced with electrical tendrils. To sell the ribbon's vastness in space shots where no sense of scale would be available, Seiden and George created a debris field of embers that trailed the ribbon.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} forms of keyseating was done by chiseling. The keyway is <b>roughed</b> <b>out</b> using a chisel and then filed to size; the key is tried frequently to avoid over filing. This technique is long, tedious, and rarely used anymore.|$|R

60|$|The {{sounds of}} keen {{activity}} stirred Festing's blood. He had {{a touch of}} constructive genius, but lack of specialized training had forced him {{into the ranks of}} the pioneers. Others must add the artistic finish and divide the prizes of ultimate victory; his part was to <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> the work and clear the way. But he was satisfied with this, and something in him thrilled as he heard in the crash of a blasting charge man's bold challenge to the wilderness. Kerr waited with a twinkle of understanding amusement while Festing looked about, and then took him up the hill.|$|E
60|$|When {{they reached}} the lake he found {{there would be some}} delay. They had covered the canoes with branches, but the pine-needles had {{withered}} off and the hot sun had opened the seams. Some of the thin planks were badly split, one had sprung away from its fastenings, and it would take a few days to repair the damage without proper tools. The caulking composition he had brought would not go round, and he had to send the Metis into the bush to look for gum to make the Indian pitch. Then it cost him a day's hard labor to <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> new plans with an ax and saw, and he afterwards found he must make a steaming-box to soften the wood so that it would bend into place.|$|E
50|$|Heyward's wife, playwright Dorothy Heyward, <b>roughed</b> <b>out</b> a stage {{adaptation}} of the novel that persuaded her husband of the story's dramatic possibilities.

During the 1990s, Orlando was pleased to discover that designer-typographer Rick Spanier, working on a Macintosh computer, could create polished Oda-like finishes of Orlando's roughs. These Orlando-Spanier collaborations were printed in DC's Superman Style Guide and other DC style guides.|$|R
25|$|The {{process is}} similar to that {{outlined}} for the universal milling machine except a gashing angle is not used. When gashing spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction. If a helical gear is being <b>roughed</b> <b>out,</b> then the table rotates and moves along the vertical axis to interpolate the helical path.|$|R

50|$|Davis {{worked with}} {{many kinds of}} wood, {{including}} mahogany, cedar and poplar, sometimes obtained from friends who worked as longshoremen on the Savannah docks. He typically worked {{without the aid of}} preliminary drawings, using hatchets and band saws to <b>rough</b> <b>out</b> the form before picking up a chisel or knife. He fashioned some of his tools himself, using metalworking skills he learned during a stint as a railroad blacksmith.|$|E

He had several tools made for him by blacksmiths at Peterâ€™s Valley Craft Center, for example, and {{in at least one}} case made a wooden prototype of a specialized gouge to communicate his exact requirements.|$|E

Modern machines use advanced CNC control systems and techniques. Charles DeVlieg entered the Machine Tool Hall of Fame for his work upon a highly precise model which he called a JIGMIL.
