50|$|The most {{persistent}} perennials spread by underground creeping rhizomes that can regrow {{from a tiny}} fragment. These include couch grass, bindweed, ground elder, nettles, <b>rosebay</b> <b>willow</b> <b>herb,</b> Japanese knotweed, horsetail and bracken, as well as creeping thistle, whose tap roots can put out lateral roots. Other perennials put out runners that spread along the soil surface. As they creep they set down roots, enabling them to colonise bare ground with great rapidity. These include creeping buttercup and ground ivy. Yet another group of perennials propagate by stolons- stems that arch back into the ground to reroot.

All the slopes are covered with copsewood, much of it oak, the tints of which are lovely shades of green in spring and golden-brown in early autumn. The whole is a place remarkable for masses of blossom. There are giant garlands of white wild cherry above in spring, and equally white anemone below; by and by an acre of primroses growing close together, not large, but wonderfully thick, a golden river of king- cup between banks of dog's mercury, later on whole glades of wild hyacinth, producing a curious effect of blue beneath the budding yellow green of the young birches with silver stems. Sheets of the scarlet sorrel by and by appear, and foxgloves of all sizes troop in the woods, and are succeeded by the rose bay <b>willow</b> <b>herb,</b> and lastly come perfect clouds of the little devils'-bit scabious.

Epilobium angustifolium L.) from Onagraceae {{family is}} a {{valuable}} medicinal plant {{that has been used}} in the treatment of urogenital disorders including BPH (Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy). The raw material is a rich source of polyphenols as well as steroids, triterpenoids and fatty acids. The extracts show pharmacological activities: anti-androgen, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial and analgesic properties. Due to frequent interspecific hybridization, plants collected in the wild display a diverse and variable content of active compounds. This poses a challenge in obtaining high quality and homogenous raw material. Application of the in vitro cultures and micropropagation techniques may offer a solution for alternative methods of cultivation. This work presents preliminary results of the implementation of Ch. angustifolium in vitro cultures to obtain raw material for the first time. Sterile seedlings were donors of explants, which were used for induction of multi-shoots culture according to a modified Turker’s protocol. Six different genotypes (lines) originating from root explants were chosen for clonal propagation. Efficiency of the elaborated method was 16 – 20 shoots per explants. Finally, over 3000 acclimatized plants were obtained and used for field crops...|$|R
2500|$|A [...] boar needs around 4,000–4,500 {{calories}} of food per day, {{though this}} required amount increases during winter and pregnancy, {{with the majority}} of its diet consisting of food items dug from the ground like underground plant material and burrowing animals. Acorns and beechnuts are invariably its most important food items in temperate zones, as they are rich in the carbohydrates necessary for the buildup of fat reserves needed to survive lean periods. In Western Europe, underground plant material favoured by boars includes bracken, <b>willow</b> <b>herb,</b> bulbs, meadow herb roots and bulbs, and the bulbs of cultivated crops. Such food is favoured in early spring and summer, but may also be eaten in autumn and winter during beechnut and acorn crop failures. Should regular wild foods become scarce, boars will eat tree bark and fungi, as well as visit cultivated potato and artichoke fields. Boar soil disturbance and foraging have been shown to facilitate invasive plants. Boars of the vittatus subspecies in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java differ from most other populations by their primarily frugivorous diet, which consists of 50 different fruit species, especially figs, thus making them important seed dispersers. The wild boar can consume numerous genera of poisonous plants without ill effect, including Aconitum, Anemone, Calla, Caltha, Ferula, and Pteridium.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} 77 growers, mainly in Hawkes Bay and Nelson, was {{undertaken}} {{during the summer}} of 1989 / 90. Personal interviews were conducted on each property. All growers were found to use herbicides for weed control, and all but one established herbicide strips with mown grass between. The major herbicide application period was spring. Three-quarters of growers relied on four herbicide formulations, amitrole, glyphosate, simazine and terbuthylazine/terbumeton. Of the residual herbicides used, 70 % were triazines. Grower knowledge about herbicides was found to be lacking. Grass species from the sub-family Paniceae were found to be the most problematic weeds, along with mallows, black nightshade, Californian thistle, tall <b>willow</b> <b>herb</b> and docks. These weeds were not adequately controlled by current weed control practices. Off-label use and herbicide damage to crop trees was noted. Growers were found to be applying herbicides through a wide array of equipment, through fan and off-centre nozzles with one to four nozzles on each boom. Only 37 % of sprayers were calibrated at least annually. During the survey 41 sprayers were calibrated, with only 17 % being correct within ± 5 % of intended application rate. Of those sprayers with errors over ± 5 % two-thirds were underapplying at mean error of 37 %, and one-third were overapplying at a mean error of 18. 1 %. Spray distribution patterns were found to be unacceptably uneven across the herbicide strip in most cases. Over 40 % of growers were not able to relate the actual amount of herbicide used to a target application rate per hectare. A lack of training in both chemical use for weed control and sprayer calibration was apparent, and 80 % of growers saw a need for a field manual.

40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of food poisonings and is known to cause human and animal diseases. It has been reported that C. perfringens has developed resistance to antibiotics. Antimicrobial properties of honey have been studied in order to confirm its action as a potential antimicrobial agent and also as a potential food preservative through inactivation, growth delay or growth prevention of food pathogenic microorganisms. This study had two different parts related on virulence of C. perfringens. In the first part of the study antimicrobial activity of five multifloral organic honeys from different parts of Finland and one multifloral honey originated from Argentina and Hungary were investigated against C. perfringens. Honeys were tested at the concentrations of 50 % (w/v), 25 % (w/v), 20 % (w/v), 15 % (w/v) and 10 % (w/v). For the antimicrobial assessment a disc diffusion method was used and zone of inhibition was expressed as diameter. The minimum concentrations (minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) needed for inhibition of bacterial growth were determined for honeys showing activity in dilutions of 50 %. Four of the studied honeys showed good inhibitory activity (diameter > 8 mm) compared to control sugar solution (diameter of 6. 1 ± 1. 5) against C. perfringens at the concentration of 50 % (w/v). All the active honeys were of Finnish origin. The broadest zone of inhibition was induced by North Carelien multifloral organic honey with <b>willow</b> <b>herb</b> as the main floral source (referred here as F) (diameter of 14, 3 mm ± 0. 6), followed by other North Carelien multifloral organic honey (diameter of 11 mm ± 2) with clover as the main floral source (referred here as E). In terms of MIC values North Carelien organic honey F was also the most efficient honey against C. perfringens and showed moderate antibacterial activity (diameter of 7 - 8 mm) even at 10 % (w/v). The other active honeys showed moderate inhibitory activity in the dilution of 15 %. To our knowledge this is the first report on the antimicrobial activity of organic honeys and antimicrobial activity of honey against C. perfringens. (Oinaala et al 2015) In the second part of the work C. perfringens isolates from healthy broilers and from broilers suffering from necrotic enteritis (NE) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method in order to determine the presence of gene coding the NE toxin B (NetB), a novel toxin that has been strongly associated with the pathogenesis of NE. The netB toxin gene was detected in 30 % isolates from broilers with necrotic enteritis and in 32. 5 % isolates from healthy broilers. In this study the presence of netB gene gives not enough information for predicting the virulence of C. perfringens isolates, thus, further investigations are needed...|$|R
