40|$|A {{pressurized}} liquid extraction (PLE) {{and high}} performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) method {{was developed for}} the qualitative determination of saponins {{in different parts of}} P. notoginseng, including rhizome, <b>root,</b> <b>fibre</b> root, seed, stem, leaf and flower. The samples were extracted using PLE. The analysis was achieved on a Zorbax SB-C 18 column with gradient elution of acetonitrile and 8 mM aqueous ammonium acetate as mobile phase. The mass spectrometer was operated in the negative ion mode using the electrospray ionization, and a collision induced dissociation (CID) experiment was also carried out to aid the identification of compounds. Forty one saponins were identified in different parts of P. notoginseng according to the fragmentation patterns and literature reports, among them, 21 saponins were confirmed by comparing the retention time and ESI-MS data with those of standard compounds. The results showed that the chemical characteristics were obviously diverse in different parts of P. notoginseng, which is helpful for pharmacological evaluation and quality control of P. notoginseng. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{turnip root fly}} (Delia floralis) is a pest insect in the {{northern}} temperate regions of the world. If uncontrolled, it can cause severe problems {{in the production of}} brassica crops. This thesis examines how intercropping of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and red clover (Trifolium pratense) affects the different life cycle stages of D. floralis. Such knowledge about the mechanisms involved is needed for developing intercropping systems with optimal pest reduction. A field trial was performed in Umeå, northern Sweden (63 º 45 ’N; 20 º 15 ’E), to study the effects of intercropping on D. floralis oviposition behaviour, and the impact of predators and parasitoids on D. floralis in the field. Intercropping was found to reduce D. floralis oviposition compared with monoculture. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial distribution of eggs within plots showed that the difference in egg numbers was greatest close to the border between the cultivation systems. This indicates that the effect of intercropping can be enhanced if D. floralis is provided with an alternative oviposition site. Natural enemies, in this case mainly predators, significantly reduced the final pupal numbers of D. floralis but this effect did not differ between the cultivation systems. However, the study showed {{that it is possible to}} retain the predation pressure in intercropped systems despite lower predator activity-densities and D. floralis egg numbers. A greenhouse experiment was performed to investigate effects of intercropping on development of D. floralis at different larval and intercropping densities and to analyse different aspects of host plant quality in the same system. It was found that D. floralis pupal weight decreased in response to both intercropping and larval density. This impaired larval development is likely to be explained by changes in host plant quality, which included decreased biomass, lower root nitrogen levels, higher <b>root</b> <b>fibre</b> content and altered glucosinolate concentrations. Information on plant responses to herbivory in competitive plant systems can be valuable in identifying quality aspects that are negative for insect development, which may further improve pest insect regulation in these systems...|$|E

40|$|Innervation of flexor muscles (the Brachialis and the biceps brachii) and an {{extensor}} (the triceps brachii) of the elbowjoint {{was examined}} in 61 dogs, 25 monkeys and 2 men. 1. Macroscopically the musculocutaneous nerve innervating the flexor muscles is usually formed from C_ 6 and C_ 7 (2 roots), and the radial nerve which innervates the extensors is from C_ 7, C_ 8 and T, (3 roots). Degeneration experiments show, however, that the ventral nerve fibres innervating the flexors {{are derived from}} C_ 6 to T, (4 segments), and the dorsal <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> are from C_ 5 to T_ 3 (7 segments). Further, the ventral <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> innervating extensors are derived from C_ 7 to T, (3 segments), and dorsal <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> are from C_ 6 to T_ 2 (5 segments). Thus, the extensor-muscle nerves originate 1 segment caudal than the flexor-muscle nerves, and the flexor and extensor muscles are innervated by more roots from the dorsal nerve fibres than those from the ventral fibres. 2. The ratios between myelinated nerve fibres to the extensors and those to the flexors are 1 : 0. 41 in dog, 1 : 0. 48 in green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops), 1 : 0. 64 in crab-eating monkey (Macaca cynomolga) and 1 : 0. 83 in man. It appears therefore that the higher the animals, the more {{the development of the}} flexor nerves. 3. Myelinated nerve fibres per gram of flexor and extensor muscles are 96. 9 and 48. 4 in number from dog, 203. 3 and 124. 2 from crab-eating monkey, and 152. 3 and 123. 1 from green monkey, respectively. Thus, the innervation rate of the flexor muscle nerves is always higher than that of the extensor. 4. The most of the myelinated nerve fibres innervating voluntary muscles are maximum-sized in dog, monkey and man. The more decrease in diameter of the myelinated nerve fibres the smaller in number of those fibres. No difference of the nerve fibre diameter is found between the flexor and extensor nerves. 5. The ratio between sensory <b>fibres</b> from dorsal <b>roots</b> and motor <b>fibres</b> from ventral <b>roots</b> is 58. 4 %: 41. 6 % in the flexor, and 69. 6 %: 30. 4 % in the extensor nerves in dog. Thus, the number of sensory nerve fibres always predominate over motor nerve fibres. There are relatively many motor nerve fibres in the flexor muscles than in the extensors, and, on the contrary, many sensory fibres in the extensors...|$|R

40|$|The {{length of}} internodes in bovine ventral spinal nerve <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> varies in an {{irregular}} pattern along {{the spinal cord}} with short internodes for the cervicothoracic and lumbosacral segments, and long internodes for the high cervical, thoracic and sacral segments.

Maximum internode length was determined at approximately 2400 microns; the longest internode found measured 2847 microns. The segmental variance in ventral root internode length in the cow differs from that in man or rat, which show a craniocaudal increase in internode length.

40|$|Histological {{studies were}} {{performed}} on Lewis rats with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) passively transferred by myelin basic protein (MBP) -sensitized syngeneic spleen cells {{in order to determine}} the relationship between demyelination and neurological signs. Neither inflammation nor demyelination was present on the day prior to the onset of neurological signs but both were present in the spinal roots and spinal cord on the day of onset of tail weakness (4 days after passive transfer). Demyelination and the neurological signs both increased over the next 48 h. There was evidence that the caudal roots were more severely affected than the rostral roots. The peripheral nerves were spared. Demyelination in the spinal cord was concentrated in the dorsal root entry and ventral root exit zones. The initial stages of repair of demyelinated spinal <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> by Schwann cells were observed on the earliest day that clinical recovery commenced (day 7). At this time some demyelinated fibres were closely associated with debris-free Schwann cells, and occasional fibres were completely invested by 1 - 2 layers of Schwann cell cytoplasm. Remyelination (compact myelin lamellae formation) by Schwann cells was first observed in the spinal roots on day 9. By the time of complete clinical recovery (day 11) the majority of affected spinal <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> had thin new myelin sheaths. Repair of central nervous system myelin by oligodendrocytes was slower than peripheral nervous system myelin repair. Investment of demyelinated spinal cord axons by oligodendrocytes was observed on day 9, and remyelination by these cells was seen on day 10. We conclude that the neurological signs of passively induced MBP-EAE can be accounted for by demyelination of the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal spinal roots and spinal cord root entry and exit zones, and that the subsequent clinical recovery can be explained by investment and remyelination of demyelinated peripheral and central nervous system fibres by Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes respectively...|$|R

40|$|Effects on single lumbar gamma-motoneurones, {{mediated}} via fibres {{running in}} the ventral roots, were studied by micro-electrode recording in cats anaesthetized with chloralose. Graded electrical stimulation of ventral roots or of peripheral nerves was used.

Soil bioengineering is an environmentally friendly method which employs vegetation {{to reinforce the}} soil in sloping terrain. The vegetation can contribute to slope stability in two ways, mechanical and hydrological. This paper demonstrates {{the effect of a}} vegetation root matrix on a soil slope and focuses on mechanical reinforcement using an example of vetiver grass. Vetiver grass (Vetiveria nemoralis A.

The growing rate of the vetiver roots and the root area ratios were observed during the tests. The cohesion and angle of internal friction of root-reinforced soils were determined from a standard direct shear apparatus and a large direct shear apparatus. A series of centrifuge tests was carried out to demonstrate the effect of vegetation on seepage- and rainfall-induced slope failures. The results indicate that the vetiver roots showed rapid growth within a year and that the shear strength of the root-reinforced soil was significantly increased by the bundle of roots.

Two of these (cases 3 and 4) began to recover voluntary movement in the limbs in a month or less, and showed complete clinical recovery in three and 10 months respectively. The other two (cases 1 and 2) began to recover proximal limb movements after three months, reached a plateau of recovery in about two years, and never recovered movements in the distal parts of the limbs, which underwent muscular atrophy. Patient 2 died 14 years after the acute illness and was examined post mortem. The difference in recovery is explained by supposing that in patients 3 and 4 the lesions consisted predominantly of segmental demyelination, whereas in patients 1 and 2 there was extensive axon destruction at a proximal level. Recovery in the latter depended upon nerve regeneration, which restored the power of the proximal muscles, but was too slow for effective reinnervation of distal muscles. This explanation is supported by post mortem findings in patient 2. A further observation in patient 2 was of degeneration of the posterior white columns of the spinal cord, which was not due to loss of posterior <b>root</b> <b>fibres.</b> It is believed that in such cases a prognosis as to ultimate recovery of muscle power can be made about a month after the acute phase, according to whether movement has begun to return in the distal parts of the limbs.

Immunocytochemical staining of TRPV 1 and NF 200, a marker for A-fibre neurons, was performed in the dorsal root ganglia L 6 –S 1. TNBS colitis significantly increased the response to colorectal distension of pelvic afferent C-fibres. BCTC did not significantly affect the C-fibre response in controls, but normalized the sensitized response in rats with colitis. TNBS colitis increased the spontaneous activity of C-fibres, an effect which was insensitive to administration of BCTC. TNBS colitis had no effect on Aδ-fibres, nor was their activity modulated by BCTC. TNBS colitis caused an immunocytochemical up-regulation of TRPV 1 receptors in the cell bodies of pelvic afferent NF 200 negative neurons.

40|$|Myelinated nerve fibres with {{a reduced}} safety factor for {{conduction}} due to demyelination are easily blocked by trains of impulses. To find out why, in vivo recordings from rat ventral <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> demyelinated with diphtheria toxin have been supplemented with in vivo and in vitro recordings from normal fibres. Despite a small rise in extracellular potassium activity, normal fibres were invariably hyperpolarized by intermittent trains of impulses. This hyperpolarization {{resulted in an}} increase in threshold and also in an enhancement of the depolarizing after-potential and the superexcitable period. Replacement of NaCl in the extracellular solution by LiCl completely blocked both the membrane hyperpolarization and the threshold increase which were normally observed during intermittent trains of impulses. At demyelinated nodes which were blocked by trains of impulses (10 - 50 Hz), conduction block was preceded by a rise in threshold current and {{in an increase in}} internodal conduction time, but by no detectable reduction in the outward current generated by the preceding node. It was found possible to prevent the threshold from changing during a train by automatic adjustment of a d. c. polarizing current. This 'threshold clamp' prevented the conduction failure and virtually abolished the changes in internodal conduction time. The threshold changes were attributed to hyperpolarization, as in normal fibres, since (a) the polarizing current required to prevent them was always a depolarizing current, and (b) they were accompanied by an increase in superexcitability. The post-tetanic depression that can follow continuous trains of impulses was attributed to the combination of increased threshold and enhanced superexcitable period due to hyperpolarization. It is concluded that the susceptibility of these demyelinated fibres to impulse trains is not due to a membrane depolarization induced by extracellular potassium accumulation but to a membrane hyperpolarization as a consequence of electrogenic sodium pumping. ...|$|R

The stretched intact nerve continued to function under a load of 65 grammes while conduction in the stripped specimen failed with loads of up to only 28 grammes; in each case motor responses in the field of the tested nerve failed when the elongation reached 25 per cent. In the present study stress-strain phenomena have been investigated in human spinal nerve roots which were selected for study because they differ in two significant respects from peripheral nerve trunks. Firstly the perineurium is absent and secondly the <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> run in parallel non-plexiform strands which are loosely held together by delicate connective tissue. By excluding, in this way, the perineurium and the funicular plexus formations of peripheral nerve trunks it was hoped to obtain some understanding of the contribution of these two features to the tensile strength of nerves. MATERIAL AND METHODS The anterior and posterior spinal roots of the third sacral nerve of adult subjects were selected for investigation. Specimens were obtained from the autopsy room within twelve hours of death and tested immediately. Fifteen anterior and seventeen posterior nerve roots were tested and the test length varied from 20 to 50 mm. The method employed for stretching the nerve roots and the collateral histological study to obtain cross-sectional areas were precisely the same as those reported in th...|$|R
40|$|The {{natural product}} willardiine is an AMPA {{receptor}} agonist. We {{have examined the}} structural changes required to convert willardiine into an antagonist at AMPA and kainate receptors. Structure–activity analysis {{has been carried out}} to discover the structural features required to increase the potency and/or selectivity of the antagonists at AMPA or kainate receptors. Reduction of the fast component of the dorsal root-evoked ventral root potential (fDR-VRP) has been used to investigate AMPA receptor antagonist activity. To examine antagonist activity at kainate receptors, the ability of compounds to depress kainate-induced depolarisations of dorsal <b>root</b> <b>fibres</b> was assessed. Blocking ionisation of the uracil ring by adding a methyl group to the N 3 position was not sufficient to convert willardiine into an antagonist. However, willardiine derivatives with a side-chain bearing a carboxylic acid group at the N 3 -position of the uracil ring could antagonise AMPA and kainate receptors. S stereochemistry was optimal for antagonism. When compounds with differing interacidic group chain lengths were compared, a group chain length of two methylene groups was preferable for AMPA receptor antagonism in the series of compounds bearing a carboxyalkyl side chain (UBP 275, UBP 277 and UBP 279 reduced the fDR-VRP with IC 50 values of 287 ± 41, 23. 8 ± 3. 9 and 136 ± 17 μM, respectively). For kainate receptor antagonism, two or three methylene groups were almost equally acceptable (UBP 277 and UBP 279 reduced dorsal root kainate responses with apparent KD values of 73. 1 ± 4. 5 and 60. 5 ± 4. 1 μM, respectively). Adding an iodo group to the 5 -position of UBP 277 and UBP 282 enhanced activity at kainate receptors (UBP 291 and UBP 301 antagonised kainate responses on the dorsal root with apparent KD values of 9. 83 ± 1. 62 and 5. 94 ± 0. 63 μM, respectively). The most useful antagonist identified in this study was UBP 301, which was a potent and ∼ 30 -fold selective kainate receptor antagonist. UBP 282 may also be of use in isolating a non-GluR 5 -mediated kainate response...|$|R
