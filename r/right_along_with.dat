[...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual.

500|$|Moving forward under a {{creeping}} barrage {{as they moved}} beyond Tokinotu, the 24th Infantry Battalion {{was the first to}} contact the Japanese, carrying out an attack against Japanese positions around Dawe's Creek on 17 April. Supported by a troop of Matilda tanks from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment, an artillery barrage which fired over 700 shells, two infantry companies—'C' and 'D'—from the 24th attacked the position while another—'A' Company—carried out a flanking manoeuvre to cut another track further north towards Kindara and Hatai. The left forward company—'D' Company—reached its objective without trouble; however, 'C' Company—on the <b>right</b> <b>along</b> <b>with</b> the troop of tanks—came up against stiff Japanese resistance and became bogged down. 'A' Company also became embroiled in heavy fighting along the Hatai track.

As night fell, 'C' Company dug in before resuming the attack the next morning. Engineers were brought forward, as was a bulldozer, and the gap was bridged. Amidst heavy fighting, the Australians forced their way across the creek. [...] By the time that the position had been taken in the afternoon and the infantry had advanced to the line of exploitation [...] beyond the creek, 37 Japanese had been killed for the loss of seven Australians killed and 19 wounded.
