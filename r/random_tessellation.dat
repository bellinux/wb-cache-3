40|$|With any max-stable {{random process}} η on X = Zd or Rd, we asso-ciate a <b>random</b> <b>tessellation</b> of the {{parameter}} space X. The construction {{relies on the}} Poisson point process representation of the max-stable process η which {{is seen as the}} pointwise maximum of a random col-lection of functions Φ = {φi, i ≥ 1 }. The tessellation is constructed as follows: two points x, y ∈ X are in the same cell if and only if there exists a function φ ∈ Φ that realizes the maximum η at both points x and y, i. e. φ(x) = η(x) and φ(y) = η(y). We characterize the distribution of cells in terms of coverage and inclusion probabilities. Most interesting is the stationary case where the asymptotic properties of the cells are strongly related to the ergodic properties of the non-singular flow generating the max-stable process. For example, we show that: i) the cells are bounded almost surely if and only if η is generated by a dissipative flow; ii) the cells have positive asymptotic density almost surely if and only if η is generated by a positive flow. We also provide a simple correspondence between the ergodic/mixing properties of the max-stable random field η and the geometry of the cells.

But, actually drawing a GRTS sample can be so complicated that some practitioners opt for a simpler design. In this paper, I describe a computer program designed to draw GRTS samples of discrete sample units that are located in either 1 -dimension or 2 -dimension. This program, S-Draw, is a Fortran-based application that will run on any computer running a Windows operating system. The GRTS sampling program reads a sample frame from a standard ASCII file, and writes the sample in another ASCII file. While the existence of this program will not illuminate the theoretical details and justification of GRTS samples, it will, I hope, make drawing a GRTS sample accessible to non-statistically inclined researchers...|$|E
40|$|The {{mean number}} of pores per inch (PPI) is widely used as a pore size {{characteristic}} for foams. Nevertheless, {{there is still a}} lack of fast and reliable methods for estimating this quantity. We propose a method for estimating the PPI value based on the Bartlett spectrum of a dark field image of the material. To this end, second-order properties of the edge systems of random tessellations are investigated in detail. In particular, we study the spectral density of the random length measure of the edges. It turns out that the location of its first local maximum is proportional to the PPI value. To determine the factor of proportionality, several <b>random</b> <b>tessellation</b> models as well as examples of real foams are investigated.

40|$|A {{thorough}} understanding of the secondary side stress corrosion cracking of Inconel 600 in steam generator tubes seems to be still somewhat in the future. Especially the early phase {{of the development of}} cracks, also called the initiation phase, is beyond the present state-of-the-art explanations. An effort was therefore made to propose modeling and visualization of the kinetics of secondary side stress corrosion crack initiation and growth on the grain-size scale: An incomplete <b>random</b> <b>tessellation</b> is used to approximate the random the planar grain structure. The crack initiation is modeled by random processes, taking into account the most important factors such as proximity of the aggressive medium and the orientation of the grain boundaries relative to the stress field. The stochastic process describing crack growth accounts for crack branching, coalescence and interference between neighboring cracks. Several numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. Reasonable qualitative agreement with metallographic results is shown.

The latter are deterministic characteristics of the underlying <b>random</b> <b>tessellation.</b> The current work explores specific and typical cells of random tessellations in spherical space.
