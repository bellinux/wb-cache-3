40|$|Sheet metals {{often have}} {{flatness}} defects {{which are usually}} combined with internal stresses. Flatness defects as well as internal stresses are undesirable because they make the further treatment more difficult and deteriorate {{the quality of the}} sheet metal. <b>Roller</b> <b>levelling</b> is a wide-spread method to minimize flatness defects and internal stresses by repreated forming under bending conditions. This thesis presents a numerical model to simulate the forming operation at <b>roller</b> <b>levelling.</b> A bilinear material law is used which allows to investigate kinematic and isotropic material hardening. The deformed shaps of the elastic-plastic structure of the sheet in the levelling machine is evaluated by the use of an iterative process. Contact conditions between the rollers and the sheet are satisfied by a superposed iterative algorithm. The different positions of the rollers and the flatness defect of the sheet metal are taken as boundary conditions. Besides the internal stresses of the sheet metal are considered. Furthermore an optimization problem is formulated to get better levelling results. This optimization problem is solved by combining the process model with an optimization algorithm. Configurations which lead to optimized results within the meaning of minimum internal stresses and residual bend are calculated. Especially the feed motions of the rollers for those configurations can be determined. These results enable an extensive automization of the levelling process using predetermined feed motions.

40|$|Abstract. Within today’s sheet {{processing}} lines, roller levellers {{are included}} in the production chain to eliminate initial curvature and reduce internal stresses of the sheet material. Despite the desire to achieve fully automated industrial processes, roller levellers still have to be set manually by an operator based on his experience and empirical data. Therefore, this paper evaluates an enhanced numerical approach to predict the vertical roll position, the so called roll intermesh, in the last load triangle. To gain the respective machine setting, a closed-loop control based on an actual curvature measurement is implemented in the finite element (FE) programme Abaqus utilising a user-subroutine. Thus, the presented FE model allows the adjustment of the roller leveller leading to a flat strip in a single simulation run within the accuracy of the FE prediction. Additionally, the FE model provides the chance to develop and test closed-loop controls for <b>roller</b> <b>levelling.</b> Complementing the results gained from the FE model, experiments have been conducted on a down-sized roller leveller with aluminium sheets (AA 5005). First results obtained with the presented numerical model proved that the roll intermesh of the last load triangle was determined successfully and the use of an actual curvature measurement within the FE model provides enhanced accuracy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} of the heavy rail roller straightening, the <b>roller</b> <b>leveller</b> only presses the plastic {{deformation}} on the web of heavy rail. Because the stiffness of flanges which are in both sides is stronger than the web, the heavy rail always has the phenomenon of web falling. In that case, we can not achieve the desired effect of straightening by the theoretic bending deflection. In this paper, a finite element model of one straightening unit was built by the ANSYS, the straightening process was simulated and the web falling affect with the bending deflection and the roller spacing was analyzed. Some pictures of curve were drew through the relationships of bending deflection and web falling, the relationships of roller spacing and web falling. In order to gain the better straightening effect, the actual bending deflection can be the sum of the theoretical bending deflection and web falling from the curve once the roller spacing was defined...|$|R

30|$|Most of {{the above}} studies {{considered}} the dynamics of driven rollers in the models but the behavior of idle rollers was ignored. Consequently, the models were under some limited conditions, which ignored detailed complex tension dynamics. On the other hand, most research focused on dynamic modeling and control strategy design, but the mechanical structure {{and the influence of}} parameter variation on fiber tension were ignored. In this paper, a novel tension control method is presented, which can regulate the tension and speed of the filament winding process. The mechanical structure and dynamic model of the system are established, and the influences of the parameter and the speed variation on fiber tension are examined. Subsequently, according to the features of driven rollers and the influence of variation, the control method is proposed by regulating the outputs of the torque of unwind roll, the torque of magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed <b>roller</b> in three <b>levels.</b> Simulations are conducted for verifying the effect by comparing the results with those of the conventional PID controller. Finally, the performance of the proposed control system is verified through experimental studies using a filament winding machine.|$|R

The {{aim of the}} present article is to present {{the results of an}} anatomical study conducted by means of both postmortem injection of the vertebral artery and perfusion of the abdominal aorta. MethodsThe spinal cord blood supply was investigated in 51 Caucasian cadavers: in 40 cases a methylene blue solution was hand-injected into the vertebral artery, whereas in the remaining 11 cases the abdominal aorta was perfused with a methylene blue solution by means of a <b>roller</b> pump. The <b>level</b> and side of the arteria radicularis magna and the continuity of the anterior spinal artery were recorded. ResultsThe anterior spinal artery was a continuous vessel without interruptions along the spinal cord in all 51 cases. The arteria radicularis magna level was variable, ranging from T 9 to L 5. The arteria radicularis magna arose from a lumbar artery in 36 cases (70. 5 %) and it was left-sided in 32 cases (62. 7 %). ConclusionsThe anterior spinal artery constitutes an uninterrupted pathway between the vertebral arteries, the arteria radicularis magna, and the posterior intercostal and lumbar arteries. Moreover, the arteria radicularis magna arises from a lumbar artery in most of cases. Therefore, the sacrifice of the intercostal arteries during a thoracic aorta repair could be justified, at least from an anatomical standpoint. However, if an extended thoracoabdominal aortic repair is planned, it may be prudent to preserve the blood flow from the lumbar arteries...|$|R
40|$|The coconut {{rhinoceros}} beetle, {{an economically}} important pest of coconut palms, is effectively managed by application of its natural pathogen, the Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV). The traditional method of producing OrNV in infected larvae is labor intensive, and suffers from inconsistencies in virus titer and purity. In vitro production of OrNV in the susceptible and permissive anchorage-dependent DSIR-HA- 1179 insect cell line can overcome these disadvantages. While production of OrNV in cell monolayers grown in T-flasks or Cell Factories is possible, the approach {{would not be}} cost-effective at industrial <b>level.</b> <b>Roller</b> Bottle Systems (RBS), with larger growth surface areas and capable of holding larger culture volumes in a more dynamic environment, {{would be a better}} option for scaling up purposes. DSIR-HA- 1179 cells grown in 490 cm 2 RBS filled with 60 ml of TC- 100 culture medium added with 10 % fetal bovine serum yielded a maximum of 1. 5 x 106 cells/ml, which was comparable to yields reached in T-flasks under the same culture conditions (1. 7 x 106 cells/ml). Infection in RBS of cells in their early exponential growth phase (5 x 105 cells/ml) at multiplicity of infection of 1 TCID 50 /cell, produced OrNV volumetric and cell-specific yields of 2. 1 x 108 TCID 50 /ml and 250 TCID 50 /cell respectively, which was an improvement over those produced under identical culture and infection conditions in T-flasks (volumetric and cell-specific yields of 6. 8 x 107 TCID 50 /ml and 102 TCID 50 /cell, respectively). Thus, the roller bottle system {{has proven to be a}} robust alternative for the industrial production of OrNV...|$|R
30|$|Filament winding {{has emerged}} as the main process for carbon fiber {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) fabrication, and tension control {{plays a key role in}} enhancing the quality of the winding products. With the continuous improvement of product quality and efficiency, the precision of the tension control system is constantly improving. In this paper, a novel tension control method is proposed, which can regulate the fiber tension and transport speed of the winding process by governing the outputs of three different driven rollers (the torque of the unwind roll, the torque of the magnetic powder brake roller, and the speed of the master speed <b>roller)</b> in three <b>levels.</b> The mechanical structures and dynamic models of the driven rollers and idle rollers are established by considering the time-varying features of the roller radius and inertia. Moreover, the influence of parameters and speed variation on fiber tension is investigated using the increment model. Subsequently, the control method is proposed by applying fiber tension in three levels according to the features of the three driven rollers. An adaptive fuzzy controller is designed for tuning the PID parameters online to control the speed of the master speed roller. Simulation is conducted for verifying the performance and stability of the proposed tension control method by comparing with those of the conventional PID control method. The result reveals that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method. Finally, an experimental platform is constructed, and the proposed system is applied to a winding machine. The performance and stability of the tension control system are demonstrated via a series of experiments using carbon fiber under different reference speeds and tensions. This paper proposes a novel tension control method to regulate the fiber tension and transport speed.|$|R
40|$|Diagonal stride is {{the classic}} style of cross-­‐country skiing {{involving}} alternating arm and leg movements that appear similar to both walking and running, but is it truly biomechanically and energetically similar to walking and running? To better understand the fundamental biomechanics of diagonal stride skiing, we compared its ground reaction forces, mechanical energy fluctuations {{of the center of}} mass and metabolic energy consumption to walking and running. We hypothesized that diagonal stride skiing would be biomechanically more similar to running, but with a lesser energetic cost. I recorded ground reaction forces of nine subjects roller skiing on a force-­‐measuring treadmill, a method that catalyzed the study of walking and running but had never been utilized in cross-­‐country skiing studies. I analyzed the changes in the perpendicular and parallel forces with increasing speed (1. 25 and 3 m/s) and incline (Level, 3 °, and 6 °). Force recordings were similar to those previously recorded with other devices, thus validating our method. From the forces, we calculated the mechanical energy fluctuations of the center of mass of level walking, running, and diagonal stride skiing (with and without poles). Diagonal stride skiing had almost in-­‐phase fluctuations of kinetic and gravitational potential energies, similar to running. In-­‐phase fluctuations of the center of mass allow runners to store and recover elastic energy, so that less mechanical energy input is required with each step. However, in diagonal stride skiing, almost all of the kinetic energy losses were due to the rolling resistance of the skis and could not be stored elastically. I also compared the energy expenditure of each locomotion form using open-­‐circuit expired gas analysis. Diagonal skiing had a metabolic rate greater than walking and lower than running at the same speeds. Also, I found no significant metabolic advantage of using poles during <b>level</b> <b>roller</b> skiing. Overall, by successfully using a force-­‐measuring treadmill, I found that diagonal skiing is a unique form of locomotion that does not utilize elastic energy storage like running, but has a lower energeti...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{compaction}} {{occurs when}} soil particles are pressed together, thus reducing pore spaces between them. Compaction {{is caused by}} the use of heavy machinery, pressure from wheels, tillage equipment, trampling by animals reduced use of organic matter, frequent use of chemical fertilizers and ploughing at the same depth for many years. The signs of soil: Slow plant emergence, thin stands, uneven early growth, small grain heads, abnormal rooting patterns and reduced nutrients offtake can be a reflection of compation. Excessive soil compaction impedes root growth and therefore limits the amount of soil explored by roots. Soil compaction is a problem of global concern and very few have worked on this issue in Pakistan. Therefore this research work was conducted to investigate and document the deleterious effects of subsurface soil compaction on crop and soil properties, as well as to evaluate best and cheap improvement measures for reducing subsurface soil compaction Two field experiments were conducted during the year 2002 - 03 and repeated during the year 2003 - 04 at the Agriculture Research Station, Mingora, Pakistan. In first experiment the effects of subsurface soil compaction were studied. In second experiment the effects of improvement measures applied to the artificially compated subsurface soil were investigated. In first experiment, the 0. 1 m surface horizon was removed from all the plots with the help of scraper. The subsurface was compated using 7. 0 tons roller. The number of passes of <b>roller</b> measured the <b>level</b> of compation. The experiment consisted of four treatments. The subsurface soil was compacted with two passes of roller in T 1, four passes of roller in T 2 and six passes of roller in T 3, while no compaction was applied to T 4 (control). The topsoil was evenly applied to the whole plot and wheat variety Fakhri Sarhad was grown. In second experiment, the 0. 1 meter surface soil was removed with a scrper. Different improvement measures were applied to subplots according to sowing plan. The experiment consisted of five treatments. T 1 received deep ploughing (D. P), T 2 received D. P+FYM at 14000 kg/ja, T 3 received D. P+Gypsum at 4000 kg/ha, T 4 received D. P +FYM+Gypsum at the rates mentioned above while T 5 (control) no addition of improvement measure was made. The subsurface of the whole plot was then compacted with 4 passes of a 7. 0 tons roller. The 0. 1 m surface soil was uniformly distributed in the plot with blade mounted tractor and scraper. Lay out was again carried out and deep ploughing was given to all the sub plots with chisel plough to a depth of 20 cm except control. Wheat variety Fakhri Sarhad was frown in all the plots with a seeding rate of 140 kg/ha- 1 In first experiment compaction of the subsurface significantly affected days to anthesis, days to maturity, plant height spikes m- 2, grains per spike, thousand grain weight, biological yield, grain yield, harvest index, crop growth rate (CGR), root length, subsurface soil bulk density, subsurface soil porosity, percent grain protein, N concentration in plants (...|$|R
