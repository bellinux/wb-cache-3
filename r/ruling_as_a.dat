Having to rely on a decreasing group of hand-picked bureaucrats, Cuza began facing a mounting opposition after his land reform bill, with liberal landowners voicing concerns over his ability to represent their interests. Along with financial distress, there was an awkward scandal that revolved around his mistress, Maria Catargiu-Obrenović, and popular discontent culminated in a coup d'état.|$|E
25|$|The former {{kingdom of}} Judah {{then became a}} Babylonian {{province}} Yehud, with Gedaliah, a native Judahite, as governor (or possibly <b>ruling</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> puppet king). According to Miller and Hayes, the province included the towns of Bethel in the north, Mizpah, Jericho in the east, Jerusalem, Beth-Zur {{in the west and}} En-Gedi in the south. The administrative centre of the province was Mizpah. On hearing of the appointment, the Jews that had taken refuge in surrounding countries returned to Judah. However, before long, Gedaliah was assassinated {{by a member of the}} former royal house, and the Babylonian garrison was killed, triggering a mass movement of refugees to Egypt. In Egypt, the refugees settled in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Noph, and Pathros, and Jeremiah went with them as moral guardian.|$|E

However, the government resigned on 20 February 2013 after nationwide protests caused by high costs of utilities, low living standards {{and the failure of}} the democratic system. The protest wave was marked by self-immolations, spontaneous demonstrations and a strong sentiment against political parties. As a consequence, the Parliament was dissolved and a new provisional {{government was}} set up by the President.|$|E
500|$|Responses from legal {{observers}} {{and the media}} were divided. Many considered Berghuis a further erosion of Miranda and were concerned it was [...] "turning the clocks back" [...] on safeguards developed in previous cases. At least one scholar has argued that Thompkins effectively gutted Miranda Others saw the <b>ruling</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign of strength and a signal that the Court, under its own impetus, was willing to address known issues resulting from the view of terrorism as crime. The more common view was concerned that vulnerable citizens could now be placed under pressure and, despite having an understanding of their rights, could be more easily coerced in a manner prejudicial to their interests.|$|E
500|$|It {{appears that}} Ohio is using social {{security}} information to verify new voter registration, even though [...] "nder federal law, election officials {{are supposed to}} use the Social Security database to check a registration application {{only as a last}} resort, if no record of the applicant is found [...] databases," [...] according to a New York Times article. [...] Michael J. Astrue, commissioner of the Social Security Administration, alerted the United States Department of Justice and sent letters to six states including Ohio to ensure compliance with federal law. [...] Brunner has stated that the filing of paperwork by Republican officials may be an attempt to establish grounds for contesting ballots on Election Day. [...] The paperwork requires use of provisional ballots by persons with discrepant registrations. [...] On October 9, 2008, the Republicans also were granted an order against Brunner by Judge Smith requiring that Brunner must perform voter registration verification according to the Help America Vote Act. [...] Matching new registrants' information against Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles or the Social Security Administration databases is one of the requirements. Challenges to mismatched registrations, which force the use of provisional ballots, must be filed twenty days prior to the election. Legal expert Greta Van Susteren viewed the <b>ruling</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> significant breaking news story and interviewed Brunner on her show On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren the day it was made. Van Susteren interpreted the <b>ruling</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> statement that Brunner has not been taking sufficient steps to prevent voter fraud.

500|$|Arbitration Committee member Roger Davies {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the decision, and commented to The New York Times that due to the controversial nature of the case, the decision was crafted so as not to focus directly upon any particular individual. Wikipedia media contact Dan Rosenthal emphasized in a statement to ABC News that it was generally accepted procedure on the site to ban users that had violated policy intended to prevent them from promoting propaganda. Wikimedia Foundation spokesman and head of communications Jay Walsh said to Bloomberg BusinessWeek the Arbitration decision was intended to help restore Scientology-related articles to an acceptable state on the site. Wikimedia Germany spokesperson Catrin Schoneville stated to Computerwoche that the decision impacted the English Wikipedia, and noted it was unclear whether a similar ruling might be applied to the German Wikipedia. Statements from Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw labelled the Arbitration <b>ruling</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> routine matter, and maintained there were still [...] "gross inaccuracies" [...] on the Scientology article. In a statement to CNN, Pouw denied the presence of an organized campaign by the Church of Scientology to manipulate Wikipedia. Scientology representative Tommy Davis emphasized to the St. Petersburg Times that users critical of the organization were also banned, and similarly denied that Scientology leadership arranged a campaign to manipulate entries on Wikipedia.|$|E

2500|$|Saruman {{originally}} {{was the most}} powerful of the five and was head of the White Council.

Saruman was learned in the lore of the Rings of Power, and gradually became corrupted by desire for the Rings and by Sauron's direct influence through the palantír of Orthanc. Eventually he took the title [...] "Saruman of Many Colours" [...] and took robes to match. [...] He assisted Sauron in the War of the Ring, biding time to secure the One Ring for himself, in order to supplant Sauron, but his plans and forces were thwarted by the power of the Ents. [...] Gandalf broke his staff and cast him from the White Council.

2500|$|On April 5, 2011, the FAA {{issued an}} {{emergency}} Airworthiness Directive (AD) requiring operators of 737 series 300, 400 and 500 aircraft {{to increase the}} frequency of inspections of lap joints on high flight cycle airframes. The AD requires that aircraft with over 30,000 cycles be inspected within 20 days of receipt of the AD, or upon reaching 30,000 cycles. For aircraft with over 35,000 cycles, the inspection is required within 5 days. The AD also requires periodic inspections of the same joints at every 500 cycles for aircraft with over 30,000 cycles. The AD refers {{to a range of}} airframes, line numbers 2553–3132 inclusive, totaling 580 aircraft. Of the total of 580 aircraft, only 175 aircraft currently meet the 30,000 cycle requirement, with 80 of those operating in the United States. [...] The FAA AD is effective to only the portion of those that are registered in the United States, since the FAA can only mandate such changes in the United States. Countries with reciprocity airworthiness agreements will also follow the AD, but other nations are not required to adhere to the <b>ruling.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of the incident, the FAA investigated Boeing's manufacturing techniques to discover whether or not they had any bearing on the cause of the failure. The incident aircraft was not considered to have a high number of cycles. Boeing co-operated with the FAA in the investigation.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this little}} world {{there is a}} story {{attached}} to every word; and never more than when it is the wrong word. For instance, we may say that in certain cases the word Roman actually means Greek. The Greek Patriarch is sometimes called the Roman Patriarch; while the real Roman Patriarch, who actually comes from Rome, is only called the Latin Patriarch, as if he came from any little town in Latium. The truth behind this confusion is the truth about five hundred very vital years, which are concealed even from cultivated Englishmen by two vague falsehoods; {{the notion that the}} Roman Empire was merely decadent and the notion that the Middle Ages were merely dark. As a fact, even the Dark Ages were not merely dark. And even the Byzantine Empire was not merely Byzantine. It seems a little unfair that we should take the very title of decay from that Christian city, for surely it was yet more stiff and sterile when it had become a Moslem city. I am not so exacting as to ask any one to popularise such a word as [...] "Constantinopolitan." [...] But it would surely be a better word for stiffness and sterility to call it Stamboulish. But for the Moslems and other men of the Near East what counted about Byzantium was that it still inherited the huge weight of the name of Rome. Rome had come east and reared against them this Roman city, and though and priest or soldier who came out of it might be speaking as a Greek, he was <b>ruling</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Roman. Its critics in these days of criticism may regard it as a corrupt civilisation. But its enemies in the day of battle only regarded it as civilisation. Saladin, the greatest of the Saracens, did not call Greek bishops degenerate dreamers or dingy outcasts, he called them, with a sounder historical instinct, [...] "The monks of the imperial race." [...] The survival of the word merely means that even when the imperial city fell behind them, they did not surrender their claim to defy all Asia {{in the name of the}} Christian Emperor. That is but one example out of twenty, but that is why in this distant place to this day the Greeks who are separated from the see of Rome sometimes bear the strange name of [...] "The Romans." ...|$|E
