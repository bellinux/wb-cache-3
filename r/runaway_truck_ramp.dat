25|$|The North–South Expressway Northern Route E1 is {{the only}} {{expressway}} in Malaysia to have a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> near Jelapang, Ipoh.|$|E
25|$|The route {{begins at}} a single-point urban {{interchange}} with I-80 at exit 145 (which {{is referred to}} as Kimball Junction) and heads south on a four-lane undivided highway, passing through commercial development. An access road intersects the road that connects SR-224 to the Utah Olympic Park. As the highway approaches Snyderville, the commercial buildings turn into residential homes and the road briefly turns southwest before turning southeast and then south again. Residential development disappears when the highway turns southeast and hills appear {{on either side of the}} road. Homes appear yet again on either side of the road with a country club on the eastern side of the road and a golf course on the west. The route intersects with SR-248 and enters Park City as Park Avenue. The route turns off of Park Avenue and onto Deer Valley Drive. The road turns southeast and bypasses the center of town. A roundabout appears and the road turns onto Marsac Avenue, a two-lane road. As the route exits Park City and heads into rural Summit County, a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> appears on the east side of the road, serving northbound traffic. As the highway enters more forested and elevated terrain, it turns southwest and continues in a general southerly direction through Ontario Canyon before terminating at the Wasatch County line.|$|E
500|$|I-70 {{begins at}} a trumpet {{interchange}} with Interstate 15, near Cove Fort. It then proceeds east over the Pavant Range, cresting at an unnamed summit with {{an elevation of}} [...] The eastern descent from the Pavant range features bridges high above Clear Creek and its side canyons. The longest of these bridges is the Fish Creek bridge at [...] long. The descent into Clear Creek features a brake check area and <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> to aid truckers down the steep slope. The freeway then skirts the edge of Fremont Indian State Park before entering Sevier Valley.|$|E
50|$|The southernmost 7 miles {{involve a}} steep grade, up for {{northbound}} and down for southbound traffic. The southbound side has 2 <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps.</b> The {{lower end of}} the grade coincides with the North Carolina border, where the road exits the Appalachian Mountain region and levels out.|$|R
50|$|I-26, in {{concurrency}} with US 23, {{enters the}} state at Sams Gap (elevation 3,760 ft), from Tennessee. In the first 9 mi, {{designated as a}} scenic byway, it features mostly six travel lanes and three <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> along its eastbound. The freeway is also parallels US 23A, which was the original route before 2006. At exit 9, I-26 ends and Future I-26 begins; US 19 also joins from Burnsville.|$|R
50|$|Since I-70's construction, {{the swell}} {{has been noted}} for its desolate beauty. The swell has since been {{nominated}} for National Park and/or National Monument status on multiple occasions. If the swell is granted this status it arguably {{would be the first}} time a National Park owes its existence to an interstate highway. Most of the exits in this span are rest areas, brake check areas, and <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> with few traditional freeway exits.|$|R
500|$|Since {{the present}} {{alignment}} of MD 135 was completed west of Bloomington {{in the late}} 1950s, the descent of Backbone Mountain has become notorious due to its steep grade and the 90 degree turn at the bottom to avoid a mountain dead ahead. [...] A retaining wall {{at the bottom of}} the mountain features white crosses in memoriam of those who lost their lives; there were 24 crosses painted as of 2009. [...] After five people had been killed on the descent by 1965, the State Roads Commission responded in 1967 by enacting the truck speed limit of , marking the three mandatory stopping areas, and installing ample warning signage, including the infamous [...] "If Brakes Fail Ditch Truck Immediately" [...] sign. [...] In 1997, signs were installed on Interstate 68, US 219, and US 40 advising truckers to use MD 36 instead of MD 135 to access Luke and Westernport. [...] The <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> was installed by 2005 and supplemented with a runaway truck warning system and updated signage in 2007.|$|E
500|$|MD 135 heads {{straight}} southeast {{toward a}} grade-separated crossing of CSX's Mountain Subdivision {{very close to}} the railroad's crossing of the Eastern Continental Divide. [...] The state highway curves to the northeast and gently ascends Backbone Mountain. [...] A scenic overlook marks the highest point on MD 135 (...) shortly before the intersection with MD 38 (Kitzmiller Road). The state highway continues northeast along the ridgeline through Potomac-Garrett State Forest and intersects Swanton Road and a few roads {{on the south side of}} the highway that access Jennings Randolph Lake. [...] Upon leaving the state forest, MD 135 begins to pass scattered residences ahead of the descent of Backbone Mountain, which has grades as steep as 9%. [...] Trucks are required to stop at three different brake check locations and obey a posted speed limit of [...] [...] After Bloomington Hill Road splits to the north and the state highway passes the third brake check stop, a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> splits to the south. [...] The downhill grade eases as MD 135 enters Bloomington, where the name of the highway changes to Bloomington Road. [...] After passing through residential areas, the state highway crosses the Mountain Subdivision and the Savage River before meeting Savage Hillside Road at a T intersection in front of Franklin Hill.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> [...] A traffic {{device that}} enables {{vehicles}} having braking problems to stop safely. These systems are found at mountainous {{areas such as}} at nearby Ipoh North Toll Plaza Interchange along the North–South Expressway Northern Route ...|$|E
50|$|A major {{slide in}} 1983 brought {{the problem to}} the public {{attention}} again. In 1985 Caltrans proposed the Martini Creek bypass as the preferred solution. However, the Sierra Club sued to stop construction, as California law requires that State Route 1 be restricted to two lanes in rural areas. The 101 ft road bed, complete with continuous uphill passing lanes, <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps,</b> and extra-wide shoulders, would be the widest two-lane road in the state. Again the state {{decided to return to}} the status quo.|$|R
50|$|The {{road leading}} up towards {{the summit of}} Clyde Mountain is a 5 km section of steep, winding section of the Kings Highway in New South Wales, Australia. It is the {{location}} of many crashes, 22% of all incidents on the Kings Highway occurring on a 40 km stretch on and near the mountain. There are three safety <b>ramps</b> (<b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps)</b> for <b>trucks</b> or heavy vehicles which lose control of their speed or suffer brake failure. Slow vehicle turnouts have been added on the Clyde Mountain descent, which allows vehicles to pass trucks in low gear.|$|R
500|$|To {{mitigate}} the dangers posed by a fire inside the tunnel, trucks hauling hazardous materials are also prohibited {{from using the}} tunnel. Prohibited trucks, bicycles, pedestrians and {{those who wish to}} stop and view the scenery must take the longer and steeper climb and descent of the older U.S. Highway 6 across Loveland Pass, [...] higher at [...] above sea level. [...] Other than the above exceptions, the tunnel has replaced the pass for general vehicular traffic. [...] While less formidable than the older route, the approach to the tunnel on both sides is steep, and <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> are available for truckers who lose control.|$|R
50|$|A <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp,</b> to stop {{vehicles}} {{unable to}} brake, is provided {{on both ends}} of the Selat Lumut-SKVE Bridge.|$|E
5000|$|The North-South Expressway Northern Route E1 is {{the only}} {{expressway}} in Malaysia to have a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> near Jelapang, Ipoh.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the steep}} incline of Algonquin Avenue/Highway 11 as it enters North Bay {{from the north}} on Thibeault Hill, the {{southbound}} lanes are equipped with the only <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> on Ontario's provincial highway system.|$|E
5000|$|US 23, in {{concurrency}} with I-26, enters Unicoi County at Sam's Gap (el. 3799 ft) and travels north along Stamp Ridge. Immediately after {{crossing the}} state line is a truck information station, signed [...] "Truck Inspection," [...] which requires all trucks to go through before continuing. The following 3 mi is a 6% grade descent, accompanied with two <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps,</b> into the South Indian Creek valley. Between mile markers 47-48 is a scenic overlook turnoff (northbound US 23/westbound I-26 only), followed by the I-26 Erwin/Unicoi County Welcome Center, located on Clear Branch Road exit. At Temple Hill, US 19W, traveling from Burnsville, joins in concurrency.|$|R
50|$|Vail Pass {{lies on the}} {{boundary}} between Eagle and Summit counties, between Vail on the west and Copper Mountain on the east. It provides the route of Interstate 70 (and earlier U.S. Highway 6) between the upper basins of the Eagle River and the Blue River, both tributaries of the Colorado River. Black Gore Creek, a tributary of Gore Creek, in the watershed of the Eagle, descends from {{the north side of}} the pass towards the town of Vail. West Tenmile Creek, in the watershed of the Blue, descends from the south side. The pass is significantly steep on either side (7 to 8%), and two <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> are available on the west bound side for trucks.|$|R
5|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at , although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> to aid <b>trucks</b> down. About halfway down is a view area of the canyon narrowing as it approaches the eastern escarpment of the swell, the San Rafael Reef. Just as the highway exits the swell it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River.|$|R

50|$|The {{climb to}} Linville Falls is {{somewhat}} curvy. It is a route heavily traveled by trucks, and a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> is located along this section. Also located {{in this section}} is Linville Caverns, a small tourist destination. At Linville Falls, nearby sites include Linville Gorge Wilderness, Linville Falls, (via NC 183) and the Blue Ridge Parkway.|$|E
50|$|Due to a {{steep incline}} as it descends Thibeault Hill into North Bay, the {{southbound}} Algonquin Avenue segment of Highway 11 features the only <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> on Ontario's highway system. The Ministry of Transportation is currently undertaking {{a study of}} potential highway improvements in the North Bay area, which may include a new westerly realignment of this segment to bypass the hill.|$|E
500|$|The freeway follows Clear Creek {{down the}} eastern side of the Rockies, passing through the Veterans Memorial Tunnels near Idaho Springs. Farther to the east, I-70 departs the US6 corridor, which {{continues}} to follow Clear Creek through a narrow, curving gorge. The interstate, however, follows the corridor of US40 out of the canyon. The highway crests a small mountain near Genesee Park to descend into Mount Vernon Canyon to exit the Rocky Mountains. This portion features grade-warning signs with unusual messages, such as [...] "Trucks: Don't be fooled," [...] "Truckers, you are not down yet," [...] and [...] "Are your brakes adjusted and cool?" [...] <b>Runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> are a prominent feature along this portion of I-70, with a total of seven used along the descent of either side the Continental Divide to stop trucks with failed brakes.|$|R
50|$|The highway then ascends Ghost Rock Summit, {{the highest}} point for I-70 inside the swell. At the summit is another view area {{overlooking}} the Little Grand Canyon of the San Rafael River. The summit is named for unusual rock formations nearby. The Ghost Rocks themselves are at 7405 ft, although the freeway is slightly lower. I-70 meanders through a relatively flat portion of the swell until reaching Spotted Wolf Canyon, which provides the exit route to the swell. The eastern descent features one brake check area and two <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> to aid <b>trucks</b> down.

Just as the highway exits the swell it passes {{to the north of}} Goblin Valley State Park. The highway exits the swell near Green River.|$|R
2500|$|Various safety {{measures}} were {{implemented by the}} New York State Department of Public Works (NYSDPW) {{in response to the}} frequent accidents. Northbound truck drivers were forced to travel in low gear, and three <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> were constructed at the tight curves along the highway for trucks whose brakes had failed. Additionally, the existing signage along the road was supplemented by new warning signs. More substantial changes to the road were suggested as early as March 1958 when several local grange halls petitioned then-Governor W. Averell Harriman to eliminate the curves altogether by straightening the road. In 1964, NYSDPW unveiled plans for a new bypass that would avoid the accident-prone route and meet NY5S at an interchange west of Sprakers. The contract for the $2.4million project (equivalent to $ in [...] ) was let in January 1967, and the highway took about two years to construct. Sprakers Hill Road is now maintained by Montgomery County as CR108.|$|R
50|$|The {{accidents}} {{prompted the}} State of Connecticut to modify Route 44 through {{the addition of}} a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> just above the Avon Old Farms Inn and the straightening and widening of the road on the western slope of the mountain. The accidents and the reconstruction of the road have been heavily covered by local media including the Hartford Courant.|$|E
50|$|The pass is traversed by the Million Dollar Highway, U.S. Highway 550 {{south of}} Silverton, {{which is part}} of the San Juan Skyway Scenic Byway. While the north side is fairly gentle, the descent on the south side is very steep (6.5%), and has a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> for trucks that lose control. It is {{basically}} downhill the entire way to Durango.|$|E
50|$|Selat Lumut-SKVE Bridge is an {{expressway}} {{bridge across}} Lumut Straits in Klang Valley, Selangor, Malaysia. It {{is a second}} longest straits bridge in the Klang Valley after Selat Lumut Bridge. It connects Pulau Carey to Pulau Indah on the South Klang Valley Expressway. A <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> is provided {{on both ends of}} the bridge because of a 4% steep grade on the bridge.|$|E
50|$|North of Limonite Avenue (south of SR 60), I-15 {{is known}} as the Ontario Freeway. After its merger with I-215 in Devore, I-15 is called the Barstow Freeway or the Mojave Freeway. A short section between SR 138 and Oak Hill Road is also {{designated}} as the CHP Officer Larry L. Wetterling and San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Lieutenant Alfred E. Stewart Memorial Highway, named after two officers killed in the line of duty. On this stretch of highway, I-15 northbound splits from I-15 southbound, where the road ascends up a steep grade until it reaches Cajon Summit (elevation 4190 feet) just south of the High Desert community of Apple Valley. Tractor Trailer trucks headed southbound are advised to travel at 35 mph or less due to the steep downward grade. The southbound lanes provide <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> as a safety feature. The two halves of the highway rejoin shortly before reaching Cajon Summit.|$|R

50|$|At {{the top of}} the gap, in {{addition}} to a reduced speed limit there is a truck information station that requires all trucks to go through before continuing. The following 5 mi descent is a 6% grade along Youngs Ridge to Old Fort, along which are several reduce-speed warning lights and three <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps.</b> It is likely that, on both on the ascent and the descent, most trucks and some cars will be going slower than posted speed limits, and that, despite the fact that this section is six lanes wide, slower vehicles may be traveling in the passing lanes. At Old Fort, US70 splits from I-40 (at exit72) and travels through the downtown area and by the Mountain Gateway Museum and Heritage Center. East of Old Fort, US70 travels northeasterly towards Marion and forms the southern boundary of the Pisgah National Forest. At Pleasant Gardens, it connects with NC 80, which travelers can follow towards Mount Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi River. Crossing the Catawba River and entering Marion, US70 connects with US 221/NC 226 and then forms a short concurrency with US 221 Bus. along Main Street. East of Marion, US70 connects with NC 126 in Nebo, where travelers can visit Lake James State Park.|$|R
50|$|The road, {{a modern}} two-lane road {{with an extra}} {{climbing}} lane where necessary, was originally the Hyden Spur of the Daniel Boone Parkway (now the Hal Rogers Parkway). Shortly after exiting the parkway, the road climbs a large hill for roughly a mile (1.6 km). The last mile into Hyden is a 7% downhill grade, with a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> near its end at US 421.|$|E
50|$|A <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp,</b> runaway truck lane, escape lane, {{emergency}} escape ramp, or truck {{arrester bed}} is a traffic device that enables vehicles which are having braking problems to safely stop. It is typically a long, sand- or gravel-filled lane {{connected to a}} steep downhill grade section of a main road, and is designed to accommodate large trucks or buses. The ramp allows a moving vehicle's kinetic energy to be dissipated gradually in a controlled and relatively harmless way, helping the operator to stop it safely without a violent crash.|$|E
50|$|Wolf Creek Pass (el. 10,857 ft.) {{is a high}} {{mountain}} pass on the Continental Divide, in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. It is the route through which U.S. Highway 160 passes from the San Luis Valley into southwest Colorado {{on its way to}} New Mexico and Arizona. The pass is notable as inspiration of a C. W. McCall song. The pass is significantly steep on either side (6.8% maximum grade) and can be dangerous in winter. There is a <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramp</b> on the westbound side for truckers that lose control of their brakes.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{hazardous}} stretches of Interstate highway in the United States is located approximately 40 mi west of Chattanooga on I-24 in Monteagle, where the highway crosses the Cumberland Plateau. Compared to grades elsewhere, Monteagle's 4-6% grade does not {{come close to the}} steepest (I-40 between Nashville and Knoxville features 5% grades in each direction as well as a 5% grade north of Nashville on I-24, near Joelton), but the slope is protracted over a distance of several miles. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area. As <b>runaway</b> <b>trucks</b> had been a regular and deadly occurrence, in part of the failure or inability of truckers to slow down to the 35 mi/h km/h truck speed limit once on the slope, the eastbound lanes were rebuilt in the late 1980s. This work reduced the grade, widened the road, added a required stopping area with traffic lights for trucks prior to descending the mountain, and added two <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> where a <b>truck</b> whose brakes have failed due to overheating can exit into a long pit full of loose gravel to safely stop. Owing to geography, these two ramps are {{on the left side of}} the grade. This stretch of highway inspired Johnny Cash to write a song about Monteagle Mountain. It is also mentioned in [...] "The Legend", the introductory song for Smokey and the Bandit, which touts the protagonist's driving skill in having reportedly navigated his truck down the Monteagle Grade during a heavy rainstorm, despite an airbrake failure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1960, I-40 {{made three}} expansions: In Burke County, from Dysartsville Road (SR 1129) to Hildebran (connecting to US 64/US 70 along I-40 Access Road SE (SR 1890)); from NC 16, in Conover, to NC 90, in Statesville; and from NC 801, near Advance, to the US 158/US 421 split, east of Winston-Salem. [...] In 1961, I-40 {{extended}} west from Dysartsville Road to NC 226, near Marion. In Statesville, I-40 extended east along a completed widening project of US 64 Bypass, between NC 90 to US 64. Between Ridgecrest and Old Fort, US 70 along Youngs Ridge was widened to four-lane; however, I-40 was not officially designated until 1982, after additional highway improvements including additional widening, <b>runaway</b> <b>truck</b> <b>ramps</b> and warning devices. [...] In 1962, I-40 extended west from NC 226, near Marion to link-up with US 70, near Old Fort. In 1963, {{the gap between}} Winston-Salem and Kernersville was completed. [...] In 1964, I-40 opened a 12 mi segment from east of Clyde (using the freeway connector from US 19/US 23) to Wiggins Road (SR 1200). [...] In 1967, I-40 opened a 3.8 mi segment through the Biltmore Estate, from NC 191 to US 25. [...] In 1968 and after twenty years of construction, the I-40 opened a 20 mi segment from the Tennessee state line to US 276, in Cove Creek. [...] In November of same year, the North Carolina State Highway Commission submitted a request to the Bureau of Public Roads to extend I-40 east of Greensboro to Raleigh, via the Research Triangle Park (RTP). In 1969, both the Bureau and AASHTO approved the extension, allowing I-40 to continue east of Durham, through Raleigh to Smithfield. [...] Also in the same year, I-40 was extended west from NC 191 to connect with I-26 and end at US 19/US 23, in Enka. [...] In 1970, I-40 extended west from NC 801, near Advance, to US 64, near Mocksville.|$|R
50|$|The final {{segment of}} Interstate 64 to be {{completed}} was between Sam Black Church and the West Virginia Turnpike near Beckley. This revised interstate alignment traverses through an entirely rural area with extremely rugged terrain. Opened in 1988, this final portion is 38 mi long and cost approximately $300 million to construct, {{making it one of}} the most expensive segments of Interstate Highway in the United States at $7.8 million per mile. It has some extremely rugged terrain, with one segment boasting a 7% grade downhill eastbound for seven miles (11 km) at Sandstone Mountain. Anticipating loss of braking situations, two emergency <b>truck</b> escape <b>ramps</b> were built to be used by <b>runaway</b> <b>trucks.</b> These emergency <b>ramps</b> were used with such frequency that, in addition to large warning signs alerting truckers to the steep grade, a special truck speed advisory system was installed to automatically weigh each truck and indicate the speed at which it should begin the downhill section.|$|R
