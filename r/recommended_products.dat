In this paper, we focus on critiquing-based recommenders, which permit users to tweak the features of <b>recommended</b> <b>products</b> in order to refine their needs and preferences.

The results indicate that e-WOM is {{likely to result in}} more time considering the <b>recommended</b> <b>product.</b> For consumers more motivated to process information, e-WOM recommendations lead to more time spent on the choice task overall. Further, consumers with less motivation to process information make suboptimal decisions based on e-WOM recommendations.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effect of the school feeding program {{purchase}} criteria on the quantity, variety and origin of food products acquired for school meals in a municipality in Brazil. Method: Analysis of purchase lists for two years prior and two years after implementation of the purchase criteria (2010). The origin (family farms (FF) /other providers (OP)) and nutritional characteristics (recommended/controlled) of food products were studied, registering annual varieties (n) and daily quantities (kg/day); contrast of proportions was applied. Results: The acquisition of <b>recommended</b> <b>products</b> increased, and the quantity of controlled products decreased (p = 0. 005). Purchase of legumes and vegetables (p < 0. 05) increased and high sugar foods decreased (p = 0. 02). The majority of food products in 2010 and 2011 were acquired from OP (64 % and 61 %), although FF provided the greatest proportion of legumes and vegetables. Ten new varieties of <b>recommended</b> <b>products</b> were incorporated, 9 of which were acquired from FF. Conclusion: The criteria of direct purchase from family farms resulted in an increase in the variety and quantity of healthy foods in the schools in the municipality...|$|E

40|$|When viewing web-consumer reviews {{consumers}} {{encounter the}} reviewers in an anonymous environment. Although their interactions are only virtual they still exchange social information, e. g. often reviewers refer to their proficiency or consumption motives within the review texts. Do these social information harm the viewers’ {{perception of the}} <b>recommended</b> <b>products?</b> The present study addresses this question by applying the paradigm of social comparison (Mussweiler, 2003) to web-consumer reviews. In a laboratory experiment with a student sample (n = 120) we manipulated the perceived similarity between reviewer and viewer and the perceived proficiency of the reviewer. A measurement of achievement goals (Elliott & McGregor, 2001) and average number of hours of study prior to the experiment allowed to introduce the reviewer as high [low] in proficiency and similar [dissimilar] in achievement goals. As predicted, the viewer’s evaluation of the <b>recommended</b> <b>products</b> differed {{as a function of}} this social information. Contrasting with the reviewer led to devaluing the products recommended by a proficient but dissimilar reviewer. However, against our prediction social comparison with the reviewer did not affect the viewer`s self-evaluation. Whether social information in web-product reviews affects the viewer`s self-evaluation and induces both social comparison processes remains an open question. Future studies aim to address this by manipulating the informational focus of the viewer, rather than the perceived similarity between viewer and reviewer. So far, the present study extends the application of social comparison to consumption environments and contributes {{to the understanding of the}} virtual social identity...|$|E

40|$|An individual’s {{ability to}} locate the {{information}} they desire grows more slowly than {{the rate at which}} new information becomes available. Customers are constantly confronted with situations in which they have many options to choose from and need assistance exploring or narrowing down the possibilities. Recommender systems are one tool to help bridge this gap. There are various mechanisms being employed to create recommender systems, but the most common systems fall into two main classes: content-based and collaborative filtering systems. Content-based recommender systems match the textual information of a particular product with the textual information representing the interests of a customer. Collaborative filtering systems use patterns in customer ratings to make recommendations. Both types of recommender systems require significant data resources {{in the form of a}} customer’s ratings and product features; hence they are not able to generate high quality recommendations. Hybrid mechanisms have been used by researchers to improve the performance of recommender systems where one can integrate more than one mechanism to overcome the drawbacks of an individual system. The hybrid approach proposed in this thesis is the integration of content and context-based with collaborative filtering, since these are the most successful and widely used mechanisms. This proposed approach will look into the integration of content and context data with rating data using a different mechanism that mainly focuses on boosting a customer’s trust in the recommender system. Researchers have been trying to improve system performance using hybrid approaches, but research is lacking on providing justifications for <b>recommended</b> <b>products.</b> Hence, the proposed approach will mainly focus on providing justifications for <b>recommended</b> <b>products</b> as this plays a crucial role in obtaining the satisfaction and trust of customers. A product’s features and a customer’s context attributes are used to provide justifications. In addition to this, the presentation mechanism needs to be very effective as it has been observed that customers trust more in a system when there are explanations on how the <b>recommended</b> <b>products</b> have been computed and presented. Finally, this proposed recommender system will allow the customer to interact with it in various ways to provide feedback on the recommendations and justifications. Overall, this integration will be very useful in achieving a stronger correlation between the customers and products. Experimental results clearly showed that the majority of the participants prefer to have recommendations with their justifications and they received valuable recommendations on which they could trust...|$|E
