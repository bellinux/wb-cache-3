40|$|How {{impactful}} is volleyball’s ‘serve-reception game’? Its efficacy {{has been}} found to discriminate between winning and losing a match. But how does reception become (in) effective? Based on the theoretical rationale of ecological dynamics, we e hypothesized that skilled receivers in volleyball would not display ready-made responses, but rather would co-adapt action modes during serve-reception to deal with the specific, emergent constraints of service to achieve ttask goals. In order to examine this issue we investigated whether the co-adaptation of serve and <b>reception</b> action <b>modes</b> {{was a significant predictor of}} set outcome in elite volleyball performance (win or loss), analysing the first and last sets of the 2014 World League Finals matches (897 game-sequences). The power-jump and jump-float were the serving modes observed and the overhand, underhand-lateral and underhand-frontal passes were the <b>reception</b> <b>modes</b> categorized. We found that the co- adaptation of serve and <b>reception</b> action <b>modes</b> predicted set outcome in the final set of a match. Receiving the jump-float serve with an overhand pass or underhand-lateral pass increased the odds of winning the final set by 200 per cent. Results suggested that, at an expert level, mastering the overhand pass and the underhand lateral pass gives teams a competitive edge. Receivers showing flexibility in action mode selection improved a team’s odds of successfully winning the final set of a match...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{scheme is}} {{developed}} for mitigating measurement biases in agile-beam polarimetric phased array weather radar. Based on the orthogonal Huygens source dual-polarized element model, a polarization measurement basis for planar polarimetric phased array radar (PPAR) is proposed. The proposed polarization basis is orthogonal to itself after a 90 ° rotation along the array’s broadside and can well measure {{the characteristics of}} dual-polarized element. With polarimetric measurements being undertaken in this polarization basis, the measurement biases caused by the unsymmetrical projections of dual-polarized element’s fields onto the local horizontal and vertical directions of radiated beam can be mitigated. Polarimetric variables for precipitation estimation and classification are derived from the scattering covariance matrix in horizontal and vertical polarization basis. In addition, the estimates of these parameters based on the time series data acquired with the new polarization basis are also investigated.

40|$|International audienceMonitoring {{physical}} quantities using {{acoustic wave}} devices can be advantageously achieved using the wave characteristic dependence to various parametric perturbations (temperature, stress, and pressure). Surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators are particularly {{well suited to}} such applications as their resonance frequency is directly influenced by these perturbations, modifying both the phase velocity and resonance conditions. Moreover, the intrinsic radio frequency (rf) nature of these devices makes them ideal for wireless applications, mainly exploiting antennas reciprocity and piezoelectric reversibility.

40|$|An {{antenna system}} {{provides}} a substantially spherical radiation pattern about a structure located above ground level, by locating the individual radiation pattern {{of each of}} a plurality of individual antennae, each positioned to have a radiation pattern covering {{only a portion of}} the desired sphere, and then applying all antenna signals, during either transmission or reception time intervals, through space-diversity and/or time-diversity apparatus, to cause the patterns of all of the antennae to combine into the desired substantially-spherical pattern. The antennae may have substantially hemispherical patterns, with each antenna of a pair thereof being directed in a direction generally opposite to the other antenna of that pair. Time domain multiple access (TDMA) operation of a master system station, with transmission in different time slots for different portions of the coverage sphere, and selection of the strongest received signal from among all of the plurality N of signals simultaneously received by the plurality N of antennae, can provide the desired spherical radiation pattern in both the transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>modes</b> of operation...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} conduct a {{comprehensive}} power-consumption evaluation study, we present a brief classification according to the node’s role as designed by the IEEE 802.15. 5 standard {{to find out how}} much energy is wasted by each type of node. To this aim, the device’s role falls into three categories: (1) mesh coordinator or region synchronizer; (2) sender or receiver node; and finally (3) intermediate nodes which are responsible for routing data from the sender to the receiver. It should be remarked that case (1) is focused on the synchronization process, and cases (2) and (3) are associated to data transmission. Consequently, a node different from the mesh coordinator (and region synchronizer) that does not perform any data transmission should present minimum power-consumption, given by its contribution to the synchronization process. In this context, the mesh coordinator or region synchronizer node is responsible for starting the synchronization process with their children. The energy consumption of these nodes is the one corresponding to the transmission mode (S 3 state), because they have to broadcast the synchronization request message and then automatically switch to the <b>reception</b> <b>mode</b> (S 2 state) so as to receive the synchronization reply messages of their respective children. These children remain in the <b>reception</b> <b>mode</b> so that they can listen to the request messages, changing again to the transmission mode in order to forward the reply messages.|$|E

40|$|Real-time {{applications}} such as software deﬁned radios have different <b>reception</b> <b>modes</b> and their real-time requirements {{are a result of}} periodic sources and sinks in the form of ADCs and DACs. Tools are under development that automatically translate a sequential speciﬁcation of a radio application, that often includes nested while loops to describe the modes, into a parallel task graph and map this task graph onto an embedded multiprocessor system. However the speciﬁcation of strict periodic sources and sinks together with input and output buffers that can respectively overﬂow or underrun is currently not possible in a sequential programming language. In this paper we will introduce a nested loop program (NLP) language extension that enables the speciﬁcation of periodic sources and sinks and their buffers in a sequential program. We show that parallelization of such a sequential program poses challenges because the order in which different tasks access the input and output buffers should be maintained in the parallel program. Furthermore, the buffers at the sources and sinks allow destructive writes and non-destructive reads, which causes non-deterministic functional behavior in case the throughput and latency constraint of the application are not met. The other buffers in the task graph block in case no data or space is available. Therefore, the system internals remain functionally deterministic which signiﬁcantly simpliﬁes debugging and analysis. Furthermore, to guarantee real-time requirements, we show {{that it is possible to}} conservatively model an application with nested while loops as a Cyclo-Static Dataﬂow (CSDF) model. Using this model we can compute a mapping of the task graph, which includes a task to processor assignment, suitable scheduler settings and buffer capacities. By making use of this CSDF model, we can guarantee that sources and sinks can run periodically under the assumption that the used execution times of the tasks are upper bounds...|$|R
