5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the earthly realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time.

50|$|As a result, the 24 {{teams are}} not {{competing}} any more for 6 {{spots in the}} Hoofdklasse, but only for 2 spots.

So the teams could compete for 3 spots.|$|R

50|$|Congressman Chadwick went to Washington on January 3, 1947 and {{established}} a typically conservative Republican voting record. He sought to maintain higher visibility before the voters than either his predecessor or successor did. He introduced bills to protect GI insurance and <b>relegate</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> states all federal interest in coastal tidelands. A vigorous anti-Communist, he strongly defended the appropriation for the House Un-American Activities committee.|$|R
5|$|A {{system of}} {{promotion}} and relegation {{exists between the}} Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in Premier League are <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to Premier League, with an additional team promoted {{after a series of}} play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. The Premier League had 22 teams when it began in 1992, but this was reduced to the present 20-team format in 1995.|$|E
5|$|An {{expansion}} to the Spion Kop terracing in the 1920s increased Anfield's capacity. Liverpool's fortunes declined {{during the}} inter-war years, when the club often finished in midtable. Liverpool became League champions again in 1947, {{in the first}} season after the Second World War, but following a slow downturn in performance the club was <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Second Division in 1954.

In normal circumstances this meant the club would have been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Football Conference, but the Football League's plan to expand its competition {{in time for the}} 1991–92 season meant there was to be no demotion.|$|E
25|$|The table below {{shows the}} current {{structure}} of the system. For each division, its official name, sponsorship name (for levels 1–8, if it differs from its historic name) and number of clubs is given.

40|$|This paper extends bialgebraic {{semantics}} [1, 2] to {{take into}} account notions of behaviour that lead to process equivalences coarser than bisimulation.

He returned in April for Newcastle, playing all nine of Newcastle's remaining league fixtures and scoring his only goal of the campaign from a free kick in a win over Peterborough United. Due to the form of Danny Guthrie and Kevin Nolan, Barton had to play left wing when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Brennus {{spent the}} {{majority}} of her career in the Mediterranean Squadron, and she served as its flagship early in her career. In 1900, she accidentally rammed and sank the destroyer Framée.

By the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, her old age and poor condition prevented her from seeing action. She was ultimately stricken from the naval register in 1919 and sold for scrap three years later.|$|E
