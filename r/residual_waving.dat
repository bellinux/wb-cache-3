40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the work of}} Lighthill (1) for one-diniensional {{unsteady}} motion is extended {{to the problem of}} steady, supersonic flow past a two-dimensional slender body. Goldsworthy (2) and others have shown that, in the limit when the Mach number, M, of the undisturbed flow tends to infinity, the two motions become identical. As in (1), an accuracy hypothesis is formulated concerning the degree of accuracy of the Friedrichs theory (3) for nearly plane, two-dimensional, steady shocks. A comprehensive check of this theory on the lines of the accuracy hypothesis is made for a fluid with general thermodynamic properties: in the process of justifying this hypothesis the picture of the flow as a whole is improved. A relationship is found between the increased total energy flux across a plane transverse to the flow in the <b>residual</b> <b>wave,</b> and the entropy flux across the region of the shock upstream from this plane. The relationship is checked by comparing the value of the pressure fluctuations in the <b>residual</b> <b>wave</b> (due to entropy change at the shock) as determined from a consideration of conditions in the <b>residual</b> <b>wave,</b> with the value obtained from an investigation of the local reflection of the simple wave in the shock. The work is extended to the problem of the actual flow past a two-dimensional aero-foil when there are two shocks forming an N-wave, and in this case, conditions very far downstream are investigated. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{response}} {{turns from}} linear to nonlinear when high intensity waves propagate in optical fibers, causing {{the emergence of}} nonlinear phenomena such as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and four wave mixing (FWM). While that phenomena cause optical communication systems to deteriorate, they are nevertheless usehl for certain applications such as in multiple wavelengths generation. This dissertation presents experimental work that involves the manipulation of FWM in the developments of lasers and cascades. Four main research studies are successhlly demonstrated in {{efforts to improve the}} performance of FWM-based lasers and cascades. The first study is related to multiwavelength BEFLs. Despite the advantage of wide tunability, they unfortunately suffer from the laser output flatness {{due to the nature of}} cascaded SBS processes. In this work, FWM in an optical fiber is applied to the laser lines of a multiwavelength BEFL through the incorporation of <b>residual</b> <b>waves</b> in order to make the output flat. Comparisons between the BEFL with and without the assistance of FWM suggest the effectiveness of the proposed technique. With the assistance of FWM, the uniformity or flatness records a 3. 73 dB improvement as compared to the case without the assistance of FWM when the Brillouin pump is set to 1550 nrn. The second research work is related to an experimental study on the <b>residual</b> <b>waves</b> of multiwavelength BEFLs. Experimental results suggest that the properties of <b>residual</b> <b>waves</b> are influenced by FWM. Multiple FWM processes in fibers are believed to cause the output power of the <b>residual</b> <b>waves</b> to grow gradually and the value of optical-signal-to-noise ratio to be lower due to the power sharing basis of FWMprocesses. The third research work, on the other hand, is aimed to improve continuous tunability of erbium-doped fiber lasers (EDFLs) in which the stability is obtained from multiple FWM processes in optical fibers. With the incorporation of tunable bandpass filters in the laser cavity, a proposed dual wavelength EDFL can achieve continuous wavelength spacing from 0. 52 nm to 22. 78 nm, limited only by the gain bandwidth of the erbium-doped fiber amplifier and the linewidth of filters. In the fourth research work, FWM cascades without external laser sources and modulators is proposed in a bid to reduce the complexity of the system. The need for laser sources is catered by a dual wavelength EDFL which acts as an intracavity pump, while the requirement for pump modulators for SBS suppression is tackled by the broad linewidth of the EDFL. In summary, four research studies that are related to FWM in generating multiple wavelengths are experimentally demonstrated in this thesis. The first two studies focus on improvements in BEFLs, while the third and fourth study is for enhancements in EDFLs and FWM cascades respectively. All the four studies are found to be effective in elevating the performances and understanding of FWMbased lasers and cascades to fwther heights...|$|R

30|$|The {{algorithm}} {{for measuring}} and correcting <b>residual</b> <b>wave</b> aberrations described above requires a relatively flat, defect-free region within {{a portion of}} the full field-of-view. A small reference region will degrade the accuracy of the measured aberration function. In the experimental results shown below, the size of the reference region was ≈ 50 unit cells for the Si 3 N 4 sample, ≈ 1000 unit cells for the graphene sample, and ≈ 150 unit cells for the silicon wedge. The accuracy of the residual aberration function also depends on the signal to noise and accuracy of the exit wave reconstruction or measurement. If the crystalline region of the sample contains random variation of the exit wave due to an amorphous layer on the surface, or systematic variations due to surface reconstruction, the resulting aberration function may contain small errors. This issue can be minimized by using as large a reference region as possible, and with good sample preparation methods.|$|R

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations contribute {{a key part of}} an ERA and predict possible blast consequences in a hazardous area.

Dynamic responses of structures under these explosion loads are dependent on a blast wave profile with respect to the magnitude of pressure, duration, and impulse in both positive and negative phases. Understanding the relationship between explosion load profiles and dynamic responses of the target area is important to mitigate the risk of explosion and perform structural design optimization.

Combined with the Subaru 36 elements adaptive optics (AO), CIAO can produce nearly diffraction limited image with ∼ 0. 07 arcsec FWHM at K band and high dynamic range imaging with ∼ 10 mag difference at 1 arcsec separation under typical seeing conditions. We have carried out performance tests of imaging without and with coronagraph mask since its first light observation held on 2000 February. Because of limited weather conditions, the performance under best seeing conditions has not been tested yet. At a typical natural seeing condition of 0. 4 - 0. 8 arcsec, halo component of PSF using 0. 2 - 0. 8 arcsec mask can be reduced up to 70 % comparing with that without mask using AO.

In the generation of any wave in the tank we get the relevant primary wave components along with bounded wave components if the incident primary wave has more than one frequency. Inevitably we also get interacted wave components, natural frequency components of the tank and other free waves. In this paper the tank's natural frequency components, bounded wave components and other free waves after {{the termination}} of wave making were investigated using several cases of mono- and bi-chromatic waves. These component energies were then compared with the total energy of the measured primary waves. The magnitudes of the residual undulations are also investigated for mono-, bi- and multichromatic waves over different time segments. Several sets of wave data are analysed to perceive the energy due to natural frequency of the basin, energy transferred to the side bands and the damping rate of the <b>residual</b> <b>waves</b> in the tank with respect to the chosen incident wave conditions.

40|$|The {{reflected}} wave is {{expressed by the}} sum of a wave according to the geometrical ray theory and the residual from it which gives, in the far regions, the refraction event (or head wave). The amplitude of the geometrical {{reflected wave}} is evaluated from {{the effect of the}} spherical spreading and the plane wave reflection coefficient for the corresponding angle of incidence. However the amplitude of the <b>residual</b> <b>wave</b> in the region nearer than the critical angle reflection point is sufficiently small, from this point it starts to rise, and in the far regions decays monotonically following the well-known decay relation of the refraction wave, (γL 13) - 1 / 2, where γ is the horizontal separation and L 1 is the distance travelled in the refractor. The correction to this amplitude is of the order √k 2 γ/(k 2 L 1 √ 1 -n 2) compared with unity, where k 2 is the wave number in the refractor and n is the refractive index. The correction to the geometrical reflected wave is of the order (k 1 γ) - 2 compared with unity, where k 1 is the wave number in the other medium. Since the frequency dependence of these waves is different from each other, the pulse shape of each event is fairly different. From the energy fraction across the interface the refraction wave is associated with the inhomogeneous wave in the refractor. |点状源から放射された波による反射波が,幾何光学的反射波と残りの反射波との和として計算される. 前者は波線がなす見掛けの入射波に対する平面波の反射係数に,波面の拡がりの影響を加へたものとして与へられる. 一方,後者は前者からの凡ゆる残差の和として,積分表示で与へられる. 後者の積分は複素積分に変換され,最峻急降下法によつて吟味される. とうげ点を通る積分からは幾何光学的反射波に対する補正項が求められ,もし必要ならば,分岐線積分から屈折波が計算される. 分岐点がとうげ点に近い時には,分岐線積分の計算が非常に困難になるので,両点を結ぶ線上の積分によつて積分を近似した. 結果を述べると,上記残差の反射波の振幅分布は,臨界反射点迄は充分小さく,臨界点から急激に増して,それ以遠では屈折波の振幅係数 1 /(γL 13) 1 / 2 に比例して減衰する. ここにγは波源と観測点間の水平距離であり,L 1 は屈折媒質中を伝はる波線の長さである. 亦,幾何光学的反射波に対する補正量は 1 に比べて 1 /(k 1 γ) 2 の大きさであり,屈折波に対するそれは 1 に比べて√k 2 γ/Kk 2 L 1 √ 1 -n 2) の大きさである. ここで,nは屈折率,k 1,k 2 は夫々の媒質に於ける波数である...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} spherical cloak {{described}} by a non-singular asymmetric elasticity tensor C depending upon a small parameter η, that defines the softness of a region one would like to conceal from elastodynamic waves. By varying η, we generate a class of soft spheres dressed by elastodynamic cloaks, which are shown to considerably reduce the scattering of the soft spheres. Importantly, such cloaks also provide some wave protection except for a countable set of frequencies, for which some large elastic field enhancement can be observed within the soft spheres. Through an investigation of trapped modes in elasticity, we supply a good approximation of such Mie-type resonances by some transcendental equation. Our results, unlike previous studies that focused merely on the invisibility aspects, shed light on potential pitfalls of elastodynamic cloaks for earthquake protection designed via geometric transforms: a seismic cloak needs to be designed {{in such a way}} that its inner resonances differ from eigenfrequencies of the building one wishes to protect. In order to circumvent this downfall of field enhancement inside the cloaked area, we introduce a novel generation of cloaks, named here, mixed cloaks. Such mixed cloaks consist of a shell that detours incoming waves, hence creating an invisibility region, and of a perfectly matched layer (PML, located at the inner boundary of the cloaks) that absorbs <b>residual</b> <b>wave</b> energy {{in such a way that}} aforementioned resonances in the soft sphere are strongly attenuated. The designs of mixed cloaks with a non-singular elasticity tensor combined with an inner PML and non-vanishing density bring seismic cloaks one step closer to a practical implementation. Note in passing that the concept of mixed cloaks also applies in the case of singular cloaks and can be translated in other wave areas for a similar purpose (i. e. to smear down inner resonances within the invisibility region) ...|$|R

Studies of headland-bound pocket beaches in coral reef environments are evenmore sparse notwithstanding {{an increasing number}} of studies of coral reef shorelines. Mayotte Island, in the Indian Ocean, is characterised by a coral reef-lagoon complex and numerous pocket beaches nested between volcanic headlands. Field experimentswere conducted in order to: comparewave attenuation fromthe outer barrier reef to the inner reef flat fronting three pocket beaches, analyse attenuation patterns across an inner reef flat fronting one of the beaches, and document beach morphological changes. Wave attenuation exceeded 90 %, and increased as wave heights increased, with maximum attenuation of moderately large waves (significant wave heights> 1. 8 m) generated by a category 1 cyclone (Jokwe). Further attenuation across the inner reef flat was neither related to reef width nor correlated with water depth, but the correlation was slightly better with relative wave height. Attenuation increased as relative wave height decreased. Patterns of beach morphological change driven by <b>residual</b> <b>wave</b> energy following reef attenuation were strongly affected by the degree of beach embayment. Mtsanga Gouela and Trevani beaches are characterised by a low bay indentation conducive to longshore sediment mobility, and provide rare examples of inferred rotation of reef-fronted beaches, similar to rotation of drift-aligned beaches in non-reef settings. In contrast, Dapani beach, nested in a strongly indented bay, was dominated by seasonal cross-shore sand exchange. In addition to reef-driven wave attenuation, an important factor differentiating pocket beaches in coral reef settings and non-reef settings is the inner reef flat. The historical stability of the beaches suggests that the outer limits of cross-shore seasonal or cyclone-induced sediment movements are set over these reef flats. Further studies of reef-fronted pocket beaches will require better elucidation of the effect of the fronting reef flats on sediment transport and storage, and of the role of heterogeneity in sediment grain size and density common in reef environments in volcanic settings...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the problem of}} {{approximating}} the continuous­-spectrum (CS) current excited by a delta­gap source on a microstrip line is addressed, {{on the basis of}} a rigorous asymptotic evaluation of the relevant spectral­domain integral representation. It is well known [1] that the CS current can be represented, in terms of the spectral Green's function singularities, as a sum of the discrete contribution of physical leaky­wave (LW) poles, if any, and the contribution of the integrals along the steepest­descent paths through the relevant branch points. The latter contribution is called residual­wave (RW) current. Such a representation is particularly useful in those cases when the contribution of a single LW pole allows us to accurately represent the CS. However, there are frequency regions in which the LW poles are not physical (spectral­gap regions), and therefore the RW is the main contribution to the CS. In any case, since the LW has an exponential decay while the RW has an algebraic asymptotic decay with the longitudinal z coordinate, the latter is the dominant contribution to the CS at large distances from the source and thus deserves a careful investigation. In the case of a microstrip line, the asymptotic behavior of the possible RW currents has been reported. The aim of the present work is to provide a rigorous asymptotic study of the possible types of <b>residual</b> <b>waves</b> in a microstrip line, i. e., bound­mode residual­wave currents related to TM and TE waves of the background structure and free­space residual­wave current related to the k 0 wavenumber. By means of suitable integral evaluations in the complex plane of the transverse spectral variable via Cauchy Integral Theorem, an accurate analytical approximation of the spectral integrand has been obtained in a neighborhood of the relevant branch point. In particular, an explicit expression for the numerical coe#cient arising in the asymptotic expansion obtained through Watson's Lemma has been provided in a closed form.

30|$|We have {{developed}} an algorithm for measuring and correcting <b>residual</b> coherent <b>wave</b> aberrations in complex exit waves of crystalline samples, measured in transmission electron microscopy. Our algorithm relies on creating a synthetic exit wave by applying point-symmetrization to all atomic columns in a reference region, to approximate the aberration-free exit wave. Because our method is objective and automatic, it is not prone to operator errors that could be introduced from manual correction of the residual aberrations. It {{is important to note}} that no symmetrization is applied to the final experimental exit wave. We have applied our method to three experimental datasets, focal series reconstructions of a Si_ 3 N_ 4 wedge and a single-layer graphene grain boundary, and an off-axis hologram of a silicon wedge. In all cases, the residual aberration correction improved the precision, accuracy and interpretability of the complex exit waves. Our algorithm is simple to implement, and applicable to a large class of experimental exit wave measurements of crystalline samples oriented along a low-index zone axis.|$|R
40|$|A tight {{array of}} seismographs {{spanning}} a 500 km traverse of southern Tibet resolved anisotropy from SKS with a spatial variation of its direction {{and an increase}} northward of the splitting delay, {{as well as of}} its first arrival <b>residual.</b> Both <b>waves</b> split by velocity anisotropy are slow relative to P and their waveform analysis may be interpreted to suggest attenuation anisotropy. The array here provides examples of residuals and splitting of other S waves which do not tightly conform to the anisotropy assumed in the simplest model of olivine of transverse isotropy with horizontal symmetry axis. S waves are also split, with parameters which vary along the array, and hence are relevant to near-receiver structure like those of SKS Their splitting delay, for non-vertical incidence and polarization, appears larger than that for SKS Residuals of S-wave first arrivals and splitting delays increase less northwards for S than SKS. Anisotropy with a slow vertical axis may account for these observations. Its origin may be related to horizontal shear or flow in low-velocity layers. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{specifications}} for the RF load {{to be used}} for absorbing the traveling wave {{at the end of an}} NLCTA accelerator section are that it be well matched over a broad band of frequencies (10 # minimum), centered at 11. 424 GHz, and capable of handling up to 63 MW peak and 3 kW average power. We present a ceramic (Aluminum Nitride + 7 # glassy carbon) load design which satisfies these requirements. It consists of a thin strip of dielectric material with a tapered surface placed inside each narrow wall of the waveguide. The complex dielectric constant of the ceramic at X-Band frequencies was first determined by measurement. Based on the measured values, a MAFIA model is used to evaluate the matching and the power dissipation. Results of the simulations indicate an optimal thickness of 0. 045 in and overall length of 10 in. I. INTRODUCTION The NLCTA requires RF loads to absorb the considerable amount of <b>residual</b> traveling <b>wave</b> power exiting each accelerator section. Very compact, high-power wate [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} is to improve understanding of wind and wave processes a↵ecting the upper ocean boundary layer, {{with an emphasis on}} in situ observations of small scales (i. e., the equilibrium range at high wavenumbers). The specific goals are to: • Measure frequency-directional wave spectra, including the equilibrium range, • Estimate the direct input of momentum from the wind to the waves and from the wind to the upper ocean, • Estimate the transfer of momentum from waves to the upper ocean as the <b>residual</b> of <b>wave</b> growth, wave radiation, and wave breaking, Research Plan Field observations will use SWIFT buoys to measure wind stress and wave breaking dissipation (Thomson, 2012) and Waveriders to measure frequency-directional wave spectra (Kuik et al., 1988). Figure 2 shows an example of the dissipation profile beneath a breaking wave observed with a SWIFT, and Figure 1 shows wave spectra at station P (N 50, W 145) observed with a Waverider. These measurements will provide the forcing and context for a DRI field experiment in 2015, while simultaneously investigating the momentum balance of the equilibrium range...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the electromagnetic fields reflected, transmitted, and diffracted by a finite reinforced concrete slab {{in the presence of}} a source, a Green's function/method of moments approach has been developed. In doing so, a Green's function solution for a finite and electrically thick dielectric slab is obtained. The Green's function for the arbitrary position of the source and field point is based on the interior Green's function, i. e. the Green's function when the source and the field point are both inside the slab. The solution is two-dimensional, with an electric line source excitation. The first development in this thesis presents an interior electric field Green's function for a thick and finite dielectric slab. The presented solution is based on the separation of variables method which gives an exact solution to a separable slab. The separable slab is closely related to the finite slab. The separable slab solution is expressed in terms of the contribution of the surface wave modes plus the remaining part which is called the "residual wave"' contribution. In order to model a finite slab, the surface wave contribution of the separable slab is modified since the separable slab solution fails to model the finite slab when a surface wave mode is close to resonance. The modification is done by correcting the end cap reflection coefficient for each mode and accounting for the mode conversions. The mode conversions and reflections are characterized by the end cap scattering matrix which is obtained by the method of moments. As a result, the interior Green's function solution for a finite slab is the modified surface wave solution plus the <b>residual</b> <b>wave</b> contribution obtained for the separable slab. The Green's functions for the cases when the source and/or field points are outside the slab are obtained using the interior Green's function and the surface equivalence principle. Having the finite slab Green's function, it is possible to model a finite reinforced concrete slab. Since the metallic rods are assumed to be electrically thick, each metallic rod is replaced by a circular array of thin wires complying with the "same surface area" rule of thumb. To obtain the unknown induced currents on the surface of the thin wires, the method of moments is used in conjunction with the finite slab Green's function. The model is used to investigate the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves for some cases of practical interes...|$|R
