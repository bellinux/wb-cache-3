50|$|Side {{windows were}} not {{existent}} in open cars, {{which may have}} detachable side screens, or manually or power-operated glass side windows as in a saloon or sedan. <b>Rear</b> <b>windows</b> have evolved similarly, with plastic <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> appearing {{as late as the}} first-generation Porsche Boxster. Contemporary convertibles and retractable hardtops feature heatable glass <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> to maximize visibility - though <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> often can compromise visibility by their size, as with the case of the very small <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and restricted visibility of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. Plastic windows can degrade, fade, yellow, and crack over time, diminishing visibility.|$|R
2500|$|Early in 1982, Rover {{unveiled}} the Cowley-built, facelifted {{line to the}} public. These cars benefited mostly from small cosmetic changes on the exterior {{as well as a}} quite extensively redesigned interior. Car spotters can distinguish the two series by the headlights, which were chrome-rimmed and flush fitting on the later, recessed on the earlier series, the deeper <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> now fitted with a rear <b>wash</b> <b>wipe,</b> and the new plastic wrap around bumpers which replaced the three-piece rubber and stainless steel ones. Other details, which are not as easy to assign include the full-width rear badge strip under the tail lights, engine size badges on front wings, and a range of new wheel trims and alloy wheels. [...] The automatic gearbox was now a GM180 model, still offering three speeds but better ratios. [...] The electric window switch pack moved from the centre console to the driver's door (and is well remembered for lacking edge finishing trim around the recesses), and a fully automatic choke appeared – eliminating the manual choke lever which had a tendency to break.|$|R

Occasionally the platina plates (569.), {{after being}} made the {{positive}} pole of the battery, were <b>washed,</b> <b>wiped</b> with filtering-paper or a cloth, and <b>washed</b> and <b>wiped</b> again. Being then introduced into mixed oxygen and hydrogen, they acted apparently {{as if they}} had been unaffected by the treatment. Sometimes the tubes containing the gas were opened in the air for an instant, and the plates put in dry; but no sensible difference in action was perceived, except that it commenced sooner.|$|R
5000|$|They {{have also}} been {{extensively}} applied to <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use. For instance in Sweden that is the normal place to put them and the bumper sticker is actually called [...] "bakrutedekal" [...] (<b>rear</b> <b>window</b> decal).|$|R
50|$|In 1970 a {{flow-through}} ventilation system, where vents {{were added}} towards {{the rear of}} the car (on the exterior under the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> were introduced. The split <b>rear</b> side <b>window</b> on the 145 became one piece which was no longer possible to open.|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: Presently, skin-cleaning {{agents that}} claim to be removed by water or wiping alone are commercially {{available}} and {{have been used for}} the purpose of bed baths. However, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on how water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping</b> differently affect skin physiological functions or ceramide content. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping</b> on skin physiological functions and ceramide content. Methods: Three kinds of the cleaning agents with different removal techniques (ie, water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping)</b> were used in this study. Skin physiological functions (ie, transepidermal water loss, skin hydration, and skin pH) and skin ceramide content were measured before and after seven consecutive days of the application of each cleaning agent. Results: No significant differences in skin physiological functions or ceramide content were observed between water <b>washing</b> and <b>wiping.</b> Conclusion: Cleaning agents {{that claim to}} be removed by water <b>washing</b> or <b>wiping</b> do not affect skin physiological functions or ceramide content by either removal method. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. in Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R

50|$|In 1957, Mercury {{introduced}} the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, featuring a roofline with a retractable <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> From 1958 to 1960, the feature made its {{return on the}} Continental Mark-series line, with a reverse-slant <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> (on both hardtops and convertibles). For 1963, Mercury re{{introduced the}} feature as an option for the Monterey; to streamline production, elements of the window design were shared with Ford station wagons. From 1963 to 1966, the optional reverse-slant roofline with retracting <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was unique to Mercury, featured by no other American brand.|$|R
