40|$|Palygorskite {{aggregated}} grains {{occur in}} aerosol dust samples in western Mediterranean Sea. Morphology {{and texture of}} palygorskite grains was characterized analytical using SEM with attached X-ray energy dispersive system. Palygorskite occurs as <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregate</b> grains (wind-shaped), as interwoven fibrous mats forming fine laminae, and as porefilling and pore-bridging cements that commonly coat detrital grains and occur among them. The results show distinct and characteristic textures of palygorskite in dry (aerosol in air) and wet (precipitation) deposition. The main sources of this clay mineral are the dry rivers, lake beds, salt lakes, and argillaceous bed-rocks in northwestern Africa.

40|$|The {{transition}} {{towards a}} low-carbon infrastructure {{requires an understanding}} of the embodied carbon (eCO 2) associated with concrete. However, much current work on eCO 2 underestimates the complexity of its relationship with concrete mix design. This paper demonstrates how eCO 2 of concrete is not a simple function of strength. Rather, for a given strength, considerable eCO 2 savings can be made by careful attention to basic mix design. Replacement of cement with PFA (pulverised fuel ash) can achieve considerable savings; additionally, using a concrete of lower workability, employing a superplasticiser, using crushed rather than <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregate</b> and using a higher strength of cement can have comparably significant effects. The analysis is presented in terms of embodied carbon per unit strength; this shows that there is an optimum strength for all concretes (with regard to minimising eCO 2 per unit of structural performance) of between 50 and 70 MPa...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that puromycin, commonly known as an inhibitor of protein synthesis (35), induces the following ultrastructural changes: mitochondrial swelling, cisternal dilatation of rough endoplasmic reticulum, formation of intracisternal granules, disaggregation of polysomes, and an increase in number of autophagic vacuoles (11, 18, 19). In addition, two kinds of membrane-unbound bodies have been observed after puromycin injection: the small, amorphous, electron-dense granular mass in pancreatic acinar cells (18) and gastric chief cells (19), and the <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregate</b> of granular or amorphous material similar to the cytoplasmic nucleolus-like bodies in the nerve cells of the mouse entorhinal cortex (11). During the course of cytochemical studies on the cytoplasmic nucleolus-like bodies (manuscript in preparation), our attention was called to the fact that puromycin induces aggregates of tubular material which are ultrastructurally different from the nucleolus-like body (14 - 17). The present report describes such aggregates in the dorsal sensory nucleus of the vagus of the medulla oblongata of the mouse and rat. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighteen mice of both sexes weighing 30 - 35 g and six male and female rats weighing 200 - 250 g were used in this study. Puromycin dihydrochloride was purchase...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} {{of nickel}} from nickel sulphate bath was studied in ammonia medium. The electrolytic conditions for nickel deposition was optimized at room temperature. The effect of acetone on current efficiency, morphology, stability and particle size of deposited nickel powder was studied. The effect of organic additive Tribenzyl ammonium chloride (TBAC) on the morphology of nickel powder was also studied. The kinetics of electrodeposition was studied {{and the results}} were utilized in developing mathematical model. During electrodeposition the current efficiency was found to increase with increase in acetone concentration up to 15 % V/V in bath solution. On further increase of acetone concentration in bath solution current efficiency decreases. The stability of the electrowon deposited nickel powder was found to be in the range of 85 to 89 %. Powder morphology was found to be dentritic, porous and irregular. The morphology was also found to be underdeveloped dentritic to <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregate</b> as the concentration of organic additive TBAC increases. The average particle size of the deposited powder was found to be decreasing as the concentration of the acetone increases. The average size of the particle is in the range of 13 - 16 m...|$|E
40|$|The {{puncture}} {{resistance of}} geotextiles in Australia {{is measured in}} terms of the G-Rating, which is the product of CBR and drop cone puncture test results. CBR and drop cone puncture tests were conducted on 24 geotextiles to provide up-to- date results, and to evaluate the G-Rating. CBR puncture tests using modified plungers were also conducted to assess the accuracy of shape factors quoted in the literature- 3. 0 for angular aggregate and 0. 8 for <b>rounded</b> <b>aggregate.</b> Wide strip tensile tests were also conducted to compare with CBR puncture test results. The results of the testing program show no relationship between wide strip tensile test results and CBR puncture test results. The modified plunger CBR puncture test results show that shape factors are not only shape dependent, but are fabric dependent as well, with the results somewhat different from those commonly quoted. The exponent used to calculate the G-Rating varies for the same fabric tested at different drop heights in the drop cone puncture test. Also, the restriction of elongation in CBR puncture tests to 80 per cent by the G-Rating classification system, was found unnecessary for all the geotextiles tested, as elongation at failure in all cases did not exceed 80 per cent. A Rupture Index classification is proposed, being the product of failure load and vertical plunger displacement at failure in a CBR puncture test. It is considered to be simpler than the G-Rating as it relies on the results of only one test. The Rupture Index calculated for a given fabric will not vary by more than the inherent variability of the specimens tested. However, G-Rating values were shown to vary considerably for the same fabric tested at different drop heights in the drop cone puncture test...|$|E

40|$|Certain {{embryonic}} tissue {{masses and}} cell aggregates behave like deformable solids during brief experimental manipulations but like viscous liquids in long-term organ cultures. To investigate these seemingly paradoxical physical properties, we have mechanically deformed cell aggregates derived from several embryonic chick organs by centrifuging them against solid substrata. Aggregate shapes during brief centrifugation were observed directly in a microscope-centrifuge. In addition, techniques were devised for fixing cell aggregates during prolonged centrifugation. Evidence presented here shows that these fixative-injection procedures accu-rately preserve the prefixation shapes of living centrifuged aggregates. According {{to a simple}} viscous-liquid model for cell aggregates, cohering cells slide past one another when external forces and/or tissue surface tensions cause gradual rearrangements in aggregate conformations. In earlier experiments, 2 types of behaviour predicted from this model were confirmed for several embryonic chick tissues subjected to prolonged centrifugation. First, initially fiat <b>aggregates</b> <b>rounded</b> up against the centrifugal force to adopt the same shapes that initially <b>round</b> <b>aggregates</b> reached by flattening. Second, the relative roundness of centri-fuged aggregates of different tissues at shape equilibrium correlated with the relative position...|$|R

500|$|Kinkladze's {{year and}} a half spell without a club came to an end in October 2004. Kinkladze's former {{international}} teammate Temuri Ketsbaia was player-manager at financially troubled Cypriot team Anorthosis. Ketsbaia gave his old friend a chance to rebuild his career, offering him a contract to play for Anorthosis. He made his debut against title contenders APOEL on 21 November and marked it with a fine goal. He scored once more in a 5–0 home victory against Olympiakos Nicosia, and in February he was recalled to Georgia's squad for the friendly against Lithuania. His contract was initially only for one season, but the club extended it for another year. Anorthosis ended the season successfully by winning the Cypriot championship and earned a place in the qualifying rounds of 2005–06 UEFA Champions League, where, thanks to the club's good run, Kinkladze played five times. He started both legs of a 2–1 first <b>round</b> <b>aggregate</b> win against Dinamo Minsk, was twice a substitute in a 3–2 second <b>round</b> <b>aggregate</b> win against Süper Lig runners-up Trabzonspor, and played the full 90 minutes in a 1–2 third round home defeat against Rangers. His display against Rangers caught the attention of Rubin Kazan’s manager Gurban Berdiýew, who invited him to join the Russian club. On 22 August 2005, Kinkladze played his last game for Anorthosis against Omonia in the Cypriot Super Cup and two days later, {{on the day of the}} second leg of the tie against Rangers, he left to close a deal with Rubin. Ketsbaia said regarding the departure: [...] "I don't want players who have no wish to play for Anorthosis. As far as I'm concerned the Kinkladze chapter is now closed." ...|$|R
30|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} approaches to developing an SCC mix design. The first is material-based, the second is chemically-based, {{and the third is}} a hybrid of the first two. The first approach focuses on modifying the aggregate types and amounts. Typically, the coarse aggregate content is reduced and also <b>rounder</b> <b>aggregate</b> is used to improve the flowability of the SCC mix. The main disadvantage of this approach is that with a lower coarse aggregate content, aggregate interlock, and as a result shear strength, is reduced. To avoid this issue, the second approach was developed and, in this approach, the coarse aggregate and paste contents are kept the same as in a CC mix. To improve the flowability and stability of this type of mix, high-range water-reducing admixtures (HRWRA) and viscosity-modifying admixtures (VMA) are used.|$|R
