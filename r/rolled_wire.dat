To {{improve the quality of}} <b>rolled</b> <b>wire</b> it is necessary to obtain continuous casting specimen with the maximum possible length of the zone of equiaxial crystals, dispersed centerline segregation, centerline porosity being welded in the process of hot plastic deformation. Objective. To investigate the continuous casting specimen dendritic structure influence on structure formation in <b>rolled</b> <b>wire</b> associated with the segregation phenomena. Methods. The research was carried out on the industrial continuous casting lots with the initial cross section of 125 ´ 125 mm from C 82 D and C 86 D steels and 11, 0 mm in the ready-made diameter. The optical light microscope «Axiovert 200 M MAT» and the binocular microscope «MBI- 2 » were used. Results. The formation of dendritic structures is most favorable if electromagnetic mixing (EMM) technology is used.

Lattice girders are essentially determined by the mechanical properties and the lattice girder geometry. This article is concerned with trends and practical application of the lattice girder production technology. After hot rolling, the wire undergoes a further processing in the cold state. Compared to the hot-rolled steel, the new cold-formed wire has a lower ratio between tensile strength and yield stress and a lower elongation at maximum load. Ageing of steel also increases yield stress and tensile strength and reduces ductility. To make sure that lattice girders provide all required properties the cold <b>rolled</b> <b>wire</b> has to be produced with {{a certain degree of}} over-quality in ductility properties...|$|E

40|$|A lamp robot that obeys verbal orders. The {{principle}} of the lamp is basically a combination of two new technologies : speech recognition and memory metal. The lamp can move in six directions, and the movements can be generated by extremely small memory metal elements with a total mass of about 3 grams. The temperature of the memory elements and thus also their shape can be remote controlled by a system which exists of a Personal Computer with a speech recognition card and a microphone, an interface with D/A and A/D-converter and amplifier and the lamp robot itself. Heating of the memory metal is achieved by direct resistance heating pulses from the interface. The position of each drive system is recorded continiously by miniature precision potentiometers and any desired intermediate position can be reached and kept by spoken commands. A fast transformation of the TiNi-elements and so short response times is achieved {{by the use of}} very thin flat <b>rolled</b> <b>wire</b> of 0. 2 * 1. 7 mm, produced by Memory Metal Holland in Enschede. This flat wire combines high recovery forces with much higher cooling rates than round wire.

40|$|Abstract. Tools {{for rolling}} steels and super alloys, which are {{nowadays}} in general made from steel or cemented carbides, suffer from wear and/or from surface cracking caused by thermal fatigue. New tools made from silicon nitride show improved performance {{in respect to}} thermal shock loading and wear. But their low toughness manifests also {{a high risk of}} brittle failure. Nevertheless the successful use of silicon nitride rolls with having more than a manifold lifetime (compared to the conventional solutions) has been reported in the last years [1 - 3]. In this paper earlier work of the Institut für Struktur- und Funktionskeramik at Montanuniversität Leoben on highly loaded silicon nitride rolls is summarized, where the limits of the Application of silicon nitride rolling tools are discussed. On the extreme example of rolls for super alloy wire rolling the behaviour of small surface cracks in the roll track is discussed. It is shown that – for the investigated conditions- rolling high strength steel wires is manageable but rolling of super alloy wires will cause the growth of fatigue cracks, which may destroy the rolls after some tons of <b>rolled</b> <b>wire.</b> A not trivial problem to be solved is the connection of the ceramic tool with the metal parts of the roll stand. Thermal strains of the metal parts can be several times larger than those of the silicon nitride ceramic and can therefore cause very high thermal misfit strains, even if the heating of metal parts seems to be modest. This case is discussed on the example of a catastrophically failed ceramic tool. This clearly shows that not only the tool but also the joint of the tool {{to the rest of the}} machinery has to be designed carefully. In summary this work demonstrates that a successful use of silicon nitride ceramic tools for cold and hot forming of metals and alloys is possible...|$|E
40|$|Titanium (Ti) alloys {{have been}} {{commonly}} used in the aerospace industry, {{not only because they}} have a high strength-to-weight ratio (comparing to the steels) but also their satisfactory corrosion resistance. Furthermore, they can be assembled with the carbon fibre composite parts. However, conventional manufacturing methods cause high material scrap rate and require lots of machining to obtain the final shape and size, which increases both the manufacturing time and cost. In order to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of Ti parts, Additive Manufacturing (AM) has been developed. <b>Rolled</b> <b>Wire</b> and Arc Additive Manufacturing (rolled WAAM) is one of the AM processes. The main characteristics of this technology is the reduced β grain size to refine the alloy's microstructure. Both the ultimate tensile strength and yield strength of Ti alloy made by rolled WAAM are at least 10 % higher than traditional wrought Ti. This project is to investigate the fatigue crack growth rates of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V built by rolled WAAM process in both the longitudinal and transverse orientations to study the effect of rolling on fatigue crack growth rate of WAAM processed Ti. The project was carried out by testing the fatigue crack growth rates for 4 compact tension specimens. The test results of different orientations were compared with each other, and scatters in fatigue life and fatigue crack growth rate were found. Fatigue crack growth rate is lower in the longitudinal specimens. The results are also compared with those of the unrolled WAAM specimens tested in a previous project. It was found that rolling can significantly improve the fatigue crack growth behaviour in WAAM processed Ti, and can reduce {{the difference between the two}} orientations, i. e. achieving better isotropic material properties. Recorded scatters may be caused by the process induced residual stresses, error in measurement, and the test machine load range being much higher than the applied loads. More specimens can be tested to validate above observations further...|$|E
