5000|$|Another {{explanation}} {{that has been}} put forth connects Hrunting’s failure to the broader underlying message of Christianity prevalent throughout the poem. Kent Gould, in his essay [...] "Beowulf" [...] and Folktale Morphology: God as Magical Donor, suggests that Hrunting fails because {{it was given to}} Beowulf by Unferth, a heathen. Only the more powerful <b>replacement</b> <b>blade</b> that God gives Beowulf is capable of destroying evil. According to Gould, [...] "the message would be clear enough to the poem's Christian audience: only God can contribute enough power to overcome enemies to whom the poem has elsewhere given a Scriptural history." [...] Grendel and Grendel's mother have such a history, as Grendel's lineage is described in lines 106-108 to have descended from Cain.|$|E
50|$|Another {{style is}} a snap-off utility knife that {{contains}} a long, segmented blade that slides out from it. As the endmost edge becomes dull, it can be broken off the remaining blade, exposing the next section, which is sharp and ready for use. The snapping is best accomplished with a blade snapper that is often built-in, or a pair of pliers, and the break occurs at the score lines, where the metal is thinnest. When all of the individual segments are used, the knife may be thrown away, or, more often, refilled with a <b>replacement</b> <b>blade.</b> This design was introduced by Japanese manufacturer Olfa Corporation in 1956 as the world's first snap-off blade and was inspired from analyzing the sharp cutting edge produced when glass is broken and how pieces of a chocolate bar break into segments.|$|E

40|$|Our goal in {{this project}} is to design a <b>replacement</b> <b>blade</b> for the 100 kW Kenetech wind {{turbines}}. These turbines have a 30 meter rotor and are on 60 foot or 80 foot lattice towers. The originally designed blades are composed of Glass-Reinforces Plastic (fiberglass) with balsa wood supports. The majority of these 900 turbines have been installed for 20 years in the Altamont pass near Tracy, California. While these blades are reaching {{the end of their}} useful life, the turbines continue to perform extraordinarily well. To replace the blades with new blades using the original design would be costly and unreasonable due to the lessened life of the current turbines. By designing a less expensive and lower maintenance blade we can restore the feasibility of blade replacement and increase the overall lifetime of these turbines. Research shows the shell of the airfoil of a hybrid design turbine blade made with currently used fiberglass intertwined with plastic materials at points of blade with lower stresses. Sections of turbine blade with plastic lower cost in materials and reduce production time due to quicker manufacturing processes of those parts of the blade. Finite analysis and air turbine blade software WT_Perf were used as methods of final design. Though prototyping and testing are not within the scope of the project, Preliminary testing devices for stress and strain will be considered...|$|E

50|$|Lower unit {{protection}} {{is the primary}} advantage of composite materials. While the initial cost of a composite propeller is usually comparable to aluminum, it is significantly less than a stainless steel propeller. Additionally, <b>replacement</b> <b>blades</b> offer significant savings over metal propeller repairs. Another advantage to using composite propellers {{is that it is}} a lightweight material. Composite material is about half the weight of aluminum and 1/6 the weight of stainless steel propeller. A lightweight propeller reduces the amount of wear and tear on the entire boat.|$|R
50|$|The {{two-part tariff}} is {{another form of}} price {{discrimination}} where the producer charges an initial fee then a secondary fee {{for the use of}} the product. An example of this is razors, you pay an initial cost for the razor and then pay for the <b>replacement</b> <b>blades.</b> This pricing strategy works because it shifts the demand curve to the right: since you have already paid for the initial blade holder you will buy the blades which are now cheaper than buying a disposable razor.|$|R

50|$|A third pivotal {{innovation}} was {{a safety}} razor using a disposable double-edge blade that King Camp Gillette submitted a patent application for in 1901 and was granted in 1904.

The returning soldiers were permitted to keep that part of their equipment and therefore easily retained their new shaving habits. The subsequent consumer demand for <b>replacement</b> <b>blades</b> put the shaving industry on course toward its present form with Gillette as a dominant force. Prior to the introduction of the disposable blade, users of safety razors still needed to strop and hone the edges of their blades.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the possibility of extending the service life of an Inconel alloy 718 (IN 718) aero-engine turbine using the linear friction welding (LFW) process. In particular, the repair of a blade integrated disk (BLISK) through <b>replacement</b> of <b>blades</b> damaged in-service was emulated by LFW virgin IN 718 to in-service IN 718. The virgin 2 ̆ 013 in-service (V 2 ̆ 013 IS) welds were then characterized to evaluate the evolution in the microstructural features, such as the grain size, 3 ̆b 4 phase, MC-type carbides and MN-type nitrides, across the weld region. In the as-welded condition, the weld and thermomechanically affected zones exhibited highly integral characteristics (i. e., no oxides, voids, or contamination), as well as no constitutional liquation of secondary phases (e. g., carbides and Laves phases). In the weld zone, grain refinement of the austenite (3 ̆b 3) matrix was observed, using electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD), and related to the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization during LFW. The microhardness and tensile mechanical properties of the weldments were investigated in the as-welded condition and compared to weldments with a standard post-weld heat treatment (PWHT).

40|$|Controlling machine wear is a {{fundamental}} function of lubrication. By properly specifying lubricant viscosity, using appropriate modifying additives, and controlling contamination, wear rates can be minimized to extend equipment life. However, other influencing factors can still result in less than optimal component wear performance, including equipment loads, design issues, and environmental factors. Cryogenic treatment of tooling steels is a proven technology to increase wear resistance and extend intervals between component <b>replacements</b> for <b>blades,</b> bits, and machining mills. Recent work has also {{shed light on the}} effects of cryogenic treatment on bearings, gears and engine components to reduce wear and improve performance. Combining optimized lubrication, correct mechanical configuration, and cryogenic treatment of wearing parts results in the maximum performance of lubricated components, and can significantly extend component life. Reliability of operating systems is influenced by 5 factors: component design, manufacture, specification, installation, and maintenance. Each of these stages can be influenced by separate individuals or teams, but ultimately the responsibility for performance of the assembled system falls to the plant maintenance team.

40|$|The high {{replacement}} {{costs of}} aircraft gas turbine blades and vanes {{have created a}} fast-growing, highly-specialized segment of the aircraft repair industry. The economic rationale for repair in lieu of replacement is prima facie. The metallurgical rationale is less certain, but satisfactory flight performance over the past twenty-five years at least attests to the technical adequacy of blade and vane repairs. Blade repairs, other than re-coating, generally consist of weld overlays on low-stress blade tip or tip shroud locations. On average, high-pressure turbine blades undergo two repair cycles before <b>replacement.</b> Low-pressure turbine <b>blades</b> similarly require repair but are replaced less frequently. Dimensional restoration of a subtly distorted component to demanding original equipment standards is a real engineering challenge.
