2500|$|The [...] "C-type" [...] wing, or [...] "Universal wing" [...] was a {{more heavily}} {{modified}} wing, redesigned to reduce labour and manufacturing time, {{as well as to}} allow different armament configuration options to be fitted in a single, universal wing structure which could accommodate several different armament layouts without serious structural modification or alteration (a similar kind of wing was developed for the Hawker Hurricane, allowing anything from 8 to 10 [...]303 Brownings, to four 20mm Hispanos, to twin anti-tank 40mm Vickers [...] "S" [...] guns and a pair of [...]303's to be fitted into the same wing). Without modification, the [...] "universal" [...] wing could accept [...] "A", [...] "B", [...] "C" [...] or [...] "E-type" [...] armament configuration, although the [...] "E" [...] type wasn't used until later marks of Spitfire. The [...] "B" [...] type, 2-cannon, 4-Browning layout was by far the most commonly seen on [...] "C" [...] wing Spitfires, until the Mk IX and the [...] "E" [...] wing. Differences in the [...] "C" [...] wings include a second cannon-bay added directly alongside the first, and the #3 Browning gun being moved slightly outboard from ribs 13 to 14, making the two outer machine guns closer together than in the older [...] "B" [...] type wing. Although officially any aircraft with a universal wing is a [...] "C" [...] variant regardless of their armament configuration (excepting [...] "E" [...] types), in later popular (and incorrect) usage, [...] "C" [...] variants with the same armament as the [...] "B" [...] type are often called [...] "B" [...] variants, even though it's technically a [...] "C", and structurally it is different than the older [...] "B" [...] wing Spitfire. The new wing now had two inner gun bays able to accommodate cannon, although one bay was usually left empty.

In this case, the empty port is usually closed off with a <b>rubber</b> <b>plug.</b> The cannon mounts were also moved further back in the wing, so the barrel fairings of the cannon are shorter than on an original [...] "B" [...] Spitfire.|$|E

Two types of cementing plug are typically used on a cementing operation. The bottom plug is launched ahead of the cement slurry to minimize contamination by fluids inside the casing prior to cementing. A diaphragm in the plug body ruptures to allow the cement slurry to pass through after the plug reaches the landing collar. The top plug has a solid body that provides positive indication of contact with the landing collar and bottom plug through an increase in pump pressure.|$|E

50|$|American aerial attackers in the Aleutian islands had {{to contend}} with fog and low-lying cloud cover, as well as heavy Japanese {{defensive}} ground fire. The situation led to the use of forward air control. On 16 May 1943, General Eugene M. Landrum ordered his air chief of staff, Colonel William O. Eareckson to coordinate air strikes with ground operations for the invasion of Attu. Eareckson borrowed an OS2U Kingfisher from the USS Casco (AVP-12). Using the seaplane's low speed and maneuverability to his advantage, Eareckson flew reconnaissance missions to spot Japanese positions. He would then spiral up through the clouds to rendezvous with strike aircraft and either lead the strike into the targets or describe the target location to the fighter-bombers. Ground fire not only hit the Kingfisher; it sometimes punctured the plane's single float. Eareckson would land in shallow water, beach the plane, and plug the bullet holes with <b>rubber</b> <b>plugs</b> before resuming his mission.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of mechanical/microstructural evaluation, thermal shock/fatigue testing, and stress analyses of advanced hot-gas filters obtained from different manufacturers. These filters were fabricated from both monolithic ceramics and composites. The composite filters, made of both oxide and nonoxide materials, were in both as-fabricated and exposed conditions, whereas the monolithic filters were made only of nonoxide materials. Mechanical property measurement of composite filters included diametral compression testing with O-ring specimens and burst-testing of short filter segments with <b>rubber</b> <b>plugs.</b> In-situ strength of fibers in the composite filters was evaluated by microscopic technique. Thermal shock/fatigue resistance was estimated by measuring the strengths of filter specimens before and after thermal cycling from an air environment at elevated temperatures to a room temperature oil bath. Filter performance during mechanical and thermal shock/fatigue loadings was correlated with microstructural observations. Micromechanical models were developed to derive properties of composite filter constituents on the basis of measured mechanical properties of the filters. Subsequently, these properties were used to analytically predict the performance of composite filters during thermal shock loading...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{sometimes}} called [...] "aerosol cheese", its container is not actually an aerosol spray can, because the cheese does not usually combine with a propellant (such as nitrogen) {{to turn into}} a fine mist upon being sprayed. Rather, the can contains a piston and a barrier plastic cap which squeezes the cheese through the nozzle in a solid column when the nozzle is pressed and the propellant expands in volume. The propellant does not mix with the cheese. Normal aerosol cans are charged with all of their contents through the single opening at the top, but spray cheese cans are separately charged with the product through the top and propellant through the bottom. This explains why the can has a small <b>rubber</b> <b>plug</b> on its base. The can design also ensures that the cheese can be dispensed with the can upright or inverted.|$|E
50|$|Soyuz 7K-L1 No.4L was {{launched}} at 22:11:54 UTC on 27 September 1967 atop a Proton-K 8K78K carrier rocket with a Blok D upper stage, flying from Site 81/23 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. A <b>rubber</b> <b>plug</b> came loose and lodged in some plumbing at liftoff, causing one first stage engine to shut off. The booster eventually lost attitude control and became unstable during flight, so the automatic shutdown command was sent at T+97 seconds and it crashed downrange. The spacecraft {{separated from the}} rocket {{by means of the}} SAS launch escape system, and came down between 50 and 60 km downrange. The next morning, recovery crews located the descent module, however approaching it was tricky due to spilled propellant and still-burning booster debris in the area. It was collected by a Mil Mi-6 helicopter and returned to Baikonur. Prior to the release of information about its mission, NASA correctly identified that it had been a test of a spacecraft intended for manned Lunar flights. However, they were unsure whether it was intended to reach the Moon itself.|$|E
5000|$|A barrel plug is {{a plastic}} or <b>rubber</b> <b>plug</b> that fits snugly into the muzzle {{end of the}} marker's barrel, like a wine cork. If made of plastic, they {{generally}} incorporate one or more rubber o-rings to provide friction against the barrel surface. These were the original and universal form of barrel block before {{the introduction of the}} barrel sock, but are now generally eschewed by players and fields in favor of barrel socks. When using a barrel plug, if a paintball is fired, it will break against the plug in the barrel, lining the barrel with paint and drastically affecting accuracy until the barrel can be squeegeed. Barrel plugs can also be hard to remove and install properly; the high friction that keeps the plug in place when needed also inhibits its intentional removal. The force of the paintball impacting against the plug is often enough to dislodge it; with modern electronic markers having [...] "automatic" [...] and [...] "burst" [...] modes of fire, a single pull of the trigger may be enough to expel the barrel plug from the barrel, which can cause injury in itself, and also exposes those nearby to any further shots leaving the barrel after the plug has been expelled. Barrel plugs, therefore, are not an absolute safety against accidental marker discharge and eye injury.|$|E
30|$|Batch {{experiments}} for dechloronation of 2, 4 -DCP {{were performed}} in 15 -mL bottles. 0.5 – 2.0  mg Fe-MCM- 48 was loaded into bottles containing 10  mL of aqueous solution of 2, 4 -DCP (100 – 400  mg/L). The bottles were sealed with <b>rubber</b> <b>plugs</b> {{and placed on}} a TZ- 2 EH rotary shaker (100  r/min) during the entire experiment period (2 – 8  h). 2, 4 -DCP and its intermediate products were quantified with an Agilent 1100 HPLC equipped with a C 18 column and a L- 4000 UV–Vis detector. All samples were filtrated with 0.45 -μm filter film. The degradation efficiency (%D) was calculated from initial concentration (Co) and residual concentration (Ct) of 2, 4 -DCP (%D = [1  − (Ct/Co)] ×  100). The concentration of 2, 4 -DCP was obtained by measuring of surface area of HPLC peak. In order to investigate the adsorption of 2, 4 -DCP on heterogeneous reagent surface, the residual reagent in filtration step was washed with ethanol, water, and acetone solution and the obtained sample analyzed by HPLC method. The result showed {{that the amount of}} adsorbed 2, 4 -DCP molecules (that not dechloronated in the reaction) was < 5  % versus to initial concentration.|$|R
50|$|Difficulty or ease of {{core plug}} {{replacement}} depends upon physical accessibility {{in a crowded}} engine compartment.

50|$|In {{preparation}} for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool {{should also be}} closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with <b>rubber</b> <b>plugs,</b> to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover {{is attached to the}} pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a bungee cord and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or basketballs can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main drain plug removed and all water drained out. Drain plugs on the pool filter are removed after the filter has been cleaned. The pool pump motor is taken under cover. Winter chemicals are added to keep the pool clean. The innovation of a composite construction of fibreglass, with an epoxy coating and porcelain ceramic tiles has led to the Pre-form, Composite-type with significant advantages over older methods; however, it also has increased sensitivity to metal staining.|$|R
5000|$|The lead of {{the pencil}} {{is a mix of}} finely ground {{graphite}} and clay powders. Before the two substances are mixed, they are separately cleaned of foreign matter and dried in a manner that creates large square cakes. Once the cakes have fully dried, the graphite and the clay squares are mixed together using water. The amount of clay content added to the graphite depends on the intended pencil hardness (lower proportions of clay makes the core softer), and {{the amount of time spent}} on grinding the mixture determines the quality of the lead. The mixture is then shaped into long spaghetti-like strings, straightened, dried, cut, and then tempered in a kiln. The resulting strings are dipped in oil or molten wax, which seeps into the tiny holes of the material and allows for the smooth writing ability of the pencil. A juniper or incense-cedar plank with several long parallel grooves is cut to fashion a [...] "slat," [...] and the graphite/clay strings are inserted into the grooves. Another grooved plank is glued on top, and the whole assembly is then cut into individual pencils, which are then varnished or painted. Many pencils feature an eraser on the top and so the process is usually still considered incomplete at this point. Each pencil has a shoulder cut on one end of the pencil to allow for a metal ferrule to be secured onto the wood. A <b>rubber</b> <b>plug</b> is then inserted into the ferrule for a functioning eraser on the end of the pencil.|$|E
