5000|$|In Poland, {{the first}} system for {{denoting}} abbreviated dates used Roman numerals for months (e.g., 11 XI 1918 for Independence Day).The current year {{can be replaced}} by the abbreviation [...] ""and the current month can similarly {{be replaced by the}} abbreviation [...] "", in which case the year is omitted altogether.The <b>Roman</b> <b>notation</b> still prevails in private communication, except for date stamps where Arabic numerals are used (as in [...] "Berlin, 9.05.1945").The authorities changed the order of the date stamps in 1979 to follow Polish industrial standard PN-90/N-01204 (Polskie Normy) similar to ISO 8601; 1981-12-13 has been the preferred format since then.|$|E

50|$|The {{notation}} {{is similar}} to the older Roman numerals for numbers up to 9 (I - VIIII). Unlike the <b>Roman</b> <b>notation,</b> there are only symbols for numbers one ("I") and five ("U"). In inscriptions the notches are placed vertically on the stem or stav of the rune. The number 4 is represented by four horizontal lines on the stem, 5 is represented by what looks like an inverted letter U. 10 is represented by two U's opposing each other. Numbers up to 19, or even 20, can be represented by a combination of I's and U's, just like the Roman numerals are represented by combinations of I's and V's. (A Roman 10 is represented by two V's opposing each other).|$|E
5000|$|I beg {{to report}} that I have {{received}} two models in plaster and also {{a copy of a}} letter from Mr. Saint-Gaudens to the Director, in which there are certain statements that are somewhat misleading ... the relief of the design must conform to the fixed conditions and therefore, the only relief that I knew of was coin relief; the models now sent are not coin relief ... The date of the year is in <b>Roman</b> <b>notation,</b> there is no provision made for even next year, there being no place left, and as these coins have to stand for twenty-five years before another change can be made, I feel it necessary to state that within a few years {{it would be impossible to}} date the dies.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} stated that in <b>Roman</b> numeral <b>notation,</b> a vinculum may {{indicate}} that the numerals under the line represented a thousand times the unmodified value.

50|$|The {{sharpened}} subdominant diminished triad {{with minor}} seventh chord is represented with the <b>Roman</b> numeral <b>notation</b> iv7; {{the root of}} this chord is the raised subdominant (sharpened fourth). That root also serves as the leading tone to the dominant when used in the vii7/V function described above; such a function is the diminished, secondary-dominant equivalent of a backdoor progression. For example, in the key of C major, the chord playing this role is F7.|$|R
50|$|Until 1970, the Roman Catholic Church always {{celebrated the}} feast of Saint Matthias on a. d. VI Kal. Mart., so if the days were {{numbered}} {{from the beginning of}} the month, it was named February 24 in common years, but the presence of the bissextum in a bissextile year immediately before a. d. VI Kal. Mart. shifted the latter day to February 25 in leap years, with the Vigil of St. Matthias shifting from February 23 to the leap day of February 24. This shift did not take place in pre-Reformation Norway and Iceland; Pope Alexander III ruled that either practice was lawful (Liber Extra, 5. 40. 14. 1). Other feasts normally falling on February 25-28 in common years are also shifted to the following day in a leap year (although they would be on the same day according to the <b>Roman</b> <b>notation).</b> The practice is still observed by those who use the older calendars.|$|E

50|$|Beta turns {{are another}} type of “short” or local {{secondary}} structure that is distinct from the more common helices, beta sheets or random coils. Beta turns are reasonably abundant (15%) and very important secondary structures in proteins. In particular, beta turns {{play a critical role}} in defining the topology of proteins. They also likely play a role in initiating early packing events during the protein folding process. In VADAR beta turns are identified under the BTURN header using standard <b>Roman</b> numeral <b>notation</b> (I = type I, II = type II, etc.). In VADAR, beta turns are identified using a combination of different pieces of information including hydrogen bond data, the location of previously identified secondary structures and the value of their local dihedral angles. In VADAR the classification and nomenclature used for beta turns follows the definitions proposed by Wilmot and Thornton.|$|R
5000|$|Latin {{inscriptions}} are {{the most}} numerous. In the East, Greek was commonly employed, interesting dialects being occasionally found, as in the Christian inscriptions from Nubia in southern Egypt that were deciphered in the 19th century. Special mention should also {{be made of the}} Coptic inscriptions. The text is very often shortened by means of signs and abbreviations. At any early date, Christian abbreviations were found side by side with those traditionally used in connection with the religions of the Roman Empire. One of the most common was D.M. for Diis Manibus, [...] "to the protecting Deities of the Lower World." [...] The phrase presumably lost its original religious meaning and became a conventional formula as used by the early Christians. Most of the time, dates of Christian inscriptions must be judged from context, but when dates are given, they appear in <b>Roman</b> consular <b>notation,</b> that is, by naming the two consuls who held office that year. The method of chronological computation varied in different countries. The present Dionysian chronology does not appear in the early Christian inscriptions.|$|R
5000|$|Hour Groups: IPFs {{with only}} one or two {{interval}} classes can often be related to a single hour, and relabelled using the <b>Roman</b> numeral hour <b>notation</b> to make this relationship clear. For instance, the tetrachord IPF 242 clearly relates to the 'eighth hour', IPF 2-4 (set-class 3-8 in pc-set theory). It can therefore be labelled as VIII4 — the 4 relating to its cardinality, a tetrachord. Note that some IPFs cannot be labelled as hour-groups if the distribution of intervals is ambiguous: e.g. for IPF 2232, it is unclear as to whether the generating trichord is 2-2 (VI) or 2-3 (VII). However, 2232 can be rewritten as 3223, 5225 or 5555 or 2323, all of which are valid hour groups (see 'Multiple-Hour Groups' below).|$|R
40|$|Prior neuroimaging work on visual perceptual {{expertise}} {{has focused}} on changes in the visual system, ignoring possible effects of acquiring expert visual skills in nonvisual areas. We investigated expertise for reading musical notation, a skill likely {{to be associated with}} multimodal abilities. We compared brain activity in music-reading experts and novices during perception of musical <b>notation,</b> <b>Roman</b> letters, and mathematical symbols and found selectivity for musical notation for experts in a widespread multimodal network of areas. The activity in several of these areas was correlated with a behavioral measure of perceptual fluency with musical notation, suggesting that activity in nonvisual areas can predict individual differences in visual expertise. The visual selectivity for musical notation is distinct from that for faces, single Roman letters, and letter strings. Implications of the current findings to the study of visual perceptual expertise, music reading, and musical expertise are discussed. © 2009 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|Introduction: The anatomo-functional {{model of}} Dehaene and Cohen (1995) assumes a number {{processing}} network of different number representations. Most importantly, the inferior parietal lobule contains an abstract semantic magnitude representation. The model {{does not consider}} notation-, task- or strategy-specific differences. However, the SNARC effect can be observed for number words in a parity task {{but not in a}} phoneme detection task, while for Arabic numerals the effect occurs in both tasks. Fias et al. (1996) proposed a model considering this task- and notation-specificity: besides a central semantic route, they suggest an additional asemantic route for number words in a non-semantic task as the phoneme detection task. We investigated whether this notation- and task-specificity is reflected in the functional activation. Finally, we examined individual strategies in number processing. Kosslyn (1999) has claimed that the same task can be solved by different strategies resulting in different activation patterns (for number processing see also Burbaud et al., 1999). Methods: In a fMRI study we investigated 20 healthy volunteers in a phoneme detection and a parity task in five notations (positive and negative Arabic numerals, Roman numbers, number words, dot patterns). After the investigation subjects were asked about their individual solution strategy. Results: Notation-specificity: Less familiar <b>notations</b> (<b>Roman</b> numbers, dot patterns) produced stronger activation than familiar notations (Arabic numbers, number words), especially in superior parietal and frontal areas. Symbolic notations produced more activation in the occipito-temporal junction, involved in object recognition. Number words were the only notation producing activation maxima in Broca’s area in both tasks. Task-specificity: Activation in verbal as well as in number specific areas was stronger for the phoneme task. In contrast, the occipito-temporal junction was more activated in the parity task. Strategy-specificity: Participants reporting a verbal strategy produced more frontal and parietal activation, whereas subjects using a visual strategy had more occipital and temporal activation along the ventral pathway. Conclusion: Functional activation in number processing is modulated by notation, task and individual strategy. The model of Dehaene and Cohen is generally supported with respect to the postulated cortical network. However, notation-, task- and strategy-specific modulations are not considered. The model of Fias et al. is confirmed in its assumption of notation- and task-specific processing. However, the inferior parietal activation for number words in the phoneme detection task is not consistent with the model assumptions. Finally, individual strategies may lead to different activation patterns even in simple tasks questioning the conclusiveness of functional imaging studies...|$|R
