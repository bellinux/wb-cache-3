500|$|Varieties {{producing}} green fruit, less strongly flavoured and {{sweeter than}} typical blackcurrants, are cultivated in Finland, {{where they are}} called [...] "greencurrants" [...] (viherherukka). In Poland, the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance, fruit quality, adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting. Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry (Ribes grossularia), the <b>red</b> <b>currant</b> (Ribes rubrum) and the flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum). The resulting offspring were further back-crossed to R. nigrum. Cultivars produced include 'Tisel' and 'Tiben' in 2000 and 'Ores', 'Ruben' and 'Tines' in 2005. Further cultivars 'Polares' and 'Tihope' are being tested. Since 1991, New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development, as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop. Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield, large fruit size, consistency of cropping and upright habit.|$|E

40|$|Red {{currants}} (Ribes rubrum L.), black currants (Ribes nigrum L.), red {{and green}} gooseberries (Ribes uva-crispa) were evaluated for the total phenolics, antioxidant capacity based on 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay and functionality such as in vitro inhibition of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) relevant for potential management of hyperglycemia and hypertension. The total phenolics content ranged from 3. 2 (green gooseberries) to 13. 5 (black currants) mg/g fruit fresh weight. No correlation was found between total phenolics and antioxidant activity. The major phenolic compounds were quercetin derivatives (black currants and green gooseberries) and chlorogenic acid (<b>red</b> <b>currants</b> and <b>red</b> gooseberries). Red <b>currants</b> had the highest alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase and ACE inhibitory activities.

40|$|Abstract: Considering {{the great}} {{abundance}} of mites {{in almost all}} habitats and their minute dimensions, acarophagy must be common and even humans eat lots of mites. The presence of mites was investigated in 90 food samples, representing 24 sorts of fruits, vegetables and mushrooms. Acarological analyses of the products detected the presence of 53 mite species of the orders Oribatida, Actinedida, Tarsonemida, Acaridida and Gamasida. Mainly the saprophagous soil-inhabiting oribatid mites, but also actinedid and tarsonemid mites, were frequently found in the analysed material. The highest number of mites was collected from fruits with uneven surface, covered with numerous hairs, e. g. raspberries, strawberries and <b>red</b> <b>currants.</b> About 50 % of mites still remained on vegetables and fruits after cleaning them in running water...|$|R
