5|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, various <b>references</b> <b>are</b> made to Ragnarök. Ragnarök {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 26, where the throned figure of High, {{king of the}} hall, tells Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) some basic information about the goddess Iðunn, including that her apples will keep the gods young until Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|More subtle Jewish <b>references</b> <b>are</b> also {{included}} in {{other aspects of the}} Rugrats franchise. In The Rugrats Movie, the 1998 film based on the series, Tommy is prepared to pour banana baby food on his infant brother Dil, which would attract a group of vicious monkeys who would likely harm the young baby; the scene parallels the Sacrifice of Isaac, a primal covenant in Jewish studies.|$|E
5|$|My {{conclusion}} is, accordingly, {{that there}} is no evidence whatever for the much-quoted salute of the gladiators. The only two ancient references, those in Suetonius and in Dio, refer not to gladiators but to naumachiarii, men condemned to die, and even these <b>references</b> <b>are</b> to one specific episode, the circumstances of which indicate that the supposed salute was not even a regular salute of the naumachiarii.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{reference}} counts require frequent updates.

5|$|Although Shankar {{initially}} {{claimed that}} Enthiran {{would be made}} for all audiences, including those lacking computer literacy, the film is influenced by and makes references to many scientific principles relating to the fields of engineering, computer science and robotics, including terabytes and Asimov's laws of robotics. Visual <b>references</b> <b>are</b> made to the science books A Briefer History of Time (2005) and Freakonomics (2005). In his book Visual Perception and Cultural Memory: Typecast and Typecast(e)ing in Malayalam Cinema, Sujith Kumar Parayil notes the similarities between Kalabhavan Mani's role in the film to the one Mani played in the Malayalam film Sallapam (1996).|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} rest of the Halloween specials, the episode is {{considered}} non-canon and falls outside of the show's regular continuity. The episode makes cultural references to television series such as The Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, and Peanuts. <b>References</b> <b>are</b> also made to films such as Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Lost Boys. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 14.5, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993 movie, The Remains of the Day, {{starring}} Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and Christopher Reeve, <b>references</b> <b>are</b> made to Clevedon, {{where the}} final scene {{of the film is}} set and was filmed. The 1998 adaptation of Cider with Rosie also featured scenes filmed in the town. Scenes from the 2010 film, Never Let Me Go, starring Keira Knightley were filmed in Clevedon during the summer of 2009. Clevedon has its own comic book superhero, Captain Clevedon.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions {{found on}} caves and pottery are another source for {{studying}} the history of Tamilakam.

Coins issued by the Tamil kings of this age have been recovered from river beds and urban centers of their kingdoms. Most of the coins carry the emblem of the corresponding dynasty on their reverse, such as the bow and arrow of the Cheras; some of them contain portraits and written legends helping numismatists assign them to a certain period.|$|E

5|$|The {{final scene}} at Globex {{contains}} several references to action and James Bond films. The episode title and many <b>references</b> <b>are</b> from the Bond film You Only Live Twice, {{as well as}} an allusion to A View to a Kill. A character modeled after Sean Connery's Bond is tackled by Homer and killed after a parody of the laser scene from Goldfinger. Miss Goodthighs from the 1967 James Bond parody Casino Royale makes an appearance in the episode and can be seen attacking a character modeled after U.S. Army general Norman Schwarzkopf.|$|E
5|$|When {{translated}} into English for a publication by Methuen in 1963, {{a number of}} Francophone place-names were changed; for instance, the port of Saint-Nazaire was renamed Westermouth, which, according to author Michael Farr, was probably inspired by the real English coastal town of Weymouth. As the English-language translation was published after the English translation of other Tintin adventures, which had actually been authored later than The Seven Crystal Balls, in the English version, <b>references</b> <b>are</b> made to events that would occur in The Calculus Affair and The Red Sea Sharks.|$|E
5|$|Five {{references}} in Eusebius' Historia Ecclesiastica speak to Philip's Christianity; three directly, two by implication. At 6.34, he describes Philip visiting a church on Easter Eve and being denied entry by the presiding bishop {{because he had}} not yet confessed his sins. The bishop goes unnamed. At 6.36.3, he writes of letters from the Christian theologian Origen to Philip and to Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa. At 6.39, Eusebius writes that Decius persecuted Christians because he hated Philip. The remaining two <b>references</b> <b>are</b> quotations or paraphrases of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, a contemporary of Philip (he held the patriarchate from 247 to 265). At 6.41.9, Dionysius contrasts the tolerant Philip's rule with the intolerant Decius'. At 7.10.3, Dionysius implies that Alexander Severus (emperor from 222 to 235) and Philip were both openly Christian.|$|E

5|$|Lakkanna Dandesa, the king's prime {{minister}} and provincial governor, wrote an encyclopaedia on the beliefs and rites of the Veerashaiva faith titled Sivatattva Chintamani. This work is {{an account of the}} life of Basavanna, the progenitor of the faith, and hundreds of his followers, making it valuable material for students of the Lingayat movement. Numerous <b>references</b> <b>are</b> made in this work to the capital city of Vijayanagara and its suburbs. Jakkanarya, a minister in the court, not only wrote Nurondusthala (one hundred and one stories) but also was patron to Kumarabanka Natha and Mahalinga Deva, poet-saints who wrote vachana poems and books on the Shaiva philosophy (called shatsthala). Other writers of the 15th century worthy of mention are Kavi Linga (1490), court poet of King Saluva NarasimhaI, Adrisappa (Praudaraya Charitra), Bommarasa (Soundara Purana), Kallarasa (Janavasya), Chaturmukha Bommarasa (Revanasiddhesvara Purana), Suranga Kavi (Trisashti Puratanara Charitre), and Nilakanthacharya (Aradhya Charitra), court poet of the Ummattur chieftain Virananjendra.|$|E
5|$|Pall Mall was {{constructed}} in 1661, replacing an earlier highway slightly to the south that ran from the Haymarket (approximately where Warwick House Street is now) to the royal residence, St James's Palace. Historical research suggests a road had been in this location since Saxon times, although the earliest documentary <b>references</b> <b>are</b> from the 12th century {{in connection with a}} leper colony at St James's Hospital. When St. James's Park was laid out by order of Henry VIII in the 16th century, the park's boundary wall was built along {{the south side of the}} road. In 1620, the Privy Council ordered the High Sheriff of Middlesex to clear a number of temporary buildings next to the wall that were of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in Vagrant Story. However, several <b>references</b> <b>are</b> made; the Kingdom of Valendia, {{the setting for}} Vagrant Story, shares its name with a {{continent}} of Ivalice appearing in Final Fantasy XII. The Kiltia religion, featured in Final Fantasy XII, was {{the religion of the}} ghost town Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Arazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics), is used {{at the beginning of the}} game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story. This would seem to place Vagrant Story latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics. Matsuno has said that he never intended Vagrant Story to be in the same world as Tactics and Final Fantasy XII, though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree.|$|E

40|$|A voltage <b>reference</b> <b>is</b> an {{essential}} building block of many analog and digital circuits. The {{performance of a}} <b>reference</b> <b>is</b> gauged by the maximum variation in its allowable operating conditions. One {{of the most important}} speci¯cations of a <b>reference</b> <b>is</b> its temperature drift. Therefore, special attention should be paid by the designer to the thermal behavior of a voltage reference. In this thesis, three new voltage <b>reference</b> circuits <b>are</b> proposed and designed in 0. 18 -m technology. Our goal has been to design CMOS voltage references with better temperature stability compared to that of existing voltage references. First, a voltage <b>reference</b> <b>is</b> presented which takes advantage of summing the gate-source voltages of two diode-connected transistors biased by temperature-stable currents. The temperature coe±cient of the output voltage of this <b>reference</b> <b>is</b> shown to be 28 ppm/±C over the temperature range of- 50 ±C to 150 ±C. Next, the temperature behavior of the gate-source voltage of a CMOS transistor biased by a current, which is proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT), is investigated. It is shown that th...|$|R
