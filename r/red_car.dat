5|$|Yummy Yummy (1994) was the {{original}} line-up's earliest album to be certified by ARIA, accredited as double platinum in 2008. The album was also certified as gold in the US in 2004. Their next three releases, Big <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> (1995), Wake Up Jeff! (1996) and Wiggly, Wiggly Christmas (1996) had also all received double platinum certifications by 2008. Their eighth studio album, The Wiggles Movie Soundtrack (1997), which doubled as the soundtrack for the group's self-titled feature film, {{was the first to}} enter the ARIA Albums Chart, peaking at number 36 in November 1997. It was certified as platinum in 2008 along with Toot! Toot! (1998). An additional eight of the quartet's albums have been accredited as gold.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a <b>red</b> <b>car</b> into the street, Brody swinging from a rope in a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E

Stanlistening to the action from her houseleaves the place by car, following which she and her boyfriend are presented sitting {{at opposite ends of}} a bed. The singer is eventually left by the male alone in the room, with him being shown entering a supermarket while Stan lays on the ground near a piano. Later, he gets back to her house again, but Stan closes the door in his face. Subsequently, she is portrayed traveling with a <b>red</b> <b>car</b> previously shown in the beginning, arriving at an old vehicle and holding a bird on her arm. Over the rest of the music video, the singer is shown meeting her love interest face to face two more times, including a performance of the song to a bar's crowd in which he is featured, sporting a white dress and head accessory. Her suitor ends struggling with alcohol issues. Scenes interspersed through the main video present the singer laying over the abandoned vehicle, and playing the piano in her room.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a common}} belief in the United States that <b>red</b> <b>cars</b> are stopped for {{speeding}} more often than other color cars. However, there is no statistical evidence that this is true. Many police departments have denied it, saying their officers stop drivers for their behavior, not {{the color of their}} cars. The one survey that was made on this subject in 1990 by a St. Petersburg, Florida newspaper showed that the number of speeding tickets given to drivers of <b>red</b> <b>cars</b> was about the same as the proportion of <b>red</b> <b>cars</b> on the road in the community.|$|R

25|$|Huntington's {{involvement}} with urban rail was intimately tied to his {{real estate development}} operations. Real estate development was so lucrative for Huntington and SP that they could use the <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> as a loss leader. However, by 1920, {{when most of the}} company's holdings had been developed, their major income source began to deplete. Many rural passenger lines were unprofitable, with losses offset by revenue generated from passenger lines in populated corridors and from freight operations. The least-used <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> lines were converted to cheaper bus routes as early as 1925.|$|E
25|$|The Waterfront <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> in the San Pedro {{section of}} Los Angeles, California, was a {{heritage}} line that operated from 2003 until closure in 2015 {{due to the}} realignment of Sampson Way leading into Ports O’ Call Village. Restoring trackage was deemed cost prohibitive.|$|E

50|$|Here the {{argument}} {{is based on the}} fact that <b>red</b> <b>cars</b> are not green cars and as such § 123 of the X-Law cannot be applied to them. This requires the law to be interpreted to determine which solution would have been desired if the lawmaker had considered <b>red</b> <b>cars.</b> In this case it's probably safe to assume that they only wanted to regulate green cars and not regulate cars of other colors.|$|R

25|$|On May 26, 1942, the California State Railroad Commission {{proposed}} {{an extension of}} the Burbank Line to the Lockheed plant. The proposal called for a double track line from Arden Junction along Glenoaks to San Fernando Blvd and Empire Way, just northeast of Lockheed's main facility. But this extension never materialized and the commission moved on to other projects in the San Fernando Valley. The <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> line in Burbank was abandoned and the tracks removed in 1956.|$|E
25|$|Warhol {{produced}} both comic {{and serious}} works; his subject {{could be a}} soup can or an electric chair. Warhol used the same techniques—silkscreens, reproduced serially, and often painted with bright colors—whether he painted celebrities, everyday objects, or images of suicide, car crashes, and disasters, as in the 1962–63 Death and Disaster series. The Death and Disaster paintings included <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> Crash, Purple Jumping Man, and Orange Disaster. One of these paintings, the diptych Silver Car Crash, became the highest priced work of his when it sold at Sotheby's Contemporary Art Auction on Wednesday, November 13, 2013, for $105.4 million.|$|E

25|$|In 1900, the Echo Mountain House burned down. It was grossly underinsured and {{was never}} rebuilt. Later the {{astronomer}} Dr. Swift went blind {{and was forced to}} leave his post at the observatory. A second astronomer was hired to oversee the observatory, Prof. Edgar Lucien Larkin (1847–1925). Though he was not as prominent as Prof. Swift, he did stay with the Mount Lowe Observatory until his sudden death in 1925. Disenchanted, Peyton sold the railway to Henry E. Huntington, after which it became part of the Pacific Electric Railway (PE), of the famed Los Angeles <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> system.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s {{profits were}} {{good and the}} lines were {{extended}} to the Pasadena area, to the beaches at Santa Monica, Del Rey, Manhattan/Redondo/Hermosa Beach, Long Beach in Los Angeles County and to Newport Beach and Huntington Beach in Orange County. Extra service beyond the normal schedules was provided on weekends, particularly {{in the late afternoon}} when passengers wanted to return simultaneously. Comedian Harold Lloyd highlighted the popularity and utility of the system in an extended sequence in his 1924 film Girl Shy, where, after finding one <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> too crowded, he commandeered another and drove at high speed through the streets of Culver City and Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|Passenger rail in California {{during the}} early 20th Century was {{dominated}} by private companies. The San Diego Electric Railway, founded by John D. Spreckels in 1892, was the major transit system in the San Diego area during that period. In the Los Angeles area, real estate tycoon Henry Huntington established both the Los Angeles Railway, {{also known as the}} Yellow Car system, and the Pacific Electric, also known as the <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> system, in 1901. Business magnate Francis Marion Smith then created the Key System in 1903 to connect San Francisco with the East Bay. All four streetcar systems, and other similar rail networks across the state, declined in the 1940s with the rise of California's car culture and freeway network. They were then all eventually taken over to some degree, and dismantled, in favor of bus service by National City Lines, a controversial national front company owned by General Motors and other companies in {{what became known as the}} General Motors streetcar conspiracy.|$|E

For inspiration, the two writers studied {{the work of}} Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation, especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons. The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by Chinatown. Price and Seaman said that [...] "the <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> plot, suburb expansion, urban and political corruption really did happen," [...] Price stated. [...] "In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought them out of business. Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the <b>Red</b> <b>Car</b> used to be." [...] In Wolf's novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit?, the Toons were comic strip characters rather than movie stars.|$|E

Subsequently, she is portrayed cutting lemons and making lemonade, following which she makes a phone call and walks down the street sporting a lemon-printed yellow dress and smiling into the camera. Next, Stan is seen singing {{in front of a}} <b>red</b> <b>car,</b> flirting with a man, which is followed by the appearance of two police men. They enter a store and the singer is presented selling lemons in the street. Afterwards, the video switches from color to sepia, as she is present at a block party; it closes with Stan posing in front of a backdrop designed with different types of shoes.|$|E
