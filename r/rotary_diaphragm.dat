40|$|This paper {{explores the}} layout of an optimum process for {{supplying}} heat to Russian municipal heating systems operating in a market environment. We analyze and compare the standard cogeneration unit design with two-stage reheating of service water coming from controlled extraction locations and layouts that employ three in-line reheaters with heat the supply controlled by a <b>rotary</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and qualitative/quantitative methods (so-called “uncontrolled extraction”). Cogeneration unit designs are benchmarked {{in terms of their}} thermal efficiency expressed as a fuel consumption rate. The specific fuel consumption rate on electricity production is viewed as a key parameter of thermal efficiency...|$|E

This standardised calculation compensates {{the quantity of}} volume as measured to quantity of volume at a set of base conditions. The AGA 7 calculation itself is a simple ratio and is, in essence, a density correction approach to translating the volume or rate of gas at flowing conditions to a volume or rate at base conditions.|$|R

Topics {{discussed}} include rationale for use of hand pumps, history of hand pumps, description of various types of hand pumps (including reciprocating, <b>diaphragm,</b> <b>rotary,</b> helical rotary, bucket, chain, windlass, and various traditional low lift, slowmoving water lifting devices used since ancient times). The principles of operation; nomenclature; hydraulic, struct:lral, and energy analysis; and the design of each component of reciprocating hand pumps are described with examples. Also administration of hand pump programmes with emphasis on installation and maintenance practices. Recent handpump research and indigenous pumps manufactured with plastic, steel, wood, and bamboo components. A final chapter described manufacture of pumps in foundries, machine shops, and using intermediate technology. Key words: Hand pumps, rural water supply, developing countries, reciprocating pumps, appropriate technology, hand pump design, hand pump maintenance, hand pump manufacture, hand pump research and development...|$|R
40|$|Deregulation {{and open}} access {{in the natural}} gas {{pipeline}} industry has changed the gas business environment towards greater reliance on local energy flow rate measurement. What was once a large, stable, and well-defined source of natural gas is now a composite from many small suppliers with greatly varying gas compositions. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to energy flow measurement [using a gas chromatograph (GC) for composition assay {{in conjunction with a}} flow meter] is only cost effective for large capacity supplies (typically greater than 1 to 30 million scfd). A less costly approach will encourage more widespread use of energy measurement technology. In turn, the US will benefit from tighter gas inventory control, more efficient pipeline and industrial plant operations, and ultimately lower costs to the consumer. An assessment of the state and direction of technology for natural gas energy flow rate measurement is presented. The alternative technologies were ranked according to their potential to dramatically reduce capital and operating and maintenance (O and M) costs, while improving reliability and accuracy. The top-ranked technologies take an unconventional inference approach to the energy measurement problem. Because of that approach, they will not satisfy the fundamental need for composition assay, but have great potential to reduce industry reliance on the GC. Technological feasibility of the inference approach was demonstrated through the successful development of data correlations that relate energy measurement properties (molecular weight, mass-based heating value, standard density, molar ideal gross heating value, standard volumetric heating value, density, and volume-based heating value) to three inferential properties: standard sound speed, carbon dioxide concentration, and nitrogen concentration (temperature and pressure are also required for the last two). The key advantage of this approach is that inexpensive on-line sensors may be used to measure the inferential variables, which can then be applied (through the data correlations) to convert existing flow meters (ultrasonic, orifice, turbine, <b>rotary,</b> Coriolis, <b>diaphragm,</b> etc.) for on-line energy measurement. The practical issues for field development were evaluated using two transducers extracted from a $ 100 ultrasonic domestic gas meter, and a $ 400 infrared sensor...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands placed on extravehicular activity (EVA) for the International Space Station (ISS) assembly and maintenance, along with planned lunar and Martian missions, {{the need for}} increased human productivity and capability becomes ever more critical. This is most readily achieved by reduction in space suit weight and volume, and increased hardware reliability, durability, and operating lifetime. Considerable {{progress has been made}} with each successive generation of space suit design; from the Apollo A 7 L suit, to the current Shuttle Extravehicular Mobile Unit (EMU) suit, and the next generation Constellation Space Suit Element (CSSE). However, one area of space suit design which has continued to lag is the fluid pump used to drive the water cooling loop of the Primary Life Support System (PLSS). The two main types of fluid pumps typically used in space applications are rotodynamic pumps (pumping is achieved through a rotary vaned impeller) and displacement pumps (which includes <b>rotary</b> and <b>diaphragm</b> pumps). The rotating and moving parts found in the pumps and electric motor add significantly to the susceptibility to wear and friction, thermal mismatch, and complexity of the pumps. Electric motor-driven pumps capable of achieving high operational reliability are necessarily large, heavy, and energy inefficient. This report describes a development effort conducted for NASA by Lynntech, Inc., who recently demonstrated the feasibility of an electrochemically-driven fluid cooling pump. With no electric motor and minimal lightweight components, an electrochemically-driven pump is expected to be significantly smaller, lighter and achieve a longer life time than conventional rotodynamic and displacement pumps. By employing sulfonated polystyrene-based proton exchange membranes, rather than conventional Nafion membranes, a significant reduction in the actuator power consumption was demonstrated. It was also demonstrated that these membranes possess the necessary mechanical strength, durability, and temperature range for long life space operation. The preliminary design for a Phase II prototype pump compares very favorably to the fluid cooling pumps currently used in space suit portable life support systems (PLSS). Characteristics of the electrochemically-driven pump are described and the benefits of the technology as a replacement for electric motor pumps in mechanically pumped single-phase fluid loops (MPFLs) is discussed...|$|R
