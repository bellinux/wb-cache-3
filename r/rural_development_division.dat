40|$|At a consultation, {{which drew}} {{participants}} from several African {{countries as well}} as from international and regional development agencies, it was agreed that a network, to be called the Network for Agricultural Mechanization in Africa (NAMA), should be established. The meeting: at which this decision was taken had been convened by the Food Production and <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> <b>Division</b> of the Commonwealth Secretariat. Given its important role in the production of both food and cash crops in Africa, the meeting noted that mechanization is generally not given adequate importance by, among others, politicians, government officials and managers of agricultural research systems. Moreover, in many countries a rather negative image of mechanization has been created as a result of past experience where ill-conceived tractorization and animal traction projects have either not produced the desired results or have completely failed. The role agriculture in Africa must therefore be promoted more vigorously and presented more positively and objectively. It is unlikely that any of the African countries would alone be able to establish and sustain the range of institutions necessary for tackling all the problems in this area. A networking approach will enable the African countries and participating institutions to pool their resources and exchange their experiences in order to tackle agricultural mechanization problems. The first issue of the NAMA newsletter has been published and articles are invited for future issues.

40|$|By 1992 50 {{countries}} {{had chosen to}} join the Commonwealth, an association of independent sovereign states, which have pledged to cooperate {{in the service of}} human development, international understanding and peace in the modern world. The Commonwealth Secretariat is the headquarters of this organization and is based in London. The Food Production and -Rural Development Division (FPRD) of the Commonwealth Secretariat was established in response to mounting concern over the global food supply. Funding is provided by the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation (CFTC). A key element of the Division's role is keeping abreast with progress in the management and development of agriculture, fisheries, forestry and environment protection. Having in-house expertise in these fields enables the Division to respond to requests from member countries. The Division fosters economic development through agricultural sector growth in two main ways. The first is to provide investment and project assistance through short-term consultancy services and to increase the countries) absorptive capacity of aid and investment The second is to provide a package of measures to foster management improvement, through preparation of technical and management manuals and training modules to meet specific sector or country needs. Using in-house or contracted technical expertise, FPRD is well placed to develop and pilot-test training programmes in agricultural development and identify institution building needs, before handing over responsibility for longer-term implementation to more specialist training support divisions of the Secretariat. Livestock, fisheries, information technology, mechanization, soil and water conservation' rangeland degradation and tropical forestry have already received FPRD's attention, and there is demand from member countries for extension to new areas. Typical programmes at present being undertaken include the preparation of a series of procedure manuals about food management systems to improve food security. Status reports on rural poverty alleviation programmes in a number of Commonwealth countries, including Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia have already been published. Training manuals and other course materials have been produced or are at present being prepared in aquaculture extension work, livestock management training in the Caribbean and soil and water conservation.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of territoriality {{in the current}} discussion on rural development is not fortuitous. It {{is the product of}} economic and social changes within countries and in the wider political context of globalization. It responds to the need to adapt methodologies, instruments and activities to the new requirements imposed by these changes and their undesired impacts. Finally, it promotes a different image of territorial issues and directly involves rural populations in the design of new development perspectives. Actors define the territories they live in or interact with. The actors ’ territoriality, or territorial vision, helps to establish a common identity and supports the realization of actors ’ strategies and projects. In addition, a plurality of actors with different and sometimes conflicting interests and values influence the dynamics and interrelationships within the same space.

During the first few years, it was a success. Then there was a fall in the area sown, whereas we had expected the area to increase. We started to enquire as to the reasons for this decline. It was not easy to get a proper answer but, when pressed hard, the farmers told us that eating soya leads to impotence, and that was why {{they did not want to}} grow it any more. We asked them how they knew this, or to tell us where they had heard that soya makes a man impotent. They replied by telling us that each time they ate soya, they were no longer the virile man they used to be. We told them some other reasons as to why they were less virile, but they remained unconvinced. They are sticking to their position and, as a result, on top of it all, they are standing in the way of soya being cultivated more widely.

40|$|Now, {{a part of}} the UN {{system has}} opened up a sort of front-desk to the various parts of the UN {{involved}} in agriculture and rural development. The UN System Network on Rural Development and Food Security (RDFS) is based in the FAO and managed from the Rome headquarters. The network comprises 20 UN organisations, bringing together the key actors to achieve their shared goals of "food for all" and rural poverty reduction. It calls itself an inter-agency mechanism for follow-up to the World Food Summit (WFS) of 1996 and the WFS-Five Years Later event of 2002, and it supports the International Land Coalition. Part {{of the role of the}} RDFS network is to coordinate efforts by governments and UN agencies, but it is most useful for its explicit goal of reinforcing ties between UN system bodies and other stakeholders, notably NGOs and civil society organisations (CSOs). It does this at the international level, without any drift towards attempting to own its independent partners a welcome but rare hands-off attitude. And at national level, it promotes links between public and independent sector bodies through national thematic groups, of which there are 80, many in ACP countries. In practice, this means that any NGO or CSO in the field of rural development and food security, keen to develop links with parts of the UN system, can knock, by mail or electronic communication, on the door of the RDFS network and find the way. The RDFS Website is a gem. It has general articles and interviews on networking and agriculture, and then 16 thematic chapters, including agriculture, communication for development, gender, food and nutrition, governance, partnership, and HIV/AIDS. Each chapter highlights the major accessible programmes of UN agencies in the field, and links to other partners.

40|$|In {{this study}} a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plans (RDPs) in four intermediate rural regions (Northern Netherlands, Lower Saxony, Wales and Emilia Romagna) and four most urban regions (Southern Netherlands, North Rhine-Westphalia, Flanders and Lombardia) is made. Such plans are designed in {{the scope of the}} second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In particular, the focus was on the question whether the menu approach of the second pillar enables EU member states and regions to design <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plans with a tailor-made set of measures which address their specific <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> needs. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the current menu of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> measures is sufficient to suit the wide range of socio-economic, ecological and physical circumstances in the EU regions. The analysis also revealed that there is some overlap between the three <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> priorities of the second pillar. Therefore, an outline of future <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> priorities and measures in the EU is designed, in which it is attempted to avoid overlap between the various <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> priorities and in which each measure contributes to the achievement of one development priority only. In addition, it is proposed that regions would select only those measures in their <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plan which really address the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> needs in their region, even if this results in a <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plan with only one or two <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> measures.

40|$|With the {{socio-economic}} transformation, {{regional development}} factors recombination and followed industrial restructuring {{have changed the}} rural areas in eastern coastal China deeply. The interaction between the material and non-material elements affecting rural production and lifestyles shaped different <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types depending on a carrier, which is composed of different industries. Accordingly, this paper makes the definitions of four <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types, i. e., farming industry dominated <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (FIT), industry dominated <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (IDT), <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type focusing on business, tourism and services industries (BTT), and balanced <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (BDT), and classifies the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types in eastern coastal China. Then, taking the social representation approach and basing on the major factors affecting the long-term <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and the exertion of {{the functions of the}} countryside with regard to society, the assessment indicator system of rurality degree index (RDI) was established to distinguish the rurality degree of different types. The results indicated that. to some extent, the RDI may accurately reflect the status quo of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and the exertion of the functions of the countryside with regard to society, and can also reflect the different stage in what the same <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type in different region stays. The authors argue that the study on the interaction of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> factors in the process of economic and social transformation and the subsequent <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> model is very important to deeply understand the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and to smoothly achieve coordinated and balanced rural-urban development in developing countries, which are experiencing rapid industrialization and urbanization.
