5|$|Captain Glušica {{was given}} {{clearance}} to land, however, he suddenly aborted the attempted landing. The aircraft's throttle handle {{was found in}} the forward position, suggesting that the pilot had attempted to abort the landing and take off again. The co-pilot Ahluwalia had warned his commander three times to go around instead of landing; the first of these warnings had come 2.5 miles before the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold,</b> the port undercarriage leg clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
25|$|The {{plane was}} cleared for an {{approach}} on runway 18R (also {{known as the}} Polderbaan runway) but came down short of the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold,</b> sliding through the wet clay of a plowed field.|$|E

25|$|Boston's Hyatt Harborside Hotel, {{which sits}} {{only a few}} hundred yards from the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold,</b> was built {{primarily}} to prevent Massport from ever extending the length of 14/32 or using it for takeoffs or landings over the city. Massachusetts state legislators carefully chose the location of the hotel—directly in the runway centerline—prior to its construction in 1992.|$|E
25|$|When Flight 420 {{was near}} the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold,</b> the {{severely}} damaged left wing failed. The aircraft then rotated 90 degrees to the left: fuel spilled from the aircraft and ignited. The aircraft spiralled and crashed, coming {{to rest on the}} left side of Runway 24L. All 2 crew members and 9 passengers on board were killed. 2 passengers initially survived the crash, but ultimately died of their injuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{first officer}} landed the {{aircraft}} at {{what appeared to}} be the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold.</b> It then came in contact with the earth bank which ripped off all three undercarriage legs and the aircraft slid to a halt on its belly. The fire alarm for the port engine sounded, and the crew performed fire drills on both engines. One female passenger injured her leg. The wrecked aircraft was initially stored but was later declared as damaged beyond economic repair and was subsequently scrapped.|$|E

25|$|Before the crash, the {{aircraft}} {{was involved in}} two accidents. On 14 January 2002, {{the aircraft}} was flying from Frankfurt to Novosibirsk when {{it had to be}} diverted to Omsk due to poor weather at the destination. On approach, pilots reported fuel supply problems, followed by a flameout of both engines. The aircraft glided and landed successfully, but overran the runway and collided with the lights after the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold.</b> There were no injuries. The aircraft was repaired and continued service. From August 2006 the aircraft was leased to various Russian airlines – Red Wings Airlines, Aviastar-TU, Interavia Airlines and then Aviastar-TU again.|$|E
25|$|The USAir plane {{touched down}} near the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold.</b> Just as the nose was being lowered, the first officer noticed SkyWest 5569 on the runway and applied maximum braking, {{but it was too}} late. The USAir plane slammed into the Metroliner, {{crushing}} it beneath its fuselage. The 737 proceeded to skid down the runway, then veered off the left side and came to rest {{on the far side of}} the taxiway against a closed fire station building where it eventually caught fire. Large debris from the Metroliner – including its tail, wings, and right engine – were found on the runway and between the runway and the abandoned fire station.|$|E
25|$|The SkyWest {{aircraft}} was arriving at SFO after {{a flight from}} Modesto, California, and was cleared for a visual approach to runway 28R by NorCal approach control. After being switched over to the tower controller, SkyWest was cleared to land on runway 28R. At the same time, the Republic Airlines aircraft, bound for Los Angeles, California was instructed to taxi into position and hold for two minutes before takeoff clearance was also granted on the intersecting runway 1L. As the landing SkyWest aircraft passed the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold</b> the Republic Airlines {{aircraft was}} cleared for takeoff. Local procedures and FAA Order 7110.65 require the local controller {{to wait until the}} landing aircraft has passed through the intersection before clearing an aircraft for takeoff on one of the intersecting runways.|$|E

25|$|During {{the final}} flare to land, the plane {{rolled to the}} right, landed hard on its right main gear and the No. 3 engine touched the runway. The right wing {{separated}} from the fuselage. The aircraft continued to roll over and skidded off the runway in flames. When it stopped, it was on its back and {{the rear of the}} plane was on fire, coming to rest on a grass area next to the runway, 1,100 m from the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold.</b> The right wing was found on a taxiway 90 meters from the nose of the plane. As shown in photos of the aircraft at rest, the fire caused significant damage to the rear section of the aircraft but was quickly extinguished due to the heavy rain and quick response from rescue teams in the airport.|$|E
25|$|May 21, 1988: An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, {{registration}} number N136AA, operating as AA Flight 70 bound for Frankfurt, overran runway 35L after automatic warning signals prompted {{the flight crew}} to attempt a rejected takeoff; the jetliner continued to accelerate for several seconds before slowing, and did not stop until it had run 1,100 feet (335 m) past the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold,</b> collapsing the nose landing gear. 2 crew were seriously injured and the remaining 12 crew and 240 passengers escaped safely; the aircraft was severely damaged and was written off. Investigators attributed the overrun to a shortcoming in the design standards that were used when the DC-10 was built; {{there had been no}} requirement to test whether partially worn (as opposed to brand-new) brake pads were capable of stopping the aircraft during a rejected takeoff and 8 of the 10 worn pad sets on N136AA had failed.|$|E
25|$|On September 9, 2014 the National Transportation Safety Board {{announced}} that it had determined the probable cause of the accident was that the aircrew had continued an unstabilized approach into Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport during which they failed to monitor their altitude and thus inadvertently descended below the minimum descent altitude when the runway was not yet in sight resulting in a controlled flight into terrain approximately 3,300 feet short of the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold.</b> The NTSB also found that contributing factors in the accident were: 1) the flight crew’s failure to properly configure and verify the flight management computer for the profile approach; 2) the captain’s failure to communicate his intentions to the first officer once it became apparent the vertical profile was not captured; 3) the flight crew’s expectation that they would {{break out of the}} clouds at 1,000 feet above ground level due to incomplete weather information; 4) the first officer’s failure to make the required minimums callouts; 5) the captain’s performance deficiencies likely due to factors including, but not limited to, fatigue, distraction, or confusion, consistent with performance deficiencies exhibited during training, and; 6) the first officer’s fatigue due to acute sleep loss resulting from her ineffective off-duty time management.|$|E
50|$|The {{airport is}} located on 144 {{hectares}} land area. There is a single asphalt runway (05/23) which is 3000 m long and 45 m wide, but has only 2,900 m of usable length. There is no run-off space beyond the <b>runway</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and the airfield is surrounded by residential areas. It is often said that its location in a residential district, the wealthy Polonia area, {{is due to a}} superstition that the loud noises from aircraft drive away malevolent spirits.|$|R

2500|$|Mürted [...] Air Base [...] ( [...] , {{formerly}} Akıncı Air Base, Akıncı Hava Üssü) was an {{air base}} of the Turkish Air Force located northwest of Ankara, Turkey. During the July 2016 coup d'état attempt the air base was used by pro-coup soldiers, and government forces bombed <b>runway</b> <b>thresholds</b> to prevent pro-coup forces from landing or taking off. Following the failed coup, Akıncı Air Base was redesignated with its former name, Mürted, and it was suggested the facility be converted to a memorial or a park.|$|R
2500|$|However, this is {{contrary}} to the procedures in Islamabad for a visual approach. When a visual approach is executed, the plane automatically strings a final leg extending the runway centerline.

2500|$|Subsequent {{investigations}} {{concluded that}} the first impact was with trees, [...] from the <b>runway</b> <b>threshold,</b> at 21:38:08. Thereafter, the aircraft hit {{the ground with the}} wheels of main landing gear, [...] from the landing <b>runway</b> <b>threshold,</b> running on the ground a distance of , when the engines collided with the ground. With this impact, the wing fuel tanks ruptured, spilling fuel and causing the fire. The survivors left aircraft by the door behind the cockpit and through openings in the fuselage. Due to the impact, emergency exits could not be opened, and a large amount of smoke accumulated in the cabin. The pilot, who survived the accident, could not organize nor conduct the passengers evacuation.|$|E

50|$|In 1981 {{a second}} east-west runway, 26L/8R, was built, necessitating {{the removal of}} the old NE-SW runway 4/22. Remnants of the 4/22 runway are visible in the present-day taxiways. With the {{completion}} of the new runway, the existing runway 25/7 became 26R/8L. In 1985, the city of Los Angeles acquired Ontario International Airport outright from the city of Ontario. In 1987, Runway 26R/8L was extended to the east to bring the two <b>runway</b> <b>thresholds</b> side by side, so aircraft would be higher over neighborhoods. 26R/8L became the main departing runway and 26L/8R the main arrival runway.|$|R
