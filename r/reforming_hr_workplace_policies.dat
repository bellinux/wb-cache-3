The case {{can be used to}} explore the intricacies of developing a <b>HR</b> <b>workplace</b> violence <b>policy</b> and getting that policy adopted by upper administration. Students are asked to develop a written <b>workplace</b> violence prevention <b>policy.</b> Developing such a policy requires them to research the elements which should be included in such a policy, to develop a plan of action to implement the <b>workplace</b> violence <b>policy,</b> to identify the critical issues of risk/liability to the company’s officials, management’s responsibility and legal liability for maintaining a safe work environment, and how to get senior management to “buy off ” on the plan. The case has a difficulty level of three. The case can be presented and discussed in two to four class periods depending on the number of issues considered. Students can be expected to spend about 10 hours of outside preparation to be fully prepared to complete the case. CASE SYNOPSIS Digital Logistics Systems (DLS), as is true of many companies, never considered the possibility of workplace violence. However, a near fist fight in the Advertising / Promotions department brought the issue firmly to the attention of Tom Ross, the department manager. By chance, the incident was overheard by Sarah Davis, the HR manager. Ross and Davis meet over the issue, where it is agreed that Ross will handle the disciplinary action for the employees while Davis will develop a workplace violence prevention plan. Davis recognizes that not only will she need to develop the plan, and develop a program to implement it, perhaps her biggest task will be in convincing upper management of the necessity of adopting the plan...|$|R

The goal of this three-year, three study research project is to provide such evidence for the auto manufacturing and educational services sectors. The research questions being addressed are: What are the impacts for employers (economic) and workers (health) of caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) for full-time caregiver-employees? What are the impacts for employers, workers and society of the caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) in each participating workplace? What contextual factors impact the successful implementation of caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) ? Methods Using a pre-post-test comparative case study design, Study A will determine the effectiveness of newly implemented caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) across two workplaces to determine impacts on caregiver-employee health. A quasi-experimental pre-post design will allow the caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) to be tested with respect to potential impacts on health, and specifically on caregiver employee mental, psychosocial, and physical health. Framed within a comparative case study design, Study B will utilize cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis approaches to evaluate the economic impacts of the caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) {{for each of the}} two participating workplaces. Framed within a comparative case study design, Study C will undertake an implementation analysis of the caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) in each participating workplace in order to determine: the degree of support for the intervention(s) (reflected in the workplace culture); how sex and gender are implicated; co-workers’ responses to the chosen intervention(s), and; other nuances at play. It is hypothesized that the benefits of the caregiver-friendly <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> intervention(s) will include improvements in caregiver-employees’ mental, psychosocial and physical health, as well as evidence of cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness for the employer. Discussion The expected project results will provide the research evidence for extensive knowledge translation work, to be carried out in collaboration with our knowledge transition partners, to the employer/human resources and occupational health/safety target populations.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare HIV/AIDS <b>workplace</b> <b>policies</b> of insurance companies in Windhoek and determine their compliance with the 2001 ILO Code of Practice in the World of Work. The study used a quantitative approach and data was collected from two life insurance companies in Windhoek with HIV/AIDS <b>Workplace</b> <b>policies</b> in place during the period of the study. Findings of the study indicate that the majority of respondents from both companies are aware that management supported the policy development process. In regard to policy contents, both companies comply with the Code’s key principles and indicated that there is no discrimination of employees infected and affected by HIV/AIDS. However, some components such as involvement of people living with HIV/AIDS, education and awareness, monitoring and budget were not clearly evident. Thus recommendations were made on how such issues should be addressed...|$|R

40|$|Background. Continuing {{professional}} development {{is essential for}} professionals to remain competent, and for effective recruitment and retention. Purpose. This paper reports a qualitative study {{of the effects of}} <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> on continuing {{professional development}} on a small, dispersed profession in a resource-challenged province, using the case example of occupational therapy in Nova Scotia. Methods. The study used a multi-methods design, theoretically based on institutional ethnography. Methods were critical appraisal of the literature, interview and focus group data collection with 28 occupational therapists and 4 health services administrators, and a review of <b>workplace</b> <b>policy.</b> Results. The study identified a policy wall. Notable policies were those which defined who is responsible for continuing professional development, and which limited employee benefits and work flexibility options for those with family duties. It appears that a female-dominated profession, such as occupational therapy, may also face gender-based challenges. Practice Implications. Suggestions are offered for <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> makers, unions, provincial regulatory organizations, and health professionals. The findings are generally applicable to any small, dispersed health profession operating in resource-challenged conditions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]Source type: Electronic(1...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Nursing)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Globally, nurses' {{contribution}} to informed health policy decisions is limited, {{as there are}} many barriers to Nurse led change to successfully influence the HIV and AIDS policy process. In South Africa nurses {{at all levels of}} health care are not involved or consulted during the formulation of the HIV and AIDS <b>workplace</b> <b>policy.</b> This has led to concern about the absence of nurses at the policy table. This study forms part of a larger international study programme entitled: “Strengthening Nurses’ Capacity in HIV and AIDS Policy Development in Sub–Saharan Africa and the Caribbean”. This programme of international research aims to empower nurses to become involved in the policy process (formulation, implementation and evaluation) in order to strengthen health systems in the areas of HIV and AIDS care. Nurses' absence at the policy table prompted the researcher to explore and describe barriers to Nurse led change to influence HIV and AIDS <b>workplace</b> <b>policy.</b> Phase 1 of the research consisted of a literature review to identify barriers to Nurse led change to influence the HIV and AIDS <b>workplace</b> <b>policy.</b> Management's opinion about the human resource management capacity and problems experienced working in an HIV and AIDS environment was obtained through a quantitative and qualitative empirical method of data collection and analysis. Frontline nurses' perspective was obtained through qualitative interviewing to identify problems experienced with policy in an HIV and AIDS workplace environment. A mixedmethod triangulation research design was used to achieve the objectives of phase 1 of the study, and strategies applied included exploratory, descriptive and contextual designs. The analysis of the data contributed to the identification and classification of problems experienced by nurses to influence HIV and AIDS <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> at macro, meso and microlevel, resulting in the formulation of fifty–nine (59) concluding problem statements. These concluding statements formed the basis for the strategy development for Nurse led change to influence HIV and AIDS <b>workplace</b> <b>policy,</b> which was the only objective of {{the second phase of the}} research. The strategy for Nurse led change to influence HIV and AIDS <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> was developed by using a strategic process to determine the vision, mission, values, principles, assumptions, strategic objectives and functional tactics based on the concluding problem statements. Finally, the research was evaluated, limitations were identified and recommendations were formulated for practice, education, research and policy. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{its third}} decade, the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} continues to affect many people’s lives in affected nations. In {{the world of}} work, the epidemic has brought about loss of productivity, increased labour costs, and loss of employment due to stigma and discrimination. Many people in the affected countries {{have lost their jobs}} due to their HIV positive status. HIV-related effects like stigma and discrimination lead to its denial. HIV-related stigma and discrimination present barriers to HIV prevention and treatment in different settings including the workplace. HIV stigma affects both large and small enterprises. However, small enterprises are more affected by stigma than large enterprises. Less {{attention has been paid to}} small enterprises in the fight against HIV/AIDS and its related effects. In an effort to mitigate HIV stigma at the workplace, integrating effective HIV workplace programmes plays a big role. These programmes are enhanced by a clear and effective HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy.</b> However, many affected countries have not been successful in implementing these programmes due to unclear policies. Uganda is one of the African countries without a clear national HIV policy, an environment that may account for the lack of a clear national HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy.</b> Nevertheless, in Uganda a few large organisations have their individual HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policies.</b> There is no either published information that shows any small enterprise with a HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> in place or any research study about HIV- related stigma and small enterprises in Uganda. These are some of the factors behind this study’s rationale. This study sought to explore employers’ and employees’ knowledge and attitudes about HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> and its impact in reducing HIV-related stigma in small enterprises in Uganda. To obtain the expected data, the following main research question was asked: how can small-scale entrepreneurs and their employees overcome the challenge of HIV-related stigma and discrimination at the workplace according to their knowledge and attitudes about HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy?</b> The following sub research questions were also asked in an effort to obtain enriched and diversified data: - How can employees’ and employers’ knowledge and attitudes about HIV/AIDS help them in dealing with HIV-related issues at the workplace? - What is the effect of integrating HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> in the fight against HIVrelated stigma among small enterprises? - Which approaches do small-scale entrepreneurs and their employees use in managing HIV-related stigma and discrimination at the workplace? - What are the challenges faced by both employers and employees due to HIVrelated stigma and discrimination at the workplace? Methods: The study employed a qualitative study design utilising a collective case study approach. Data were collected using in-depth interviews and observation. The transcribed data were analysed by coding it into themes from which units of meaning were derived. Results: This study has confirmed the lack of HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> in the participating small enterprises. There were few cases of HIV/AIDS denial in the visited small enterprises. Employees in small enterprises have limited knowledge about HIV workplace programmes. Some small-scale entrepreneurs do not bother to find out health-related problems from their workers. The majority of HIV support organisations have not reached out to small enterprises. Counselling and guidance, cautioning stigma perpetrators and cooperation are some of the approaches to stigma confirmed by this study. Unexpectedly, findings of this study have indicated that employees in the visited work sites do not fear HIV testing and disclosing their HIV status at the workplace although their perceptions towards HIV testing and disclosure are theoretical. Conclusion: There is a need for effective HIV workplace programmes among small enterprises in an effort to mitigate HIV-related stigma. In this era of HIV/AIDS, enabling small enterprises to integrate a clear HIV <b>workplace</b> <b>policy</b> is one way of empowering small-scale entrepreneurs and their employees with skills and knowledge in the fight against HIV-related stigma at the workplace...|$|R

30|$|The work {{systems were}} regressed on {{information}} about pay systems and related practices on training and job tenure for 1995 – 2010 {{on which the}} EWCS provides information. The detail {{is available from the}} author. Regressions were done using the full set of EU− 15 countries to overcome sample size limitations. A multinomial logit regression was used, taking the Taylor system as benchmark. A separate logit regression was done for that system to facilitate interpretation of the results. The results are broadly consistent with economic and human resource theories of incentive pay. The need for cooperation and team-working in the Learning and Lean systems is reflected in the use of collective, company-based, incentive pay. The focus on individual output in Taylorist systems is reflected in the use of individual payment by results, but also in pay for specific inconveniences of the job, such as overtime, bad conditions and unsocial hours. Because of the nature of mlogit, the coefficients need to be read comparatively between work systems. Likewise with regard to investments in training and on-the-job learning (proxied by length of service), the Learning and Lean systems emerge as the predominant users. Turning to workplace size and occupation, whereas use of taylorism increases steadily with establishment size, {{this is not the case}} for the other systems, which increasingly diverge from taylorism as size increases. In terms of occupations, the Learning and Lean models are associated with managerial and technical work, whereas taylorism is associated with blue collar and junior white collar work. This correspondence between individual reports of work organisation with <b>workplace</b> <b>HR</b> <b>policies</b> suggests strongly that the four types can indeed be interpreted as work systems. The derivation of the work system models from the EWCS is explained in the Appendix. Detailed regressions are available from the author.|$|R
