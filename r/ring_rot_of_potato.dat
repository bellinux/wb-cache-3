40|$|Members of the {{actinomycete}} genus Clavibacter {{are known}} to produce antimicrobial compounds, but so far none of these compounds has been purified and characterized. We have isolated an antimicrobial peptide, michiganin A, from the tomato pathogen Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. michiganensis, using ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by cation-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography steps. Upon chemical derivatization of putative dehydrated amino acids and lanthionine bridges by alkaline ethanethiol, Edman degradation yielded sequence information {{that proved to be}} sufficient for cloning of the gene by a genome-walking strategy. The mature unmodified peptide consists of 21 amino acids, SSSGWLCTLTIECGTIICACR. All of the threonine residues undergo dehydration, and three of them interact with cysteines via thioether bonds to form methyllanthionine bridges. Michiganin A resembles actagardine, a type B lantibiotic with a known three-dimensional structure, produced by Actinoplanes liguriae, which is a filamentous actinomycete. The DNA sequence of the gene showed that the michiganin A precursor contains an unusual putative signal peptide with no similarity to well-known secretion signals and only very limited similarity to the (only two) available leader peptides of other type B lantibiotics. Michiganin A inhibits the growth of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus, the causal agent <b>of</b> <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potatoes,</b> with MICs in the low nanomolar range.

However, the possibility that the substance could be obtained from sources other than the bacterium had not been completely eliminated. In an attempt to answer this question, three extracts were purified and compared. First, compounds were isolated from a broth culture of bacteria in the manner described by Strobel (21). Second since the culture medium consisted of yeast extract, the possibility that similar types of compounds could be obtained from this medium was considered. Third, materials that possessed wilting activity were isolated from whole bacterial cells which had been subjected to sonic oscillation. Upon isolation of these three extracts, the physical properties and biological activity were compared to determine their degree of similarity.

40|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> disease <b>of</b> <b>potato,</b> {{caused by}} the Gram-positive bacterium, Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. {{sepedonicus}} (Cms), is under good regulatory control in Canada. With a zero tolerance for the disease in seed potato production, and a certification requirement for annual laboratory indexing of selected seed lots for the possible presence of asymptomatic latent infections, occurrences <b>of</b> bacterial <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> are infrequent and limited in scope. The laboratory indexing requirement {{is considered to be}} a particularly important component of the seed certification program for <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> control, because the disease, when first present, is, under Canadian production conditions, often not detected by field inspection of growing crops or by bin inspection of harvested tubers, and will be of increasing importance should changing climatic conditions impact negatively on symptom expression. In Canada, the primary test for laboratory indexing is the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a monoclonal antibody targeting the Cms extracellular polysaccharide, followed by a somatic antigen-directed monoclonal antibody-based immunofluorescence (IMF) confirmatory test for ELISA positive samples. A real-time (kinetic) PCR test (kPCR) using TaqMan chemistry, adapted from a published method and supplemented with an internal reaction control (RC) was implemented to evaluate the efficiency of the serological methods. The RC was constructed from a corn invertase gene fragment flanked by sequences complementary to the Cms primers, and was designed to generate an amplicon that differed from the Cms-specific amplicon but by its amplification would confirm the absence of PCR inhibitory substances in template DNA. The RC construct was cloned into plasmid vector pCRII-TOPO (to create plasmid, pCmsC 4) and propagated in Escherichia coli strain DHá-T 1. The RC amplicon did not hybridize to the Cms-specific TaqMan probe, but could be detected in kPCR runs with the inclusion of SYBR Green in the reaction mix. The Cmsspecific and the RC amplicons were readily distinguished by their respective postamplification melting temperatures in the presence of SYBR Green. The addition of 100 copies of pCmsC 4 to the reaction mix did not adversely affect sensitivity of Cms detection by kPCR. The presence of Cms in all ELISA/IMF-positive samples was confirmed by kPCR. However, in a 320 -sample data set, 50 % of ELISA-positive samples with cell counts below the IMF threshold were positive by kPCR, verifying the applicability of kPCR as a valuable additional confirmatory test. In the same data set, 16 % of samples that had both ELISA and IMF readings below the positive thresholds were positive by kPCR. While it was difficult to discount entirely the possibility of false positive kPCR tests resulting from crosscontamination during collection and processing of samples or PCR setup, the data confirms the greater sensitivity of kPCR for detecting asymptomatic (latent) infections <b>of</b> bacterial <b>ring</b> <b>rot.</b> vokMyynti MTT Tietopalvelut 31600 Jokioine...|$|R

All nineteen fractionations had antimicrobial activities against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum, while Fractionation three (Fr. 3) had the highest (P< 0. 05) antimicrobial activity.

Antimicrobial activity of Fr. 3 against C. michiganense subsp. sepedonicum could be attributed to its ability to damage the cell wall and cell membrane, induce the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration, inhibit the glycolytic pathway (EMP) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, inhibit protein and nucleic acid synthesis, and disrupt the normal cycle of DNA replication.

The highest (p< 0. 05) antibacterial activity was observed when pH was 5, excluding the effect of control. The extracts were stable under ultraviolet (UV). In vivo analysis revealed that 50 mg/mL of P. orientale leaf extracts was effective in controlling decay.

40|$|Testing of {{planting}} material for freedom from phytopathogenic bacteria is an important, although not exclusive, method {{for control of}} bacterial diseases of plants. Ideally, pathogen-free or pathogen-/disease-resistant planting material is desirable, but this situation is not always possible on a practical basis. For most bacterial pathogens, resistance is not available in cultivated hosts, and production of pathogen-free planting material requires strict certification schemes via several routes. These include (i) indexing, with subsequent removal of infected/contaminated material from the production chain; (ii) meristem and other tissue culture production systems; (iii) thermo- or chemotherapy; (iv) plant or seed surface disinfection for epiphytic bacterial pathogens; (v) avoidance or decontamination of contaminated production factors such as substrate, soil or irrigation water. These methods cannot guarantee 100 % freedom from the pathogen or disease during crop multiplication from certified planting material, because of factors such as sampling error, experimental error, test sensitivities, limitations of therapies (e. g. phytotoxicity or insufficient penetration), re-introduction of the pathogen, insufficient hygiene or decontamination during planting and multiplication of clean propagating material, and manipulations during trade and production. These factors are discussed with reference to several bacterial plant diseases, in particular control of bacterial brown rot and <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> in Europe and North America.

Recent discoveries related to pathogenesis of Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (Cms), causal agent of bacterial <b>ring</b> <b>rot</b> <b>of</b> <b>potato,</b> {{are beginning to}} shed light on the virulence strategies of this species. The chromosomal homologue of pat- 1, chp 7, was found to be necessary for HR elicitation in tobacco and virulence of Cms in eggplant and potato. Multiple chromosomal and plasmid-encoded homologues of pat- 1 (chp and php genes, respectively) are present in Cms, yet only the function of chp 7 has been evaluated. The development of molecular resources and techniques for genetic manipulation of Cms are needed to facilitate studies aimed at building a more comprehensive understanding of the role of pat- 1 homologues in pathogenesis. Knockout mutants chp 7 and php 3 of Cms were generated via targeted mutagenesis. The virulence of chp 7 and php 3 mutants of Cms were evaluated on eggplant and potato. Significant reductions in virulence of Cms were observed for chp 7 and php 3 mutants in both eggplant and potato. Mutation of chp 7 also resulted in the loss of non-hostHR induction and an observed reduction in bacterial titer of infected plants. These phenotypes however, were not observed in php 3 mutants of Cms. A mutant of chp 8 was identified in a newly generated EzTn 5 transposon library of Cms. The virulence of the chp 8 mutant of Cms was evaluated in eggplant. Significant reductions in both bacterial titer of infected plant tissue and virulence of Cms were observed for the chp 8 mutant. In summary, three pat- 1 homologues from Cms have now been evaluated for their relative contributions to virulence, and these studies indicate that each is likely contributing differently to pathogenesis of Cms. The formation of biofilms has been demonstrated in Cms both in vitro and in planta. Development of an appropriate assay for assessing biofilm formation by Cms is a necessary first step towards addressing the role of biofilms in bacterial ring rot. Two of the biofilm assays examined in this study could be considered as potential strategies for future assessment of biofilm formation by Cms. Currently, both of these assays are still diminished in their utility, given issues with inconsistencies and reproducibility...|$|E

The isolated bacteria were verified as Pectobacterium or Dickeya by PCR tests and analysis of 16 S 23 S rDNA intergenic sequences. All the strains isolated from river samples and 24 % of the strains from stems showing blackleg symptoms were identified as Dickeya, whereas only few Dickeya strains were isolated from diseased tubers. Phylogenetic trees based on the 16 S and 16 S 23 S intergenic sequences showed that three different Dickeya groups were present in rivers water, and two of the groups were isolated also from <b>potato</b> samples.
