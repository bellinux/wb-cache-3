5|$|Other {{scholars}} {{have identified the}} text's tone as satirical and mildly obscene, locating it among a movement of pamphlets influenced by a counter-trend promoting greater sympathy for prostitution. Linda Dowling interprets the pamphlet less a broadside against sodomites, and more as evidence of a strand in <b>rhetoric</b> <b>that</b> valorized Britain's martial past and saw {{lack of respect for}} it as a precondition for vice. Ian Bell considers the causality of this relationship between moral collapse and vice, characterizing the book as part of strand that saw vice as a product, not a cause, of a fundamental collapse in morality in Augustan London.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} <b>rhetoric</b> <b>that</b> Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as unsurpassed in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} Latin {{authors of the}} twelfth century, William is {{surprisingly}} favourable to the Byzantine Empire. He had visited the Byzantine court as an official ambassador and probably knew more about Byzantine affairs than any other Latin chronicler. He shared the poor opinion of Alexius I Comnenus that had developed during the First Crusade, although he was also critical {{of some of the}} crusaders' dealings with Alexius. He was more impressed by Alexius' son John II Comnenus; he did not approve of John's attempts to bring the crusader Principality of Antioch under Byzantine control, but John's military expeditions against the Muslim states, the common enemy of both Greeks and Latins, were considered admirable. Emperor Manuel, whom William met during his visits to Constantinople, was portrayed more ambivalently, much like King Amalric. William admired him personally, but recognized that the Empire was powerless to help Jerusalem against the Muslim forces of Nur ad-Din and Saladin. William was especially disappointed in the failure of the joint campaign against Egypt in 1169. The end of the Historia coincides with the massacre of the Latins in Constantinople and the chaos that followed the coup of Andronicus I Comnenus, and in his description of those events, William was certainly not immune to the extreme anti-Greek <b>rhetoric</b> <b>that</b> was often found in Western European sources.|$|E
40|$|This {{empirical}} {{case study}} of a business school internationalisation process investigates the relationship between rhetoric, ambiguity and strategic action in a garbage can context. Our data showed <b>that</b> <b>rhetoric</b> structured the garbage can and reduced the randomness of the strategy-making process in two ways. First, rhetoric enabled actors to distinguish between two uses of ambiguity - maximising ambiguity to avoid action, and minimising ambiguity to enact action. <b>Rhetorics</b> <b>that</b> maximised ambiguity were most frequent {{at the start of}} the strategy process; <b>rhetorics</b> <b>that</b> minimised ambiguity were most common later in the strategy process. Second, rhetoric provided structure by linking solutions, problems and participants to choice opportunities to enable action and by negating links between solutions, problems and participants and choice opportunities in order to enable inaction...|$|R

Eventually, public debates and discussions led to a broad rewriting of the Mudawana in 2003–4, which many attribute to the increase in activity and organization within Moroccan civil society in the 1990s as well as a changing international environment surrounding women's rights and gender equality. Beginning in the 1990s, women’s rights organizations in Morocco gained leverage and influence by incorporating progressive elements from academia, publishing, and government, and using <b>rhetoric</b> <b>that</b> drew from Islamic sources as well as the language of national development and the rights of women and children.|$|E

In , groups were set up and a campaign started to get women to help in agriculture and in , the Women's Land Army was set up. One goal was to attract middle-class women who would act as models for patriotic engagement in nontraditional duties. However the uniform of the Women's Land Army included male overalls and trousers, which sparked debate on the propriety of such cross-dressing. The government responded with <b>rhetoric</b> <b>that</b> explicitly feminized the new roles.

500|$|Supporters {{promoted}} Breckinridge for Speaker of the House, but {{he refused}} to allow his own nomination and voted with the majority to elect fellow Kentuckian Linn Boyd. Despite this, the two were factional enemies, and Boyd assigned Breckinridge to the lightly regarded Committee on Foreign Affairs. Breckinridge's first speech, and several subsequent ones, were made to defend William Butler, again a presidential aspirant in 1852, from charges leveled by proponents of the Young America movement that he was too old and had not made his stance on slavery clear. The attacks came from the pages of George Nicholas Sanders's Democratic Review, and on the House floor from several men, nearly all of whom supported Stephen Douglas for the nomination. These men included California's Edward C. Marshall, who was Breckinridge's cousin. Their attacks ultimately hurt Douglas's chances for the nomination and Breckinridge's defense of Butler enhanced his own reputation. After this controversy, he was more active in the chamber's debates but introduced few significant pieces of legislation. He defended the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 against attacks by Ohio Representative Joshua Giddings and opposed Andrew Johnson's proposed Homestead Act out of concern that it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Despite his campaign <b>rhetoric</b> <b>that</b> federal funds should only be used for internal improvements [...] "of a national character", he sought to increase Kentucky's federal allocation for construction and maintenance of rivers and harbors, and supported bills that benefited his district's hemp farmers.|$|E

[...] Jensen added that [...] "hope for improvement" [...] came {{with the introduction of}} Elektra, and that the sixth episode should be a template {{for the rest of the}} season, which ultimately, he felt was [...] "stiff and silly." [...] Daniel D'Addario for Time was also disappointed with the season, saying, [...] "it’s hard not to feel that one is being taken for a long, and not particularly enjoyable, ride... Daredevil just wants to dole out fun doses of extreme gore on the path to an endpoint on a business plan. Any viewer committed to story is left searching in the dark." [...] Vulture's Abraham Riesman joined the criticism, calling the seven episodes reviewed [...] "a dour parade of one cliché after another, recycling themes, images, and <b>rhetoric</b> <b>that</b> audiences have seen countless times before."

50|$|Burke defined rhetoric as the “use {{of words}} by human agents to form attitudes or to induce actions in other human agents.” His {{definition}} {{builds on the}} preexisting ideas of how people {{understand the meaning of}} rhetoric. Burke describes rhetoric as using words to move people or encourage action. Furthermore, he described rhetoric as being almost synonymous with persuasion (A Rhetoric of Motives, 1950). Burke argued <b>that</b> <b>rhetoric</b> works to bring about change in people. This change can be evident through attitude, motives or intentions as Burks stated {{but it can also be}} physical. Calling for help is an act of rhetoric. Rhetoric is symbolic action that calls people to physical action. Ultimately, rhetoric and persuasion become interchangeable words according to Burke. Other scholars have similar definitions of <b>rhetoric.</b> Aristotle argued <b>that</b> <b>rhetoric</b> was a tool for persuading people (but also for gaining information). He stated <b>that</b> <b>rhetoric</b> had the power to persuade people if the speaker knew how. One way in which Aristotle formed his arguments was through syllogism. Another example of how rhetoric was used to persuade was deliberate discourse. Here, politicians and lawyers used speech to pass or reject policies. Sally Gearhart states <b>that</b> <b>rhetoric</b> uses persuasion to induce change. Although she argues persuasion is violent and harmful, she uses it as a tool herself to bring about change.|$|R
50|$|The rhetorical {{situation}} is {{the context of}} a rhetorical event that consists of an issue, an audience, and a set of constraints.
