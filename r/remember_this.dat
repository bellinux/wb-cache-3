5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. <b>Remember</b> <b>this</b> is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E
5|$|The leader Uruk {{will have}} a range of {{strengths}} and weaknesses, the latter that can be exploited in combat to quickly weaken and defeat the leader. The player can gain knowledge of these through finding intelligence mostly by draining and interrogating marked Uruks for this. Being able to exploit such weaknesses in defeating the leader will gain a better quality rune and more experience points in this manner. Once the player gains the ability to brand Uruks, they can brand these leaders and convert portions of Sauron's army to their side. At this point, the player can use the Nemesis system to trigger infighting within the Uruk forces which they can then directly participate in, helping to weaken the army further. Uruks that survive their encounter with Talion will <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> when Talion combats them again; for example, an Uruk who was thrown into a fire by Talion might want revenge on him for being disfigured.|$|E
5|$|When Sorceress Edea {{becomes the}} Galbadian ambassador, Balamb and Galbadia Gardens order Squall's team to assassinate her; Irvine is {{introduced}} as the sniper for the mission. Moments before the assassination attempt, he explains to Squall {{that he always}} chokes under pressure. In spite of his nerves and under intense pressure, he fires an accurate shot, but Edea uses magic to stop the bullet. At Trabia Garden, Irvine reveals that he {{and most of the}} other party members had lived in the same orphanage, run by Cid and Edea Kramer. However, the others could not <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> because of their use of Guardian Forces (GF), magical beings who cause severe long-term memory loss as a side effect. Because Irvine had not used a GF until he joined the party, he is able to remember his past. During the game, Irvine gradually draws closer to Selphie, acting on the feeling he has had since living with her at the orphanage.|$|E

25|$|In Buddhism, honey {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the festival of Madhu Purnima, celebrated in India and Bangladesh. The day commemorates Buddha's making peace among his disciples by retreating into the wilderness. The legend has it that while he was there, a monkey brought him honey to eat. On Madhu Purnima, Buddhists <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> act by giving honey to monks. The monkey's gift is frequently depicted in Buddhist art.|$|E
25|$|The {{trouble with}} our genial humorist {{is that he}} is beyond his depth. He would not make a success if he turned statesman. He would not make much of a success if he turned missionary; as a humorist he is incomparable. Every man to his trade. Let Mark <b>remember</b> <b>this,</b> and let him choose as a target for his satire {{something}} other than the heroic men who have been through the nightmare of blood and ruin in China, while he has been comfortably basking in the sunlight that makes eternal summer for a genius admired of both old world and new.|$|E
25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas {{entitled}} Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant it all seems now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E

25|$|Often we {{encompass}} {{the record of}} an entire matter by one notation, a single image. For example, the prosecutor {{has said that the}} defendant killed a man by poison, has charged that the motive for the crime was an inheritance, and declared that there are many witnesses and accessories to this act. If in order to facilitate our defense we wish to <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> first point, we shall in our first background form an image of the whole matter. We shall picture the man in question as lying ill in bed, if we know his person. If we do not know him, we shall yet take some one to be our invalid, but not a man of the lowest class, so that he may come to mind at once. And we shall place the defendant at the bedside, holding in his right hand a cup, and in his left hand tablets, and on the fourth finger a ram's testicles (Latin testiculi suggests testes or witnesses). In this way we can record the man who was poisoned, the inheritance, and the witnesses.|$|E

500|$|This {{episode is}} one of Yeardley Smith's {{favorite}} episodes.

500|$|Marge gives Bart a box {{of items}} she kept during his stint as a celebrity to help him <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> time of his life. Lisa says that she is glad that [...] "Bart {{can go back to}} just being himself, instead of a {{one-dimensional}} character with a silly catchphrase." [...] The Simpson family— along with Barney, Mr. Burns, Ned, and Nelson— then recite their respective catchphrases, prompting an unamused Lisa to go to her room.|$|E
500|$|For every Opening Ceremony, each {{host country}} has a theme. [...] During the [...] "Parade of Nations", the host country’s goal is to {{represent}} their cultural identity and {{to show the world}} their place in society. [...] For example, in the 2008 Beijing Olympics the theme was “unity”. [...] On May 12, 2008, a devastating earthquake erupted in Sichuan. As the host country, China wanted to <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> tragic event by having Yao Ming, a Chinese basketball legend, walk hand-in-hand with Lin Hao, a nine-year-old boy who saved some of his classmates during the earthquake.|$|E

500|$|During this episode, it {{is implied}} that Isabella marries either Phineas or Ferb, {{though none of}} the {{characters}} <b>remember</b> <b>this.</b> It is also implied that Phineas wins at least one Nobel Prize as the future Linda says the future Phineas is [...] "in Switzerland for the Awards Ceremony." [...] Ferb is likely President of the United States as he is stated to be [...] "at Camp David", a resort specially made for Presidents since Eisenhower, although his British birth, and not being 35 years old yet, would ordinarily prevent this. [...] A more likely scenario would be that Ferb is married to Vanessa, and is at Camp David with his wife [...] President Vanessa Doofensmirtz as she would fit both the birth and age requirement.|$|E
500|$|As they {{continue}} to grow and mature, the girls have many disappointing encounters which leave them fearful of the loneliness that must await them in this foreign country where they struggle hopelessly to fit in and be understood. Even as a grown woman, returning to her Dominican roots, Yolanda finds she can never truly escape the fear that has hovered over her {{for as long as}} she can <b>remember.</b> <b>This</b> is evident in the very first chapter, [...] "Antojos", as Alvarez reveals the panic evoked in the adult Yolanda at the sudden realization that she is stranded in a guava field in the Dominican Republic, where women do not go about unchaperoned at night. Alvarez evokes Yolanda's fear as she reports that [...] "the rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings of her old aunts: you will get lost, you will get kidnapped, you will get raped, you will get killed".|$|E

[...] " [...] and added, [...] "And with the three words, [...] "You're my person." [...] Cristina Yang and Meredith Grey {{solidified}} their status as the small screen's best best friends ever." [...] Marama Whyte of Hypable wrote, [...] "Critically, the key relationship in Meredith’s life was not her romance with Derek Shepherd, but her passionate, indestructible, absolutely enviable friendship with Cristina. Talk about relationship goals; who wants McDreamy when Cristina Yang could be your person. These two were the real powerhouse, and Shonda Rhimes didn’t shy away from making the audience <b>remember</b> <b>this.</b> Derek was the love of her life, but Cristina was her soul mate. More than anyone else, Cristina challenged Meredith, was honest with her, and inspired her. For these reasons, it was Cristina who was constantly the source of Meredith’s character development, not Derek." ...|$|E

500|$|Andre Ethier, Russell Martin and Wilson Valdez {{managed to}} each earn three hits each during the Dodgers game. Ethier {{hit a home}} run which drove in the first four runs of the season for the Dodgers, who stole five bases — their most since August 23, 1999 when they stole seven in a game at Milwaukee. [...] "It's kind of cool to have a decent game on Jackie Robinson Day," [...] Martin said. [...] "I’m going to <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> {{probably}} {{for the rest of my}} life." [...] Randy Wolf, who was playing for the Dodgers at the time (currently a free agent) allowed six hits and three runs in six innings and struck out seven. [...] "The whole team wearing No. 42, it kind of goes sour if we don’t win," [...] Wolf said. [...] "It was great. There were a lot of special people here. It's a special day and I think they did it right." [...] The San Diego Padres' José Cruz, Jr. hit his 200th career home run.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. I passed the test." ...|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said it was [...] "an amazing episode, in which Homer {{actually}} has an argument with someone, rather than backing down. As he and his father drift further apart, so the family are at a loss at what to do. You can't help but feel sorry for Grampa as a piece of Simpson family history goes up in flames". Nate Meyers for Digitally Obsessed praised Dan Castellaneta's role in the episode and said: [...] "Dan Castellaneta's work as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in [...] is full of emotion and brilliant comic timing. Watch the closing scene carefully as Homer returns to his childhood home, because Castellaneta gracefully dances between a tender father-son relationship and flat-out comedy". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said he [...] "didn’t <b>remember</b> <b>this</b> as a very good episode, but it actually turns out to be quite strong. The initial plot in which Homer and Marge can’t get it together offers plenty of funny moments, and the scenes in which Homer battles with his dad offer depth and much humor. It’s also hard to beat the children's fears of the reverse vampires".|$|E
