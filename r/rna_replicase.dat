5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four {{different}} groups depending on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own <b>RNA</b> <b>replicase</b> enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E
25|$|In virology, {{the term}} {{may also be}} used when {{referring}} to mRNA synthesis from an RNA molecule (i.e., RNA replication). For instance, the genome of a negative-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA -) virus may be template for a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA +). This is because the positive-sense strand contains the information needed to translate the viral proteins for viral replication afterwards. This process is catalyzed by a viral <b>RNA</b> <b>replicase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within minutes, {{bacterial}} ribosomes start translating viral mRNA into protein. For RNA-based phages, <b>RNA</b> <b>replicase</b> is synthesized {{early in}} the process. Proteins modify the bacterial RNA polymerase so it preferentially transcribes viral mRNA. The host’s normal synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids is disrupted, and it is forced to manufacture viral products instead. These products go on {{to become part of}} new virions within the cell, helper proteins that help assemble the new virions, or proteins involved in cell lysis. Walter Fiers (University of Ghent, Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of bacteriophage MS2 (1976).|$|E
40|$|Despite {{years of}} study, {{it is still}} not clear how life emerged from inanimate matter and evolved into the complex forms that we observe today. One of the most {{recognized}} hypotheses for the origins of life, the RNA World hypothesis, assumes that life was sparked by prebiotic replicating RNA chains. In this paper, we address the problems caused by the interplay between hypothetical prebiotic <b>RNA</b> <b>replicases</b> and <b>RNA</b> parasitic species. We consider the coexistence of parasite <b>RNAs</b> and <b>RNA</b> <b>replicases</b> as well as the impact of parasites on the further evolution of replicases. For these purposes, we used multi-agent modeling techniques that allow for realistic assumptions regarding the movement and spatial interactions of modeled species. The general model used in this study is based on work by Takeuchi and Hogeweg. Our results confirm that the coexistence of parasite <b>RNAs</b> and <b>replicases</b> is possible in a spatially extended system, even if we take into consideration more realistic assumptions than Takeuchi and Hogeweg. However, we also showed that the presence of trade-off that takes into the account an RNA folding process could still pose a serious obstacle to the evolution of replication. We conclude that this might be a cause for one of the greatest transitions in life that took place early in evolution-the separation of the function between DNA templates and protein enzymes, with a central role for RNA species...|$|R
50|$|The {{isolation}} of enzymes from infected tissue {{can also provide}} {{the basis of a}} biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease. For example, humans can make neither <b>RNA</b> <b>replicases</b> nor reverse transcriptase, and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections. The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection, although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function.|$|R
50|$|Biochemical {{and genetic}} {{analyses}} {{showed that the}} enzyme systems that replicate viral RNA molecules (reverse transcriptases and <b>RNA</b> <b>replicases)</b> lack molecular proofreading (3' to 5' exonuclease) activity, and that RNA sequences do not benefit from extensive repair systems analogous to those that exist for maintaining and repairing DNA sequences. Consequently, RNA genomes appear {{to be subject to}} significantly higher mutation rates than DNA genomes. For example, mutations in HIV-1 that lead to the emergence of viral mutants that are insensitive to antiviral drugs are common, and constitute a major clinical challenge.|$|R

40|$|How the 5 ′-terminus of the {{template}} affects RNA synthesis by viral <b>RNA</b> <b>replicases</b> is poorly understood. Using short DNA, RNA and RNA–DNA chimeric templates that can direct synthesis of replicase products, {{we found that}} DNA templates tend to direct the synthesis of RNA products that are shorter by 1 nt in comparison to RNA templates. Template-length RNA synthesis was also affected by the concentration of nucleoside triphosphates, {{the identity of the}} bases at specific positions close to the 5 ′-terminus and the C 2 ′-hydroxyl of a ribose at the third nucleotide from the 5 ′-terminal nucleotide. Similar requirements are observed with two bromoviral replicases, but not with a recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

40|$|AbstractThe {{specific}} {{recognition of}} genomic <b>RNAs</b> by viral <b>replicase</b> proteins {{is a key}} regulatory step during the early replication process in positive-strand RNA viruses. In this study, we characterized the RNA-binding activity of the auxiliary replicase protein p 27 of Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV), which has a bipartite genome consisting of RNA 1 and RNA 2. Aptamer pull-down assays identified the amino acid residues of p 27 involved in its specific interaction with RNA 2. The RNA-binding activity of p 27 correlated with its activity in recruiting RNA 2 to membranes. We also identified the amino acids required {{for the formation of}} the 480 -kDa replicase complex, a key player of RCNMV RNA replication. These amino acids are not involved in the functions of p 27 that bind viral <b>RNA</b> or <b>replicase</b> proteins, suggesting an additional role for p 27 in the assembly of the replicase complex. Our results demonstrate that p 27 has multiple functions in RCNMV replication...|$|R
40|$|The soluble {{phase of}} the {{cytoplasm}} of human rhinovirus type 2 -infected cells contains an enzymatic activity able to copy rhinovirion RNA without an added primer. This RNA-dependent <b>RNA</b> polymerase (<b>replicase)</b> makes a specific copy of the added rhinovirion RNA, as shown by hybridization of the product to its template RNA but not to other <b>RNAs.</b> The same <b>replicase</b> preparation also contains a virus-specific polyuridylic acid [poly(U) ] polymerase activity which is dependent on added polyadenylic acid-oligouridylic acid template-primer. Both activities purify together until a step at which poly(U) polymerase but no replicase activity is recovered. Addition of a purified HeLa cell protein (host factor) to this poly(U) polymerase completely reconstitutes rhinovirus replicase activity. Host factor activity can be supplied by adding oligouridylic acid, suggesting that the host cell protein acts at the initiation step of rhinovirus RNA replication. A virus-specific 64, 000 -dalton protein purifies with both poly(U) polymerase and replicase activities...|$|R
40|$|Single-stranded RNA viruses {{often have}} 3 '-terminal tRNA-like {{structures}} {{that serve as}} substrates for the enzymes of tRNA metabolism, including the tRNA synthases and the CCA-adding enzyme. We propose that such 3 '-terminal tRNA-like structures are in fact molecular fossils of the original RNA world, where they tagged genomic RNA molecules for replication and also functioned as primitive telomeres to ensure that 3 '-terminal nucleotides were not lost during replication. This picture suggests that the CCA-adding activity was originally an RNA enzyme, that modern DNA telomeres with the repetitive structure CmAn are the direct descendants of the CCA terminus of tRNA, and that the precursor of the modern enzyme RNase P evolved to convert genomic into functional RNA molecules by removing this 3 '-terminal tRNA-like tag. Because early <b>RNA</b> <b>replicases</b> would have been catalytic RNA molecules that used the 3 '-terminal tRNA-like tag as a template for the initiation of RNA synthesis, these tRNA-like structures could have been specifically aminoacylated with an amino acid by an aberrant activity of the replicase. We show that it is mechanistically reasonable to suppose that this aminoacylation occurred by the same sequence of reactions found in protein synthesis today. The advent of such tRNA synthases would thus have provided a pathway {{for the evolution of}} modern protein synthesis...|$|R

40|$|The {{replication}} complexes of all positive strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes {{are associated}} with membranes. In the case of Semliki Forest virus (SFV), the main determinant of membrane attachment {{seems to be the}} virus-encoded non-structural protein NSP 1, the capping enzyme of the viral mRNAs, which has guanine- 7 -methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activities. We show here that both enzymatic activities of SFV NSP 1 are inactivated by detergents and reactivated by anionic phospholipids, especially phosphatidylserine. The region of NSP 1 responsible for binding to membranes as well as to liposomes was mapped to a short segment, which is conserved in the large alphavirus-like superfamily of viruses. A synthetic peptide of 20 amino acids from the putative binding site competed with in vitro synthesized NSP 1 for binding to liposomes containing phosphatidylserine.

40|$|Retroviral {{infections are}} ‘mini-symbiotic’ events {{supplying}} recipient cells with sequences for viral replication, including the reverse transcriptase (RT) and ribonuclease H (RNase H). These proteins and other viral or cellular sequences can provide novel cellular functions including immune defense mechanisms. Their high error rate renders RT-RNases H drivers of evolutionary innovation. Integrated retroviruses {{and the related}} transposable elements (TEs) have existed for at least 150 million years, constitute up to 80 % of eukaryotic genomes and are also present in prokaryotes. Endogenous retroviruses regulate host genes, have provided novel genes including the syncytins that mediate maternal-fetal immune tolerance and can be experimentally rendered infectious again. The RT and the RNase H {{are among the most}} ancient and abundant protein folds. RNases H may have evolved from ribozymes, related to viroids, early in the RNA world, forming ribosomes, <b>RNA</b> <b>replicases</b> and polymerases. Basic RNA-binding peptides enhance ribozyme catalysis. RT and ribozymes or RNases H are present today in bacterial group II introns, the precedents of TEs. Thousands of unique RTs and RNases H are present in eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses. These enzymes mediate viral and cellular replication and antiviral defense in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, splicing, R-loop resolvation, DNA repair. RNase H-like activities are also required for the activity of small regulatory RNAs. The retroviral replication components share striking similarities with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas machinery, eukaryotic V(D) J recombination and interferon systems. Viruses supply antiviral defense tools to cellular organisms. TEs are the evolutionary origin of siRNA and miRNA genes that, through RISC, counteract detrimental activities of TEs and chromosomal instability. Moreover, piRNAs, implicated in transgenerational inheritance, suppress TEs in germ cells. Thus, virtually all known immune defense mechanisms against viruses, phages, TEs, and extracellular pathogens require RNase H-like enzymes. Analogous to the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas anti-phage defense possibly originating from TEs termed casposons, endogenized retroviruses ERVs and amplified TEs can be regarded as related forms of inheritable immunity in eukaryotes. This survey suggests that RNase H-like activities of retroviruses, TEs, and phages, have built up innate and adaptive immune systems throughout all domains of life...|$|R

Quasispecies analysis of a number of field isolates indicated the presence of virulent virus in one particular isolate. Gene sequence analysis of the progenitor virus isolated in 1998 showed very little sequence variation when compared to that of a progenitor-like virus isolated in 2001 demonstrating that in the field. viral genome sequence variation appears to be biologically restricted to that of a consensus sequence.
