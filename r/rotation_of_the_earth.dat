5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth,</b> {{tropical}} cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to {{move from}} east to west. This causes tropical cyclones to approach the West Coast of the United States infrequently. Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures. Because of the water currents, the waters off California are rarely above , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves. This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century. The Long Beach Tropical Storm {{was the only one}} to make landfall; the other three hit Mexico before moving north.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> (the Coriolis effect).|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rotation</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> (Ω = 7.2921 × 10&minus;5 rad/s) can be {{calculated}} as 2π / T radians per second, where T is <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> which is one sidereal day (23 hr 56 m 4.1 s).

25|$|Unlike a {{directional}} gyro or heading indicator, a gyrocompass seeks north. It detects the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> about its axis and seeks the true north, {{rather than the}} magnetic north. Gyrocompasses usually have built-in damping to prevent overshoot when re-calibrating from sudden movement.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the ancient}} Greeks, {{several of the}} Pythagorean school {{believed}} in the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens. Perhaps the first was Philolaus (470–385 BCE), though his system was complicated, including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central fire.|$|E
25|$|Because this {{reference}} frame rotates {{several times a}} minute rather than only once a day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth.</b>|$|E

50|$|Precession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{equinoxes}} on <b>Earth</b> can {{be divided}} up into two distinct phases. The first phase is created by a wobbling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth’s</b> axis <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> and is known as axial precession. While the second phase is known as procession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ellipse and is related to <b>the</b> slow <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth’s</b> elliptical orbit around the sun. When combined these two phases create a precession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equinoxes that has a strong 23,000 year cycle and a weak 19,000 year cycle.|$|R
50|$|Low Earth {{orbiting}} satellites (LEOs) {{are often}} deployed in satellite constellations, because {{the coverage area}} provided by a single LEO satellite only covers a small area that moves as the satellite travels at the high angular velocity needed to maintain its orbit. Many LEO satellites are needed to maintain continuous coverage over an area. This contrasts with geostationary satellites, where a single satellite, moving at the same angular velocity as <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> surface, provides permanent coverage over a large area.|$|R
25|$|The {{understanding}} of the kinematics of how exactly the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> affects airflow was partial at first. Late in the 19th century, {{the full extent of}} the large scale interaction of pressure gradient force and deflecting force that in the end causes air masses to move 'along' isobars was understood.|$|E
25|$|A related {{problem is}} that of {{centrifugal}} forces for the Earth-Moon-Sun system, where three rotations appear: the daily <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> about its axis, the lunar-month rotation of the Earth-Moon system about their center of mass, and the annual revolution of the Earth-Moon system about the Sun. These three motions influence the tides.|$|E

5000|$|Ayanamsa (Sanskrit : [...] "movement" [...] + [...] "component"), also ayanabhāga (Sk. bhāga [...] "portion"), is the Sanskrit term in Indian {{astronomy}} for <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> precession.

25|$|Because the Earth's tides are {{ultimately}} due to gravitational {{interaction with the}} Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a renewable energy resource. Movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the Earth–Moon system: this {{is a result of}} pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence. This loss of energy has caused the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> to slow in the 4.5billion years since its formation. During the last 620million years the period of <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> (length of a day) has increased from 21.9hours to 24hours; in this period the Earth has lost 17% of its rotational energy. While tidal power will take additional energy from the system, the effect is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{scientist}} Giovanni Battista Riccioli and {{his assistant}} Francesco Maria Grimaldi described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 Almagestum Novum, writing that <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east. In 1674 Claude François Milliet Dechales described in his Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus how the <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed {{toward one of the}} planet's poles. Riccioli, Grimaldi, and Dechales all described the effect as part of an argument against the heliocentric system of Copernicus. In other words, they argued that the Earth's rotation should create the effect, and so failure to detect the effect was evidence for an immobile Earth. The Coriolis acceleration equation was derived by Euler in 1749 and the effect was described in the tidal equations of Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1778.|$|E

25|$|There are {{preserved}} observations of solar and lunar eclipses from Babylonian astronomy and Chinese astronomy beginning from the 8th century BCE.

The cumulative effect of the faster turn, of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century, 36,525 days per century, shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations. Scholars have combed the ancient records and calculated by modern models the magnitude of the long term historical slowing down of the Earth's rotation.|$|E
25|$|The {{rotation}} {{axis of the}} Earth describes, over {{a period}} of 25,700 years, a small circle (blue) among the stars, centered on the ecliptic north pole (the blue E) and with an angular radius of about 23.4°, an angle known as the obliquity of the ecliptic. The direction of precession is opposite to the daily <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> on its axis.
