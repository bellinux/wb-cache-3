30|$|Analyzing the 94 {{narrative}} comments {{provided on}} the items across the debriefing interviews, 11 <b>remarks</b> <b>concerned</b> comprehension difficulties, 13 <b>remarks</b> <b>concerned</b> clarity, 25 <b>remarks</b> <b>concerned</b> knowledge and recall (ease of memory retrieval), and 45 <b>remarks</b> <b>concerned</b> ease of judgment or spontaneous comments. These remarks thus applied to 52 {{out of the}} 123 items, with 71 items not remarked on. Patients {{found it difficult to}} interpret some symptoms, such as “body odor” (5 remarks) or “problems with memory” (2 remarks), because their effects are relatively subjective. Determining the severity of persistent symptoms such as “anxiety” (4 remarks) or “leg/arm swelling” (1 remark) was also problematic for small numbers of participants. Problems determining whether something like “aching joints” included symptoms such as stiff shoulders or aching muscles were reported by five patients.|$|R
