40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of real estate {{transparency}} (<b>RET)</b> <b>on</b> foreign real estate investments (FREI). Most of the previous studies have argued that the free flow of information and the fair and consistent application of local property laws could attract greater amounts of FREI. Using observations from 32 countries covering 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010 and applying fixed-effect and the generalized method of moments (GMM) techniques, our empirical results reveal that RET is not a major determinant of FREI. However, we find that the effect of <b>RET</b> <b>on</b> FREI is dependent on its interaction with the level of income implying that the higher the level of income in the host country, the higher the effect of <b>RET</b> <b>on</b> FREI. Finally, the results show that foreign direct investment (FDI) in other sector, market size and property prices are important determinants of FREI...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the short and long-term effects of resistance exercise training (RET) performed at different intensities (moderate and submaximal) on red blood cell (RBC) deformability and aggregation. 14 young male subjects {{were divided into two}} groups: Moderate intensity group performed 3 sets of 12 repetitions at an intensity corresponding to 70 % of one-repetition maximum (1 RM) whereas submaximal intensity group performed 3 sets of 6 repetitions at 85 % of 1 RM for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained just before and immediately after the <b>RET</b> <b>on</b> the first and last day of the program. Hemorheological parameters were determined using an ektacytometer (LORCA), hematological parameters were evaluated by a hematology analyzer. RBC deformability was found to increase in both groups immediately after the RET but this elevation was significant only in the moderate intensity group on the first day. RBC aggregation significantly increased in both groups immediately after the <b>RET</b> <b>on</b> the first and last day of the program. It is concluded that RET performed at an intensity corresponding to 70 % of 1 RM alters RBC deformability more than training performed at 85 % of 1 RM. On the other hand, both training protocols affect RBC aggregation in a similar way...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsPhysical {{activity}} and nutritional supplementation interventions {{may be used}} to ameliorate age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. Previous reviews have demonstrated the beneficial effects of resistance exercise training (RET) combined with protein or essential amino acids (EAA) in younger populations. Whether or not older adults also benefit is unclear. The aim of this review was to determine whether regular dietary supplementation with protein/EAA during a RET regimen augments the effects of <b>RET</b> <b>on</b> skeletal muscle in older adults. MethodsA literature search was conducted in August 2015 using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL Plus to identify all controlled trials using a RET regimen with and without protein/EAA supplementation. Outcome variables included muscle strength, muscle size, functional ability, and body composition. ResultsFifteen studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria, including 917 participants {{with a mean age of}} 77. 4  years. Studies involving both healthy participants and those described as frail or sarcopenic were included. Overall, results indicated that protein supplementation did not significantly augment the effects of <b>RET</b> <b>on</b> any of the specified outcomes. Exceptions included some measures of muscle strength (3  studies) and body composition (2 studies). Meta-analyses were conducted but were limited because of methodologic differences between studies, and results were inconclusive. ConclusionsSystematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials reveal that protein/EAA supplementation does not significantly augment the effects of progressive RET in older adults...|$|R

Irrespective of the locations, the pH of the post-retting water samples was more acidic than the pre-retting water samples.
