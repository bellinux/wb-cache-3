2500|$|The Internet Explorer box model bug {{refers to}} the way in which earlier {{versions}} of Internet Explorer handle the box model or sizing of elements in a web page, which differs from the standard way recommended by the W3C for the Cascading Style Sheets language. As of Internet Explorer 6, the browser supports an alternative <b>rendering</b> <b>mode</b> (called the [...] "standards-compliant mode") which solves this discrepancy. However, for backward compatibility reasons, all versions still behave in the usual, non-standard way by default (see quirks mode). Internet Explorer for Mac is not affected by this non-standard behavior.|$|E

2500|$|The game gained {{controversy}} when {{a designer}} inserted sprites of shirtless [...] "himbos" [...] (male bimbos) in Speedo trunks who hugged and kissed each other, who appear {{in great numbers}} from time to time. Their fluorescent nipples were drawn with a special <b>rendering</b> <b>mode</b> usually reserved for fog-piercing runway landing lights, so they could easily be seen from long distances in bad weather. An unintended emergent behavior of the code caused hundreds of himbos to swarm and crowd around the helicopter, {{where they would be}} slashed up by the blades, and then need to be air-lifted to the hospital—which earned the player easy money. The easter egg was caught shortly after release and removed from future copies of the game.|$|E
2500|$|For devices with screens 128 pixels wide or smaller, {{the default}} <b>rendering</b> <b>mode</b> is Small-Screen Rendering (SSR). In this mode, the page is reformatted {{into a single}} {{vertical}} column so that it need only be scrolled vertically. Long lists and navigation bars are automatically collapsed (hiding most of the list or bar) by a feature known as [...] "content folding". A plus (+) sign is displayed next to the collapsed content; when clicked, it toggles content folding. Web developers can turn on SSR on the desktop edition of Opera to see how their websites will be displayed on mobile editions of Opera. In SSR mode images are scaled down {{to no more than}} 70% of the screen size in either direction.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor work {{focuses on}} {{internet}} browsers. It deals with their historical evolution, examines their technologies, compares nad tests them. It also focuses on different <b>rendering</b> <b>modes</b> of web sites. Further it describes procedures of writing web sites, so that that the output {{is very similar}} in all major web browsers and the also standards-compliant. The goal is to show some inadequacies of modern web browsers, which offer multiple <b>modes</b> of <b>rendering</b> websites {{in order to maintain}} back compatibilty with older web sites. This text shows, how to recognise <b>rendering</b> <b>modes</b> and also how to overcome their differences. Procedures are shown on examples and also on example web presentation. This paper also tests JavaScript speed in different browsers. Several JavaScript tests were written for this purpose. Also several reasons for correct writing of HTML and CSS marks are mentioned...|$|R
40|$|While {{graphical}} visualization {{has advanced}} {{our ability to}} understand large multi-dimensional data sets, some types of data are still difficult to convey visually. Combined visual/haptic computer interfaces may allow users to explore multi-dimensional data sets more naturally, where the human haptic sense involving touch, limb position, and muscle tension provides a complementary information channel to convey certain data properties. We discuss the development of haptic <b>rendering</b> <b>modes</b> and combined visual/haptic <b>rendering</b> <b>modes</b> which can convey complex, multidimensional data. Tests to better understand human haptic and visual/haptic perception of the new data rendering elements are also outlined and initial results are presented. 1. Introduction Human vision is well-suited for 2 -dimensional (2 D) pattern understanding, and for identifying solid objects in 3 -dimensional (3 D) spaces. It is, however, less adept at understanding the following types of data: ffl scalar fields on 3 D domains [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|A {{trial version}} of the Internet Channel was {{released}} in December 2006, and a full version followed in April 2007. While in the beta stages of the development, this {{version of the}} Opera web browser implements some of the most widely reported features of the prospective final version. For example, it is possible to zoom in on web pages (by one increment) with the [...] "+" [...] button on the Wii Remote and pan around by holding the [...] "B" [...] button, and both Flash and AJAX functions are present. In addition, an alternative single-column <b>rendering</b> <b>mode</b> with large-print text can be toggled by pressing the [...] "2" [...] button on the Wii Remote, similar to the Small Screen <b>Rendering</b> <b>mode</b> seen on Opera's Nintendo DS Browser.|$|E

50|$|A {{community}} of enthusiast developers investigated {{the cause of}} the poor performance and concluded that DirectDraw and Direct3D applications were running in software <b>rendering</b> <b>mode</b> only.

50|$|In {{the version}} 2.0 update, {{character}} skins were {{a new and}} unique feature that allowed all characters to look different and have new music along with them. Some skins are the same character but from a different game in their respective franchise, while others are from completely different franchises. The 3.0 update added additional character skins, special <b>rendering</b> <b>modes</b> to mimic other earlier computer gaming hardware, and levels inspired by the limited-release Super Mario Bros. Special.|$|R
50|$|The {{project was}} started in 2005 on a sourceforge.net repository. The game was {{developed}} completely 2D, but utilizing 3D hardware acceleration (OpenGL) for faster rendering. An optional non-OpenGL ultra low requirements vector wireframe <b>render</b> <b>mode</b> is available that should run on any legacy platform. Graphics are kept simple, sound is sparse. The game features only engine sounds, level lost/won sounds, and a strawberry pickup sound, while the main menu features a single soundtrack. Levels can feature their own music.|$|R

50|$|The default and tightly {{integrated}} {{rendering engine}} in Softimage is mental ray. Materials and shaders are {{built in a}} node-based fashion.
