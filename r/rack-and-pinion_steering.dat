25|$|In 1946, {{the company}} {{restarted}} car production with the 202, delivering 14,000 copies. In 1947, Peugeot introduced the Peugeot 203, with coil springs, <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering,</b> and hydraulic brakes. The 203 set new Peugeot sales records, remaining in production until 1960.|$|E
25|$|The SC 430 chassis {{featured}} a double-wishbone setup {{for both the}} front and rear wheels. The vehicle platform shared elements with the GS 430 sport sedan, including variable-assist power <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> Safety systems ranged from traction control to vehicle stability control. The convertible received a ULEV emissions certification rating.|$|E
5000|$|Changes include {{lower and}} wider body, {{introduction}} of second-generation Direct Adaptive Steering, Drive Mode Selector with custom settings profile, hydraulic electronic <b>rack-and-pinion</b> power <b>steering</b> system standard (2.0t), introduction of Dynamic Digital Suspension, retuned seven-speed automatic transmission, Active Grille Shutter in V6 engine models. But the Q60 Convertible is discontinued {{for the second}} generation model of Q60.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fourth-generation}} Firebird amplified the aerodynamic styling {{initiated by}} the previous generation. While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the same, {{ninety percent of the}} Firebird's parts were all-new. Overall, the styling of the Firebird more strongly reflected the Banshee IV concept car than the 1991 [...] "facelift" [...] did. As with the Camaro, major improvements included standard dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, 16-inch wheels, <b>rack-and-pinion</b> power <b>steering,</b> short/long-arm front suspension, and several non-rusting composite body panels. Throughout its fourth generation, trim levels included V6-powered Firebird, and V8-powered Formula and Trans Am. The T5 five-speed manual transmission was standard with the V6s, as was the Borg-Warner T56 six-speed manual for the V8s. A four-speed automatic was optional for both, featuring built-in electronic controls beginning in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} CTS-V {{is based on}} the new GM Sigma II platform. The rear-wheel-drive platform is the basis for the 2008 to present Cadillac CTS base model with which the CTS-V shares most of the body work. The suspension features coil springs front and rear. The front suspension is a control arm arrangement while the rear is an independent multi-link suspension. To improve the handling and comfort, the 2009 CTS-V uses BWI Group's MagneRide technology. The dampers, filled with magnetorheological fluid, are adjusted based on sensor readings that happen at 1 ms intervals. [...] The sedan has four-wheel disc brakes similar to the first generation. The front brakes were increased in size to 14.96 in ventilated discs with six piston Brembo fixed calipers. The rear brakes are 14.37 in ventilated rotors with four piston calipers. Steering is speed-sensing hydraulic-assist <b>rack-and-pinion.</b> The <b>steering</b> ratio is 16.1:1. Tire sizes are 255/40ZR19 front and 285/35ZR19 rear on 19×9.0 inch and 19×9.5 inch wheels front and rear.|$|R
25|$|The Pacer became {{only the}} second American car after the Ford Pinto in {{production}} cars in the U.S. to feature <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> The system was mounted low {{at the front of}} the crossmember. The body was designed with the aim that structural lines protected it from hit damage, and AMC engineers claimed that they succeeded in more than 50% of the car surface.|$|E
25|$|May 1975 - Introduction of the Chevette three-door Hatchback in {{base and}} L model variations. Both had an {{improved}} {{version of the}} 1,256 cc OHV engine from the Viva, with a similar four-speed gearbox, rear wheel drive, independent front suspension, <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> and servo-assisted dual circuit brakes. Initial standard equipment included two-speed heater fan, radial tyres, reversing lights, heated rear window and reclining front seats.|$|E
25|$|For the suspension, the B31 {{featured}} double wishbones, {{coil springs}} over dampers with an anti-roll {{bar at the}} front, and single top links, twin lower links, twin trailing arms, coil springs over dampers with an anti-roll bar at the rear. The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> As the car weighed , it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5hp/kg.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} was widened for driver comfort with 2 more inches {{either side of}} the foot pedal, the <b>steering</b> <b>rack-and-pinion</b> moved to rear steer position of the front spindles (unlike Bill's 1st design front steer position on the 1964 model), the front frame section had 7°caster built into it, the front shock tower area had new diagonal tubing installed to limit chassis flex, the front upper and lower a-arms had ball joints and the rear chassis area was enlarged to allow for more fuel capacity. The project was never finished by Thomas because of Chevrolet's decision to withdraw its support.|$|R
2500|$|The Escort had {{conventional}} {{rear-wheel drive}} and a four-speed manual gearbox, or three-speed automatic transmission. The suspension consisted of MacPherson {{strut front suspension}} and a simple live axle mounted on leaf springs. The Escort was the first small Ford to use <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> The Mark I featured contemporary styling cues in tune with its time: a subtle Detroit-inspired [...] "Coke bottle" [...] waistline and the [...] "dogbone" [...] shaped front grille– arguably the car's main stylistic feature. Similar Coke bottle styling featured in the larger Cortina Mark III (a visually similar car was built in West Germany as the Taunus) launched in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|The {{editors of}} The Motor opined the [...] "more you study both the general layout and the detail {{features}} of the Pacer, the more convinced you become that the men who dreamed it up and decided to make it actually do drive around in crowded cities and consequently realise from their own experience that the traditional big barges are less and less easy to navigate through our streets." [...] Car and Driver road testers noted the Pacer's [...] "smooth and quiet ride can probably {{be attributed to a}} front subframe that isolates the passenger capsule from engine, suspension and steering loads" [...] making the car [...] "eminently stable and controllable, with its <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> and wide track." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Ridgeline has a four-wheel {{independent}} suspension with MacPherson struts {{in front and}} a multi-link trailing arm rear with upright springs and dampers. [...] It has a turning diameter of [...] using variable power-assisted <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> [...] It has four-wheel disc brakes with [...] ventilated front discs with floating twin piston calipers. [...] The rear brakes use [...] solid rear discs with floating single piston calipers and integrated emergency/parking brakes using a [...] "drum-in-hat" [...] design. [...] The disc brakes are controlled via a four-channel Anti-lock Braking System with Electronic Brakeforce Distribution and Brake Assist. [...] Although [...] to 0 stopping distances of [...] to [...] have been reported, the average appears to be between [...] and [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{standard}} transmission {{for this}} year was the W58 5-speed manual with the A43DL 4-speed automatic transmission being an option for L-types. Both transmissions featured an overdrive gear and the automatic featured a locking torque converter. The top gear in the 5-speed was its overdrive whereas the automatic transmission featured an overdrive gear that would engage at speeds over [...] The 1982 model's rear differential featured a 3.72:1 ratio. The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Lamm, {{writing in}} Popular Mechanics, commented on many [...] "thoughtful touches that {{distinguish}} AMC's strikingly futuristic new Pacer". [...] He said the ride was “not choppy as {{in so many}} short-wheelbase cars”, the <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> gave [...] "handling a feeling of precision ... sticking well in turns, with hard cornering generally solid and predictable”, the “tight turning radius" [...] made parking [...] "easy”, and the steering wheel was too big. [...] Summing up, he said that with its [...] "very modern styling, ample power and generous interior" [...] the Pacer was [...] "more car" [...] than [...] "the Mustang II or [...] "GM’s sporty compacts (Monza, Skyhawk/Starfire)", and that its performance felt [...] "strong—certainly {{on a par with}} most V8s." ...|$|E

50|$|Invented in 1913 {{it became}} common from the 1920s until the mid 1950s. In USA when power-steering {{becoming}} {{popular in the}} 1950s it was mainly replaced by worm and recirculating-ball nut steering —which incorporated ball-bearings. In Europe Marles' design {{was replaced by a}} general move to <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> gear.|$|E
50|$|Steering was changed: The 280ZX {{initially}} offered either unassisted <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> or a Datsun 810-derived recirculating-ball {{with power}} assistance. Neither {{came in for}} much appreciation in period road tests. A new power-assisted rack-and-pinion replaced the recirculating-ball steering system for the 1981 turbo, becoming available on the naturally aspirated models the following year.|$|E
50|$|The Chairiot solo {{features}} a unitized composite body on a steel chassis; {{the rear door}} is also composite, with an integral steel frame. The front suspension is double wishbone with <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering.</b> The rear suspension is a trailing arm design with a torsion tube independently controlling the rear wheels. It is equipped with four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{the newly}} {{released}} Mercedes W202 C-Class, {{the second generation}} CLK uses <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering,</b> instead of the recirculating ball design used in the previous generation CLK. The second generation CLK also uses a three-link front suspension, and aluminium rear multi-link suspension, and is 61 mm (2.4 in) longer, 18 mm (0.7 in) wider and 28 mm (1.1 in) taller than its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|By 1954, Suzuki was {{producing}} 6,000 motorcycles per month and had officially {{changed its name}} to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. Following the success of its first motorcycles, Suzuki created an even more successful automobile: the 1955 Suzuki Suzulight. The Suzulight sold with front-wheel drive, four-wheel independent suspension and <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering,</b> which were not common on cars until three decades later.|$|E

50|$|The new Victor shared its floorpan {{with the}} Opel Rekord but {{retained}} a distinct bodyshell, its own suspension and <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> {{as opposed to}} the Rekord's recirculating ball unit. The front end incorporated the then advanced detail of having the slim bumper bisect the grille, with a third of the grille and the side-lights (on quad headlamp models) below the bumper line.|$|E
5000|$|Suzuki {{announced}} the second-generation model on 18 January 1998 for 1999. Now slightly larger, pricier and more powerful, {{it uses a}} light-duty automobile-type <b>rack-and-pinion</b> <b>steering</b> box instead of the recirculating ball truck unit used in the first generation. The class was moved from mini SUV to compact SUV. In most international markets the name [...] "Grand Vitara" [...] was adopted.|$|E
