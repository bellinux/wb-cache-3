40|$|A {{study of}} the {{computer}} stored records of 293 dairy cows and 652 calvings reveals the effects of <b>retained</b> placenta and metritis complex on reproductive performance. The overall incidence rate of <b>retained</b> placenta was 11. 2 %. <b>Retained</b> placenta was 4. 6 {{times more likely to}} occur following twin births than following single births. Most cases of <b>retained</b> placenta occurred during the fall. Forty-five percent of that seasonal increase was explained by an increased number of calvings. Metritis complex was diagnosed following 54. 8 % of <b>retained</b> placenta cases. <b>Retained</b> placenta alone did not significantly impair reproductive performance. Metritis complex, in {{the presence or absence of}} <b>retained</b> placenta, caused a significant (P≤ 0. 05) increase in days open, services per conception, calving to first heat intervals and days from calving to first service. There is an indication (interaction P≤ 0. 1) that cows with both <b>retained</b> placenta and metritis complex are more severely affected than cows with either <b>retained</b> placenta or metritis complex alone. The influence of <b>retained</b> placenta on fertility appears to depend on the proportion of cows with <b>retained</b> placenta that have metritis complex...|$|R

40|$|Aims and Objective: To {{find out}} and compare peri implant strain {{developed}} in four {{different types of}} implant supported prostheses i. e., cement <b>retained</b> splinted, cement <b>retained</b> non splinted, screw <b>retained</b> splinted, screw <b>retained</b> non splinted. Methodology: Four implant analogues were placed in a polyurethane mandibular model at the position of left and right first and second molar. Abutments were fixed to the implant at a torque of 25 Ncm. Two such models were made. Four different prostheses were placed on abutment of each model i. e screw <b>retained</b> splinted, screw <b>retained</b> nonsplinted, cement <b>retained</b> splinted, cement <b>retained</b> non splinted. Four strain gauges were attached on the model, two on the buccal and two on the lingual aspect of each implant. Static load of 400 N was applied on the prosthesis using universal testing machine. Load application was done ten times for each model and peri implant strain was measured. Results: The mean peri implant strain (±SD) generated {{was found to be}} highest in non-splinted screw <b>retained</b> (1397. 70 ± 44. 47 microstrains and 1265. 90 ± 42. 76 microstrains) and least in splinted cement <b>retained</b> (630. 70 ± 31. 98 microstrains and 519. 60 ± 32. 48 microstrains) in both 1 st and 2 nd molars respectively. Conclusions: Splinted crowns produce less peri implant strain when compared to non splinted crowns. Cement <b>retained</b> prosthesis produce less peri implant strain when compared to screw <b>retained</b> prosthesis. Least strain was observed in cement <b>retained</b> splinted crowns...|$|R

40|$|This study {{concerns}} incidence, risk factors, {{therapy and}} consequences of <b>retained</b> placenta after normal foalings in Friesian mares. <b>Retained</b> placenta was defined as failure to expel all fetal membranes within 3 hours after the delivery of the foal. Incidence of <b>retained</b> placenta was studied in 495 parturitions. As possible risk factors for <b>retained</b> placenta, serum calcium, magnesium (n = 155), and vitamin-E concentrations, and glutathion peroxidase activity in blood (n= 99) were determined within 12 hours post partum and compared between mares with and without <b>retained</b> placenta.

As therapy, the relative effectiveness of intra venous administration of oxytocin in saline solution (n= 59) and of oxytocin in a Ca-Mg-borogluconate solution (n= 53) was studied. Parameters for post partum reproductive performance were compared between mares with (n= 54) and without <b>retained</b> placenta (n= 50), and within the group of mares with <b>retained</b> placenta, of mares from which the fetal membranes had been removed manually (n= 30) and from which it was not (n= 24).

40|$|Geogrid {{reinforced}} soil <b>retaining</b> {{walls are}} relative flexible <b>retaining</b> soil structures. The seismic mechanism of geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls with liquefiable backfill soils {{has not been}} clear during earthquakes. A strain multiple mechanism model can describe the generation and development of pore water pressures in saturated sand under cyclic loadings and undrained conditions. It can also describe the rotation of principal stress axes to simulate cyclic behaviors of anisotropic consolidated sand. The multiple mechanism model is applied to investigate seismic performances of geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls with liquefied backfill sand. In order to study the reinforced effect of geogrid for seismic stability of <b>retaining</b> walls, three <b>retaining</b> wall models are constructed, which are respectively an unreinforced soil <b>retaining</b> wall with saturated backfill sand, a geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> wall with saturated backfill sand and a geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> wall with dry backfill sand. Seismic horizontal deformations, seismic settlements, excess pore water pressures and strains of geogrids are compared in detail. The comparison results indicate that geogrids can still effectively decrease seismic performances of geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls with liquefied backfill sand. Drainage measures in geogrid reinforced soil <b>retaining</b> walls must be taken well in the construction. Some important seismic design points are achieved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Industrial {{low alloy}} TRIP sheet steels contain blocky and lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite. In the present study, {{transformation}} behaviour of blocky and lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite during straining was investigated to clarify {{its effect on}} mechanical properties. Two types of TRIP steels containing almost the same amount but the different morphology of <b>retained</b> austenite were used. A steel containing large amount of lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite exhibits superior ductility, and sustains high work-hardenability in a high strain region. On the contrast, a steel containing large amount of blocky <b>retained</b> austenite exhibits low ductility. The work-hardenability increased steeply to the maximum at a low strain region, and then reduced in a high strain region. The stability of the blocky austenite {{has been found to}} be poor with respected to martensite transformation. The lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite remains until a high strain region whereas the blocky <b>retained</b> austenite transformed into martensite in a low strain region. Carbon content was higher in the lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite than in the blocky <b>retained</b> austenite. Stability of <b>retained</b> austenite is, however, inexplicable only by the carbon content, and would be affected by the different morphology and the resulting restraint conditions...|$|R
