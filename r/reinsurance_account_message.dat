40|$|This {{paper was}} {{prepared}} {{in response to}} a call from the American Academy of Actuaries Comrmttee on Property and Lability Financial Reporting (COPLFR). The call requested ideas about how to define and test for risk transfer in short duration reinsurance contracts as required by FAS 113 and SSAP 62. These accounting standards require that a reinsurance contract must satisfy " one of two conditions in order to qualify- for <b>reinsurance</b> <b>accounting</b> treatment: 1) the contract must transfer "substantially all " of the underlying insurance risk, or failing that, 2) it must at least transfer "significant " insurance risk. The paper presents methods to test for both conditions, but the main focus is on testing for "significant" risk transfer. The shortcomings of the commonly used " 10 - 10 " test are discussed and two alternative testing frameworks axe presented as significant improvements over " 10 - 10 ". The first of these, which is presented in detail, is based on the expected reinsurer deficit (ERD). Conceptually, that approach is a refinement and generalization of " 10 - 10 " that addresses its major shortcomings. The second framework, based on the right tail deviation (RTD), is presented more briefly. It has certain desirable properties but at the cost of greater complexity...|$|R

We provide {{evidence}} from field experiments {{with three different}} banks, that reminder messages increase commitment attainment for clients who recently opened commitment savings <b>accounts.</b> <b>Messages</b> that mention both savings goals and financial incentives are par-ticularly effective, while other content variations such as gain versus loss framing do not have significantly different effects. Nor do we find evidence that receiving additional late reminders has an additive effect. These empirical results do not map neatly into existing models, so we provide a simple model where limited attention to exceptional expenses can generate under-saving that is in turn mitigated by reminders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{proposes a}} measure for risk transfer, the portion or {{percentage}} of risk transferred ("PRT'O that varies between 0 % and 100 %. Such measure {{would provide a}} superior basis for a binary decision between <b>reinsurance</b> <b>accounting</b> and deposit accounting (with a likely critical value of 50 °/ 0). A preferred approach would be to use PRT {{as the basis for}} continuous accounting. The paper differentiates between "natural " reinsurance contract provisions that do not limit risk transfer and "structural " contract provisinns that may limit risk transfer. The PRT measures the risk-limiting impact of the structural provisions by comparing risk distributions before and after the application of structural provisions. PRT is 100 % for contracts without structural provisions. The risk to be measured is defined as potential adverse deviation from the amounts reflected in <b>accounting</b> values. Fixed <b>reinsurance</b> contract provisions that are accounted for without uncertainty provide no potential for adverse deviation and do not affect PRT. The paper includes a discussion and critique of the FAS 113 definition of risk transfer, and finds two fundamental flaws: (1) the definition is based on an absolute measure of the riskiness of the ceded cash flows, so that reinsurance of low risk subject portfolios often fails even though nearly all the risk is transferred, while reinsurance of high risk subject portfolios often passes even though the risk transfer is severely lhnited; and (2) the focus on reinsurer profitability includes fixed amounts that are unrelated to risk, and thereby includes an implicit standard for reinsurance pricing that is an inappropriate role for accounting.

40|$|Building dialog {{agents that}} can {{converse}} naturally with humans is a challenging yet intriguing problem of artificial intelligence. In open-domain human-computer conversation, where the conversational agent {{is expected to}} respond to human responses in an interesting and engaging way, commonsense knowledge has to {{be integrated into the}} model effectively. In this paper, we investigate the impact of providing commonsense knowledge about the concepts covered in the dialog. Our model represents the first attempt to integrating a large commonsense knowledge base into end-to-end conversational models. In the retrieval-based scenario, we propose the Tri-LSTM model to jointly take into <b>account</b> <b>message</b> and commonsense for selecting an appropriate response. Our experiments suggest that the knowledge-augmented models are superior to their knowledge-free counterparts in automatic evaluation.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} messageordering, between outgoing messages from a sender to multiple receivers (called multicasts), on the completion time of a program for wormhole-routed distributed-memory systems.

We study how best to order a set of outgoing messages by taking into <b>account</b> <b>message</b> criticality and architectural issues including link contention, multiple ports, and adaptivity in routing. First, the simple algorithm of Dikaiakos et al. [8] is extended to obtain a static algorithm for non-fully-connected systems.

Simulation results on random task graphs show improvement in completion time by 34 % for static and 44 % for dynamic, over naive sequential message-ordering...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} message-ordering, between outgoing messages from a sender to multiple receivers (called multicasts), on the completion time of a program for distributed-memory systems. We study how best to order a set of outgoing messages by taking into <b>account</b> <b>message</b> criticality and architectural issues like multiple injection ports, routing adaptivity, and link contention. First, the simple message-ordering algorithm of Dikaiakos et al. [8], proposed only for fully-connected one-port system, is enhanced to obtain a static message-ordering algorithm. This enhanced algorithm is based on message criticality obtained from the temporal dependencies {{of the program and}} works for nonfully -connected systems. Next, a dytamic message-ordering algorithm is proposed which additionally considers architectural issues including link contention and multiple ports for wormhole-routed systems. Both algorithms are compared against naive sequential message-ordering on an event-driven simulator for Gaussian Elimination and random task graphs. Simulation experiments show a reduction in program completion time up to 33. 1 % by using static over sequential ordering. Similarly, the dynamic ordering shows additional improvement of up to 17. 7 % over static ordering. This research indicates that good message-ordering schemes need to be used as the last step in the mapping and scheduling process to generate efficient programs for wormhole-routed distributed-memory systems...|$|R
