A binding constraint on the monopolistfs expected average revenue lowers the access fee, promotes transmission investment, and improves consumer surplus. In {{a case of}} any linear or log-linear electricity demand function with a positive probability that no congestion occurs, average <b>revenue</b> <b>regulation</b> is allocatively more efficient than a Coasian two-part tariff if a positive access fee under average <b>revenue</b> <b>regulation</b> is lower than that under a Coasian two-part tariff. congestion pricing; electric power transmission; two-part tariff; average revenue regulation; Coasian two-part tariff...|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, the IRS issued Notice 98-11, 1998-1 C.B. 433 in {{an attempt}} to combat the use of [...] "check-the-box" [...] in {{international}} tax planning (see below); however, the notice met opposition, and was withdrawn by Notice 98-35, 1998-2 C.B. 34. Another proposal, around 1999, would have left the basic check-the-box regime in place, but allowed the IRS to disregard entity classification elections made in connection with [...] "extraordinary transactions" [...] (where the tax liability changes [...] "significantly" [...] {{as a result of the}} election). An [...] "extraordinary transaction" [...] was defined as one in which there was a sale, exchange, transfer, or other disposition of a 10-percent or greater interest in a foreign entity; the proposed regulations provided that an election to be classified as a disregarded entity could be ignored, and thus the entity continue to be taxed as a corporation, if the election occurred within twelve months following the day before an extraordinary transaction. However, various tax professionals opposed the changes, arguing that the threshold for defining an extraordinary transaction was far too low, and that existing internal <b>revenue</b> <b>regulations,</b> as well as common law doctrines such as the principle of substance over form and the step transaction doctrine, were already sufficient to combat any abuses of the check-the-box rules.|$|E
40|$|The {{paper is}} an attempt to present the first Polish legal {{regulations}} that were directly applicable to the motor industry. Such regulations were drafted and implemented as a binding law in Poland only in 1921. The period of twenty years that followed its implementation was a time of a continuous development of motor car law that had gradually taken the form of more detailed and specific legal provisions. It is worthy a note that by 1937 a uniform regulation covering all types of motor car as well as the motor traffic rules had been adopted. Obviously, the regulations had to develop, and they did, to reflect the technical developments and the progress and advancements in technology in particular, and the motor industry in general. And yet, the motor car law was not reduced to invoking the legal provisions only. Together with the development of legislation as such, it also addressed current matters and formulated other specific solutions, pertaining, for instance, to fiscal and <b>revenue</b> <b>regulations,</b> or to the obligation of motor car owners to make their vehicles to the military forces in the peace time, or to the state for defence purposes...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} model {{to show that}} through the adoption of simple regulatory rules, the threat of regulation as well as regulation itself impacts upon a firm s pricing strategy. The model is relevant to general antitrust policy, {{as well as the}} regulation of individual utility industries. While the paper focuses on the threat of <b>revenue</b> <b>regulation,</b> the principal results may also hold when regulation takes the form of penalties on prices charged. In the model the probability of regulatory intervention increases with the level of price charged, as does the toughness of any regulation imposed. This form of regulation, although not optimal, has the advantage of being relatively simple to apply. The proposed regulatory rules offer a form of transparent regulation that could circumvent fears of regulatory capture...|$|R

The state of Assam in India today, bordering what is now Bangladesh, lies beneath the watchful eyes of the Eastern Himalayas, through which the mighty Brahmaputra gushes and breathes life into the valley. The landscape of the Brahmaputra Valley, historically speaking, has been as much a patchwork of field and forest as of different ethnolinguistic and religious groups, ever fluid and shifting in response to human and non-human vectors of change. The contested relations of power that yoke together owners and cultivators of this complex, variegated landscape in the late colonial and early postcolonial eras is the subject of the book under review...|$|R
40|$|In 1997 an incentive-based {{regulation}} {{was introduced}} for Norwegian {{transmission and distribution}} companies. Under the following <b>revenue</b> <b>regulation</b> regime, the permissible revenue of a grid company is adjusted annually, and during the first regulation period, the new revenue cap was determined {{on the basis of}} last year’s revenue cap, adjusting for inflation, productivity improvement, and load growth. The idea behind the load growth compensation factor was that the grid companies should be compensated for increased costs due to grid expansion. Load growth was chosen, partly because it was considered to be an exogenously determined variable. However, in this paper, we will examine some investment incentives due to the load growth factor of the adjustment formula of the Norwegian regulation. We will show {{that as a result of}} parallel flows in electrical networks, a seemingly reasonable regulation policy of an electricity market may have paradoxical effects...|$|R

40|$|<b>Revenue</b> cap <b>regulation</b> {{is often}} {{combined}} with systematic benchmarking {{to reveal the}} managerial inefficiencies when regulating natural monopolies. One example is the European energy sector, where benchmarking methods are based on actual cost data, which are influenced by managerial inefficiency as well as operational heterogeneity. This paper demonstrates how a conditional nonparametric method, which allows the comparison of firms operating under heterogeneous technologies, {{can be used to}} estimate managerial inefficiency. A dataset of 123 distribution firms in Norway is used to show aggregate and firm-specific effects of conditioning. By comparing the unconditional model to our proposed conditional model and the model presently used by the Norwegian regulator, we see that the use of conditional benchmarking methods in <b>revenue</b> cap <b>regulation</b> may effectively distinguish between managerial inefficiency and operational heterogeneity. This distinction leads first to a decrease in aggregate efficient costs and second to a reallocation effect that affects the relative profitability of firms and relative customer prices, thus providing a fairer basis for setting revenue caps...|$|R

40|$|Price cap {{regulation}} {{allows the}} operator {{to change its}} price level according to an index that is typically comprised of an inflation measure, I, and a “productivity offset, ” which is more commonly called the X-factor.

Establishing price baskets allows the operator to change prices within the basket as the operator sees fit {{as long as the}} average percentage change in prices for the services in the basket does not exceed the price cap index for the basket. <b>Revenue</b> cap <b>regulation</b> is similar to price cap regulation in that the regulator establishes an I – X index, which in this case is called a revenue cap index, for service baskets and allows the operator to change prices within the basket so long as the percentage change in revenue does not exceed the revenue cap index. <b>Revenue</b> cap <b>regulation</b> is mor...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} efficiency {{in the provision of}} power distribution networks, the German regulator Bundesnetzagentur plans to implement <b>revenue</b> cap <b>regulation</b> together with yardstick competition. <b>Revenue</b> cap <b>regulation</b> could bear the ratchet effect: cost minimization need not to be optimal for the operator who anticipates that his revenue cap will become adjusted according to his cost performance. The regulator could extract all the rent by lowering an operator 9 ̆ 2 s revenue cap to the level of costs he revealed to be possible for him to reach. The ratchet effect could be mitigated by yardstick competition at which the level of revenues that is allowed to one operator is tied to the performance of others that are comparable to him. One will only be allowed to accumulate revenues that recover the least cost level that has been adopted within the group of comparable decision makers. In a setting of two sequential regulatory lags, this paper examines the occurence of the ratchet effect and the mitigating influence that yardstick competition has on it...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} airport {{decisions}} on pricing and capacity investment with both aeronautical and concession operations. In addition, the airport under consideration is serving air carriers who have market power. We {{find that a}} profit-maximizing airport would over-invest in capacity {{in the sense that}} the marginal (social) benefit of capacity is smaller than the marginal (social) cost. This tendency of overinvestment still holds when the private airport is under the regulatory constraint of cost recovery in its aeronautical operation (the dual-till regulation). We also find that the capacity investment by a public airport will be socially efficient {{in the sense that the}} marginal benefit of capacity is equal to the marginal cost of capacity. However, somewhat surprisingly, the capacity investment of the public airport will be inefficient if it is under regulatory constraints. Specifically, the airport will also over-invest in capacity, whether it is under a single-till regulation or a dual-till regulation. Finally, it is noteworthy that the inefficiency in airport investment is driven by the interaction between the airport and the carriers who have market power.
