In this video, Stevens considers {{the difference between the}} typically cited [...] "situational" [...] irony, versus [...] "dramatic" [...] irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are. The situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic. It is a song about [...] "the difference between what life knows we need, and what life thinks we need. What's ironic is not 10,000 spoons when {{all you need is a}} knife, it's the fact that, as Alanis believes, you have all of those spoons because, unbeknownst to you, but known by life, what you really need <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> only spoons... or the last thing you need <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> a knife." ...|$|E

[...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1995, Brooks and Groening were {{involved}} in a public dispute over the episode [...] "A Star Is Burns". Groening felt that the episode was a thirty-minute advertisement for Brooks' show The Critic (which had moved to Fox from ABC for its second season), and was created by former The Simpsons showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss, and whose lead character Jay Sherman appears in the episode. He hoped Brooks would pull the episode because [...] "articles began to appear in several newspapers around the country saying that [...] created The Critic", and removed his names from the credits. In response, Brooks said [...] "I am furious with Matt, he's been going to everybody who wears a suit at Fox and complaining about this. When he voiced his concerns about how to draw The Critic into the Simpsons' universe he was right and we agreed to his changes. Certainly he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. [...] He is a gifted, adorable, cuddly ingrate.

The Simpsons visit Australia in [...] "Bart vs. Australia" [...] (season six, 1995) and Brazil in [...] "Blame It on Lisa" [...] (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board—which claimed {{that the city was}} portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations—went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (season six, 1995) which featured a crossover with The Critic. He felt that it was just an advertisement for The Critic, and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode [...] "violates the Simpsons' universe." [...] In response, Brooks said, [...] "I am furious with Matt,... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far.... his behavior <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> rotten." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the tour began, Spears said of the show: [...] "I come from Broadway, so I {{want it to be}} very theatrical. The whole process for me is magical.

She joined them later after rehearsing the choreography in Los Angeles. [...] The setlist was composed mostly by songs from Britney.

500|$|When {{beginning}} {{work on her}} then-untitled third studio album, Stefani sought {{inspiration from}} her personal life in order to write lyrics for new material. She noted:... I was also in a really desperate place doing This Is What The Truth Feels Like, and I wasn’t back {{to a place of}} naiveté and purity. It was, 'All I have left <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> my music. And if I do that, maybe I’ll survive.' So, the way Tragic Kingdom was pure, this new record was pure. I was making this record because it’s all I could do to save my own life. She described this as a magical process. Immediately following the completion of [...] "Make Me Like You", Stefani wrote [...] "Misery" [...] with Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, and Robin Frediksson; however, unlike the recording sessions for her previous albums, the songwriting process was significantly shorter, which she opined was because everything should be simple. [...] "Misery" [...] was recorded by Mattias Larsson and Robin Frediksson of Mattman & Robin at Wolf Cousins Studios and Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and at Interscope Studios in Santa Monica, California. Additional recording was handled by Juan Carlos Torrado and Noah Passovoy, while Serban Ghenea mixed the audio at Mixstar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia.|$|E

I mean, {{we ended up}} recording {{them at the same}} time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses.

[...] The scene where Jack is staring at the bench where Hurley sits when Charlie visits him, I think in that moment he's thinking, my life <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> pretty good, I don't want to end up here." [...] In regard to the contrast in Kate's character on the island and after the island, Kitsis said that [...] "you could say [...] motherhood suits her.

[...] There's so much devotion to that child, and she appears to be such a great mother … taking care of Aaron may have helped her put away some other issues." ...|$|E

[...] On public reaction to the sexual performance, Lavanya Ramanathan of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "The Internet exploded, and it's not surprising. This is a couple who sat separately at awards ceremonies when they were dating several years ago." [...] On February 1, 2014, the couple performed the song again during Jay Z's performance at the DirecTv pre-Super Bowl party. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone referred to the pair's chemistry as the highlight of the event and said the performance was [...] "smiles and hugs and laughs, with one of the most famous rappers in the world gladly playing hypeman" [...] in contrast to the Grammy performance. Nekesa Mumbi Moody writing for the Associated Press felt that it was the set's highlight.
