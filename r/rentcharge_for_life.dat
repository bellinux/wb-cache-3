Rentcharges will therefore continue to exist as a means of paying for the upkeep of freehold estates.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether implementing Success <b>For</b> <b>Life</b> in Thailand would meet the needs of Thai public policy, the Thai educational system, and Thai culture. There were 46 respondents, including 4 early childhood professionals, 4 preschool owners, 6 directors, and 32 teachers. All respondents received the Success <b>For</b> <b>Life</b> training workshop. Each participant was requested to complete a questionnaire on their understanding and awareness of brain development and function, thoughts about implementing Success <b>For</b> <b>Life</b> in Thailand, and the appropriateness of Success <b>For</b> <b>Life</b> <b>for</b> the Thai educational system, Thai public policy, and Thai culture.

50|$|The Rentcharges Act 1977 {{seeks to}} abolish most forms of rentcharge. Section 2 {{prohibited}} {{the creation of}} new <b>rentcharges</b> except <b>for</b> 'estate rentcharges' (see below). Such rentcharges may also be redeemed (i.e. ‘bought out’) by the terre-tenant, generally for around sixteen times the annual amount of the rentcharge in accordance with provisions in the Act. Although many rentchargers will try to make a private settlement with the terre-tenant, the Act provides a formula which enables Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) to calculate the redemption figure that the terre-tenant has to pay the rentcharger in order to redeem their rentcharge. When the transaction has been completed DCLG, on behalf of the Secretary of State, issues a redemption certificate to the terre-tenant. Any existing rentcharges other than estate rentcharges will be extinguished on 22 August 2037.|$|R
