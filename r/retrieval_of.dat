We assessed the effect of using observations and mesoscale weather and chemical transport models on multispectral <b>retrievals</b> <b>of</b> land and ocean properties. We performed two atmospheric corrections on image data acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) /Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) airborne simulator over Monterey Bay, California. One correction used local atmospheric profiles of meteorology and trace gases at overpass and the other used the 1976 US Standard default atmospheric profile in the MODTRAN 4 radiative transfer model. We found only minor impacts from atmospheric correction in the Fluorescence Line Height index of ocean chlorophyll, but substantive differences in <b>retrievals</b> <b>of</b> surface temperature and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index.

5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson interferometer. One interferometer arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other interferometer arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase <b>retrieval</b> <b>of</b> coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In spring 2006, the European Arctic was {{abnormally}} warm, setting new historical temperature records.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} three-dimensional (3 D) radiative effects, which {{arise from}} horizontal radiative interactions between {{areas that have}} different cloud properties. Earlier studies have argued that these effects can cause significant uncertainties in current satellite <b>retrievals</b> <b>of</b> cloud properties, because the retrievals rely on one-dimensional (1 D) theory and do not consider the effects of horizontal changes in cloud properties. This study addresses two questions: which retrieved cloud properties are influenced by 3 D radiative effects, and where 3 D effects tend to occur? The influence of 3 D effects is detected from the wayside illumination and shadowing make clouds appear asymmetric: Areas appear brighter if the cloud top surface is tilted toward, rather than away from, the Sun. The analysis of 30 images by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reveals that <b>retrievals</b> <b>of</b> cloud optical thickness and cloud water content are most influenced by 3 D effects, whereas <b>retrievals</b> <b>of</b> cloud particle size are much less affected. The results also indicate that while 3 D effects are strongest at cloud edges, cloud top variability in cloud interiors, even in overcast regions, also produces considerable 3 D effects. Finally, significant 3 D effects are found {{in a wide variety}} of situations, ranging from thin clouds to thick ones and from low clouds to high ones...|$|R
