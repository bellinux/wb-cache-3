50|$|Modifications to {{the basic}} three element design have been {{periodically}} incorporated, especially in applications where higher than normal torque multiplication is required. Most commonly, these have taken the form of multiple turbines and stators, each set being designed to produce differing amounts of torque multiplication. For example, the Buick Dynaflow automatic transmission was a non-shifting design and, under normal conditions, relied solely upon the converter to multiply torque. The Dynaflow used a five element converter to produce the wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> multiplication needed to propel a heavy vehicle.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} healthcare resources {{is used for}} the treatment and prevention of contractures in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI), with stretch and passive movements remaining the most prominent intervention methods. The results of both clinical trials and animal studies in recent years have shown traditional stretch therapies to be ineffective at preventing contracture and joint immobility, and have encouraged further emphasis on evidence-based practices. However, these studies only analyzed one aspect of stretching, dosage, and failed to look at the characteristic <b>of</b> joint <b>torque.</b> Recent clinical trials have unearthed the fact that the joint <b>torque</b> application <b>of</b> therapeutic stretches in the clinic not only vary by therapist, but also can be well beyond the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>torques</b> tolerated by able-bodied individuals. A glove device utilizing force sensing resistors (FSRs) was developed to gauge joint torques. Coupled with a custom National Instruments’ LabVIEW program, the device was able to accurately measure forces, and eventually torques, applied during stretching. This study sought to explain what <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>torques</b> were being applied during stretching after SCI in the rat model in the hopes of understanding how to administer safe, effective therapeutic stretches. Six adult female Sprague-Dawley rats were mildly contused at T 9 using the NYU impactor device with a 12. 5 g-cm weight drop. n= 2 rats were stretched 2 days per week and n= 2 rats were stretched once per week using an eight minute protocol, for the first 5 weeks post-injury while controls (n= 2) received no stretch therapy. Briefly, the tibialis anterior (TA) and triceps surae (TS) muscle groups were stretched by two therapists bilaterally for a minute each, totaling 4 minutes of stretch per rat per day. Kinematic assessments of stretching were accompanied by force measurement data and were used to generate comparisons between therapeutic <b>torque</b> and end <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion (ROM) of the ankle. The data suggests that both once and twice per week stretching regimens were not enough to inhibit locomotor recovery or elicit a noticeable change in end ROM in such a mild injury model. There were noticeable differences in torques applied during stretching by different therapists, confirming the findings of previous studies. More importantly, the data showed that immediately after injury the normal end ROM can be achieved by applying less torque. The torque necessary to reach the end ROM increases to baseline values by week 5, potentially due to a return of the stretch reflex during spinal shock. This study urges other aspects of stretching therapy to be considered and suggests a tool for therapists to quantitatively apply safe and consistent stretching therapies to patients...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} in torque sharing between an internal combustion engine (IC engine) and two electrical motors for optimal drive of a hybrid vehicle.

The first stage of the train provides high torque from the IC engine and moderate torque from the motor M 1. The second stage provides lower torque but higher speed from the motor M 2. Such arrangement of power sources is achieved by carefully selecting of all the gear ratios in the train.

Brushless dc motor required less maintenance because permanent magnet is used so they do not have brushes. Under ideal condition with trapezoidal back emf the torque produced by the brushless dc motors is constant. However in practice the torque ripple appears on the delivered output toque.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the Variation-Based Platform Design Method (VBPDM) for product family design, {{which aims to}} satisfy a range of performance requirements using the smallest variation of the product designs in the family. In {{the first stage of}} the VBPDM, the product platform around which the product family is to be developed is identified. The product platform is common to all of the products in the family and re{{presents the}} maximum standardization possible considering the variety of performance requirements that must be satisfied. To satisfy the range of performance requirements for the product family, a ranged set of solutions is found using variation-based modeling. A compromise Decision Support Problem (DSP) is formulated to solve the tradeoff between satisfying the variety requirement and maximizing platform commonality. Platform commonality is achieved by introducing a commonality goal that seeks to minimize the deviation of the input design variables while satisfying the range of performance requirements. Those design variables that show small deviations are held constant to form the product platform. In the second stage of the VBPDM, each individual product is designed around the common platform such that the functional requirements for each product in the family are best satisfied.

It {{is well known that}} their energy efficiency is low but actual values are generally not available. Moreover, the bulk of the stepping motor applications are driven in open loop, with maximum current, to avoid step loss. A full step drive algorithm results in a low efficiency. In this paper the influence of the control algorithm on the efficiency of the motor is analyzed, measured and discussed. The basic open loop full-, half- and micro stepping algorithms are considered together with a more intelligent vector control algorithm. For each algorithm, torque/current optimization is discussed. As stepping motors are typically used for a broader <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>torques</b> and speeds, nominal values are not given. To present the efficiency of the motor for different control strategies, at every operating point, ISO efficiency curves are used. With these curves, the efficiencies of the different control strategies can be compared.

However, no study has evaluated the in vivo biomechanical properties of the quadriceps tendon in PFP syndrome. Our purpose was to compare the biomechanical properties of the quadriceps tendons in vivo and noninvasively in patients with PFP syndrome to those of control subjects. The null hypothesis was that the quadriceps tendons of PFP subjects would have significantly decreased strain compared with control subjects. Fourteen subjects (7 control, 7 PFP) performed voluntary ramp isometric contractions to a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> levels, while quadriceps tendon elongation was measured using ultrasonography. Tendon strain was calculated for the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) and vastus lateralis (VL) portion of the quadriceps tendon and compared between subjects (control vs. PFP) and within subjects (VMO vs. VL). PFP subjects showed significantly less VMO tendon strain than control subjects (P < 0. 001), but {{there was no difference in}} VL tendon strain between PFP and control subjects (P = 0. 100). Relative weakness of the VMO is the most likely cause of the decreased tendon strain seen in subjects with PFP. VMO weakness not only explains the decreased medial tendon strain but also explains the presence of increased lateral patellar translation and lateral patellar spin (distal pole rotates laterally) reported in the literature in this population. This technique can potentially be used in a clinical setting to evaluate quadriceps tendon properties and infer the presence of muscle weakness in PFP...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Before {{making a}} {{movement}} aimed at achieving a task, human beings either run a mental process {{that attempts to}} find a feasible course of action (at the same time, it must be compatible {{with a number of}} internal and external constraints and near-optimal according to some criterion) or select it from a repertoire of previously learned actions, according to the parameters of the task. If neither reasoning process succeeds, a typical backup strategy is to look for a tool that might allow the operator to match all the task constraints. A cognitive robot should support a similar reasoning system. A central element of this architecture is a coupled pair of controllers: FMC (forward motor controller: it maps tentative trajectories in the joint space into the corresponding trajectories of the end-effector variables in the workspace) and IMC (inverse motor controller: it maps desired trajectories of the end-effector into feasible trajectories in the joint space). The proposed FMC/IMC architecture operates with any degree of redundancy and can deal with geometric constraints (range of motion in the joint space, internal and external constraints in the workspace) and effort-related constraints (<b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> of the actuators, etc.). It operates by alternating two basic operations: 1) relaxation in the configuration space (for reaching a target pose); 2) relaxation in the null space of the kinematic transformation (for producing the required interaction force). The failure of either relaxation can trigger a higher level of reasoning. For both elements of the architecture we propose a closed-form solution and a solution based on ANNs. ...|$|E
40|$|Stairs, Lyne & Shemar {{have found}} that arrival time {{residuals}} from PSR B 1828 - 11 vary periodically with a period 500 days. This behavior can {{be accounted for by}} precession of the radiopulsar, an interpretation that is reinforced by the detection of variations in its pulse profile on the same timescale. Here, we model the period residuals from PSR B 1828 - 11 in terms of precession of a triaxial rigid body. We include two contributions to the residuals: (i) the geometric effect, which arises because the times at which the pulsar emission beam points toward the observer varies with precession phase; (ii) the spindown contribution, which arises from any dependence of the spindown torque acting on the pulsar on the angle between its spin and magnetic axes. We use the data to probe numerous properties of the pulsar, most notably its shape, and the dependence of its spindown torque on, for which we assume a sum of a spin-aligned component (with a weight 1 -a) and a dipolar component perpendicular to the magnetic beam axis (weight a), rather than the vacuum dipole torque (a= 1). We find that a variety of shapes are consistent with the residuals, with a slight statistical preference for a prolate star. Moreover, a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> possibilities fit the data equally well, with no strong preference for the vacuum model.
