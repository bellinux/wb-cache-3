40|$|Four hot-cathode {{ionization}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>gages</b> were calibrated in 12 gases. The relative sensitivities {{of these}} gages {{were compared to}} several gas properties. Ionization cross section was the physical property which correlated best with gage sensitivity. The effects of gage accelerating voltage and ionization-cross-section energy level were analyzed. Recommendations for predicting gage sensitivity according to gage type were made...|$|R
60|$|They {{climbed down}} a greasy iron ladder, {{and found a}} man in {{overalls}} kneeling beside a big iron casting {{in the bottom of}} the engine room. Near by piston-rod and connecting-rod flashed with a silvery glimmer between the throbbing cylinders and the whirling cranks that flung a shower of oil about, and floor-plates and frames vibrated in time to the rhythmic clangor. The engineer held an open lamp, its pale flame flickering to and fro as the vessel rolled, while he watched the index of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>gage.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{unique and}} {{versatile}} vacuum chamber {{has been designed}} for JPL's IR Focal Plane Technology Group. This chamber is equipped with multiple ports for cryogen and electrical vacuum feedthroughs, pumping units, <b>vacuum</b> <b>gages,</b> sources, and detector camera heads. The design incorporates a liquid-nitrogen-cooled optical table and radiation shield for low-background IR detector testing. Focal planes can be tested at temperatures ranging from 300 K to that of liquid helium. This paper describes the design and construction of this low-background IR focal plane test chamber and discusses some of its distinctive features. An analysis of the test chamber's performance is also presented...|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} all carbon triode ultrahigh <b>vacuum</b> <b>gage</b> was fabricated and tested. The gage {{exhibited a}} sensitivity of 3. 7 per torr for nitrogen and an X-ray background approximately 0. 1 {{as large as}} would be expected of a metal gage of the same design. The gage made from these materials, showed good sensitivity and durability. A practical technique was developed for bonding carbon components together without metal fasteners. The bond is made with a cross-linked phenolic resin which is converted to vitreous carbon by a careful pyrolysis procedure. The resulting bonds are strong, electrically conductive, and can withstand repeated excursions to 2500 K in vacuum. Measurements of adsorption and outgassing characteristics of four refractory carbons have confirmed that such materials are suitable for use in ultrahigh vacuum and that some are superior refractory metals in man respects...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of bulk ultrafine-grained (UFG) and nanostructured Al via cryomilling can frequently require a degassing step prior to consolidation, {{partly due to}} the large surface area of the as-milled powders. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the effects associated with cryomilling with stearic acid additions (as a process-control agent) on the degassing behavior of Al powders. This objective was accomplished by completing select experiments with Al- 7. 5 Mg, Al- 6. 4  wt pct Al 85 Ni 10 La 5, and Al- 14. 3  wt pct B 4 C. The interaction between Al and stearic acid was determined using thermal analysis combined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The degassing experiments were carried out under high vacuum (10 − 4 to ~ 10 − 6  torr) in a range from room temperature to 400  °C, with the pressure of the released gases monitored using a digital <b>vacuum</b> <b>gage.</b> The results showed that the liberation of chemisorbed water was suppressed in cryomilled Al powders and both the chemisorbed water and stearic acid were primarily released in the form of hydrogen. It was also demonstrated that under certain conditions, a nanostructure (grain size ~ 100  nm) can be retained following the hot vacuum degassing of cryomilled Al...|$|R
40|$|Basically, the ISO {{standard}} 5707 (Milking machines installations: {{construction and}} performance) applies to milking machines for small ruminants for {{qualitative and quantitative}} requirements that are similar for dairy cattle such as vacuum regulation, sizing airlines, <b>vacuum</b> <b>gages</b> and receiver. Specific quantitative requirements for sheep were introduced {{by a group of}} experts within the International Dairy Federation (I. D. F.) and published in a bulletin in March 2002. New recommendations, especially for vacuum pump capacity and effective reserve, are now available. For ewes, they take into account the type of cluster used, the number of operators with the type of machine (bucket or milkline) and the number of units. Vacuum pump capacity is also calculated referring to air used during the cleaning process (only for machine with milkline). Furthermore, regulation must be well adjusted in order to maintain a stable vacuum within the plant at every moment of milking. Pulsation characteristics are important for ewes because they have a direct influence on stimulation of milk let-down. The best pulsation rate should be 150 - 180 cycles/min and a pulsator ratio of 50 %. Sizing milklines is similar to cows but taking into account the particular milk kinetics of the East-Friesian ewes and the type of cluster used. Finally, recent recordings of vacuum beyond the teat and in the claw (or SMT) and of liner movements presented in this document can be useful for helping farmers in their choice of new equipment...|$|R

40|$|A porous cup when {{filled with}} water and {{connected}} to a suitable gage {{may be used for}} measuring the pressure in soil water (1, 5). This pressure may be either greater or less than atmospheric pressure, which is ordinarily taken as the pressure reference. At points below a water table the pressure is positive, but in unsaturated soil the water in a porous cup must be under negative or vacuum pressure in order to be in equilibrium with the water in the soil. The combina-tion of a porous cup and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>gage</b> for measuring the equivalent negative pressure 3 or tension of water in unsaturated soil has been called a “tensi-ometer ” (1). Improvement in both the design and materials for tensiometer construction will undoubtedly continue, and no one design will be best for all types of use. Care must be exercised in the selection of materials and in the construction of any tensiometer if it is to give trouble-free operation, and sometimes difficul-ties develop which are not easy to anticipate. Numerous requests have come to the writer for information on the design and construction of tensiometers. Since these units are not commercially available at present, it is hoped that this paper will be of assistance to those who wish to construct tensiometers for their own use. Three units that have performed satisfactorily under field and laboratory conditions are described. TENSIOMETER CUPS Porous cups suitable for use with tensiometers and of almost any desired shape can be made up in the laboratory by the drain-casting process. Experi-mentation with different clays and firing processes may be necessary to obtain a suitable porous structure. The cup wall should be permeable to water, and yet when the wall is wet the “air-entry value ” must be greater than one atmos-phere. This value is simply the pressure difference required to produce an air leak through the cup wall when it is saturated with water. There is to a certain extent, a reciprocal relation between these two properties; when one is high the other is low. Experience indicates that the permeability should be as high as possible and still have the air-entry value greater than oneatmosphere...|$|R
50|$|Austin {{mentioned}} in his defence the renowned British inventor Sir William Crookes. Sir William {{was described as}} {{the inventor of the}} <b>radiometer</b> and the <b>vacuum</b> tube, the discoverer of thallium, a member of the Royal Society, president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and (according to Dr. Austin) Britain's 3rd most important scientific mind (Lord Kelvin and Wallace taking the first two spots by narrow margins). Sir William had conducted a series of experiments with noted Spiritualists and Spiritual Mediums and had also experienced many of the phenomena that Dr. Austin described, admitting them to be beyond any known natural law. These experiences had occurred during a series of highly controlled tests in Sir William's own house and in other places which could not have been tampered with.|$|R
40|$|Aims. LYRA, the Large Yield <b>Radiometer,</b> is a <b>vacuum</b> {{ultraviolet}} (VUV) solar radiometer, {{planned to}} be launched in November 2009 on the European Space Agency PROBA 2, the Project for On-Board Autonomy spacecraft. Methods: The instrument was radiometrically calibrated in the radiometry laboratory of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) at the Berlin Electron Storage ring for SYnchroton radiation (BESSY II). The calibration was done using monochromatized synchrotron radiation at PTB's VUV and soft X-ray radiometry beamlines using reference detectors calibrated {{with the help of}} an electrical substitution radiometer as the primary detector standard. Results: A total relative uncertainty of the radiometric calibration of the LYRA instrument between 1 and 11 was achieved. LYRA will provide irradiance data of the Sun in four UV passbands and with high temporal resolution down to 10 ms. The present state of the LYRA pre-flight calibration is presented as well as the expected instrument performance. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Temporal Experiment for Storms and Tropical Systems Technology Demonstration (TEMPEST-D) {{mission is}} to {{demonstrate}} the capability of 6 U-Class satellite constellations to perform repeat-pass radiometry to measure clouds and precipitation with high temporal resolution on a global basis. The TEMPEST mission concept is to improve understanding of clouds and precipitation by providing critical information on their time evolution in different climatic regimes. Measuring at five frequencies from 89 to 182 GHz, TEMPEST-D millimeter-wave radiometers are capable of penetrating into the cloud to observe changes as precipitation begins or ice accumulates inside the storm. The TEMPEST-D flight model radiometer instrument has been completed, passed functional testing, vibration testing and self-compatibility testing with the XB 1 spacecraft bus. The next steps for the TEMPEST-D millimeter-wave <b>radiometer</b> are thermal <b>vacuum</b> testing and antenna pattern measurements. The complete TEMPEST-D flight system will be delivered to NanoRacks for launch integration {{in the autumn of}} 2017, in preparation for launch to the ISS {{in the second quarter of}} 2018, with deployment shortly thereafter into a nominal orbit at 400 -km altitude and 51. 6 ° inclination...|$|R
