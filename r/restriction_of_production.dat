40|$|Research PaperIn {{the context}} of the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> French {{agriculture}} modifies its activities by developing multifunctionality. This concept translates the fact that, beyond the saleable production of agricultural and food processing products, the agricultural activity fulfills other functions: economic, social, environmental. Multifunctionality of agriculture is implemented {{in a number of ways}} and at various levels (regional, national, European). Measures to support it take two forms. It can be support for projects, collective services which cannot be remunerated by the market and which require a financial contribution. Other measures, ad hoc and limited in time, subsidise projects which will generate viable activities and which will then be financed by the market. Sea fishing and shellfish culture activities have an important role in the spatial planning on the coast. The development of these activities allows the stabilisation of employment and the preservation of an economic and social fabric throughout the year. These activities also exert an undeniable attraction for tourism. In the context where striking a balance between safeguarding the resource, rationalisation of economic activity and maintenance of social objectives is more and more difficult, the assertion of a multifunctionality of sea fishing and shellfish culture would also have, as for agriculture, to allow the continued existence of significant number of enterprises because of the generated complementary incomes and financing of non commercial services ensured within this framework. As in agriculture, specific measures would make it possible to generate new activities in order to make them economically viable in the medium term in particular improvement of methods of fishing, diversification of activities and enhancement of sea food products...|$|E

40|$|Milling {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and common processes widely used in manufacturing industry, which is a very competitive environment. For this reason, manufacturing companies are facing many different challenges. The offering of a variety of high quality products, the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> time and costs, the increase of productivity, and the need for flexibility of production are the goals that manufacturers have to consider and achieve in order to succeed in their field. These aspects relate to the process study, optimization and control, and in recent years many attempts to find possible solutions and techniques to manage these steps in a proper way have been done. The first solution that a lot of enterprises were motivated to research and utilize relates to the application of the finite element modeling (FEM) techniques to study manufacturing processes or to highlight behaviour of products, for example of cutting tools, during the design phase. The second technique deals with the manufacturing process control, and is aimed at the increasing of automation level of modern production systems by evolving them towards the paradigm of Intelligent Manufacturing. The present work is focused on the study and evaluation of the effectiveness of both techniques. The first part of the research presented in this thesis is dedicated to the study of the application of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems to milling processes. In particular, in the Chapter 1 it is discussed the improvement of the artificial operator called Evaluation and Perception Controller (EPC) built by the Mechatronics group of the University of Trento within the national project Michelangelo in 2013. In this thesis it is proposed to improve the performance characteristics of the EPC system in terms of the process quality, described by the surface roughness value. In particular, it is proposed to associate the surface roughness term to the scallop height value, and to include a model that describes the mechanism of scallop height formation into the Optimal Control Problem formulation. Chapter 2 of this work is related to the application of FEM techniques to study milling processes. In particular, in this section the influence of CAD cutting tool models (STEP and STL) on 3 D FEM AdvantEdge prediction accuracy in terms of the average and maximum cutting forces, and deformed chip thickness and curvature radius values are studied. In addition, this part of the thesis includes also the discussion of the problems related to the application of 2 D FEM modeling techniques to study the influence of cutting tools geometries on the feed and tangential cutting forces that act in three-dimensional cutting processes. Chapter 3 of this thesis is dedicated to the development of a model suitable for prediction of cutting forces that act in non-tilted and tilted side down-milling processes performed with end mills. The development of this model has two purposes. First of all, it can be included into the EPC controller, thus extending the field of the possible applications of this system. The second purpose relates to the fact that in case the side down-milling process simulations are performed by using cutting forces coefficients identified based on 2 D FEM cutting forces data, the proposed model allows to overcome the mismatches between real processes and 2 D FEM, and to simulate two cutting forces, feed and normal, arising in three-dimensional processes...|$|E

Timber building prefabrication represents a suitable way to satisfy this demand, but its application {{for this purpose}} is at the moment inadequate mainly due to <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> approaches: the lack of variety of low-cost mass-produced buildings and {{the high costs of}} ad-hoc full-customized buildings. In order to provide affordable customized houses, the timber building industry should focus on designs characterized by the combination of mass-produced and customized parts.

As an example the enterprises of the Tatarstan Republic chemicals sector were held up.

In contexts of international economics globalization new financing sources in financial and operating activities of enterprises become increasingly important under <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> factors scarcity. As far as we know, labor theory of value emphasizes three factors of production: land, labour, capital. Against the background of institutional economics transformation of the first factor and detachment into the additional category such factor as «human capital assets» is taking place. Initially it was mentioned in Adam Smith's book «The Wealth of Nations» where human capital asset is thought of as the generalized characteristic for quality and quantity of the human's labour ability being key revenue source and labor productivity growth promoting factor. Nowadays «the notion of «human capital asset» is understood as the body of knowledge, skills, abilities (including creativity and mental ability), human incentives for productive labour acquired due to education, training or based on practical experience and being of great economic value promoting growth in prosperity of certain economic entity and national wealth as well...|$|R

METHODS: Data from 217 renal transplant {{patients who received}} an HLA-A 2 -mismatched renal graft were analyzed with regard to HLA-A 2 humoral responsiveness. High-resolution DNA typing of class II HLA-DR alleles was performed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primer. Patients who {{had one of the}} following eight HLA-DRB 1 alleles were included in the study: -* 0101, -* 0301, -* 0401, -* 0701, -* 1101, -* 1301, -* 1401, and -* 1501. Serum samples were screened posttransplantation with the standard complement-dependent cytotoxicity procedure. In addition, recombinant HLA-A 2 monomers (the "MonoLISA" assay) were used as a target for the detection of HLA-A 2 group-specific antibodies. The following HLA-A 2 amino acid positions (termed "epitopes") that are responsible for the induction of an antibody response were defined: 74 H, 65 - 66 GK, 62 G, 114 H, 142 - 145 TTKH, and 107 W- 127 K. The definition of the "HLA-DR permittors" of anti-HLA-A 2 response was based on a "class II restriction table" designed for this purpose.

This program rests on a tripod, so to speak, the first leg being the proration laws of the oil-producing States, the second being the Federal Government in the from of legislation, and the third being the large integrated oil companies. That program has been sponsored by the major oil companies to control over-production of crude oil. Since proration was effective, the behavior of crude oil price became far more stable, and with minor exceptions, {{the only way it}} ever moved was upwards. In view of the supply inelasticity of competitive crude oil <b>production,</b> the smoothness <b>of</b> the transitions from one price to another and the long period of stability in the face of changing demand bespeak the characteristic of administered price. After World War II crude oil prices have risen sharply. This price rise is much greater than the cost rise per foot of wells drilled. This high price is reached and maintained by means of severe output controls to assure the greatest profit to the major companics. High prices and special tax arrangements stimulated the exploration and development of oil wells and produced an increasing surplus of oil producing capacity over output. The result is the uneconomic use of resources and decrease in the return on investment...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of machines into human affairs produces tension between competing needs.   We need {{to engage the}} world directly with the hand, {{and we need to}} augment the hand with mechanical power.   What is the right balance between human autonomy and mechanical influence - between direct and indirect control?  With the rise of the computer age, we seem to resolve the matter in favor of machines, encouraging their unrestrained expansion.   However, a Resistance Movement persists.   It resurfaces with each wave of technological invention, rekindling the tension.  This {{can be seen in the}} current debate over the appropriate use of digital fabrication technology.  Some architects believe it yields unprecedented creative freedom by overcoming the <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> mass <b>production.</b>  Others believe it alienates us from a vital source of inspiration by deemphasizing direct contact with material.   This paper examines the hand-machine conflict in its current form, and argues that its polarized categories cloud our thinking with false moral alternatives such as: embrace technology and foster a new aesthetic age, or resist it and protect mankind from further alienation.   Instead, we should seek a third alternative that frees us from this either-or thinking.  One established way of doing this in architectural design is to use traditional media and computer media in oscillation.  The paper critically evaluates this approach and presents a design studio experiment that moves beyond oscillation, seeking a higher degree of hand-machine unity...|$|R
