5|$|By this time, {{the route}} from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from {{improving}} <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> had drawn away {{much of the}} tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, and the track itself was poorly maintained. Trains, once again, were regularly derailing on the line.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1950s, British Railways {{had begun}} to operate in {{regional}} units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns {{was transferred to the}} London Midland Region. Services on the branch were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on the branch, although these declined steadily owing to competition from <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> to the point at which coal deliveries were the only significant business.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{reorganisation}} {{of public}} transportation by the Labour government of Clement Attlee, the LPTB {{was scheduled to be}} nationalised along with the majority of British railway, bus, <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> and waterway concerns from 1 January 1948. In advance of this, Ashfield resigned from the LPTB at the end of October 1947 and joined the board of the new British Transport Commission which was to operate all of the nationalised public transport systems. At nationalisation, the LPTB was to be abolished and replaced by the London Transport Executive. Lord Latham, a member of the LPTB and the incoming chairman of the new organisation, acted as temporary chairman for the last two months of the LPTB's existence.|$|E
5|$|However, by {{this point}} the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since {{the opening of the}} Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped {{throughout}} the 1950s as a result of improved <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> and declining demand for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. With freight usage dwindling to a trickle following the ending of passenger services, the goods yard was closed on 7 December 1964. The site of the goods yard was used {{for the construction of a}} large apartment block known as The Sandlings, and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Previous {{studies for}} {{analyzing}} optimal haulage routes of dump trucks in open pit mines mostly used raster data. However, the raster data has several problems in performing optimal route analyses: (1) the jagged appearance of <b>haulage</b> <b>roads</b> according the cell resolution often causes overestimation {{of the travel}} cost; (2) it difficult to trace the topological relationships among <b>haulage</b> <b>roads.</b> These problems can be eliminated by using vector network data, however a new method is required to reflect the performance characteristics of a dump truck according to terrain gradient changes. This study presents a new method to create vector network data with the consideration of terrain gradient for analyzing optimal haulage routes of dump trucks in open pit mines. It consists of four procedures: (a) creating digital elevation models, (b) digitizing <b>haulage</b> <b>road</b> networks, (c) calculating the terrain gradient of <b>haulage</b> <b>roads,</b> and (d) calculating the average speed and travel time of a dump truck along <b>haulage</b> <b>roads.</b> A simple case study at the Roto South pit in the Pasir open pit coal mine, Indonesia is also presented to provide proof that the proposed method is easily compatible to ArcGIS Network Analyst software and is effective in finding optima...|$|R

30|$|The depot is a {{population}} of nodes that represent a rail-road freight terminal and smaller depots connected by <b>road</b> <b>haulages.</b> Nevertheless, all depots share common attributes, including the generation of freight transport demand, waiting lists, resource pools, and the calculation of key performance indicators, the ones widely used in the system analysis of logistics performance. Scenario generation is controlled by a dynamic event. Historical orders are disaggregated by the data adaptor. Freight demand might be satisfied {{by more than one}} container for large goods. The waiting list is the collection array of the temporarily stored products that are delayed because of the unavailability of a tractor. Resources are pools of common specified objects, which include containers and parking slots. Performance indicators document the economic and environmental measurements that change over time and are visible through a user interface. The interface also outputs simulation data into spreadsheets.|$|R
2500|$|Most timber railway {{operations}} across Australia were transitory, only existing for {{the time}} that timber was extracted.

25|$|The {{competition}} from road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced the revenue {{available to the}} railways, even though the needs for maintenance on the network had never been higher, as investment had been deferred over the past decade. Rail companies accused the government of favouring <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> {{through the construction of}} roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use flexible pricing because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the Salter Report of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with <b>road</b> <b>haulage.</b> Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.|$|E

40|$|Dust {{emissions}} from mining activities {{and their impact}} on the surrounding environment have been and remain one of the major environmental impacts associated with surface mining. Dust emissions caused by the transportation of mined material on surface mines are the most significant contributor. In previous studies, as much as 93 % of total dust emissions were found to be associated with this activity. Dust emissions not only have a negative environmental impact, but also impact on vehicle maintenance and operating costs, and can affect the health of the surrounding communities.
