40|$|ZEOLITES AND RELATED MICROPOROUS MATERIALS: STATE OF THE ART 1994 The {{effect of}} solvent {{polarity}} on reaction rate and selectivity in the cyclohexylation of phenol over an ultrastable Y zeolite is analyzed {{in terms of}} its effect on the adsorption of <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>products</b> {{on the one hand and}} on the surface reaction on the other hand. It is shown that in absence of diffusional limitations, variations of activity and selectivity with solvent polarity are determined by the equilibrium distribution of <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>products</b> between the bulk solution and the cavities of the zeolites, the latter acting as micro-reactors. Polar solvents, as nitrobenzene and nitropropane strongly adsorb on the catalyst and suppress catalytic activity. Due to the high polarity of the solvent, the primary products are expelled from the catalyst, suppressing consecutive reactions. In apolar solvents, the concentration of phenol on the catalyst increases at the expense of cyclohexene, the latter becoming more stabilized in the bulk solution. This also results in decreased rates of primary and secondary reactions. At intermediate solvent polarity both reagents adsorb on the catalyst, resulting in the highest reaction rate. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} density matrix {{techniques}} and angular momentum algebra to obtain quantum-mechanical equations describing the dynamical stereochemistry of the atom-diatom reaction A + BC⇌AB + C. The relative motions of <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>products</b> are specified by four vectors: rotational angular momenta of diatomic molecules and relative velocities of <b>reagents</b> <b>and</b> <b>products.</b> Our equations {{show how the}} correlations between the spatial distributions of these four vectors are related to the scattering matrix determined in quantum scattering calculations. We present three different expressions for the four-vectors correlation. One of them is appropriate to the helicity representation of the scattering matrix, while the others are appropriate to the orbital angular momentum representation with either space-fixed or body-fixed reference frames. The formulation adopted allows for a rigorous comparison between theory and experiment. It takes mixed quantum-mechanical states and unobserved quantum-numbers into account, and all vector distributions are expressed in terms of measurable quantities (scattering angles and polarization moments of rotational angular momenta). Explicit expressions for most of the lower-order vector correlations obtained by direct reduction of the four-vectors correlation formulas are also presented. © 1997 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
