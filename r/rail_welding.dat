40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>welds</b> {{are widely}} used in {{high-speed}} railways and short-wave irregularities usually appear due to limitations in welding technology. These irregularities can excite a high wheel/rail force and are regarded as {{the main cause of}} deterioration in track structures. To measure this fierce force (or deterioration of the <b>rail</b> <b>weld),</b> axle box acceleration is treated as an effective and economic measure, though an exact quantitative relation between these two quantities remains elusive. This paper aims to develop such a relation in order to provide a new theoretical basis and an analysis method for monitoring and controlling weld geometry irregularity. To better understand the characteristics of axle box acceleration, the paper consists of two parts: an observation and a numerical simulation of axle box acceleration by <b>rail</b> <b>welds.</b> Based on measured data from field tests, axle box acceleration at <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> was found to have high-frequency vibrations in two frequency bands (i. e., 350 – 500 Hz and 1000 – 1200 Hz). Upon analyzing the vibration characteristics in time–frequency domains, the exact location of the <b>rail</b> <b>weld</b> irregularity could be identified. Subsequently, a 3 D high-speed wheel/rail rolling contact finite element model was employed to investigate the effect of <b>rail</b> <b>weld</b> geometry on axle box acceleration, and led to the discovery that the weld length and depth determine the vibration frequency and amplitude of the axle box acceleration, respectively. A quantitative relation between axle box acceleration and wheel/rail force has also been determined. Finally, we propose an approach for real-time health detection of <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> and discuss the influence of other defects and <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> on the acceleration signal of the axle box...|$|R

In this work, residual stresses in <b>rail</b> <b>weld</b> samples were measured at locations in welds where {{traditional methods of}} measurement {{are not able to}} access. This {{is the first time that}} full scale <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> were used for neutron diffraction measurements. The procedure used in these measurements can be used to measure residual stresses more accurately and with higher resolutions in structures with complex and large geometries. Residual stresses in four rail samples were measured at locations where welds are more prone to crack and fracture. Two of the <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> were made using aluminothermic welding technique, and they had different preheating conditions. Other two samples were made through flash-butt welding technique, and different welding machines were employed to make them. Using the measured residual stresses, the correlation between railway welding techniques, some of the welds' metallurgical characteristics and the measured residual stresses were determined. This work can be used as a stepping stone toward weld optimization procedure in railway industry by minimizing the magnitude of residual stresses, and it adds to understanding of measuring residual stresses in full scale samples, lattice parameter measurements in reference samples and determining the correlation between welding parameters and residual stresses in <b>rail</b> <b>welds.</b> The result obtained through these measurements can be used as a sound base for fatigue analysis and life span prediction of <b>rail</b> <b>welds...</b>|$|R

British practice sometimes uses a sliding joint of some sort at the end of long runs of continuously welded rail, to allow some movement, although by using a heavy concrete sleeper and an extra amount of ballast at the sleeper ends, the track, which will be prestressed according to the ambient temperature at the time of its installation, will develop compressive stress in hot ambient temperature, or tensile stress in cold ambient temperature, its strong attachment to the heavy sleepers preventing buckling or other deformation. Current practice is to use welded rails throughout on high speed lines, and expansion joints are kept to a minimum, often only to protect junctions and crossings from excessive stress. American practice appears to be very similar, a straightforward physical restraint of the rail. The rail is prestressed, or considered [...] "stress neutral" [...] at some particular ambient temperature. This [...] "neutral" [...] temperature will vary according to local climate conditions, taking into account lowest winter and warmest summer temperatures. The rail is physically secured to the ties or sleepers with rail anchors, or anti-creepers. If the track ballast is good and clean and the ties are in good condition, and the track geometry is good, then the welded rail will withstand ambient temperature swings normal to the region.|$|E

40|$|A rail is an {{important}} and the most heavily laden element in the railway superstructure, because it functions as both the running surface used for vehicle guidance and the beam directly transmitting the load of the vehicles to the ballast bed and the railway substructure. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the characteristics of rails and provides a theoretical background relating to rail stresses resulting from traffic load, temperature change and production procedures. When rail vehicles move, enormous contact stresses are produced in the contact zone between the wheel and the rail, which often causes damage to the running surface. Curves with smaller diameters cause particular wear of the rails because of the strongest dynamic effects of the vehicle on the rail. The thesis thus presents the most common surface defects, defines rail wear and outlines currently available techniques of rail grinding and lubrication. In the last few decades, only continuous welded tracks have been consistently installed.

40|$|Short-wave {{irregularities}} in the wheel-rail interface {{are at the}} basis of track and vehicle damage and deterioration. On the short term, they result into high dynamic train-track interaction forces and a high energy input into the system that must be dissipated in the different system components or "levels", leading on its turn to progressive deterioration on the long term. Furthermore, the short-wave defects grow into longer defects in the track geometry, {{due to the fact}} that the train is a travelling multi-body mass-spring system. The lifetime of the track and its components can be extended by adjusting the "path" of the dissipated power spectrum through the system and adjusting component and system properties with respect to their hysteretic behaviour. Instead of life-time extension, such measures may also aim at an extension of maintenance intervals, which is important to optimise the availability of e. g. high-speed lines. The present study investigates two particular types of short defects in detail: <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> and wheel flats. In longitudinal direction and on a global scale, the contact between a rolling wheel and a rail can be distinguished into continuous single-point contact and transient double-point contact. The contact type that occurs depends on the actual geometry of the wheel-rail interface in the running direction. The first contact type leads to a dynamic amplification of the static axle load, whereas the second leads to wheel-rail impact. Especially the latter contact type is detrimental to the rail system and should be prevented as much as possible or detected at an early stage. The introduction of <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> instead of the traditionally bolted connections reduced the dynamic forces at rail joints globally with a factor three. However, welds remain potential damage initiators due to the local geometrical and metallurgical discontinuity. Investigations show an approximately linear relationship between the extreme value of the dynamic wheel-rail contact force at a weld, the maximum absolute rail inclination and the train speed. The geometry of <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> is traditionally assessed with the principle of vertical tolerances. A new assessment method for <b>rail</b> <b>welds</b> is proposed, with norm values for the allowable inclination depending on the line section train speed. This method is based on a relatively strong correlation between discretised maximum rail geometry inclinations (first derivatives) and extreme dynamic wheel-rail contact forces, relative to the poor correlation between tolerances and extreme forces. The method aims at a reduction and uniformisation of dynamic contact forces at <b>rail</b> <b>welds,</b> in order to avoid deterioration. Wheel flats are commonly assessed on the basis of their length and/or depth, or automatically detected by wheel impact load detectors in the track. This study has shown that the minimum circumferential wheel tread curvature is the critical parameter that governs the dynamic wheel-rail interaction in the presence of wheel flats. It determines which contact type occurs for a given flat geometry: continuous single-point contact, in the subcritical speed regime, or transient double-point contact, in the transcritical speed regime. It furthermore determines the magnitude of the contact force in the subcritical regime. Both speed regimes are shown to exhibit essentially different features with respect to the dynamic wheel-rail interaction: the track stiffness governs the interaction for low train speeds and long flats, whereas for high speeds and/or short flats the inertial properties of the wheel and the rail govern the interaction. The force-speed relationship is non-linear in the first regime, whereas linearity is a good approximation in the second regime. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Within railway {{engineering}} practice continuous rails {{is created by}} welding lengths of rail. Conventional <b>rail</b> <b>welding</b> processes include aluminothermic/thermite welding and flash-butt welding. Both welding processes result in a large width of the weld and heat affected zone (HAZ). The weld and HAZ show irregularities along the rail surface including hardness variations, microstructural disturbances and/or inclusions. This makes welds in particular susceptible to damage. Laser welding of rails is proposed to create welds with a smaller weld and HAZ width. This thesis investigates the feasibility of laser welding for rails. The evolution of microstructures in R 260 Mn rail steel has been studied using x-ray fluorescence, dilatometry, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and hardness measurements. From the data obtained from these experiments and thermal models that have been constructed, an appropriate set of welding conditions was determined and used for laser welding. The welding conditions considered are laser power, welding speed and pre-heating temperature. The main focus was put on welding speed and pre-heating. Preliminary welds consisted of a mainly martensitic and thus unacceptable microstructure. By selecting the welding conditions accordingly, the cooling rate could be decreased to form a pearlitic microstructure instead. Especially pre-heating {{was found to be}} a valuable method to reduce cooling rate and achieve an acceptable weld in terms of microstructure. The welded samples did contain welding defects like solidication cracking and porosity. The amount of welding defects is observed to decrease for higher welding speeds. It can be concluded that laser welding can be used to achieve an acceptable weld in terms of microstructure, especially when a pre-heating is applied to the rails. Further optimisation of the welding conditions may resolve welding defects...|$|E
40|$|Among {{different}} <b>rail</b> <b>welding</b> methods Aluminothermic welding (ATW) is {{the oldest}} and simplest procedure widely used for re-railing and replacement of defective rails. Since ATW is a cast welding process in which several aspects are operator-dependent it suffers from the variability of the produced weld quality, presence of casting defects and inconsistencies in the microstructure and mechanical properties. Previous observations have shown that field-welded ATWs have been major sources of fatigue and overload failures in Australian heavy haul railway systems. The most common failure modes are categorized into straight breaks (transverse fissure) and horizontal split webs (HSW). Straight breaks initiate from stress concentration sites {{at the edge of}} the weld collar, in the foot, lower web and underhead regions, and propagate in vertical direction under Mode I loading. HSW failures involve the development of a horizontal fatigue crack which initiates from a surface or near-surface gross defect in the weld collar, generally in the mid- or upper-web region. In this study analysis of fatigue crack initiation is performed {{at the edge of the}} weld collar of an aluminothermic weld, in order to examine the formation of straight break under high axle load conditions. The fatigue assessment is accomplished using a thermo-structural finite element simulation in ANSYS package followed by a shear based multi-axial fatigue critical plane criterion implemented in a MATLAB computer code. The influence of several parameters including wheel-rail contact patch eccentricity, contact tractions, residual stress distribution, seasonal temperature variation and track support condition is investigated. The analysis identifies the underhead region of a defect-free weld as the most critical location which is subject to severe fatigue damage under harsh curving and hunting behaviours...|$|E
