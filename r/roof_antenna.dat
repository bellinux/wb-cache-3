40|$|Due to the vastly {{increasing}} use {{of wireless}} services in the car, such as WiFi, Car 2 Car and LTE, the requirements on bandwidth and radiation pattern of the <b>roof</b> <b>antenna</b> systems become more challenging.

The applicability of the design concept is not limited to multi-band roof antennas, it can also be used for a general wideband antenna design. For illustration of this concept, a multi-band <b>roof</b> <b>antenna</b> with a bandwidth of 780 MHz to 5. 9 GHz and a near circular radiation pattern with an average gain of G = 3 dBi (at 5. 9 GHz) on the horizontal plane is designed.

40|$|Shadowing {{from other}} {{vehicles}} can degrade {{the performance of}} vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems significantly.

In this paper we analyze the distance dependent path loss and the additional shadowing loss due to a truck through dynamic measurements.

30|$|The bill of {{resources}}-related service drivers {{refer to}} the set of resources that are required per service. The free Wi-Fi service and the crew communication service share usage of the same on-board and wayside resources but the crew communication service uses dedicated crew mobile devices. The video-on-demand service shares usage of the on-board distribution network and the wayside resources with the other services and uses a dedicated video-on-demand server on-board the train and a dedicated content creation server at the wayside. The video-on-demand server and the content creation server {{need to be able}} to store 470 GB. We assume that all content is updated once per year. As such, 470 GB has to be transferred per train over Wi-Fi for the video-on-demand service. The connection to the wayside uses an on <b>roof</b> <b>antenna</b> system consisting of the antenna itself, a signal splitter and radios that receive and transmit the signal. Coaxial cables interconnect the <b>roof</b> <b>antenna</b> system with the on-board equipment. The on-board network equipment consists of an on-board gateway server which will direct the traffic from the offered services to the right destination. A Wi-Fi distribution system is deployed to bring the service to the customer. The Wi-Fi distribution system consists of WAPs attached to the ceiling of the carriages that are connected via Category 5 e UTP cables to the on-board servers and access routers. Switches are used to interconnect all network elements efficiently. The passenger services are offered via their own devices (e.g. laptop, smartphone or tablet), the crew communication service is offered on mobile devices that are included in the service offering. On-board the train, a video-on-demand server is deployed. For the train-to-wayside connection, multiple technologies and/or network operators can be used. For the case considered, the existing cellular infrastructure and Wi-Fi access points of a single network operator are used to transmit and receive data signals. For this case, this combination of technologies is adequate, but for other areas, the offered bandwidth may not be sufficient and a satellite connection or the deployment of a dedicated Wi-Fi/WiMAX network can be considered. At the wayside, a manned network operations center has to be set up to provide support for network maintenance, upgrades and failures. Several servers are required to provide the services. A wayside gateway server which is complementary to the on-board gateway server directs the traffic to the right destination. A server is required for the management of the services and a content creation server is used to update the video content.|$|E
