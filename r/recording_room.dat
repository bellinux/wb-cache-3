They are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E
5|$|Nick calls Norah, {{apologizing for}} leaving, and she agrees {{to meet him}} again. Deciding to go somewhere where no one they know will find them, they arrive at Electric Lady Studios, a music studio owned by Norah's father. Once there, Norah gets Nick to play {{something}} {{he wrote in the}} studio, but then joins him in the <b>recording</b> <b>room.</b> Norah gets a text message from Caroline telling her where she found Where's Fluffy? playing. When they arrive at the show, they meet Tris, who cannot understand why Nick will not take her back, and Tal, who wants the same answer from Norah. Tal starts a fight with Nick, but Thom and Dev's friend, Lethario (Jonathan B. Wright), steps in and headbutts Tal. Nick and Norah share a smile and leave together. At Pennsylvania Station, Nick admits that he does not care about missing the concert, and they kiss on the escalator as the sun rises over New York City.|$|E
500|$|On September 5, 1907, Paoli [...] held {{a private}} recital for Pope Pius X at the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. That same {{year he was}} named as a [...] "Singer of the Royal Court" [...] by William II of Germany. Paoli {{was also the first}} operatic artist to record an entire opera when he participated in a {{performance}} of Pagliacci by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in [...] Milan, Italy. He was selected in 1907, as the First Tenor in the main character by a team of engineers and musicians which included Leoncavallo. The recording was arranged in the following manner; the musicians were placed {{at the end of the}} <b>recording</b> <b>room</b> and the back up singers in a semi-arc in front of the gramophone while Paoli stood alone [...] away from the gramophone.|$|E

500|$|In mid-2006, Bloc Party {{travelled}} to Lee's Grouse Lodge Studios in Westmeath, Ireland, {{to record}} A Weekend in the City. The band members initially worked by experimenting with their respective instruments and sound check arrangements. Moakes additionally focused on using {{different types of}} synthesiser. All parties soon moved to the main <b>recording</b> <b>room,</b> a large area with [...] "a lot of natural ambience" [...] according to sound engineer Tom McFall. A makeshift booth was built {{around the back of}} the drum kit to reduce any sonic interference, while a roof was sometimes used over drummer Matt Tong to isolate a pure sound. Different types of microphones were used for each component of the drum kit. The miking scheme was crucial to prepare the drum tracks for the looping and processing Lee planned using production program Logic.|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the <b>recording</b> <b>room</b> and told Powell [...] "You have to go out there, and you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|In February 1991, U2 {{moved the}} album's {{recording}} sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, renting {{the house for}} ₤10,000 per month. The band nicknamed the house [...] "Dog Town" [...] for the [...] "tackiness" [...] of its exterior dog kennels, and the location was credited as such in the album notes. Lanois' strategy to record in houses, mansions, or castles was something he believed brought atmosphere to the recordings. Dublin audio services company Big Bear Sound installed a recording studio in the house, with the <b>recording</b> <b>room</b> in a converted garage diagonally beneath the control room. Video cameras and TV monitors were used to monitor and communicate between the spaces. With Elsinore located {{within walking distance of}} Bono's and the Edge's homes, the sessions there were more relaxed and productive. The band struggled with one particular song—later released as the B-side [...] "Lady With the Spinning Head"—but three separate tracks, [...] "The Fly", [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station", were derived from it. During the writing of [...] "The Fly", Bono created a persona based on an oversized pair of black sunglasses that he wore to lighten the mood in the studio. The character, also named [...] "The Fly", evolved into a leather-clad egomaniac meant to parody rock stardom. Bono assumed this alter ego for the band's subsequent public appearances and live performances on the Zoo TV Tour.|$|E

500|$|Powderfinger's Vulture Street was {{released}} on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No.1 in Australia; while in New Zealand it reached No.17. Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for {{the location of the}} band's first <b>recording</b> <b>room</b> in West End, Brisbane. The Sydney Morning Heralds music critic Bernard Zuel approved of [...] "a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album" [...] with [...] "a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect"; he felt it had Haug and Middleton [...] "dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut" [...] album. Simon Evans of musicOMH described the group as having [...] "opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs". Middleton described the band's aim was to [...] "get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was Bowie, Zeppelin, Kiss ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s. We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record. It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and recorded to tape, of course. It's fairly organic in that sense". Vulture Street won four ARIA Awards in 2003: [...] "Album of the Year", [...] "Best Group", [...] "Best Rock Album" [...] and [...] "Best Cover Art" [...] (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design). Singles issued from the album are: [...] "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind", [...] "Since You've Been Gone", [...] "Love Your Way", and [...] "Sunsets". Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and 2004.|$|E

Drop the cable!", which was looped into the song afterwards; and Abbey Road employees John Skinner and Terry Condon twirled chains in a tin bath to create water sounds. After the line, [...] "and the band begins to play", Emerick found a recording of a brass band and changed it slightly so it could not be identified, although it is thought to be a recording of Georges Krier and Charles Helmer's composition, [...] "Le Rêve Passe" [...] (1906). The original recording had a spoken intro by Starr, but the idea was abandoned on 3 June.|$|E
