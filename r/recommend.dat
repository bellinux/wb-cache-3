For persistent erythematous nipple or atypical eczema lesions, a nipple biopsy is <b>recommended</b> (Grade C). For distortion and asymmetry, a vacuum core-needle biopsy is <b>recommended</b> due to the risk of underestimation by simple core-needle biopsy (Grade C). For BI-RADS category 4 - 5 microcalcifications without any ultrasound signal, a minimum 11 -G vacuum core-needle biopsy is <b>recommended</b> (Grade B).

Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines <b>recommend</b> DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines <b>recommend</b> DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement.
