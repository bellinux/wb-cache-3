40|$|This {{paper is}} part of my {{doctoral}} thesis in which I studied the role translation plays in the migration of literary and cultural theories across culture and power differentials (Susam-Sarajeva 2002). The two cases examined in the thesis, namely the importation of structuralism and semiotics into Turkey, and of French feminism into Anglo-America, share many common features. The present paper, however, focuses on the fundamental {{differences between the two}} cases, since these differences are crucial in understanding translation’s formative role in the travels of theoretical texts towards diverse destinations and for varying audiences. All resemblances aside, the reception of French feminism in Anglo-America and of structuralism and semiotics in Turkey cannot be too similar; not only because the works, authors, translators, commissioners, publishers, and readers involved are not alike, but also because “the symmetries and asymmetries of linguistic and geopolitical power”, and “the historical-cultural relationships ” between French and Anglo-American systems on the one hand, and French and Turkish systems on the other, are “vastly different ” (cf. Gupta 1998 : 182). In each <b>receiving</b> <b>subsystem</b> – i. e. Turkish literary critical system and Anglo-American academic feminist critical system (as differentiated from the non-academic feminist movements in Anglo-America) – the attitudes towards imported discursive elements are thus determined by the power differentials between the languages and cultures at large. Still, apart from the prevailing power differentials, the individuals and institutions involved as mediators or opponents, who respond to the translated material by promoting, using, rejecting, or criticising it, also have a say in determining the stand taken towards importation. Their attitudes do not always coincide with those found in the receiving system’s literary, cultural and political spheres in general, since these individuals have their own interests and agendas partially independent of the dominant attitudes. Therefore, as we shall see below, different attitudes can be found side by side within the same system at the same time, and are reflected in the use of certain tropes in relation to translation...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a game theoretic framework to analyze a cellular-WLAN heterogeneous network from a virtual multiple-input multiple-output (VMIMO) perspective. Namely, we restrict to the uplink case and consider a non-cooperative game where each user seeks {{to meet some}} quality of service (QoS). Moreover, mobile users are allowed to re-inject, through their WLAN interfaces, {{a part of their}} throughput in the induced game. Thus, the interaction among users defines a distributed VMIMO with a possibly throughput exchange. This mechanism will help all users to meet their respective QoS expressed by the perceived average throughput. The average throughput is considered to be the utility function used in this framework. Now, each mobile user experiences a certain throughput composed of two parts: (1) the throughput <b>received</b> from cellular <b>subsystem</b> and (2) the throughput <b>received</b> from WLAN <b>subsystem.</b> Naturally, we use the concept of satisfaction equilibrium to predict the behavior of the network. Indeed, we provided a sufficient condition for the existence of such an equilibrium. Next, we prove the uniqueness of the equilibrium and compute it explicitly. Afterward, we propose a fully distributed algorithm inspired from the well-known Banach-Picard learning algorithm. Our scheme has many good features facilitating its implementation and usability. Indeed, it accurately converges to the equilibrium (if exists), it is very fast, and it requires no external information. Simulation results validate the algorithm and show its robustness and illustrate numerically the proposed learning scheme for quality-of-service management in such a heterogeneous network.|$|R

50|$|To solve a {{noise and}} {{vibration}} problem with SEA, the system is partitioned {{into a number of}} components (such as plates, shells, beams and acoustic cavities) that are coupled together at various junctions. Each component can support a number of different propagating wavetypes (for example,the bending, longitudinal and shear wavefields in a thin isotropic plate). From an SEA point of view, the reverberant field of each wavefield represents an orthogonal store of energy and so is represented as a separate energy degree of freedom in the SEA equations. The energy storage capacity of each reverberant field is described by a parameter termed the 'modal density', which depends on the average speed with which waves propagate energy through the subsystem (the average group velocity), and the overall dimension of the subsystem. The transmission of energy between different wavefields at a given type of junction is described by parameters termed 'coupling loss factors'. Each coupling loss factor describes the input power to the direct field of a given <b>receiving</b> <b>subsystem</b> per unit energy in the reverberant field of a particular source subsystem. The coupling loss factors are typically calculated by considering the way in which waves are scattered at different types of junctions (for example, point, line and area junctions). Strictly, SEA predicts the average response of a population or ensemble of systems and so the coupling loss factors and modal densities represent ensemble average quantities. To simplify the calculation of the coupling loss factors it is often assumed that there is significant scattering within each subsystem (when viewed across an ensemble) so that direct field transmission between multiple connections to the same subsystem is negligible and reverberant transmission dominates. In practical terms, this means that SEA is often best suited for problems in which each subsystem is large compared with a wavelength (or from a modal point of view, each subsystem contains several modes in a given frequency band of interest). The SEA equations contain {{a relatively small number of}} degrees of freedom and so can be easily inverted to find the reverberant energy in each subsystem due to a given set of external input powers. The (ensemble average) sound pressure levels and vibration velocities within each subsystem can then be obtained by superimposing the direct and reverberant fields within each subsystem.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} models {{based on}} Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) to predict bending wave vibration in heavyweight buildings from structure-borne sound {{sources such as}} machinery. These sources tend to inject most power in the low- and mid-frequency ranges where the walls and floors have low mode counts and low modal overlap for which calculated Coupling Loss Factors (CLFs) from semi-infinite plate theory can be in error. For machinery {{it is necessary to}} predict vibration on walls/floors that are remote from the source room. In this situation, propagation across successive structural junctions causes spatial filtering of the wave field and the assumption of a diffuse field in each plate subsystem breaks down. The predictive approach described in the European Standard EN 12354 uses SEA path analysis which assumes that transmission is dominated by first-order paths. However the feasibility of extending the concept of path analysis to walls and floors of rooms that are distant from the source room(i. e. not adjacent) is unknown. These issues are addressed in the thesis. The feasibility of SEA path analysis was assessed by quantifying the total contribution to receiver subsystem energy from paths containing specified numbers of CLFs. For <b>receiving</b> <b>subsystems</b> which are attached directly to the source subsystem, the EN 12354 approach was found to underestimate the energy levels. For rooms remote from the source room, path analysis was found to significantly underestimate the vibration of the walls/floors which form the receiver room. Alternative approaches to improve predictions in large heavyweight buildings were assessed through comparison with Monte-Carlo Finite Element Method (MCFEM) models which were validated on a small heavyweight building. Matrix SEA was used with CLFs calculated for L-, T- and X-junctions using analytical models for rectangular plates to try and incorporate modal features. For isolated junctions, there was good agreement with MCFEM but in large buildings. However, it was unable to predict the peaks and troughs in the vibration response to one-third octave band accuracy although it can estimate the envelope response for plates that are directly connected to the source plate. In general, matrix SEA using finite plate theory CLFs does not improve the prediction in one-third octave bands when the statistical mode count is less than unity. Ray tracing was therefore investigated which showed that the angular distribution of power incident on the plate edges differed significantly from a diffuse field. Computationally efficient ray tracing was then developed for inclusion in Advanced SEA (ASEA) models to account for indirect coupling between plate subsystems. ASEA gave significant improvements over matrix SEA when there were large numbers of structural junctions between the source and receiving plates...|$|R
