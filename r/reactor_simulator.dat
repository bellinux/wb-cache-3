40|$|Component {{level testing}} of power {{conversion}} units proposed {{for use in}} fission surface power systems has typically been done using relatively simple electric heaters for thermal input. These heaters do not adequately represent the geometry or response of proposed reactors. As testing of fission surface power systems transitions from the component level to the system level it becomes necessary to more accurately replicate these reactors using reactor simulators. The Direct Drive Gas-Brayton Power Conversion Unit test activity at the NASA Glenn Research Center integrates a <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator</b> with an existing Brayton test rig. The response of the <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator</b> {{to a change in}} Brayton shaft speed is shown as well as the response of the Brayton to an insertion of reactivity, corresponding to a drum reconfiguration.

40|$|A {{closed-loop}} brayton cycle, {{powered by}} a fission reactor, offers an attractive option for generating both planetary and in-space electric power. Non-nuclear testing {{of this type of}} system provides the opportunity to safely work out integration and system control challenges for a modest investment. Recognizing this potential, a team at Marshall Space Flight Center has evaluated the viability of integrating and testing an existing gas-cooled <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator</b> and a modified commercially available, off-the-shelf, brayton turbine-generator. Since these two systems were developed independently of one another, this evaluation had to determine if they could operate together at acceptable power levels, temperatures, and pressures. Thermal, fluid, and structural analyses show that this combined system can operate at acceptable power levels and temperatures. In addition, pressure drops across the <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator,</b> although higher than desired, are also viewed as acceptable. Three potential working fluids for the system were evaluated: N 2, He/Ar, and He/Xe. Other potential issues, such as electrical breakdown in the generator and the operation of the brayton foil bearings using various gas mixtures, were also investigated...|$|E

40|$|Power is a {{critical}} consideration in planning exploration of the surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and places beyond. Nuclear power is an important option, especially for locations {{in the solar system}} where sunlight is limited or environmental conditions are challenging (e. g., extreme cold, dust storms). NASA and the Department of Energy are maintaining the option for fission surface power for the Moon and Mars by developing and demonstrating technology for a fission surface power system. The Fission Surface Power Systems project has focused on subscale component and subsystem demonstrations to address the feasibility of a low-risk, low-cost approach to space nuclear power for surface missions. Laboratory demonstrations of the liquid metal pump, reactor control drum drive, power conversion, heat rejection, and power management and distribution technologies have validated that the fundamental characteristics and performance of these components and subsystems are consistent with a Fission Surface Power preliminary reference concept. In addition, subscale versions of a non-nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator,</b> using electric resistance heating in place of the reactor fuel, have been built and operated with liquid metal sodium-potassium and helium/xenon gas heat transfer loops, demonstrating the viability of establishing system-level performance and characteristics of fission surface power technologies without requiring a nuclear reactor. While some component and subsystem testing will continue through 2011 and beyond, the results to date provide sufficient confidence to proceed with system level technology readiness demonstration. To demonstrate the system level readiness of fission surface power in an operationally relevant environment (the primary goal of the Fission Surface Power Systems project), a full scale, 1 / 4 power Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU) is under development. The TDU will consist of a non-nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator,</b> a sodium-potassium heat transfer loop, a power conversion unit with electrical controls, and a heat rejection system with a multi-panel radiator assembly. Testing is planned at the Glenn Research Center Vacuum Facility 6 starting in 2012, with vacuum and liquid-nitrogen cold walls to provide simulation of operationally relevant environments. A nominal two-year test campaign is planned including a Phase 1 <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator</b> and power conversion test followed by a Phase 2 integrated system test with radiator panel heat rejection. The testing is expected to demonstrate the readiness and availability of fission surface power as a viable power system option for NASA's exploration needs.

A key component in these simulated reactors is the thermal simulator, designed to closely mimic the form and function of a nuclear fuel pin using electric heating. Continuing effort has been made to design simple, robust, inexpensive thermal simulators that closely match the steady-state and transient performance of a nuclear fuel pin. A series of these simulators have been designed, developed, fabricated and tested individually and in a number of simulated reactor systems at the EFF-TF. The purpose of the thermal simulators developed under the Fission Surface Power (FSP) task is to ensure that non-nuclear testing can be performed at sufficiently high fidelity to allow a cost-effective qualification and acceptance strategy to be used. Prototype thermal simulator design is founded on the baseline Fission Surface Power reactor design. Recent efforts have been focused on the design, fabrication and test of a prototype thermal simulator appropriate for use in the Technology Demonstration Unit (TDU). While designing the thermal simulators described in this paper, effort were made to improve the axial power profile matching of the thermal simulators. Simultaneously, a search was conducted for graphite materials with higher resistivities than had been employed in the past. The combination of these two efforts resulted in the creation of thermal simulators with power capacities of 2300 - 3300 W per unit.

The development of an analysis code and the natural circulation behaviors of a <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator</b> under rolling motion are described in this paper.

In the natural circulation under a rolling motion, the flow rate oscillations in the hot legs were controlled by the tangential force; however, the mass flow rate oscillations in the total natural circulation and the heating channels were a result of the combined action of the change of inclination angle, flow resistance, and the extra force arising from the rolling motion.

40|$|It is {{well known}} in reactor {{dynamics}} that the so-called open-loop or zero-power reactor transfer function, which assumes a point-kinetic behavior of the system, has a simple analytical expression in the frequency domain. This expression depends on the effective fraction of delayed neutrons, the decay constant of the precursors of delayed neutrons, and the neutron mean generation time. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to recover the point-kinetic component of the fluctuations in neutron flux induced by perturbations of macroscopic cross-sections. These fluctuations can be estimated by any open-loop <b>reactor</b> <b>simulator</b> working in the frequency domain, and the proposed method could thus be used as a means to validate the simulator against the theoretical expression of the transfer function.

In this paper, the methodology is also demonstrated using the CORE SIM tool in two test situations: a localized absorber of variable strength, and a travelling perturbation. In both cases, the simulator is able to reproduce the expected frequency-dependence of the reactor transfer function, despite the fact that the reactor response significantly deviates from point-kinetic for localized perturbations at high frequencies. It has nevertheless to be pointed out that the proposed method only works if the applied perturbation has a non-zero reactivity effect...|$|E
