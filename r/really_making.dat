500|$|Italian {{composer}} Domenico Alaleona's only opera, premiering in 1920, {{was entitled}} Mirra. The libretto {{drew on the}} legend of Myrrha while the music was inspired by Claude Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande (1902) as well as Richard Strauss' Elektra (1909). Suffering from being monotonic, the final showdown between father and daughter, the critics commented, was the only part <b>really</b> <b>making</b> an impact. Mirra remains Alaleona's most ambitious composition and though the music tended to be [...] "eclectic and uneven", it showed [...] "technical enterprise".|$|E
500|$|In 1889 Myers {{purchased}} the Gates Mansion Victorian style house with five acres of property that was located near Frankfort, New York, previously owned by Fred Gates of the Diamond Match Company. Here Myers {{and his wife}} went {{into the business of}} manufacturing passenger balloons and specialty purpose gas balloons, many for the US government. The balloons that had just been assembled were partially inflated outdoors to test if they held the hydrogen gas properly. Because of the large balloons half inflated and laid out on the property grounds, it gave the impression they were growing large mushrooms or some unusual new farm crop. In time some people realized they were <b>really</b> <b>making</b> balloons and it became known as the Frankfort [...] "balloon farm." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the album}} was not {{released}} outside of Sweden, it attracted little attention from overseas music critics. However, John Lucas did review the album on behalf of AllMusic, writing that [...] "there are no truly weak moments" [...] and praised it for being [...] "much more organic and mature" [...] than Robyn Is Here. On the other hand, he felt it lacked [...] "instant" [...] and [...] "irresistible" [...] hooks and criticised the [...] "uniformity of sound that can make some songs drift in and out without <b>really</b> <b>making</b> any impression". He concluded, [...] "Not a commercial blockbuster then, nor a perfect listen, but this album does mark an important step forward for Robyn as an artist." [...] A negative opinion came from music critic Robert Christgau, who considered My Truth [...] "as strained as you might fear", and used it {{as an example of}} Robyn's [...] "awkward stage that hits teenpop stars like clockwork".|$|E

500|$|However, {{the firm}} did not release the poll results before the election. The {{day after the}} election, when Giron had been {{recalled}} by 12 points, they released the poll and company director Tom Jensen explained why they had not initially done so, citing numerous unusual results. These included the district supporting her recall by such a wide margin, despite having been carried by 20 points by Democratic President Barack Obama in the 2012 election; and voters saying they supported universal background checks by 68% to 27% and being split 47% to 47% on limiting high-capacity ammunition magazines to 15 bullets. Jensen opined that [...] "if voters were <b>really</b> <b>making</b> their recall votes based on those two laws, that doesn't point to recalling Giron by a 12 point margin" [...] and that the NRA had done a [...] "good job of turning the election more broadly into 'do you support gun rights or are you opposed to them.'" [...] Their decision not to release the poll before the election caused significant controversy, with some statisticians and journalists criticising them and others supporting them.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Thomas {{explained}} he {{had been}} a fan of the soundtrack to the musical Jesus Christ Superstar and sought to bring the story to comic books in a superhero context: [...] "Yes, I had some trepidation about the Christ parallels, but I hoped there would be little outcry if I handled it tastefully, since I was not <b>really</b> <b>making</b> any serious statement on religion... at least not overtly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the UK's Metal Hammer magazine in May 2008, Heafy said that their new album was to have [...] "more thrash influences, more screaming." [...] He told Revolver magazine, [...] "For the first time, we can't look at our songs and say who the riffs sound like. We're <b>really</b> <b>making</b> our own stuff and our own kind of music and art form, and that's exciting." [...] In September 2008, Trivium released their fourth full-length album, Shogun. The album sold 24,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release, debuting at #23 on the Billboard 200 chart as well as #1 in the UK Rock Album Charts.|$|E

5000|$|Level II is {{an album}} by Eru, a singer from South Korea. The singles [...] "까만안경" [...] (Black Glasses) and [...] "흰눈" [...] (White Snow) {{performed}} <b>really</b> well, <b>making</b> this album {{more successful than}} his first.

6000|$|Mrs. Touchett excused it perhaps, {{but was not}} so much {{reassured}} as {{to withhold}} from Madame Merle the expression of her fears.

6000|$|Mr. Traffick valued £120,000 very highly, as do most men, {{and would}} have done much to keep it; but he {{believed}} that the best way of making sure of it would be by showing himself to be the master.

50|$|Audit {{studies have}} been criticized because the {{auditors}} may look different to employers, and this may result in the appearance of discrimination when employers were <b>really</b> just <b>making</b> decisions based on appearance.

60|$|They {{clung to}} the tree until they found the water flowing the right way, when they let go and {{permitted}} the raft to resume its voyage.

60|$|However, he and Aurelia were {{permitted}} to improve that half hour to the utmost in their own way, while the Major and Betty were reading a long and characteristic letter from Mrs. Arden, inquiring certainly for her sister's fate, but showing far more solicitude in proving that she (Harriet Arden) had acted a wise, prudent, and sisterly part, {{and that it was}} most unreasonable and cruel to treat her as accountable for her sister's disappearance. It was <b>really</b> <b>making</b> her quite ill, and Mr. Arden was like a man--so disagreeable about it.|$|E
60|$|Some {{time during}} the forenoon, {{approaching}} the mountains, we changed from the regular train to one composed of little canvas-sheltered cars that skimmed along within a foot of the ground {{and seemed to be}} going fifty miles an hour when they were <b>really</b> <b>making</b> about twenty. Each car had seating capacity for half-a-dozen persons; and when the curtains were up one was substantially out of doors, and could see everywhere, and get all the breeze, and be luxuriously comfortable.

60|$|Altogether, {{the visit}} {{was not very}} successful, and poor Dorothy almost felt that if she chose {{to remain in the}} Close she must lose her mother and sister, and that without <b>really</b> <b>making</b> a friend of her aunt. There had as yet been no quarrel,--nothing that had been plainly {{recognised}} as disagreeable; but there had not as yet come to be any sympathy, or assured signs of comfortable love. Miss Stanbury had declared more than once that it would do, but had not succeeded in showing in what the success consisted. When she was told that the two ladies were gone, she desired that Dorothy might be sent to her, and immediately began to make anxious inquiries.|$|E

Soubise with his Invasion of England, all the French are very busy; they have conquered Hessen from Duke Ferdinand, and promise themselves a glorious Campaign, after that Seizure of Frankfurt. Soubise, intent on his new Enterprise, is <b>really</b> <b>making</b> ardent preparations: at Vanues in the Morbihan, such rendezvousing and equipping;--especially at Havre, no end of flat-bottomed boats getting built; and much bluster and agitation among the weaker sorts in both Nations.
