Existem diversas técnicas propostas a realizar estabilização vertebral, entretanto, estudos em coluna tóraco-lombar não foram realizados para avaliar as propriedades biomecânicas de cada técnica. Baseado nisso, nossa pesquisa teve como objetivo fazer uma avaliação biomecânica comparando a força e rigidez promovidas por cinco diferentes técnicas de estabilização em coluna toracolombar (Pinos com Cimento Ósseo, Técnica Segmentar Modificada, Placa Bloqueada e <b>Clamp</b> <b>Rod</b> Internal Fixation utilizando parafusos monocorticais e bicorticais) frente às forças de compressão e flexão. Foram utilizadas 34 colunas tóraco-lombares de cães, divididas em cinco grupos. Para realização dos testes biomecânicos, foi utilizada a máquina de ensaios Kratos (modelo KE 3000 MP) e célula de carga de 100 kg. Para cada corpo de prova, três testes biomecânicos foram realizados, o controle, no segmento íntegro, após desarticulação de T 13 /L 1 e após realização de uma das técnicas de estabilização propostas. Os dados foram exportados para análise estatística para o programa Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) versão 18. 0. Os resultados permitiram concluir que, apesar de não haver diferença estatística significativa, a Placa Bloqueada foi a técnica que promoveu maior rigidez e estabilidade nas vértebras lesionadas, seguida do CRIF bicortical, técnica Segmentar Modificada e Pinos e Cimento Ósseo. Estatisticamente, a Placa Bloqueada e o CRIF com parafusos bicorticais apresentaram maior rigidez e estabilidade em T 13 /L 1 quando comparados com a técnica CRIF monocortical, que por sua vez, não alcançou rigidez necessária para adequada estabilização das vértebras. Spinal {{fractures}} and luxations {{resulting from}} trauma consist frequent disorder in clinical veterinary practice, being thoracolumbar spine {{the region that}} is the most commonly affected in canines, thus in many cases surgical treatment is necessary. There are several proposed techniques of implants to perform spinal stabilization; however, few studies of the thoracolumbar spine were carried out to evaluate the biomechanical properties of each technic. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to analyze biomechanical effects comparing the strength and the stiffness promoted by five different technics of stabilization in the thoracolumbar spine (pin with bone cement, modified segmental stabilization, locking plate and <b>clamp</b> <b>rod</b> internal fixation) under compression and bending forces. In the study, thirty four thoracolumbar dog spines were used, dividing the specimens in five groups. In order to perform the biomechanical tests, it was used a Kratos testing machine (model KE 3000 MP) and loading cell of 100 Kg. Each body of proof was submitted to three biomechanical tests, the control, in the segment intact, after disarticulation of the T 13 /L 1 and after the realization of one of the proposed technics. Data were exported to statistical analyses to the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18. 0.

40|$|The {{research}} project focuses the attention on masonry domes – elements as much {{emerging in the}} historical urban landscape as constructively complex – considered as “macro-elements” historically vulnerable to static and dynamic stresses. In continuity with previous studies carried out over past years by many co-proponents, the project aims at experimenting an integrated knowledge approach to the domes' interpretation by combining established methodologies with innovative strategies for the comprehension of invisible structures. Such an approach is related in an unitary vision to verticals parts, as foundations, pillars, drums, attics and lanterns, and to curved ones, as arches, vaults and pendentives, together with the pre-reinforcements placed during the construction phases or for later strengthening (iron hoops, tie <b>rods,</b> <b>clamps,</b> etc). These arguments deal with issues crucial {{for the study of}} domes: firstly, the overlapping of inner and outer surfaces – as roof claddings and fresco paintings – which hide constructive elements and do not enable their comprehension. In addition, it has to be considered the difficult inspection and, therefore, the common inaccessibility, due to big dimensions and conspicuous heights from the ground level. All these factors, together with the presence of decorated surfaces that strongly limit the traditional diagnosis, require new investigation strategies – at distance and by non-destructive methods – able to document the invisible both for emerging and underground parts. Once limited the field of investigation on the 15 th and 16 th centuries' Campania construction context, the project aims at developing an integrated model of knowledge where “humanistic” interpretation techniques and bottom-up/bottom-down surveys and materials' investigations could be complementary and able to give information useful for the restoration of masonry domes. This could be possible thanks to an interdisciplinary data combination, by integrating bibliographical, iconographic and archival documents, comparisons with historical treatises, instrumental surveys and diagnosis investigations together with innovative spatial interpretations, as well as through the collaboration of research and specialist educational centres. This aim, supported by the careful selection, cataloguing and open-access digitalization of the acquired data, will be applied to a demonstrative research case-study and will have a broader and complete result in the Atlas of Masonry Domes in Campania. The Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries, considered as a testing outcome on which can be prepared, in the near future, national and international projects, related both to the following centuries’ architectures in the same area, as well as to wider contexts through well calibrated comparative processes. The understanding of what is invisible to direct inspection, in turn, is a stimulating frontier to deepen in a multi-disciplinary form for the proposition of innovative dissemination ways for the comprehension of cultural heritage and able to add to the recognition of decorative and spatial values new communicative horizons related to the construction of complex “machines”. The transposition of the outcomes of the survey phase – i. e, engineering inventions of the past, preventive expedients, hidden systems, transformations’ traces – into the transfer of digital “accessible” data by ICT and mobile systems, other than increase the specialized knowing, can have repercussions on the improvement of the sharing and consequent spread of a greater cultural awareness towards the historical-constructive features, often sacrificed, of the historical buildings...|$|R

The electrophysiology, as well as measurements of the reagents' ability to traverse the ROS plasma membrane, was done on amphibian (Rona and Ambystoma) rods, and the biochemistry on bovine rods. The main SH-reagents used were N-ethyl-maleimide (NEM) and iodoacetamide (IAA). Both transiently increased rod current, {{but part of the}} large current could not be turned off by light. After a few minutes' exposure, NEM, but not IAA, caused a continuous decay of the rod's light sensitivity. In patch-clamp recordings from the ROS plasma membrane, the reagents increased conductivity both in the presence and absence of cGMP, consistent with the observation that the drug-induced current increase in intact rods involved both light-sensitive and light-insensitive components. In vitro, NEM was found to be a powerful inhibitor of cGMP hydrolysis, which can explain the gradual loss of light sensitivity in the rod and could initially contribute to the increased dark current via elevated cGMP levels.

To {{investigate}} {{the contributions of}} BisGMA:TEGDMA and filler content on polymerization stress, along with the influence of variables associated with stress development, namely, degree of conversion, reaction rate, shrinkage, elastic modulus and loss tangent {{for a series of}} experimental dental composites. Methods. Twenty formulations with BisGMA: TEGDMA ratios of 3 : 7, 4 : 6, 5 : 5, 6 : 4 and 7 : 3 and barium glass filler levels of 40, 50, 60 or 70 wt% were studied. Polymerization stress was determined in a tensilometer, inserting the composite between acrylic <b>rods</b> fixed to <b>clamps</b> of a universal test machine and dividing the maximum load recorded by the rods cross-sectional area. Conversion and reaction rate were determined by infra-red spectroscopy. Shrinkage was measured by mercury dilatometer. Modulus was obtained by three-point bending. Loss tangent was determined by dynamic nanoindentation. Regression analyses were performed to estimate the effect of organic and inorganic contents on each studied variable, while a stepwise forward regression identified significant variables for polymerization stress. Results. All variables showed dependence on inorganic concentration and monomeric content. The resin matrix showed a stronger influence on polymerization stress, conversion and reaction rate, whereas filler fraction showed a stronger influence on shrinkage, modulus and loss tangent. Shrinkage and conversion were significantly related to polymerization stress. Significance. Both the inorganic filler concentration and monomeric content affect polymerization stress, but the stronger influence of the resin matrix suggests that {{it may be possible to}} reduce stress by modifying resin composition without sacrificing filler content. The main challenge is to develop formulations with low shrinkage without sacrificing degree of conversion. (C) 2011 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Upgrades included redesigned connecting <b>rods,</b> upgraded aluminum <b>clamp</b> and swivel brackets, a new high RPM magneto, improved porting, an 8 Reed valve cage (as opposed to KE-7 and KF-7’s 4) and larger crankcase opening. Hurricane was also advertised at 10 hp*, way below the actual horsepower developed, Mercury noted this asterisk by stating that horsepower varies with rpm; really the Hurricane could deliver up to 18 hp. Shortly after the introduction of the Hurricane, Mercury came up with their first performance gear case with the capability of mating to a standard driveshaft housing of a KG-7 or similar green top engine of the time. This was named “Quicksilver” and promised an extra 20 to 30% increase in top speed. Essentially, it boasted a significantly slimmer pointed gear case that housed an integrated rubber rotex water pump and forward only 1:1 gears along with the necessary bearings. After a few months of use, Mercury found that the average race boat's transom would not elevate the standard driveshaft housing and quicksilver gear case high enough for peak performance. Rectifying this problem, Mercury developed the Quicksilver driveshaft housing. This new driveshaft housing was three inches shorter which in turn lowered the motor's center of gravity on the boat which helped turning ability, reduced the strain on the boat's transom and motor's clamp brackets, and decreased underwater drag while increasing top speed as less gearcase was below the boat. In addition the motor had a sort-of cut down lower anti-cavitation plate, protruding forward upper anti-cavitation plate (spray plate), a stronger rear-mounted steering bar design, and finally, an exhaust opening above the water surface that reduced exhaust back pressure while increasing noise levels when the boat was on plane. When the dealer installed the quicksilver driveshaft housing and gear case (packaged at $82.25) he had authorization to hand stamp a small [...] "Q" [...] behind the serial numbers on the tag and block. Some did, some did not - and so, the [...] "Stamped Q" [...] came to be. 1951 saw the first production race-ready outboard models; KG-4Q, KG7-Q, and KG-9Q. These motors were pulled off the production line at random, given the quicksilver gear case, driveshaft housing, and [...] "Q" [...] stamp behind the tag serial number and block serial number. These KG-7Qs worked fine on runabouts but were too long for hydroplanes - and the racers made this known to Mercury. So thus was born the 2" [...] shorter [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing in 1952. Right before Mercury released this [...] "H" [...] driveshaft housing, they still had several [...] "Q" [...] length driveshaft housings, so they introduced a factory KG-7Q which had a green silk screened Q behind the serial number on the tag and a factory stamped [...] "Q" [...] on the block. These motors are very rare; they fall into the serial range of 532404-532963.|$|R
