5|$|As senator, Ford has {{introduced}} many bills {{with only a}} small number becoming law, but has been more successful in contributing to compromise bills. After becoming senator, Ford attempted to have the Confederate flag removed from the South Carolina State House. It was the last state capitol to display a Confederate battle flag, and Ford had picketed the building in the 1960s as a symbol of discrimination. Following years of debate, the flag was moved to a nearby monument with the adoption of a compromise bill authored by Ford. He was responsible for the passage of a 1998 bill that paired Martin Luther King, Jr. Day with Confederate Memorial Day as paid holidays. Ford stated that he hoped the legislation would improve <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> <b>in</b> South Carolina.|$|E

She sold the items not long after the divorce. He remarried in 1984. In 1993, his third wife Marjorie was part of a group that met with MLB executives to discuss <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> <b>in</b> baseball after allegations of racial slurs surfaced against Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott. Banks married Liz Ellzey in 1997 and Hank Aaron served as his best man. In late 2008, Banks and Ellzey adopted an infant daughter.|$|E
5|$|Columbia's {{infrastructure}} {{was relatively}} {{untouched by the}} Civil War. Missouri, as a slave state, had Southern sympathies, but remained in the Union. The majority {{of the city was}} pro-Union, however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby Boonville and Centralia. After the Civil War, <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> <b>in</b> Columbia followed the Southern pattern; George Burke, a black man, was lynched in 1889.|$|E

5|$|During this time, {{social justice}} and <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> <b>in</b> Mobile worsened, however. The state passed a new {{constitution}} in 1901 that disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first racial segregation ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention. Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed. After this, Mobile's de facto segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed Jim Crow laws to maintain supremacy.|$|E
5|$|The Port Chicago {{disaster}} highlighted systemic racial {{inequality in}} the Navy. A {{year before the}} disaster, in mid-1943, the U.S. Navy had over 100,000 African Americans in service but not one black officer. In the months following the disaster, the Pittsburgh Courier, a newspaper with a large nationwide subscription primarily of African Americans, related the incident and the subsequent mutiny trial in their Double V campaign, a push for victory over not just the Axis powers but also over racial inequality at home. The mutiny trial was seen as underscoring the tense <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> <b>in</b> the armed forces at the time.|$|E

The part of Porgy was played by Reuben Wright. The collaboration {{of the two groups}} was evidence that <b>race</b> <b>relations</b> <b>in</b> Charleston had improved. In 1971 excerpts from the opera were presented by the same performers during the inauguration festivities for Governor John C. West.

25|$|Richard Nathaniel Wright (September 4, 1908â€“ November 28, 1960) was an American {{author of}} {{sometimes}} controversial novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction.

25|$|In 1816, a {{group of}} wealthy European-Americans, {{some of whom were}} abolitionists and others who were racial segregationists, founded the American Colonization Society with the express desire of {{returning}} African Americans who were in the United States to West Africa.

25|$|Featherston blames blacks, and the {{powerful}} families that control the country, largely via the Whig Party, for causing the Confederate States to lose the Great War.

Featherston is so sure that blacks are a threat to the Confederacy that, even as the United States begins to win the war, he continues committing resources to the genocide against them.|$|E
