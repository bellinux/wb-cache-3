In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.|$|E
5|$|Plants {{and animals}} include those {{generally}} common to Central Europe. Beeches, oaks, and other deciduous trees constitute {{one-third of the}} forests; conifers are increasing {{as a result of}} reforestation. Spruce and fir trees predominate in the upper mountains, while pine and larch are found in sandy soil. There are many species of ferns, flowers, fungi, and mosses. Wild animals include <b>roe</b> <b>deer,</b> wild boar, mouflon (a subspecies of wild sheep), fox, badger, hare, and small numbers of the Eurasian beaver. The blue cornflower was once a German national symbol.|$|E

Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, <b>roe</b> <b>deer</b> (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E
5|$|In Dalmatia, {{the golden}} jackal's diet {{consists}} of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change their diet to {{more readily available}} foods. In Serbia, their diet is primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent {{due to a lack}} of removal, and this may have led to the expansion of their population. In Hungary, 55% of their diet is composed of common voles and bank voles, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the golden jackal in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small <b>roe</b> <b>deer</b> and hares. In Israel, golden jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against golden jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.|$|E
5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, <b>roe</b> <b>deer</b> and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, fallow deer and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E
50|$|In {{the streams}} lives {{not only the}} brown trout but also the {{endangered}} white-clawed crayfish, observed in Lemme Valley.

5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, <b>roe</b> <b>deer,</b> and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest city}} park is Horský park (literally, Mountainous Park), in the Old Town. Bratislavský lesný park (Bratislava Forest Park) {{is located in}} the Little Carpathians and {{includes}} many locales popular among visitors, such as Železná studienka and Koliba. The Forest Park covers an area of , of which 96% is forested mostly with oak and mixed oak/hornbeam forest, and contains original flora and fauna such as European badgers, red foxes, wild boar and red and <b>roe</b> <b>deer.</b> On the right bank of the Danube, in the borough of Petržalka, is Janko Kráľ Park founded in 1774–76. A new city park is planned for Petržalka between the Malý Draždiak and Veľký Draždiak lakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. <b>Roe</b> <b>deer</b> (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, Burabay's forests host deers, mooses, wild boars, <b>roe</b> <b>deers,</b> squirrels, stoats, weasels, martens. Amongst the predators, {{wolves and}} lynx might be encountered. In the steppes and wooden steppes, foxes, corsac foxes, weasels and European and {{mountain}} hares might be met, {{as well as}} badgers in the forests.|$|R

Animals like foxes, boars, <b>roe</b> <b>deers,</b> owls, eagles and brown bears are common in the surroundings of the village and much appreciated by the nature lovers, who use to go there to see those animals.|$|R
5|$|Vikos–Aoös National Park {{preserves}} one of {{the richest}} mountain and forest ecosystems in terms of wildlife diversity in Greece. Numerous species of large mammals such as wolves, foxes, wild horses, and <b>roe</b> <b>deer</b> are found in the area year-round. Otters and wild cats live around the area of Tymfi, with the latter being quite rare. The Pindus range, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, is home to the endangered brown bear and lynx, and is also the southernmost point of their European habitat. One of the park's special attractions is the existence of the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), a rare species that lives at higher altitudes far from human activity, especially at the rocky cliffs of the gorges, for example in Megas Lakos, a secondary ravine of the Vikos Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a <b>roe</b> <b>deer</b> fawn born in {{a thicket}} to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also dangerous place as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, <b>roe</b> <b>deer,</b> fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E
5000|$|The garden holds 900 {{different}} species of trees and bushes {{from all over the}} world, on just about 5 ha.

5|$|Strandzha Nature Park has {{the richest}} {{vertebrate}} fauna among all protected areas in Bulgaria— 410 species, not counting 70 species of marine fishes. There are 66 breeding mammal species. Among {{the most common}} are the <b>roe</b> <b>deer,</b> red deer, wild boar, grey wolf, golden jackal, red fox, European badger, and beech marten. The park protects {{some of the largest}} and most important populations of European otter and wildcat in Europe. The European pine marten and marbled polecat are uncommon in Strandzha. There are 25 bat species present including Bechstein's bat and Kuhl's pipistrelle. 27 species of small mammals at the park include European ground squirrel, lesser mole-rat, Günther's vole, three dormouse species, and two other globally threatened species. The park is an important sanctuary of the Roach's mouse-tailed dormouse. There have been reports on the presence of Mediterranean monk seals in the rocks and caverns of Silistar.|$|E
5|$|Van Meegeren {{showed his}} first {{paintings}} publicly in The Hague, {{where they were}} exhibited from April to May 1917 at the Kunstzaal Pictura. In December 1919, he was accepted as a select member to the Haagse Kunstkring, an exclusive society of writers and painters who met weekly on the premises of the Ridderzaal. He painted the tame <b>roe</b> <b>deer</b> belonging to Princess Juliana in his studio at The Hague, opposite the Royal Palace Huis ten Bosch. He made many sketches and drawings of the deer, and painted Hertje (The fawn) in 1921, which became quite popular in the Netherlands. He undertook numerous journeys to Belgium, France, Italy, and England, and acquired {{a name for himself}} as a talented portraitist. He earned stately fees through commissions from English and American socialites who spent their winter vacations on the Côte d'Azur. His clients were impressed by his understanding of the 17th-century techniques of the Dutch masters. Throughout his life, van Meegeren signed his own paintings with his own signature.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the Wohnlager {{administrative}} and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named Seidel Straße after Unterscharführer Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads were lined with gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Sokołów Podlaski, and Kosów Lacki. There was a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence for the Jewish work commandos. SS-Untersturmführer Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, with two foxes, two peacocks and a <b>roe</b> <b>deer</b> (brought in 1943). Smaller rooms were built as laundry, tailors, and cobblers, and for woodworking and medical aid. Closest to the SS quarters were separate barracks for the Polish and Ukrainian serving, cleaning and kitchen women.|$|E
50|$|In the {{northern}} {{slope of the}} Cantabrian mountains, beech and oak groves of the Saja-Besaya Natural Park spread out; an important nature reserve abundant with <b>deers,</b> <b>roe</b> <b>deers</b> and golden eagles. The presence of Iberian wolves is not very rare, and brown bears have been sighted, thus considering this zone as an important nexus of communication between isolated populations of this plantigrade. There are also important colonies of griffon vultures. Other interesting species of animals that populate the area are: eagle owls, martens, badgers, stoats and desmans.|$|R
50|$|Mallard {{and great}} crested grebe are {{breeding}} in the lake, just like are occasionally common moorhen and Canada goose (introduced in Sweden in the 1930s). Marsh warbler and gray heron are often seen among the reed. Even though reed have been cleared to attract waders, as a locale for birs, the lake hasn't meat expectations much due to neglected attention of the canals and islands. There are three species of protected frogs in the lake: common frog, common toad, and smooth newt. The deers once abundant in the area have been superseded by <b>roe</b> <b>deers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cicogni {{is known}} for his folkloristic traditions, {{particularly}} about the beginning of the spring, celebrated with its own feast in the first days of May.

Forests of the Tomorri National Park are composed of diverse species of deciduous and coniferous trees and a great variety of flowers. The park's forests are abundant in species such as European beech, Bosnian pine, Turkish hazel, Linaria, Great yellow gentian, Autumn crocus, Greek whitebeam, European mistletoe, Centaury and many others. Numerous species of large mammals such as wolves, foxes, wild boars, <b>roe</b> <b>deers,</b> wild goats, rabbits, golden eagles, owles, and sparrowhawks are found in the area.|$|R
40|$|Last summer, a {{claim on}} the Italian mass-media was raised {{following}} {{the decision of the}} Piedmont region to authorize a selective hunting on 600 <b>roe</b> <b>deers.</b> Almost everyone participated in the debate, in most cases with emotional considerations, overwhelming the opinions of experts. Unfortunately, the only “absents” have been the representatives of foresters. On the contrary, foresters could have brought important arguments and data to contribute in the debate, considering the impact of deer on the forest environment. An integrated management of wildlife and forest resources is possible, but it is necessary to contribute with real arguments in a debate, in which foresters do have the knowledge, the capacities and the duty to raise their voice...|$|R
