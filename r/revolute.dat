5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} two axles, were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a <b>revolute</b> joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} B. grossa are adapted to a dry climate. The lower {{surfaces}} {{are protected by}} the strongly <b>revolute</b> shape of the leaf, the leaf margins curling around underneath almost to the mid-vein. The trichomes (leaf hairs) run along the mid-vein and the margins, further protecting the surface where the stomates are located, thus minimising water loss. Cladistic analysis suggests this species and its relatives in the series Abietinae developed long narrow leaves with inrolled margins as they invaded drier climates in Australia's southwest, having evolved from ancestors with broad leaves.|$|E
5|$|Auriscalpium vulgare {{usually has}} a single stem, but {{occasionally}} several stems arise from a thick common base. It attaches {{to the side of}} the cap and is cylindrical or slightly flattened with a bulbous base. Its surface is covered with hairy fibers (especially near the base), and its mature color is a dark chestnut brown. The cap is semicircular or kidney-shaped, flat on the lower surface and rounded on the top. The surface is at first much like the stem: covered with bristles and dark chestnut brown. However, it becomes smooth with maturity and can darken to the point of being almost black. The cap margin is usually buff to light brown–roughly the same color as the spines and lighter in color than the center. It becomes rolled inward (<b>revolute)</b> and often wavy in maturity. The spines on the underside of the cap are a few millimeters long and cylindrical down to their sharp tips. White to light brown when young, they later become covered with a white spore mass and then turn an ashy gray. Occasionally, fruit bodies are produced that lack a cap entirely.|$|E
25|$|Group 12 – Single Orchid (Star) dahlias (SinO) — single {{outer ring}} of florets {{surround}} a central disc. The ray florets are either involute or <b>revolute.</b>|$|E
25|$|O. revolutus’ namesake <b>revolute</b> leaf {{margins are}} very likely an {{adaption}} to the harsh growing conditions of its range, presumably adding structural integrity to leaves often exposed to frost, sleet and driving wind, {{as well as}} very high UV levels. The margins would also reduce air movement across the stomata, presumably protecting the plant from desiccation. This is supported by observations that plants growing in shady subalpine pockets—where the need for sunlight may offset {{the need for a}} tough exterior—tend to have flatter or broader leaves with recurved rather than <b>revolute</b> margins.|$|E
25|$|Group 13 – Double Orchid dahlias (DblO) — Double blooms with {{triangular}} centres. The ray florets are narrowly lanceolate and {{are either}} involute or <b>revolute.</b> The central disc is absent.|$|E
25|$|Group 11 – Fimbriated dahlias (Fim) — ray florets evenly split or notched {{into two}} or more divisions, uniformly {{throughout}} the bloom, creating a fimbriated (fringed) effect. The petals may be flat, involute, <b>revolute,</b> straight, incurving or twisted.|$|E
25|$|Group 9 – Semi cactus dahlias (S–c)— Double blooms, very pointed ray florets, <b>revolute</b> {{for greater}} than twenty five percent {{and less than}} fifty percent of their {{longitudinal}} axis. Broad at the base and straight or incurved, almost spiky in appearance.|$|E
25|$|The name Orites revoluta (referring to {{the tightly}} <b>revolute</b> leaf margins) was first {{published}} by the Linnaean Society of London in March 1810 in the paper On {{the natural order of}} plants called Proteaceae by Robert Brown. However, the orthographic variant Orites revolutus is used just as widely and is often reported to be the more correct species name.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Alex George {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia {{in his classic}} monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). He reinstated B.ser. Abietinae, placing it within B.sect. Oncostylis, and defining it as containing only those species with entire, linear leaves with <b>revolute</b> margins, and having roughly spherical inflorescences. Thus three species with elongate cylindrical inflorescences were moved into separate series.|$|E
25|$|A <b>revolute</b> pair, or hinged joint, {{requires}} a line, or axis, in the moving body to remain co-linear {{with a line}} in the fixed body, and a plane perpendicular to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar perpendicular plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom, which is pure rotation about the axis of the hinge.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} other {{varieties}} of B.spinulosa (Hairpin Banksia), B.spinulosavar. spinulosa grows as a multi-stemmed lignotuberous shrub with flower spikes that are all golden or golden with red or purple styles. Its strongly <b>revolute</b> leaf margins distinguish it from the other varieties, and it is further distinguished from B.spinulosavar. collina in having narrower leaves that are serrate only towards the leaf tips. It is also easily distinguished from B.spinulosa var. cunninghamii by its lignotuber and resultant multi-stemmed habit.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} example shows {{a typical}} multibody system. It is usually denoted as slider-crank mechanism. The mechanism {{is used to}} transform rotational motion into translational motion {{by means of a}} rotating driving beam, a connection rod and a sliding body. In the present example, a flexible body is used for the connection rod. The sliding mass is not allowed to rotate and three <b>revolute</b> joints are used to connect the bodies. While each body has six degrees of freedom in space, the kinematical conditions lead to one degree of freedom for the whole system.|$|E
25|$|This system {{depended}} {{primarily on}} the visibility of the central disc, whether it was open centred or whether only ray florets were apparent centrally (double bloom). The double bloom cultivars were then subdivided according {{to the way in}} which they were folded along their longitudinal axis, flat, involute (curled inwards) or <b>revolute</b> (curling backwards). If the end of the ray floret was split, they were considered fimbriated. Based on these characteristics, nine groups were defined plua a tenth miscellaneous group for any cultivars not fitting the above characteristics. Fimbriated dahlias were added in 2004, and two further groups (Single and Double orchid) in 2007. The last group to be added, Peony, first appeared in 2012.|$|E

2500|$|M. triquetra {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by its distinct three-ranked leaf arrangement and for being dioicous. [...] It may {{be distinguished from}} M. uliginosa by its squarrose leaves; narrow costa relative {{to the size of}} the leaf base; serrate, planar leaf margins; and acute leaf tips. In contrast, M. uliginosa a wide (up to 1/3 of the leaf base) costa, entire, <b>revolute</b> leaf margins, and blunt apices. Other Meesia species also have blunt apices.|$|E

[...] Petioles stout, pubescent, one-half to an inch in length.|$|E
2500|$|Orites revolutus , {{also known}} as narrow-leaf orites, is a Tasmanian endemic plant species in the family Proteaceae. Scottish {{botanist}} Robert Brown formally described the species in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London in 1810 from a specimen collected at Lake St Clair. Abundant in alpine and subalpine heath, {{it is a small}} to medium shrub [...] tall, with relatively small, blunt leaves with strongly <b>revolute</b> margins. The white flowers grow on terminal spikes during summer. Being proteaceaous, O. revolutus is likely to provide a substantial food source for nectivorous animal species within its range.|$|E
2500|$|B. ser. Abietinae {{was first}} {{published}} in 1856, in Carl Meissner's chapter on the Proteaceae in A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. It was one of four series into which the subgenus Eubanksia was divided. These four series were defined in terms of leaf characters, with series Abietinae containing the species with entire or shortly denticulate leaves with <b>revolute</b> margins. In hindsight, it was the most homogeneous of the four series, as it contained only (but not all) species with hooked styles. The other three series were highly heterogeneous in comparison. The placement and circumscription of B.ser. Abietinae in Meissner's arrangement may be summarised as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Orites revolutus grows as a {{spreading}} bush or an erect, woody shrub, usually [...] in height. Branching is {{dense and}} the leaves are alternate up the stem. Leaf shape is narrow and fairly blunt at the apex, 7–20mm long, 1-1.5mm wide, with tightly <b>revolute</b> margins and a hairy surface on the underside. Flowering occurs in early to mid-summer with the sour-scented flowers arising on terminal spikes to twice {{the length of the}} leaves. White in colour, they are 5mm long, actinomorphic and bisexual with 4 adnate stamens and a superior ovary. The corolla is valvate, tubular in bud and split at maturity. Fruit is a hairy follicle to 15mm containing winged seeds.|$|E
60|$|The botanists {{call it a}} corolla, {{which means}} a garland, or a kind of crown; and the word {{is a very good}} one, because it {{indicates}} that the flower-cup is made, as our clay cups are, on a potter's wheel; that it is essentially a <b>revolute</b> form--a whirl or (botanically) 'whorl' of leaves; in reality successive round the base of the urn they form.|$|E
