40|$|In {{this work}} the {{influence}} of the ingate system design on the as-cast mechanical properties of an Al- 10 Si- 0. 38 Mg alloy have been clarified. The Weibull distribution has been seen to describe the spread in mechanical properties very well. The Weibull modulus has therefore been used as a measure of the soundness of an ingate system. Different ingate systems were investigated, including: expanding systems, pressurised systems, systems with and without filter, systems with different designs of the connection between the downsprue and the runner, and systems with and without an additional pocket {{at the end of the}} runner. The modification index of the microstructure was also measured in order to investigate if the spread in data is more dependent on the modification index than on the ingate system design. The results showed that a high Weibull modulus is more dependent on the ingate system design than on the modification index of the microstructure. The ultimate tensile strength was not significantly affected by the ingate system design, while the fracture elongation seemed to be more dependent on the melt quality than on the ingate system design. The Weibull modulus indicates that expanding systems are better than pressurised systems, and that the use of a filter in the runner is very beneficial. An additional pocket at the end of the runner has no beneficial effect when using a filter. The connection between the downsprue and the runner should have a <b>rounded</b> <b>bend</b> and the change in cross-section between the downsprue and the runner should be chamfered and not sharp...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{aerodynamic}} noise generated by a <b>round</b> bar <b>bended</b> into a circular arc shape in uniform air flow. The <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> bar has a curvature R and attack angle α. In the experiment, we investigated the effects of R or α on the aerodynamic sound generated by <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> bars. The results of the frequency analyses of the aerodynamic sounds show that the aeolian tones are generated by the <b>bend</b> <b>round</b> bar, when α is large, but that when α is small, although the aeolian tones are reduced, the broad band noise of lower frequencies are increased. In order to decrease aeolian tones, we find the appropriate attack angle α...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} reports {{the results of}} {{investigations}} conducted during 2006 - 2007 of the bottom longline fishery in the Southern Adriatic Sea. The study investigated the rigging {{of the line and}} the material used. These investigations specifically compared the catch efficiency of the traditionally used J-shaped hook to hooks with innovative design that are commonly used in the Norwegian costal longline fishery. Fishing trials were conducted using a commercial fishing boat operating in areas with two different bottom morphologies (rocky and muddy bottom). Species abundance of the catches in the two areas were compared. The working hypothesis was that the innovative hooks, characterized by a point toward the line of pull (i. e., Mustad: EZ-Baiter, Wide Gap, Wide Gap Eyed), perform better than the traditional hook whose point is parallel to the line of pull (i. e., Mustad: <b>Round</b> <b>Bend</b> Sea). A variant of the traditional J-shaped hook, characterized by an offset-angle (Mustad: Kirby) was also tested. The elasmobranch species (Squalus acanthias 26 % and Raja clavata 13 %) were the most abundant species on rocky bottom, followed by Pagrus pagrus (13 %). These species were hardly present on muddy bottoms where Merluccius merluccius dominated (48 %). The EZ-Baiter and Wide Gap hooks had the highest catch efficiency in terms of biomass of fish caught. They also gave the highest income. The Wide Gap Eyed hook performed the worst as it was not suitable for the baiting operations. The EZ-Baiter and Wide Gap hook were more efficient than the <b>Round</b> <b>Bend</b> Sea hook on both bottom morphologies. The results suggest that the EZ-Baiter hook performed better than Wide Gap hook on rocky bottom, while the Wide Gap performed better on muddy bottom. The Kirby hook did not improve the catch efficiency compared to the <b>Round</b> <b>Bend</b> Sea. It was concluded that introduction of the Norwegian hook designs could improve the efficiency and income of the Italian bottom longline fishery without large investments...|$|R
