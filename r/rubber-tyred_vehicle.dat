50|$|A recent {{development}} of tramway {{technology has been}} the guided bus (or tram on tyres), a <b>rubber-tyred</b> <b>vehicle</b> guided by a fixed rail in the ground, which draws current from overhead electric wires like a conventional tram.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the use of}} {{the term}} trolley for tram was not adopted in Europe, the term was later {{associated}} with the trolleybus, a <b>rubber-tyred</b> <b>vehicle</b> running on hard pavement, which draws its power from pairs of overhead wires. These electric buses, which use twin trolley poles, are also called trackless trolleys (particularly in the northeastern US), or sometimes simply trolleys (in the UK, as well as in Seattle and Vancouver).|$|E
50|$|An {{intermediate}} form, whereby tramlines {{are laid}} {{in the middle of}} a road, and segregated from other road users either by being raised approximately 10 centimetres above street level, and/or with small studs, or simply by a painted white line. This space is normally for trams only, or for trams, buses, taxis and emergency vehicles. However ordinary traffic may cross into the tram lane to pass parked vehicles. In the Netherlands and Belgium this is known as a trambaan. The tram lane may be roughened by paving it with cobbles as an additional deterrent to use by <b>rubber-tyred</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Both of {{the systems}} in these cities are {{referred}} to as [...] "tramways on tyres", and in common with tram systems they use a surface guidance system and in normal operation are powered by electricity drawn from an overhead wire. However, while the vehicles are guided by a central guidance rail, they ride on rubber tyres, not on rails. There has been disagreement about whether they should be called [...] "trams", for that reason and also because they are capable of being steered and operating independently of the guidance rail, using auxiliary diesel engines. GLT is effectively a model of guided dual-mode bus, but when GLT vehicles use a pantograph to collect current, as do those in Caen, they are not commonly considered to be trolleybuses. English transport publications generally refer to the GLT and the competing Translohr system as [...] "rubber-tyred tramways", but rarely simply as [...] "tramways", as they are not tramways in the conventional sense, but neither are they buses when pantograph-equipped and operating in service as designed (i.e. in electric mode). GLT {{is one of the few}} models (together with the Innovia APM) of <b>rubber-tyred</b> <b>vehicles</b> produced by Bombardier’s transport division, which is otherwise focused on rail transport.|$|R
40|$|In the past, brake {{testing of}} <b>rubber-tyred</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{operating}} in quarries, opencast coal sites, mines and similar environments, comprised ‘simple’ stopping distance tests, typically {{carried out at}} daily or weekly intervals. More recently, many operators of such plant have progressed to using a brake testing method that employs electronic instrumentation, {{as a means of}} determining the ‘brake ratio’ of a vehicle. This is because instrumented testing gives more accurate results. Accordingly, the time between performing these instrumented tests has increased to monthly, or even 3 -monthly, intervals. For both simple and instrumented test methods, international standard ISO 3450 is often (wrongly) used as the guide to acceptable brake performance testing regimes. The ISO standard contains formulae that enable either a stopping distance or a brake ratio to be calculated (depending on which test method is used). However, these calculated values are minimum levels of braking ability necessary for a vehicle to be placed on the market. That is, the ISO standard is a minimum standard for manufacture, not a maintenance standard. To put this into context, it is likely that any ‘modern’ vehicle will have levels of braking performance approaching twice these minimum ISO values. In using these ISO values as routine test pass or fail criteria, organisations may be indirectly accepting that brakes on modern vehicles can deteriorate by up to 50 per cent before their operators become concerned with braking ability. In addition, test conditions on site (particularly speed and gradient) may be much less onerous than those used in ISO 3450, which produces low test results. The overall outcome of this may be a ‘poor’ brake test result, but one that exceeds a low level pass criterion and is not, therefore, seen as a test failure. Another common problem with some brake testing regimes is that they do not readily correlate to site operating conditions; in particular to gradients, but also to vehicle speed and load. The law requires organisations to ‘ensure’ that work equipment is suitable (safe) for the conditions of use it will encounter. This means being able to demonstrate that vehicle braking capabilities are adequate for actual site operating gradients, speeds and loads. Naturally therefore, any testing regime should accurately take account of the site conditions which the vehicle will be exposed to. In order to address these shortcomings regarding brake testing of <b>rubber-tyred</b> <b>vehicles,</b> this guide explains the brake ratio method of brake testing. A step-by-step guide on how to correlate braking performance with actual site conditions and how to design and put in place a suitable brake test regime is preceded by several discussion chapters. The written report was compiled in collaboration with the Health & Safety Executive (HSE), the Off-highway Plant and Equipment Research Centre (OPERC) and the Mineral Products Qualifications Council (MPQC – formerly EPIC) ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1925, the {{lighthouse}} {{was one of}} the first Scottish lights to receive communications from the shore by wireless telegraphy. In the 1960s, the island's transport system was modernised. The railway was removed, leaving behind the concrete bed on which it had been laid to serve as a roadway for a [...] "Gnat" [...] - a three-wheeled, <b>rubber-tyred</b> cross-country <b>vehicle</b> powered by a 400cc four-stroke engine, built by Aimers McLean of Galashiels. This had a somewhat shorter working life than the railway, becoming redundant in its turn when the helipad was constructed.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{idea for}} <b>rubber-tyred</b> railway <b>vehicles</b> {{was the work}} of Scotsman Robert William Thomson, the {{original}} inventor of the pneumatic tyre. In his patent of 1846 he describes his 'Aerial Wheels' as being equally suitable for, [...] "the ground or rail or track on which they run". The patent also included a drawing of such a railway, with the weight carried by pneumatic main wheels running on a flat board track and guidance provided by small horizontal steel wheels running on the sides of a central vertical guide rail.|$|R
