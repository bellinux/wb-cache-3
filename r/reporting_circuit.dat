40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a new family}} of conditioning circuits used in electrostatic kinetic energy harvesters (e-KEHs), generalizing a previously <b>reported</b> conditioning <b>circuit</b> known as the Bennet's doubler. The proposed topology implements a conditioning scheme described by a rectangular charge-voltage cycle (QV-cycle) of tunable aspect ratio. These circuits show an exponential increase of the converted energy over operation time if studied in the sole electrical domain. The QV-cycle's aspect ratio can be set to values that were previously inaccessible with other exponential conditioning circuits. After a brief intuitive presentation of the new topology, its operation is rigorously analyzed and its dynamics are quantitatively derived in the electrical domain. In particular, the aspect ratio of the rectangular QV-cycle describing the biasing scheme of the transducer is expressed {{as a function of}} the circuit's parameters. Practical considerations about the use of the <b>reported</b> conditioning <b>circuits</b> in actual e-KEHs are also presented.

Further, we also perform logic synthesis and technology mapping, demonstrating that synthesized circuits mapped with the library of ambipolar logic gates dissipate 57 % less power than CMOS circuits. By combining the benefits coming from the expressive power of generalized logic and from the CNTFET technology, we demonstrate that we can reduce the energy-delay-product by a factor of 20 × using the ambipolar CNTFET technology. 1...|$|R
