50|$|The {{single-headed}} {{version of}} this weapon is used {{in a similar manner}} to the rope dart in that it is a long reach weapon with a single head. The main difference between the headed meteor hammer and a <b>rope</b> <b>spear</b> is that traditionally the meteor hammer has an end shaped similar to an egg or melon. The single end can traditionally weigh up to 3 kg and is attached to a rope that can be 6 meters (20 ft) in length (in contrast a rope dart is typically 3.6 meters long). Because of these traits, a single headed meteor hammer can be a very effective weapon, despite being very difficult to control. The weapon could attack in multiple directions and even in an arching pattern when engaged in formation attacks. This weapon would be tossed up and over an enemy formation to hit troops not yet engaged in the head. In modern times, this version is rarely studied or taught since a weapon of this nature isn't needed and is very complex to learn. The double headed version is flashier and better known.|$|E
60|$|The {{poor man}} {{had indeed been}} {{entangled}} in the <b>rope</b> of the <b>spear,</b> {{so that he could}} not use his limbs freely.|$|R
50|$|Native Hawaiians {{used the}} hard wood of olopua to make au koi (adze handles), apuapu (rasps for making fish hooks), ōō (digging sticks), lāau melomelo (fishing lures), pou (house posts), pāhoa (daggers), pīkoi (tripping weapons {{similar to a}} <b>rope</b> dart), and <b>spears.</b> Because the wood burned well even if green, it was used as wahie (firewood).|$|R
50|$|Here {{the spear}} gun is {{connected}} to a buoy via a float <b>rope.</b> After <b>spearing</b> a fish, the spearfisher detaches the float rope and uses a speed stick (a metal spike) attached to the float rope to thread the fish onto the float rope through its gills. The fish will then gradually slide up the float rope as the diver swims until it rests underneath the buoy. When shooting larger fish, the diver can {{let go of his}} gun and play the fish from the float line, giving the fish more room to tire and preventing it from tearing off the spear or dragging the spearfisher under the water.|$|R
5000|$|The fourth {{match was}} a WWF Tag Team Championship {{triangle}} ladder match involving The Hardy Boyz, Edge and Christian, and champions The Dudley Boyz [...] Edge and Christian first gained the advantage after Edge climbed the top <b>rope</b> and <b>speared</b> Jeff, who was climbing a ladder. Edge and Christian were then given consecutive 3-D's by The Dudley Boyz. The Dudley Boyz then brought tables {{into the ring}} and onto ringside, where D-Von splashed Jeff through {{a table in the}} ring, while Bubba powerbombed Matt through another at ringside. The Hardy Boyz would then retaliate after Jeff delivered a Swanton bomb off a ladder onto Bubba, through a table. As Jeff did so, Matt climbed a ladder, along with Edge and Christian, who pushed Matt off the ladder through a table. The situation allowed Edge and Christian to reach and grab the championship belts that were hung from the rafters, thus gaining their first Tag Team Championship.|$|R
60|$|If he met God, Tarzan {{would be}} prepared. One {{could never tell}} whether a grass <b>rope,</b> a war <b>spear,</b> or a {{poisoned}} arrow would be most efficacious against an unfamiliar foe. Tarzan of the Apes was quite content--if God wished to fight, the ape-man had no doubt as to {{the outcome of the}} struggle. There were many questions Tarzan wished to put to the Creator of the Universe and so he hoped that God would not prove a belligerent God; but his experience of life and the ways of living things had taught him that any creature with the means for offense and defense was quite likely to provoke attack if in the proper mood.|$|R
50|$|South Asian spears {{were used}} both in missile and non-missile form, both by cavalry and foot-soldiers. Mounted spear-fighting was practiced using with a ten-foot, ball-tipped wooden lance called a bothati, {{the end of}} which was covered in dye so that hits may be confirmed. Spears were {{constructed}} from a variety of materials such as the sang made completely of steel, and the ballam which had a bamboo shaft. The Rajputs wielded a type of spear for infantrymen which had a club integrated into the spearhead, and a pointed butt end. Other spears had forked blades, several spear-points, and numerous other innovations. One particular spear unique to India was the vita or corded lance. Used by the Maratha army, it had a <b>rope</b> connecting the <b>spear</b> with the user's wrist, allowing the weapon to be thrown and pulled back.|$|R
40|$|Nicobarese {{are one of}} the six {{aboriginal}} tribes inhabiting Andaman and Nicobar Islands. They {{account for}} over 95 % of the total tribal population in the islands and majority of them inhabit at Car Nicobar, which is the capital of Nicobar district and popularly called as Coconut Island. The Nicobari tribes are hunters and gatherers who use their indigenous knowledge for exploitation of marine fishery resources using locally available materials. The common fishing methods in vogue are tamatu (trap), thanam kak (<b>spear</b> with <b>rope)</b> chok/linreny kak (<b>spear</b> with rubber), kinyav (icthyotoxic seed), thakua kak (line), kel thakua kak (hand line), tamarotha thakua kak (long line), Hanak Inhal Kak (shore seine), Inruon thakua kak (troll line) and Inhal (gill net). The Nicobari tribes have inherited the skill for designing and operating these gears from their forefathers. This paper summarises the traditional knowledge existing and commonly practiced among the Nicobari tribes for exploitation of marine fish at Car Nicobar...|$|R
5000|$|As the Shaolin Monk {{trains in}} a field he hears loud noises nearby and finds the Maori Warrior {{performing}} his [...] "Ka Mate" [...] haka. The Maori dances {{in front of him}} and sticks out his tongue, meaning that he intends to eat him. The Monk slowly walks up to the Maori and bows; he responds by charging, swinging his stingray spear. The Monk swiftly back-flips to dodge the spear. The Maori sticks his tongue out again, but the Monk calmly produces a meteor hammer. He tries to strike the Maori, but the stingray spear frustrates the attempt, so the Monk swings the meteor hammer and wraps its <b>rope</b> around the <b>spear.</b> The two pull on the rope to gain control of the spear. The Maori then angrily throws the spear, causing the Monk to fall back. The Monk quickly back-flips to keep his balance and remain standing. He makes a run for the trees; the Maori gives chase.|$|R
60|$|The third {{guard at}} the further side was sawing {{through one of the}} fibre <b>ropes</b> with his <b>spear.</b> There they were on the middle of the bridge with the torrent raving fifty feet beneath them, and the man had nearly severed the rope! To get over before it parted was impossible; behind were the priests; beneath the roaring river. All three of them stopped as though paralyzed, for all three had seen. Something struck against Alan's leg, it was his pistol that still {{remained}} fastened to his wrist by its leather thong. He cocked and lifted it, took aim and fired. The shot missed, which was not wonderful considering the light and the platform on which the shooter stood. It missed, but the man, astonished, for he had never seen or heard such a thing before, stopped his sawing for a moment, and stared at them. Then as he began again Alan fired once more, and this time by good fortune the bullet struck the man somewhere in the body. He fell, and as he fell grasped the nearly separated rope and hung to it.|$|R
5000|$|At this point, {{the story}} diverges into two {{branches}} - on one hand, the story follows Domenico {{as he makes}} his way to a city of thieves and killers, Camoora. On the other hand, new characters are introduced, who are referred to as the [...] "Five Great Canudosians". The first of the Five Great Canudosians, Manuelo Costa, is a peasant in Certana, a village near Camoora. He is very poor due to high taxes imposed on peasants by Camoorians, and serves them on their land. However, he is naturally light-hearted and optimistic and brave. As a result, he is very popular among the ladies in his village, Certana. After introducing the character, it is stated that Manuelo will become the first of the Five Great Canudosians. The second is Santos, a peasant who was ambushed by Masimo in the City of Beauty while Domenico was staying there. Santos was carrying medicine to his wife who was very sick, but, because he was ambushed and heavily injured, was unable to make it on time, and as a result, his wife died of sickness and his son died of shock of the ambush and the death of his mother. Everyone in Santos's village, Calabria, is sad over the death of Santos's wife. She was considered to be a very gentle, wise and beautiful woman, but nobody could guess why she chose Santos as her husband. It is stated that Santos's wife, Mirtza, was the kind of woman that could appreciate a man not necessarily for what he has done, but what he would do later in life, like becoming one of the Five Great Canudosians. Santos started spending his evenings standing over his family's graves and talking to his dead wife and son, while standing in his own grave in between them, with his hands on each of their graves, and spent his days swinging his axe, splitting apart logs with his bare hands and lifting cows. He was fueled by primal rage and desire for revenge against a Camooran captain, who, as he found out later, was named Masimo. He got himself a log, called it Masimo and spent his nights [...] "choking" [...] it with his fingers. Over time, Santos's physical strength became so great {{that he was able to}} lift cows with his hands, was able to split any log with a single strike of his axe and the log called Masimo had visible markings and deformations on it from Santos's fingers. It is stated that Santos later had his terrible revenge, and also became the second of the Five Great Canudosians. The third of the Five Great Canudosians is Ze Moreira, Manuelo's best friend. Ze has children and a wife who loves him very much, but disapproves of his friendship with Manuelo, whom she views as a drunk and [...] "not a serious person". What she does not know is that whenever a bull goes rabid or a jaguar attacks the farm, Ze and his friend Manuelo are the ones who go out and kill the dangerous animals using <b>ropes</b> and <b>spears.</b> Usually it is Ze who does that, but he does not want his wife to know that he has been putting himself in danger, so he asks Manuelo to take credit for all of that. It is stated that Ze Moreira will become the third of the Five Great Canudosians.The fourth of them, Joao Abado, is also a peasant in Certana, just like Ze and Manuelo, but unlike them, he never had enough courage to fight rabid animals. He is instead a very mean person, always finding an excuse to yell at someone, whether they deserved it or not. He would even sometimes hide his own possessions, just so he could have an excuse to yell at his wife for losing them. Nobody in the village likes Joao aside from his wife and children, and yet it is stated that he would one day become the fourth of the Five Great Canudosians. All of these characters are poor, but that is not what torments them. What torments them all is their lack of freedom. They don't talk to each other about it, but they all feel the same. The identity of the fifth Great Canudosian is kept a secret.|$|R
