40|$|Transcription begins] Thanksgiving Day 23 November 1944 Somewhere in Germany Howdy my darling, Thanksgiving Greetings, dear! I’ve just {{finished}} putting away a Thanksgiving dinner which does the United States Army proud. It’s a supply {{miracle of the}} age when you can put on a spread which we had <b>right</b> up <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area. Pity the poor “dough-feet”—they didn’t have it so good. Yes sir, we had roast turkey, cranberries, peas, potatoes, canned peaches, and coffee—can’t complain on that. Dearest, while I’ve finished eating my meal about 30 minutes ago, I’m going to eat again in about 5 hrs. from now when I shall sit at your side and feel you near me. Sweets, I know you’re a champion cook and the big grievance I have is {{not being able to}} partake of your cooking. (Of course, being able to make love to you is such a small matter, isn’t it?) Boy, could I use some of that love-making now! Don’t you worry, I’ll make up for it—and how! We are continuing to make history and you should hear about us officially before long. We’ve got a bang-up outfit and they’ve done a tremendous job. Today I received some of your letters dated Sept. 26 2 ̆ 6 29. They were Halloween greetings and a 1 1 / 3 -year Anniversary Greetings. Sweets, you’re a doll-baby! Also inclosed [sic] was the letters from your girlfriends which you sent me. Bubsie, you should see my mustache, it’s getting to be man-sized. I’m not trimming it like the “Shick” type but am growing one on the British type—fully grown with a slight upsweep. Nothing new or unusual has happened today. The weather has been bad—raining most of the time, but since we have a very dozy room we don’t mind the elements. Are you getting my mail regularly, darling? You know, dearest, I don’t mind if your letters are a month old—I enjoy them nevertheless—it’s because I’m in love with you. So Ohio State is going to win the championship—my, my. We {{have a lot of fun}} around here—kidding around. Lt. Haygood’s wife is expecting a baby around Christmas and we’re really “sweating” him out. Bubs, maybe we were smart that we didn’t start Jr. on the way. I don’t think I’d be able to take it so easy. I want to be with you all the time while you’re giving birth—not just when the bundle arrives. I love you, darling, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|R
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{you will}} say, {{there must be}} a {{difference}} between true Poetry and true Speech not poetical: what is the difference? On this point many things have been written, especially by late German Critics, some of which are not very intelligible at first. They say, for example, that the Poet has an infinitude in him; communicates an Unendlichkeit, a certain character of [...] "infinitude," [...] to whatsoever he delineates. This, though not very precise, yet on so vague a matter is worth remembering: if well meditated, some meaning will gradually be found in it. For my own part, I find considerable meaning in the old vulgar distinction of Poetry being metrical, having music in it, being a Song. Truly, if pressed to give a definition, one might say this as soon as anything else: If your delineation be authentically musical, musical not in word only, but in heart and substance, in all the thoughts and utterances of it, in the whole conception of it, then it will be poetical; if not, not.--Musical: how much lies in that! A musical thought is one spoken by a mind that has penetrated into the inmost heart of the thing; detected the inmost mystery of it, namely the melody that lies hidden in it; the inward harmony of coherence which is its soul, whereby it exists, and has a <b>right</b> to be, <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> world. All inmost things, we may say, are melodious; naturally utter themselves in Song. The meaning of Song goes deep. Who is there that, in logical words, can express the effect music has on us? A kind of inarticulate unfathomable speech, which leads us {{to the edge of the}} Infinite, and lets us for moments gaze into that! ...|$|R
