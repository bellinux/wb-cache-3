This paper examines the liquefaction potential of the <b>road</b> <b>foundations</b> in twenty sites located in Gold Coast of South East Queensland. The preliminary seismic analysis was carried out in accordance with Seed and Idriss (1971) simplified procedure by using the in-situ SPT data. The factors of safety (FS) was calculated for three different moment magnitudes of Mw = 3, 4 and 5, and the analysis was used to generate the Liquefaction Potential Index (IL) and Liquefaction Risk Index (IR) values for all sites. The calculated indexes are used to delineate the liquefaction resistance of the <b>road</b> <b>foundations.</b> The study shows that all cases were found to have low liquefaction failure potential for the moment magnitudes considered in the study.
