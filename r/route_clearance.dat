40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for creating common weather avoidance reroutes for multiple flights {{and the associated}} benefits analysis, which {{is an extension of}} the single flight advisories generated using the Dynamic Weather Routes (DWR) concept. These multiple flight advisories are implemented in the National Airspace System (NAS) Constraint Evaluation and Notification Tool (NASCENT), a nation-wide simulation environment to generate time- and fuel-saving alternate routes for flights during severe weather events. These single flight advisories are clustered together in the same Center by considering parameters such as a common return capture fix. The clustering helps propose routes called, Multi-Flight Common Routes (MFCR), that avoid weather and other airspace constraints, and save time and fuel. It is expected that these routes would also provide lower workload for traffic managers and controllers since a common route is found for several flights, and presumably the <b>route</b> <b>clearances</b> would be easier and faster. This study was based on 30 -days in 2014 and 2015 each, which had most delays attributed to convective weather. The results indicate that many opportunities exist where individual flight routes can be clustered to fly along a common route to save a significant amount of time and fuel, and potentially reducing the amount of coordination needed...|$|R

5|$|The Brigade {{spent the}} first six months of its {{deployment}} to Tikrit in central Iraq, working on projects there for Multinational Division-Center under the 10th Mountain Division. On 6 November, the brigade relocated to Kirkuk, unfurling its colors at Forward Operating Base Warrior. The brigade conducted <b>route</b> <b>clearance</b> and construction projects in northern Iraq, while partnered with Iraqi engineers. It replaced the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division in Kirkuk and will was under the area of responsibility of Multinational Division-North led by the 1st Armored Division. In February 2009, the brigade again moved, this time to Ninewa Province to focus on construction projects in areas in and around Mosul. It was relieved by 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. On 17 July 2009, the brigade handed over responsibility of Mosul to the 130th Engineer Brigade. The brigade subsequently returned to Schwetzingen, Germany after its 15-month deployment was finished.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2008, the brigade's combat service/combat {{sustainment}} support battalions took part in equipment testing and training in Rapid City, South Dakota. It tested the Multifunction Agile Remote Control Robot IV, a <b>route</b> <b>clearance</b> robot, {{with the assistance of}} the South Dakota National Guard. The bulk of the brigade spent the summer at Fort Sill, Oklahoma to train aviation assets for deploying units. In June 2008, the brigade trained the aviation assets of the 34th Infantry Division in air combat, air assault, and other tactics related to aviation. For this mission, the brigade was assisted by the 479th Field Artillery Brigade, which handled ground exercises. As part of a new training routine, the brigade trained the 34th Infantry Division's aviation units at Fort Rucker, spending a longer time training the unit because it continued to train the brigade as it mobilized and prepared to deploy. Other units trained with the Division, but none through the entire mobilization process. This process used new and never-before-used facilities to streamline training exercises. Purportedly, it gave the 166th Aviation Brigade much additional time for training, as the streamlining process made some programs more efficient, cutting time needed to prepare for them in half.|$|E
5|$|Resuming their advance, the Australians were {{supported}} by three squadrons of Corsairs from the Royal New Zealand Air Force—Nos. 14, 22 and 26 Squadrons—which bombed and strafed {{the ground in front}} of the advancing infantry, as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire. With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai, for just one man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the 15th Brigade's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out <b>route</b> <b>clearance</b> and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire.|$|E

5000|$|Clearance {{delivery}} is {{the position that}} issues <b>route</b> <b>clearances</b> to aircraft, typically before they commence taxiing. These clearances contain details of the route that the aircraft is expected to fly after departure. Clearance delivery or, at busy airports, Ground Movement Planner (GMP) or Traffic Management Coordinator (TMC) will, if necessary, coordinate with the relevant radar centre or flow control unit to obtain releases for aircraft. At busy airports, these releases are often automatic and are controlled by local agreements allowing [...] "free-flow" [...] departures. When weather or extremely high demand for a certain airport or airspace becomes a factor, there may be ground [...] "stops" [...] (or [...] "slot delays") or re-routes {{may be necessary to}} ensure the system does not get overloaded. The primary responsibility of clearance {{delivery is}} to ensure that the aircraft have the correct aerodrome information, such as weather and airport conditions, the correct route after departure and time restrictions relating to that flight.

During the deployment, the brigade had five principle duties: <b>route</b> <b>clearance</b> and sanitation, rapid crater repair, engineer support to the 3rd Infantry Division and other combat units, planning, design and construction of contingency operating bases, and command of tactical bridging assets. The first major project of the brigade after arriving in country in September 2006 was to assist Iraqi engineers in repairing and operating the run down and damaged water treatment plant at Al Bakir which provided a major source of fresh water from the Tigris River. The brigade allowed Iraqi engineers to lead this operation and played a supporting role in evaluating their work. One of the brigade's major projects was the construction of Forward Operating Base (FOB) Hammer, which was completed in just 45 days. The base required construction materials {{from all over the country}} as well as foreign materials brought to Camp Victory and Balad Air Base.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the flight demonstration and test results. INTRODUCTION The U. S. aviation industry is investing $ 6 billion over 20 years to increase airport capacity {{due to the}} gap between the industryÕs desired capacity and the ability of the National Airspace System to handle the increased air traffic. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that currently 23 of the largest U. S. airports each experience more than 20, 000 hours of delays every year, and that by the year 2000, 40 major airports are likely to be experiencing delays of this magnitude [1]. Furthermore, these air traffic delays were estimated to cost $ 3 billion for airline operations and $ 6 billion for passenger delays in 1990. These costs are projected to increase 50 percent in 10 years based on current trends. Action must be taken to safely increase airport capacity of existing airport facilities while reducing controller and pilot workload. The FAA plans to address these concerns by providing air traffic control, the airlines, and airport management with positive identification of surface targets on the movement area; providing pilots with airport safety alerts; providing controllers with automated warnings of potential and actual runway incursions; providing a surface traffic planning capability; and providing an automated method of sending instructions, such as taxi <b>route</b> <b>clearances,</b> to aircraft. 1 Similarly, the National Aeronautics and Space AdministrationÕs (NASA) Terminal Area Productivity (TAP) Program was established, in cooperation with the Federal Aviation Administration, to develop and demonstrate airborne and ground technologies and procedures to safely increase terminal area capacity.

At this time the 1st Battalion adopted the nickname [...] "Aleutian" [...] as the unit's fixed call sign. The unit underwent training at Fort Hood, Texas for three months of intensive training in Force Protection, Convoy Security, <b>Route</b> <b>Clearance</b> and Urban Operations. The 1–206th FA became the first Army unit to field and conduct artillery live fire exercises with the new ANGYK-57 Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). Each battery conducted two days of artillery live fire training during post mobilization training. At this time the 1–206th FA received the attachment of Battery A, 1st Battalion, 103rd Field Artillery, Rhode Island National Guard. The 1–206th FA had arrived at mobilization station approximately 80 soldiers short of its required strength, most vacancies being in the Fire Support Teams. The National Guard Bureau supplied this shortage by activating A/1-103rd and attaching it to 1–206th for deployment. A/1-103rd FA quickly became known as the [...] "Rhody" [...] Battery. While the 1–206th was at Fort Hood, the battalion commander, battalion operations officer, and three battery commanders accompanied the brigade staff and other battalion commanders and staff on a Pre-Deployment Site Survey (PDSS) to Iraq. The commanders spent 10 days traveling to the Baghdad Area of Operations, being hosted by the 16th Engineer Battalion, 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division. In late January 2004 the 1–206th FA moved to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, Louisiana for a Mission Rehearsal Exercise to validate the brigade training for the deployment. While at Fort Polk the 39th Brigade staff was informed by the 1st Cavalry Division that due to a scheduling gap and the need to assume responsibility of the base defense operations center at Camp Taji, Iraq, the brigade would have to deploy one battalion approximately three weeks ahead of the rest of the brigade. The 39th Brigade selected the 1–206th to assume this mission and the battalion was prioritized on the brigade's movement plan. The advance party of the 1–206th FA departed Fort Polk on 28 February 2004. Due to a mechanical breakdown en route the advanced party arrived in Kuwait on 8 March 2004.
