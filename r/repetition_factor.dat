A simple characterization {{of both the}} <b>repetition</b> <b>factor</b> and numerical stability (for small $h$) is given, which enables us to derive some results {{with respect to a}} conjecture of Linz. In particular we show that (i) methods with a <b>repetition</b> <b>factor</b> of one are always numerically stable; (ii) methods with a <b>repetition</b> <b>factor</b> greater than one are not necessarily numerically unstable.

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{discovery}} that repeat-accumulate-accumulate (RAA) codes with a <b>repetition</b> <b>factor</b> of three or larger are asymptotically good, {{we focus on the}} design of double-serially concatenated codes (DSCCs) with an outer repetition code. The main design goal is to obtain rate- 1 / 2 codes with minimum distance approaching the Gilbert-Varshamov bound (GVB), while still maintaining a good convergence threshold with iterative decoding. To this end, the “accumulate” codes, used as middle and inner codes in RAA codes, are replaced with higher memory, rate- 1 convolutional codes. We find that distance growth rates close to the GVB can be achieved in a DSCC with code memories as small as two or three. EXIT charts are used to design DSCCs with good convergence thresholds and distance growth properties. Finally, these codes are compared to the RAAA code and a punctured RAA code with a <b>repetition</b> <b>factor</b> of three, both of which exhibit linear distance growth with block length. ...|$|E

The general models for finding exact repetitions in one string and in a finite set of strings are introduced. It is shown that d-subsets created during determinization of nondeterministic factor automata contain all information concerning <b>repetitions</b> of <b>factors.</b> The principle of the analysis of d-subsets is then used for finding approximate repetitions using several distances for a general finite alphabet and for an ordered alphabet including the case of presence of don’t care symbols. Complexity of finding repetitions is shown for exact repetitions in one string. ...|$|R

One week later subjects were asked for their free recall of the events in the video followed by sets of hierarchically arranged, increasingly sug-gestive questions that suggested a correct (positive-leading), an incorrect (misleading), or no specific (unbiased-leading) answer, with the final level of questioning for each item being a three-alternative multiple-choice question. Correct free recall varied with age, with the kindergarten and Grade 2 children generally following the lead of the first-level questions more so than the older subjects. Older children were as accurate as adults in responding to questions about the central items, but not so for noncentral items. Devel-opmental differences were found in responses to repeated suggestive questioning, with kindergarten children following misleading questions and changing answers more often than older subjects. On the final, multiple-choice questions, kindergarten children were able to provide the correct answer as often as they had to the initial questions, despite intervening errors.

40|$|In Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) {{communications}} {{based on}} Time Hopping (TH) Impulse Radio, {{one of the}} most frequently studied receivers is the correlation receiver. The Multi-User Interference (MUI) at the output of this receiver is sometimes modeled as a Gaussian random variable. In order to justify this assumption, the conditions of validity of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) have to be studied in an asymptotic regime where the number of interferers and the processing gain grow toward infinity at the same rate, the channel degree being kept constant. An asymptotic study is made in this paper based on the so-called Lindeberg’s condition for the CLT for martingales. We consider non synchronized users sending their signals over independent multi-path channels. These users may also have different powers. It is shown that when the frame length grows and the <b>repetition</b> <b>factor</b> is kept constant, then the MUI does not converge in distribution toward a Gaussian random variable. On the other hand, this convergence can be established if the <b>repetition</b> <b>factor</b> grows at the rate of the frame length.

40|$|A {{new class}} of exact-repair {{regenerating}} codes is constructed by stitching together shorter erasure correction codes, where the stitching pattern {{can be viewed as}} block designs. The proposed codes have the "help-by-transfer" property where the helper nodes simply transfer part of the stored data directly, without performing any computation. This embedded error correction structure makes the decoding process straightforward, and in some cases the complexity is very low. We show that this construction is able to achieve performance better than space-sharing between the minimum storage regenerating codes and the minimum repair-bandwidth regenerating codes, and it is the first class of codes to achieve this performance. In fact, it is shown that the proposed construction can achieve a non-trivial point on the optimal functional-repair tradeoff, and it is asymptotically optimal at high rate, i. e., it asymptotically approaches the minimum storage and the minimum repair-bandwidth simultaneously.

For a general communication system, error correction coding offers a compromise between the amount of data that can be corrected and the level of redundancy.
