40|$|In a {{mouse model}} of river {{blindness}} it was demonstrated that Wolbachia bacteria, endosymbionts of filarial nematodes, {{play an important}} role in the inflammatory process leading to the disease and that this process depends on Toll-like receptor 4. Wolbachia is found in many arthropods and in all filariae pathogenic for man. Treatment with doxycycline depletes female filariae of Wolbachia and renders them infertile for at least 18 months. Chemotherapy of filarial nematodes should be studied for the reduction and possibly prevention of pathology <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>filariae,</b> and for a contribution to control and eradication programme...|$|R
50|$|Johnston had an {{interest}} in descriptive parasitology, and was a leading world expert on helminthology. He was a frequent and prolific contributor of new material to the collections of the South Australian Museum. In Queensland, he conducted studies in diverse areas as cattle tick, blowflies, muscidae, onchoceriasis and fish epidemics. Working with John Burton Cleland he studied worm nests in cattle <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>Filaria</b> gibsoni. He explored the internal parasites of Australian birds that included the emu. He studied the parasite mallophaga from marsupials. Johnston made significant contributions to the study of flies and parasitic worms, including Habronema and Musca domestica or housefly.He sought to develop a solution to the sheep maggot fly problem and the utilization of the chalcid wasp parasite as a possible answer.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{efficacy}} and lolerability of new benzatin-penicitlin (Extencillin, A VENTIS, France, Germany) {{as a means}} of prevention of A-streptococcal tonsillites and following repeated rheumatic attacks and also the data of comparative pharmacokinetics assessment for three therapeutical forms of benzatin-penicillin (Extencillin powder for injections 2. 4 tnln U.; Bicillin- 5 powder for injections 1. 5 mln U, SYNTHESIS. Kurgan, Russia). Results: On prescribing Extencillin in dosage of 2. 4 mln U i. m. once per three weeks to 60 pts with reliable rheumatism for 3 years the stable normalization of titers of antistreptolysin- 0 was noticed in 8 S. 2 % pts, absence of hemolytic streptococci in fauces - in 86. 7 %. There were no repeated rheumatic attacks in any patient. In 6. 67 % cases side effects were noticed (eosinophilia, skin itching) which were short-termed, reversible, and did not require cancellation of the drug. In comparative study off pharmacokinetics it was determined that after Extencillin administration in dosage of 2. 4 mln U. concentration of benzyl-penicillin was enough for inhibition of 13 -hemolytic A-streptococci (> 0. 025 mkg/ml) was preserved for 3 -weeks term in 83. 3 % of cases. After injection of Extencillin 1. 2 mln U of Bicillin- 5 1. 5 mln U this level of benzyl-penicillin was noticed on 21 day’ in 30 and 0 % cases cotrespondingly Conclusion: High and prolonged antistreptococcal activity> and good tolerability of Extencillin 2. 4 mln U. allow us to recommend it as an effective remedy for secondary prevention of <b>rheumatism.</b> <b>Due</b> <b>to</b> discrepancy to pharmacokinetic requirements to preventive drugs, medical forms of benzatin-penicillin such as Extencillin 1. 2 mln U and Bicillin- 5 1. 5 mln U. are not acceptable for adequate rheumatism prevention in adult patients...|$|R

5|$|On May 23, 1839, Waller married Philadelphian Julia Ellmaker. He {{first met}} Ellmaker while visiting friends in Philadelphia {{during his time}} at the Princeton Theological Seminary. The couple had nine {{children}} between 1840 and 1858, six of whom survived to adulthood, and five of whom were alive {{at the time of}} his death. He lived at the corner of 5th and Market Streets in Bloomsburg, although at one point he owned much of the land between 4th Street, the Susquehanna River, Railroad Street, and Ferry Road in Bloomsburg. In 1871, he suffered a driving accident and was temporarily injured. He was in another accident in 1875 and <b>due</b> <b>to</b> this, he needed to walk with crutches for the remainder of his life. Waller also suffered from <b>rheumatism</b> and neuralgia <b>due</b> <b>to</b> extensive traveling. He retired from being a minister on April 16, 1871. He died in on December 7, 1893, at the age of 79. The services for his death were held in his home. The historian J.H. Battle made note of Waller's hospitality. He was interested in geology and another Presbyterian minister gave him a large mineralogy-related collection in 1848.|$|R
40|$|Flunixin {{meglumine}} {{was used}} to examine the effect of prostaglandin inhibition on the pathogenesis of Dirofilaria immitis in the pulmonary arteries of dogs. Immunopathological reactions <b>to</b> dead <b>filariae</b> were monitored by light and transmission electron microscopy and serology. Lung lesions in prostaglandin-inhibited dogs exposed <b>to</b> dead <b>filariae</b> were enhanced compared to control dogs. This was associated with the persistence of parasitic antigen in lung tissue and in the blood. Serology demonstrated that after insertion of D. immitis in treated dogs, antibody levels did not change, while immune complex and antigen levels increased. These results indicate that prostaglandin may have a protective effect on the way the lung reacts to dead D. immitis, and that altered dynamics of the antigen processing may well contribute to the associated lung lesions...|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of Brugia malayi microfilariae {{and adults}} to injury by the murine macrophage cell line J 774 activated with gamma interferon and bacterial lipopolysaccharide has been examined in vitro. Parasites of both stages showed {{a decline in}} viability over 48 h of coculture with activated macrophages, assessed by their capacity to reduce the tetrazolium salt 3 -[4, 5 -diethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), although adult parasites were more resistant than microfilariae. Removal of parasites to cell-free medium following exposure to activated macrophages for up to 48 h resulted in partial recovery of their capacity to reduce MTT, suggesting that the effects were primarily cytostatic. However, prolonged exposure to activated J 774 cells for 72 h resulted in parasite death. Addition of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NMMA (N(G) -monomethyl-L-arginine monoacetate) indicated that nitric oxide derivatives were responsible for cytostasis and ultimate toxicity. The toxicity of nitric oxide derivatives was confirmed by coincubation of parasites with chemical donors, although far higher concentrations were required than those generated by activated J 774 cells, implying additional complexity in macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. These experiments further suggested that peroxynitrite or its by-products were more potently damaging <b>to</b> <b>filariae</b> than nitric oxide per se. Examination of ultrastructural changes on exposure of parasites to activated macrophages or donors of nitric oxide indicated that hypodermal mitochondria were highly vacuolated, with less prominent cristae. The data are discussed with reference to immunity <b>to</b> lymphatic <b>filariae</b> and their mechanisms of energy generation...|$|R

40|$|We {{report the}} {{phenotypic}} selection of {{two lines of}} Aedes aegypti, from a filariae susceptible parental stock (Refm). This selection was based upon the level of inducible anti-gram negative Escherichia coli activity within the haemolymph following E. coli infection. These lines, denoted `high' and `low', demonstrated significant differences in anti-E. coli responses throughout. However no difference was observed in the anti-gram positive Micrococcus luteus response following E. coli challenge. F$_{ 4 }$, F$_{ 6 }$ and F$_{ 9 }$ mosquitoes were experimentally infected with Brugia pahangi microfilariae. Reductions of between 53 and 82 % in {{the mean number of}} larvae completing development in the `high' compared with the `low' responding line were observed. Corresponding reductions of between 30 and 50 % in the mosquito infection rates also occurred between these lines.

40|$|Bidirectional cytoplasmic {{incompatibility}} in the Culex pipiens complex {{appears to}} provide a mechanism for the replacement of a wild population by a strain refractory <b>to</b> <b>filaria</b> or a strain made partly sterile by a translocation. As a preliminary test of the feasibility of the replacement process, various ratios of strains with the cytoplasm of either Delhi or Paris, which are bidirectionally incompatible, were tested in laboratory cages. Where one strain was marked with the ruby-eye gene, this strain always declined in frequency in the next generation. In experiments in which the Paris strain was marked with a male-linked translocation complex, after 2 - 4 generations of breeding there was complete elimination of either the Paris or the Delhi type depending, as expected, on the relative frequencies of the two types with which the population began. In one experiment a type with Paris cytoplasm devoid of the translocation was found. This type increased in frequency in succeeding generations. The possible causes of origin of this type and its relevance to the practical use of the replacement principle are discussed...|$|R

However, in the present study of Tsunaki-cho in Kumamoto Prefecture where ATL is endemic and patients with filariasis had been commonly observed until 1964, similar results could not be observed. The results obtained in this study could not suggest the consideration that filarial infection in the past might have some promoting effects on ATLV infestation among inhavitants in Tsunaki-cho, because we could not obtain any relationship between filaria and ATLV antibody titers in this time. Many of the inhabitants (19. 8 %) in Tsunaki-cho were suffered from a kind of fluke worm, Heterophyes heterophyes nocens. However, no relationship between heterophyes and ATLV infection could be also observed...|$|R
40|$|Some {{time ago}} Mr. J. H. Spitzly kindly {{forwarded}} to our Museum a few bottles with parasitic worms, collected by him in Surinam. Among them {{there was a}} bottle, containing some Nematodes found {{in the heart of}} a young female Jaguar, that was killed by a hunter. In reference to these parasites Mr. Spitzly wrote to me: »on incising the remarkably thin walls of the right ventricle, I was astonished to find the whole cavity fully packed with long white worms, laying in bundles more or less parallel {{to each other in the}} direction of heart’s apex to endings of pulmonary arteries. By slitting open the pulmonary arteries I found that some of them extended from the heart along the arteries far into the substance of the lungs. ” These worms bear a great resemblance <b>to</b> <b>Filaria</b> inmitis Leidy, observed by several investigators in the right ventricle and the pulmonary arteries of our common dog. Having no individuals of this species at my disposal, the specimens could only be identified from the short description, published by Schneider in his »Monographie der Nematoden” pag. 87 1); therefore the Jaguar-filaria’s afterwards perhaps may prove to belong to another species. However because Nematodes never have been mentioned from the heart of Felis onca, as far I am aware off, I thought it not without interest to call the attention of helminthologists on this fact...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This is {{the first}} study of the lesions {{produced}} by Elaeophora elaphi, a filarial worm first reported in 1986. Only the morphologic characteristics of this species have been described previously. Samples for the study were taken from 74 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 1 - 10 years old, slaughtered in central Spain. Grossly, filariae were observed in the transverse, left, or right branches of the portal vein of 18 animals. In addition <b>to</b> <b>filariae,</b> whitish thrombi {{were found in the}} right and left branches of the portal vein in nine animals. Thrombi of similar characteristics were also observed in 12 deer in which no adult filariae were found. Microscopic changes were observed only in the right and left branches of the portal vein and consisted of thickening of the intima with surface formation of villi. Stroma of villi contained a moderate to intense infiltrate composed mainly of eosinophils and mononuclear cells. The tunica media of affected vessels was uniformly hypertrophic and in some cases presented a moderate inflammatory infiltrate similar to that observed in the stroma of villi. Thrombi consisted of a central area containing calcified filariae or cuticle debris, surrounded by giant cells and numerous lymphoid cells forming clearly defined nodules resembling lymphoid follicles. Thrombi were externally sur-rounded by a strip of connective tissue and beyond by endothelial cells that were occasionally continuous with the tunica intima. Other lesions probably associated with the infestation were multifocal granulomas in the periportal areas, lymphoid tissue formations in the hepatic parenchyma, and an interstitial nephritis...|$|R
