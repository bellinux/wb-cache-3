Two {{discrete}} scheduling aspects mainly influence this process: the tankers' arrivals and the sequence of crude lots processed in the refinery. A simulation-based approach that can be applied as a simulator of the physics of the crude oil flow in the refinery system, as a learning support for personnel training, and as a decision support system (DSS) is proposed. The results of the application of the implemented system on a real small–medium-sized refinery system are presented...|$|E

40|$|This research" Management Plan for Effective Maintenance of Petroleum Tanks” {{was focused}} on <b>{{refinery}}</b> <b>tank</b> farm {{which is the largest}} oil product store in Sri Lanka. The refinery is operated as a heart of Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) which carries on business as a main importer, exporter, seller, supplier and distributor of Petroleum products in Sri Lanka. Storage plays very important role in the refinery so that it directly related to refinery operation an whole business of CPC. As per the observations, the <b>refinery</b> <b>tank</b> maintenance management system is currently facing many problems leading to ineffectiveness in maintenance management system as whole. The effort of this research is to address those problems via proposing best fit effective maintenance management system in order to overcome prevailing issues in <b>refinery</b> <b>tank</b> farm and bring the CPC to a profitable way. This research was based on Mix method approach which consists of quantitative and qualitative methods. In the first phase of this research, it was carried out wide data survey and questionnaire data collection in order to find out prevailing maintenance management issues and barriers within <b>refinery</b> <b>tank</b> farm. Semi structured expert interview was conducted as the second phase of this study base on the findings of first phase. The expert’s proposals and opinions were subjected to a detail content analysis in order to develop strategies and solutions for management plan of petroleum tank maintenance. This study revealed that <b>refinery</b> <b>tank</b> maintenance system has faced to a critical management failure in several aspects and it is required to have solution no more later. Finally, It was proposes a total management solution for those issues.

50|$|An Industrial fire {{is a type}} of {{industrial}} disaster involving a conflagration which occurs in an industrial setting. Industrial fires often, but not always, occur together with explosions. They are most likely to occur in facilities where {{there is a lot of}} flammable material present. Such material can include petroleum, petroleum products such as petrochemicals, or natural gas. Processing flammable materials such as hydrocarbons in units at high temperature and/or high pressure makes the hazards more severe. Facilities with such combustible material include oil <b>refineries,</b> <b>tank</b> farms (oil depots), natural gas processing plants, and chemical plants, particularly petrochemical plants. Such facilities often have their own fire departments for firefighting. Sometimes large amounts of dust or powder are vulnerable to combustion and their ignition can cause dust explosions. Severe industrial fires have involved multiple injuries, loss of life, costly financial loss, and/or damage to the surrounding community or environment.|$|R

40|$|Detection and {{localization}} of escaped hazardous gases is {{of great}} industrial and public interest {{in order to prevent}} harm to humans, nature and assets or just to prevent financial losses. The development of novel leak-detection technologies will yield better coverage of inspected objects while helping to lower plant operation costs at the same time. Moreover, inspection personnel can be relieved from repetitive work and focus on value-adding supervisory control and optimization tasks. The proposed system consists of autonomous mobile inspection robots that are equipped with several remote gas sensing devices and local intelligence. All-terrain robots with caterpillar tracks are used that can handle slopes, unpaved routes and offer maneuverability in restricted spaces as required for inspecting plants such as petroleum <b>refineries,</b> <b>tank</b> farms or chemical sites as well as sealed landfills. The robots can detect and locate gas leaks autonomously to a great extent using infrared optical spectroscopic and thermal remote sensing techniques and data processing. This article gives an overview of the components of the robotic system prototype, i. e. the robotic platform and the remote sensing and evaluation module. The software architecture, including the robot middleware and the measurement routines, are described.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Air {{emissions}} from the Map Ta Phut petrochemical complex in southeastern Thailand were studied. One {{focus of the}} research {{is the development of}} an emission inventory of the volatile organic compounds, benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). Emission sources were identified and the loading from all mobile and stationary sources were compiled. Based on this data set, the Industrial Source Complex Short-Term version 3 (ISCST- 3) was used to predict the contributions of the BTX species, which then were compared with the field measurements. The methodology of the emission inventory is described and evaluated with the shortcomings and areas of uncertainty. The relative importance of point, line and area sources and the influence of the local meteorology on the timing and place of concentration impacts are discussed. The coincidences and differences observed highlight the relative importance of source type and location, and of fugitive emissions and episode events. In particular, this research highlights the importance of area {{emissions from}} the petrochemical and petroleum industries, such as the oil <b>refineries</b> and <b>tank</b> farms, and identifies them as potential major contributors to the ambient BTX concentrations...|$|R

In this work, we present the first data on the levels of MTBE and BTEX in different groundwater wells in the area of Catalonia (northeast Spain). This monitoring campaign corresponded to 28 groundwater wells that were located near petrol service stations, oil <b>refinery</b> storage <b>tanks,</b> and/or chemical industry at different locations of Catalonia during the period of 1998 / 1999. The levels of MTBE detected varied between 4 — 300 μg/l, but two sites had MTBE levels up to 3 and 13 mg/l. In many cases, the BTEX levels were below 1 μg/l, whereas 7 sites had levels varying from 19 μg/l up to 3 mg/l. Most of them were related to leakage from underground tanks in petrol service stations, while the remaining three corresponded respectively to chemical industrial pollution of undetermined origin and to a leak from high-ground petrol <b>tanks</b> in petrochemical <b>refinery</b> factories. The aquifers involved were constituted by detritus coarse materials, sands, and conglomerates.
