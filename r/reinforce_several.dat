40|$|Observations {{were made}} {{of the effects of}} several plant regulators, indole- 3 -acetic acid, kinetin, abscisic acid, and {{gibberellic}} acid, as well as of extracts prepared from leaves and fruit stalks on the respiration pattern, ethylene production, and the number of days to ripen of avocado fruits (Persea americana Mill.). These substances were vacuum infiltrated to insure good penetration and distribution. Kinetin, abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, and the extracts had no effect on either ripening time or on the respiration pattern and ethylene production of the fruits. Indoleacetic acid, however, had a marked effect on ripening. At high concentrations (100 and 1000 μm), indoleacetic acid stimulated respiration and induced preclimacteric ethylene production, resulting in accelerated ripening of the fruits. At the low concentrations (1 and 10 μm), it delayed ripening of fruits and suppressed the climacteric respiration and ethylene production. The results <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> previous observations with other fruits that auxins may largely constitute `resistance to ripening' and may be responsible for the lack of ripening shown by unpicked fruits...|$|E
40|$|This report {{concludes that}} the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) should not contain an {{open-ended}} clause, one that would prohibit discrimination on grounds other than those specifically listed in the Act. One variant of an open-ended clause, an “unreasonable cause” provision, would reintroduce the discredited “distinction ” approach to equality issues, with its attendant negative consequences for women’s equality. Another version would amend the CHRA to mirror s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, thus likely incorporating into the CHRA the same analogous grounds that courts include in s. 15. It would not effectively address specific inequalities experienced by women, such as those resulting from poverty. Furthermore, it could <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> negative features of the current Canadian human rights system, such as valorizing the “prohibited ground ” approach to redressing women’s inequalities.

To this end, we describe key elements that help explain the origin of this process. Furthermore, this research has followed a qualitative research methodology, using the concept mapping technique, and grouping the different constructs items that act as motivating factors in the transformation of organizations to institutions. Methodologically we have tried to overlook the differentiation between old and new institutionalism, this approach follows the ideas of those researchers that question the suitability of drawing a line between {{the old and the new}} theory. We consider that the role of the CEO is essential in driving the institutionalization process, though usually their decisions are supported or have passed through the filter of the organization governance staff or the board of directors. Any progress that the organization makes depends fundamentally on the capabilities, perceptions, training and mindset of the CEO. The research results <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> key topics suggested in the literature on institutional theory.

This classification is consistent, to a larger extend, to the pillars of institutionalization that have been defined in the institutional theory literature, helping to understand, in more detail, the origin of the business processes and the background or motivations that generates and guide them...|$|E
40|$|Master of ArtsDepartment of HistoryMark P. ParilloAs the 1950 s began, Western European {{defense policy}} posed unique {{challenges}} for the United States. At {{the outset of the}} Cold War, U. S. officials recognized that maintaining a free Western Europe was vital to the long-term survival of the United States against the Soviet Union and its satellite nations. While America could rely on its long-range nuclear bombers (and, in a few years, its intercontinental ballistic missiles) as a deterrent to Soviet aggression against the continental United States, the situation in Europe was more complicated. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), first organized in 1949, was the defense pact designed to counter the Soviet Bloc in Eastern Europe. The NATO alliance, however, still recovering from the destruction of the Second World War, was in no condition to oppose Soviet aggression at the end of 1950. Yet by 1955, the situation in Europe was dramatically different. The NATO allies had transformed from a loose confederation of weak nations to a strong international alliance capable of confronting the Communist forces if necessary. At the center of this transformation was Dwight D. Eisenhower. In January 1951, Eisenhower assumed the position of NATO's first Supreme Allied Commander, Europe (SACEUR) and spent nearly two years strengthening the Western European alliance. Then, after entering the White House as president in 1953, Eisenhower used his experiences as SACEUR to <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> aspects of his own defense policy. Ultimately, several key aspects of Eisenhower's ―New Look‖ defense policy (such as the continued emphasis of the NATO alliance) had their antecedents in Eisenhower's service as NATO Supreme Commander...|$|E
40|$|Games Teaching Hydrologic Concepts to High School Students Author: Jocelynn Anderson Coauthors: Herman Dolder, Dr. Jim Nelson, Dr. Norm Jones In the United States {{there is}} an {{increasing}} shortage of skilled workers {{in the areas of}} science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). To counter this trend, increased emphasis is being placed by school districts and the government to improve STEM education in the K- 12 school system. This requires teachers {{to find new ways to}} present these subjects in order to get students interested in these fields. An area of study in STEM that is becoming increasingly important is hydrology. As the world’s population increases and the amount of available water per person is decreasing, understanding water management and water issues is essential. For this reason, a collection of games designed to teach high school students basic hydrologic concepts are being created by the Outreach team at Brigham Young University as part of the CI-WATER project funded by the National Science Foundation. These games, paired with lessons on subjects such as the water cycle, are intended to engage students in the learning process and increase their knowledge of various aspects of hydrology. The games are designed to be fun, while using what was taught in class in practical applications. The collection of games will <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> concepts including weather, snow runoff, irrigation requirements, evaporation, and reservoir management. From playing these games, students will have a more in depth understanding of basic hydrologic concepts and an increased interest in water issues around them. Additionally, after learning more about water issues, some students may develop a desire to pursue hydrology as a career...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A first {{generation}} of mobile robots {{able to cope with}} the high uncertainty of natural environments is starting to emerge. As a consequence, there is an increasing need for theoretical and practical courses that can formally teach {{the state of the art}} of the technology. This paper describes our experience teaching a Mobile Robotics course as part of our computer science curriculum for undergraduate students. The course has a strong experimental part, where the goal is to provide the students with a set of hand-on experiences using real mobile robots. In particular, we show how using a simple differential drive mobile platform and a low cost visual sensor, it is possible to teach the topics that are currently most relevant to the area of mobile robot programming for autonomous navigation. The course starts by illustrating low level control routines, such as locomotion, and simple behaviors, such as obstacle avoidance and target tracking in non-structured environments. Then, as the course moves to higher level tasks such as localization and mapping, the real world becomes too complex and a more structured world is needed. A structured world, called MazeWorld is then presented where we are able to illustrate high level topics using limited perception capabilities. In addition to the main parts of the class, we also describe the perception algorithms that we developed to achieve autonomous navigation in non-structured environments and in MazeWorld. Our experience indicates that the course is highly motivating for the students. They are able to <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> topics from the computer science curriculum and they learn the basis for advanced coursework, research, and the development of applications in Robotics and related fields, such as, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Perception.

To preorder the book, visit www. upjohninstitute. org/Publications/Titles/ WhatDoestheMinimumWageDo. What is now known as the new minimum wage research got its start at a conference at Cornell University in 1991. In the 10 years leading up to the conference, the number of articles studying the minimum wage as a share of all articles in economics had risen by 28 percent; in the subsequent 10 years, that increase was 81 percent. How did this conference stimulate the phenomenal growth of research on the minimum wage? By showing that minimum wage research could both ride and <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> new trends in economics regarding types of data analyzed, analytic approaches, and theories for understanding the data. Most empirical research prior to the conference had relied on data aggregated to the national level not only because of issues of data availability and low computational power, but also because the federal minimum wage was the effective minimum wage in almost every state. The paucity of increases in the federal minimum wage during the decade before the conference had led to greater variation in state minimum wages, and the rapid increase in computational power meant that it was no longer especially burdensome to analyze data that incorporated state-level variation. In the wake of these developments, Neumark and Wascher (1992) used the conference to introduce national state-level panels into research on the employment impact of the minimum wage, extending their analysis in later work to relate the employment consequences to other economic decisions, such as school enrollment (Neumark and Wascher 1995 a,b; 1996). Pursuing a different tack, Card (1992 a,b...|$|E
40|$|Shrinking {{government}} budgets due {{to economic}} woes has aerospace and defense contractors scrambling {{to sustain their}} business and minimize the effects of budget sequestration. Given the global economic climate {{and the level of}} federal debt, government budget spending is unlikely to recover in the near future to previous levels, where aerospace and defense contractors had enjoyed an abundance of million and billion dollar cost-reimbursable contracts. In current business conditions, company leadership has put a new focus on finding and developing business in adjacent markets, where core competencies can be utilized to generate alternative streams of revenue. In order to provide insight into potential adjacent markets for aerospace technologies and entry strategies that increase chances of success, this thesis analyzes cases of technologies originally developed for an aerospace application that were eventually adopted for use in another (non-aerospace) industry. Analysis of metrics and 35 cases compiled from NASA's Spinoff and Technology Databases <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> observations that have been generalized in other literature: 1) a wide variety of industries could be considered adjacent markets, 2) entering established industries may offer the highest technology adoption rate, 3) partnership with an existing firm or organization with knowledge of the adjacent market has {{played a key role in}} the successful adoption of the technology in the adjacent market, and 4) building-block technologies at the subsystem, component and base material level most often traversed market boundaries. However, a handful of cases prove that systems can traverse market boundaries in whole under certain conditions.

40|$|Bolivia {{is one of}} {{the poorest}} {{countries}} in Latin America. Children living in rural areas face challenges in gaining access to services such as education. For families living in poverty, the costs associated with education can be one prohibitive factor. In ensuring children’s right and thus access to education, civil society organizations play a role in ‘filling’ the gap for populations living in poverty such as the one included in this study. This paper aims to explore the experiences and attitudes of children attending two boarding schools run by a non-governmental organization in rural Bolivia. Qualitative data was generated through the use of multiple methods including semi-participant observation, drawings, sentence completion, ranking and semi-structured interviews with both children and adults. This study explores several key concepts in the Social Studies of Childhood Studies related to structure and agency. Set schedules and routines as well as inter-generational relations heavily define children’s daily lives in the boarding schools. These structures <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> socio-cultural values while promoting modern values such as education and equality. The research found that despite increased constraints on children’s space and time, children employ strategies to exercise agency and gain control over the use of their time. Children experience many benefits in the boarding schools such as food and shelter, social interaction with peers and adults and participating in group activities. Children are generally placed in the boarding schools for their best interest. Yet, most children are not consulted on their family’s decision and if given the option, many children would choose to return home to be with their families. Realizing children’s rights requires more than implementing the Articles in the UNCRC. Children are placed in the House for their right to education {{as well as for the}} provision of food and other needs. Nevertheless, education should not be a reason for children having to forego being with family. The boarding schools juxtapose children’s rights and well-being or what the Convention refers to as the best interest of the child. A holistic approach is therefore needed in order to assess both objective and subjective factors that play a role in children’s lives. A key component to this is to understand children’s perspectives as they fully comprehend their lived experiences and the factors they value for their well-being and better quality of life...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 Whimbrels Numenius phaeopus {{breed in}} tundra-like habitats, both beyond treeline {{and within the}} boreal forest of {{interior}} Alaska. Despite their widespread distribution and designation as a species of conservation concern, their ecology has been particularly understudied in Alaska. During 2008 [...] 2012, I initiated the first dedicated study of Whimbrel breeding ecology in Alaska, and the first such study of any boreal-breeding shorebird in the state. Within a habitat mosaic of forest, woodlands, muskeg, scrub, and ponds within the floodplain of the Kanuti River in north-central Alaska, Whimbrels bred in the three largest (of nine) patches of discontinuous tussock tundra. These Whimbrels exhibited a compressed annual breeding schedule with the first birds arriving about 6 May and nests hatching about 17 June. Evidence for clustered and synchronous nesting, which may aid in predator defense, was equivocal. Most (69 %) Whimbrels nested in mixed shrub-sedge tussock bog. I modeled nest-site selection at multiple spatial scales for 39 nests; however, the only variables important in the models were at the finest scale around the nest, namely that nests tended to be located on hummocks and exhibited lateral cover. Model results for nest survival of 67 nests over 4 years revealed a considerable difference in nest success (92 % vs. 41 %) at the two largest patches studied; this site effect was largely unexplained. To investigate Whimbrel ecology more broadly in the boreal biome, in 2013 I designed and conducted a Whimbrel-specific survey comprising 279 point counts within 28 transects along the road system of interior Alaska. I detected Whimbrels on just 32 % of transects and 11 % of count points. Although I detected Whimbrels at 3 sites where {{they had not been}} reported previously, I failed to detect them at several historically occupied sites. Dwarf shrub meadow was the most commonly observed habitat for all points visited. I modeled Whimbrel presence based on coarse habitat and avifaunal community features; no models were well supported. Between the local and regional surveys, my results tended to <b>reinforce</b> <b>several</b> widespread, but not necessarily investigated, descriptions about the breeding ecology of Whimbrels. My studies supported the premises that Whimbrels are patchily distributed on the landscape and often breed in clusters. Breeding of individuals and occupancy of some patches may be annually variable. Despite analyses of multiple habitat features at multiple spatial scales, I mostly observed a lack of specificity in where they bred among tundra-like patches, and where they nested specifically within such patches. This suggests that Whimbrels are tundra habitat generalists on their breeding grounds. Such phenotypic plasticity may be particularly adaptive in the dynamic, wildfire-prone landscape of interior Alaska...|$|E
