5|$|In 1823, {{the state}} {{legislature}} chose Rowan and Henry Clay to represent the defendant in a second <b>rehearing</b> of Green v. Biddle before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, which involved the constitutionality of laws passed by the General Assembly relating to land titles granted in Kentucky when the state was still a part of Virginia, was {{of interest to the}} legislature. The Supreme Court, however, refused the second <b>rehearing,</b> letting stand their previous opinion that Kentucky's laws were in violation of the compact of separation from Virginia.|$|E
5|$|On January 13, 2014, the Court {{denied the}} {{petition}} for Certiorari. In March 2014, the Court denied a Petition for <b>Rehearing</b> filed in February 2014, letting the Ninth Circuit's decision stand, {{along with the}} reasonable suspicion standard it created.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} three judges then {{agreed to}} <b>rehear</b> the case themselves. The original August 2006 judgment, {{which had been}} mandatory precedent only in the District of Columbia, was vacated.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2015, the Ninth Circuit panel {{withdrew the}} September 2014 opinion {{and agreed to}} <b>rehear</b> the case. [...] In May 2016, the panel again held that Doe's case could proceed.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Cruz had appealed. In December, 1992, {{his second}} {{conviction}} was {{upheld by the}} Illinois Supreme Court, but in May 1993 the court agreed to <b>rehear</b> the case, and on July 14, 1994, Cruz was ordered a third trial.|$|R
5|$|The state {{sought a}} <b>rehearing</b> en banc, {{but the entire}} court of appeals refused to rehear the case after it deadlocked in a 5-to-5 vote.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1906, the Supreme Court upheld Burton's convictions. That same day, {{another of}} Burton's lawyers, former Senator John Mellen Thurston, filed a {{petition}} for <b>rehearing,</b> which operated as a 60-day continuance, and in effect stayed the matter much longer because the Court {{was set to}} adjourn until October.|$|E
5|$|After the Ninth Circuit {{issued its}} ruling in the direct appeal, {{the case was}} remanded to the {{district}} court for further proceedings. Washington submitted {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court of the United States, but the Supreme Court denied the state's petition for certiorari and subsequent petition for <b>rehearing.</b> Despite these rulings, the parties in the original case continued to litigate issues relating to apportionment of the fisheries and subsequent rulings have been issued as recently as May 2015.|$|E
50|$|The Ninth Circuit {{agreed to}} <b>rehear</b> the appeal before a 15-judge en banc panel in February 2006. On December 5, 2006, {{by a vote}} of 8 - 7, the en banc panel {{reversed}} the earlier decision by the three-judge panel, affirming Kay's earlier ruling.|$|R
5|$|In spring 1953, the Court {{heard the}} case {{but was unable}} to decide the issue and asked to <b>rehear</b> the case in fall 1953, with special {{attention}} to whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibited the operation of separate public schools for whites and blacks.|$|R
50|$|Hill's {{case was}} {{returned}} to the district court after the Supreme Court declined to <b>rehear</b> the matter or to offer additional clarifying information on {{the resolution of the}} issue. On March 18, Judge Campbell set a three-week time frame for the next part of the case.|$|R
5|$|He {{would carry}} the day after federal {{prosecutors}} appealed for an en banc <b>rehearing</b> by the entire court, reiterating that point for an eight-judge majority and saying that unless Jacobson could demonstrate that a specifically protected right had been violated by the investigation, the conviction should stand. The majority also rejected the entrapment defense, arguing that the postal investigators had merely provided Jacobson with opportunities to purchase child pornography and not sought to affect his predisposition (an important element in entrapment under U.S. law) {{to do so in}} any way.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, 2011, Bonds {{was sentenced}} to 30 days of house arrest, two years of {{probation}} and 250 hours of community service, for an obstruction of justice conviction stemming from a grand jury appearance in 2003. However, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston then delayed the sentence pending an appeal. In 2013 his conviction was upheld on appeal by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. However, the full court later granted Bonds an en banc <b>rehearing,</b> and on April 22, 2015, an 11-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit voted 10-1 to overturn his conviction.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a <b>rehearing</b> en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
50|$|The Cayuga Indian Nation of New York sought {{review of}} this {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States, which was denied on May 15, 2006. The time in which the Cayuga Indian Nation could ask the U.S. Supreme Court to <b>rehear</b> the case has passed.|$|R
50|$|In spring 1953, the Court {{heard the}} case {{but was unable}} to decide the issue and asked to <b>rehear</b> the case in fall 1953, with special {{attention}} to whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibited the operation of separate public schools for whites and blacks.|$|R
50|$|In February 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals {{concluded}} that the Communications Decency Act did not bar Jane Doe's claim, and remanded {{the case to the}} district court for further proceedings.

5|$|Cohen {{thereafter}} {{launched a}} media offensive claiming the DRS was biased {{in favor of}} large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet. Cohen stated {{he believed that the}} DRS system was unfair {{for a number of reasons}} and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review. Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS. Cohen refused and, after several months, instead issued proceedings for judicial review. The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen's case in August 2005, noting that Cohen's company, Cyberbritain Group Ltd., should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet's domain resolution service. Afterward, Cohen's company asked for a <b>rehearing</b> and, as that case progressed, the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site. In November 2005, Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple.|$|E
25|$|After {{the error}} was discovered, {{supporters}} of the law—including the governors of Missouri and Louisiana, and 85 members of Congress—petitioned for <b>rehearing.</b> The United States Department of Justice also filed a brief supporting <b>rehearing.</b> It noted that it too had missed the 2006 amendment; since it {{has a duty to}} defend all federal laws, and since the decision called that law into question, it was duty–bound to favor <b>rehearing.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 2014, Santai-Gaffney filed a {{petition}} in the Third Circuit to rehear her motion to intervene, or to rehear it en banc.

The ruling was temporarily stayed to allow {{an appeal to the}} U.S. Supreme Court.|$|R
2500|$|The City of Salinas {{subsequently}} {{petitioned the}} appellate court to <b>rehear</b> the Salinas case, but that petition was denied.

50|$|In the Ariosa litigation, the District Court (N.D.Cal.) {{held that}} the '540 patent was invalid because it claimed a natural phenomenon, the {{presence}} of cell-free fetal DNA fragments in maternal blood.
