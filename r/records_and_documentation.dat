40|$|Aims and Methods. Conducting {{a survey}} {{study of a}} large number of {{patients}} and gastroenterologists aimed at identifying relevant predictors of interest in digital <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> (DRD) of endoscopic procedures. Outpatients presenting to the endoscopy unit at our institution for an endoscopy examination were anonymously surveyed, regarding their views and opinions of a possible recording of the procedure. A parallel survey for gastroenterologists was conducted. Results. 417 patients and 62 gastroenterologists participated in two parallel surveys regarding DRD of endoscopic procedures. 66. 4 % of the patients expressed interest in digital documentation of their endoscopic procedure, with 90. 5 % of them requesting a copy. 43. 6 % of the physicians supported digital recording while 27. 4 % opposed it, with 48. 4 % opposing to making a copy of the recording available to the patient. No sociodemographic or background factors predicted patient’s interest in DRD. 66 % of the physicians reported having recording facilities in their institutions, but only 43. 6 % of them stated performing recording. Having institutional guidelines for DRD was found to be the only significant predictor for routine recording. Conclusions. Our study exposes patients’ positive views of digital <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> of endoscopic procedures. In contrast, physicians appear to be much more reluctant towards DRD and are centrally motivated by legal concerns when opposing DRD, as well as when supporting it...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Poor {{harmonization}} {{of critical}} results management {{is present in}} various laboratories and countries, including Croatia. We aimed to investigate procedures used in critical results reporting in Croatian medical biochemistry laboratories (MBLs). Materials and methods: An anonymous questionnaire, consisting of 24 questions/statements, related to critical results reporting procedures, was send to managers of MBLs in Croatia. Participants were asked to declare the frequency of performing procedures and degree of agreement with statements about critical values reporting using a Likert scale. Total score and mean scores for corresponding separate statements divided according to health care setting were calculated and compared. Results: Responses from 111 Croatian laboratories (48 %) were analyzed. General practice laboratories (GPLs) more often re-analyzed the sample before reporting the critical result {{in comparison with the}} hospital laboratories (HLs) (score: 4. 86 (4. 75 - 4. 96) vs. 4. 49 (4. 25 - 4. 72); P = 0. 001) and more often reported the critical value exclusively to the responsible physician compared to HLs (4. 46 (4. 29 - 4. 64) vs. 3. 76 (3. 48 - 4. 03), P < 0. 001). High total score (4. 69 (4. 56 - 4. 82)) was observed for selection of the critical results list issued by the Croatian Chamber of Medical Biochemistry (CCMB) indicating a high harmonization level for this aspect of critical result management. Low total scores were observed for the statements regarding data <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> of critical result notification. Conclusions: Differences in practices about critical results reporting between HLs and GPLs were found.

40|$|Background: Heart failure (HF) is {{a complex}} and highly {{debilitating}} clinical syndrome. International guidelines identify the optimum clinical management of patients living with HF in primary care but translation of these into practice remains inadequate. The aim of this service evaluation is to measure standards of HF diagnosis and management, {{before and after the}} implementation of The Greater Manchester Heart Failure Investigation Tool (GM-HFIT), a facilitated ‘tool kit’ designed to optimise HF care. Methods: The GM-HFIT was developed as a means of assessing and improving care and was implemented as part of a facilitated service improvement and evaluation in primary care using a prospective, pre-test, post-test design. Results: Anonymised pre- and post-audit data were taken from a sample of 1130 cases entered on general practice HF registers. These cases were from two clinical commissioning groups (39 general practices) in the north west of England and were analysed to compare HF management and treatment parameters against clinical guidelines. Implementation of the GM-HFIT tool kit was associated with a {{reduction in the number of}} patients inappropriately placed on the HF register (p< 0. 001), an improvement in the <b>recording</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentation</b> of pulse rate and rhythm (p= 0. 005) and the proportion of patients receiving the target dose of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers (p< 0. 001).

The {{purpose of the study was}} to seek answers to the research questions pertaining to structured {{on-the-job training}} in the Malaysian workplace. To achieve this, the research design involved a micro-level qualitative single- case study in a purposefully selected manufacturing company in Johor whose training program was unplanned. The research procedures included a review of specific archival <b>records</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentations</b> using a prescribed checklist to understand the barriers in planning the proposed training program. Further, the proposed structured onthe- job training program based on a revised ADDIE Model comprising of the synthesis of the various training and management concepts was conceptualized with the aid of customized worksheets to address five selected performance problems. The performance problems involved three types of training i. e. technical, managerial, and awareness, which encompass the various job functions and job levels. The respective worksheets/checklists were instrumental in both data collection and analysis and the sources of data for the case study were from literature, archival <b>records</b> <b>and</b> <b>documentations.</b> The results of the case study reaffirmed that structured on the job training could meet the business objectives of an organization by focusing on key performance indicators, which could be established using the Balanced Scorecard system.

Further, structured on-the-job training could be planned not only for technical training but also for managerial and awareness training across all job functions and levels.
