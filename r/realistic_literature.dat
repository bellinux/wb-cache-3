This dislike of non-traditional stories continued there until the beginning of the next century.

60|$|But such disgusts as {{this are}} {{for the man who}} really aims at taking a house. The artist house-hunter knows better than that.

I have heard, indeed, of old ladies who enlivened the intervals of their devotions in this manner, but to the general run of people the thing is unknown. Yet a more entertaining way of spending a half-holiday--having regard to current taste--it should be difficult to imagine. An empty house is <b>realistic</b> <b>literature</b> in the concrete, full of hints and allusions if a little wanting in tangible humanity, and it outdoes the modern story in its own line, by beginning as well as ending in a note of interrogation. That it is not more extensively followed I can only explain by supposing that its merits are generally unsuspected. In which case this book should set a fashion.|$|E
60|$|Now, it is {{this great}} gap in modern ethics, the absence of vivid {{pictures}} of purity and spiritual triumph, which lies {{at the back of}} the real objection felt by so many sane men to the <b>realistic</b> <b>literature</b> of the nineteenth century. If any ordinary man ever said that he was horrified by the subjects discussed in Ibsen or Maupassant, or by the plain language in which they are spoken of, that ordinary man was lying. The average conversation of average men throughout the whole of modern civilization in every class or trade is such as Zola would never dream of printing. Nor is the habit of writing thus of these things a new habit. On the contrary, it is the Victorian prudery and silence which is new still, though it is already dying. The tradition of calling a spade a spade starts very early in our literature and comes down very late. But the truth is that the ordinary honest man, whatever vague account he may have given of his feelings, was not either disgusted or even annoyed at the candour of the moderns. What disgusted him, and very justly, was not the presence of a clear realism, but the absence of a clear idealism. Strong and genuine religious sentiment has never had any objection to realism; on the contrary, religion was the realistic thing, the brutal thing, the thing that called names. This is the great difference between some recent developments of Nonconformity and the great Puritanism of the seventeenth century. It was the whole point of the Puritans that they cared nothing for decency. Modern Nonconformist newspapers distinguish themselves by suppressing precisely those nouns and adjectives which the founders of Nonconformity distinguished themselves by flinging at kings and queens. But if it was a chief claim of religion that it spoke plainly about evil, it was the chief claim of all that it spoke plainly about good. The thing which is resented, and, as I think, rightly resented, in that great modern literature of which Ibsen is typical, is that while the eye that can perceive what are the wrong things increases in an uncanny and devouring clarity, the eye which sees what things are right is growing mistier and mistier every moment, till it goes almost blind with doubt. If we compare, let us say, the morality of the DIVINE COMEDY with the morality of Ibsen's GHOSTS, we shall see all that modern ethics have really done. No one, I imagine, will accuse the author of the INFERNO of an Early Victorian prudishness or a Podsnapian optimism. But Dante describes three moral instruments--Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell, the vision of perfection, the vision of improvement, and the vision of failure. Ibsen has only one--Hell. It is often said, and with perfect truth, that no one could read a play like GHOSTS and remain indifferent to the necessity of an ethical self-command. That is quite true, and the same is to be said of the most monstrous and material descriptions of the eternal fire. It is quite certain the realists like Zola do in one sense promote morality--they promote it in the sense in which the hangman promotes it, in the sense in which the devil promotes it. But they only affect that small minority which will accept any virtue of courage. Most healthy people dismiss these moral dangers as they dismiss the possibility of bombs or microbes. Modern realists are indeed Terrorists, like the dynamiters; and they fail just as much in their effort to create a thrill. Both realists and dynamiters are well-meaning people engaged in the task, so obviously ultimately hopeless, of using science to promote morality.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 58 - 61) In 1891, Hamlin Garland, {{a student}} of literature from South Dakota, published a volume of short stories entitled Main-Travelled Roads. The stories depict the people {{and way of life}} on the frontier that Garland came to know well, being himself a member of a pioneer family. With these stories, Garland intended to present a true and complete picture of life on the frontier. Garland had become disillusioned with the romantic and sentimental notions that totally dominated frontier literature, as they came to dominate all of popular American fiction by the 1880 s. But in the early 1900 s, a literary realism began to gain a foothold in American fiction as literature began to reflect the changes in America???s economic and social structures that developed after the Civil War, and to feel the wave of scientific and literary theories from abroad. Among the serious writers, William Dean Howells assumed a commanding position in the struggle for the acceptance of literary realism. The development of <b>realistic</b> frontier <b>literature</b> contributed a solid foundation for the emergence of a literary realism. The works of Edward Eggleston, Edgar Watson Howe, and Joseph Kirkland best represented Mid-West realistic writing. Before Garland published Main-Travelled Roads, Joseph Kirkland's Zury (1887) was the leading example of <b>realistic</b> Mid-West <b>literature.</b> Although Garland had praised Zury for being "the best picture of pioneer Illinois life yet written," he still felt it necessary to go beyond Kirkland's realistic account of frontier life. While studying I for a career as a teacher of literature, Garland formulated, a critical system based on an evolutionary theory of literary values. With this critical system, Garland found Howells to be the one significant evolutionary writer of the time. Howells' works dealt with contemporary social life and the average rather than the exceptional characteristics of an evolutionary literature Garland had identified. Garland wished to become the next significant evolutionary writer after Howells. He developed for himself a completely new alternative to realism that he called veritism. Veritistic writing combined the writer's sincere and powerful emotional response to the life around him and impressionistic technique used to convey that response to others. Thus by writing veritistic art Garland perceived himself becoming the next evolutionary writer of significance while presenting a more faithful account of life on the Mid-West prairie than Kirkland had done. The thesis argues that as Garland's deeply felt emotions concerning the prairie and its people gain substance in Main-Travelled Roads, the stories take on a naturalistic perspective of the frontier. Through a comparison between Kirkland's treatment of the frontier in Zury and Garland's treatment in Main-Travelled Roads one can see that a movement form realism to naturalism did, indeed, evolve...|$|R

It was an extension of a study conducted by Therese Bissen Bard. ^ Elementary school library circulation records from two schools, one with children of high socio-economic status and one with children of low socio-economic status, were examined. The data from each school were analyzed separately to determine the categories of literature present in the sample. The data were then organized, classified, and summarized into frequency distributions using these categories. The circulation figures were adjusted to compensate for the difference in the number of students in each school. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test for differences based on the adjusted circulation figures. For each school a list of titles that circulated frequently enough to be one or more standard deviations above the mean circulation was compiled. These results were analyzed to determine if any differences existed between type of literature as well as specific titles preferred by children of each socio-economic group. ^ Findings revealed that the students of low socio-economic status preferred imaginative-easy literature while the students of high socio-economic status preferred imaginative-non-fiction books. Significant {{differences were found between the}} two groups in their preferences for content books, imaginative <b>literature,</b> <b>realistic</b> fiction, and easy books on the basis of the number of titles in each class and category.

Their knowledge at Σ 3 twin boundaries {{may be of}} interest for {{a better understanding of}} the mechanical behaviour of f. c. c. materials that can display lamellar twin structures such as TWIP steels or general nanotwinned materials. In this paper, incompatibility stresses arising at general twin boundaries are explicitly derived for a given twin volume fraction. They are deduced from the solutions of the general infinite bicrystal, which is equivalent to a periodic layered structure. In the case of pure elasticity and Σ 3 twin boundaries, the result is of remarkable simplicity. The incompatibility stress field reduces to a shear stress acting upon a plane orthogonal to twin plane. Simple analytical expressions of the resolved shear stresses are also determined according to the twin boundary orientation, the twin volume fraction and the elastic anisotropy factor. Such expressions allow performing a comprehensive study of slip initiation. In particular, there exists a large physical domain, depending on the three above parameters, where simultaneous slip parallel to twin plane in the parent and in the twin is greatly promoted. There is also a restricted domain where simultaneous single slip parallel to twin plane is promoted. The conditions for these promotions are <b>realistic</b> considering the <b>literature</b> data on TWIP steels. The present results hence support the high ductility and strong contribution of kinematic hardening observed in TWIP steels and agree with composite hardening models with single and multislip deforming grains...|$|R
