40|$|In {{this study}} we present a method for Displacements Prediction in Double-Arch Dam <b>Rock</b> <b>Abutment</b> Using SPSS Software Based on Extensometer Readings. Displacement in dams is the most {{tangible}} and important parameter which could be crucial in their safety. Different elevation displacements are yielded by various loadings and the thrust force imposed on foundation and abutment. Most concrete dams are constructed on stone foundations. Displacements in foundation and abutment are measured by extensometers. Karun 4 Concrete dam is designed with 11 galleries, from elevation 1016 to 802 m, in the order from top elevation (dam crest elevation 1032) to the bottom elevation (dam foundation elevation 806) within the dam body. As a whole, 19 extensometers in the left bank, 17 in the right, and one more in the middle are implemented in the dam. Karun 4 dam has already been impounded with water up to the elevation 1003. Displacements in Karun 4 are recorded by extensometers whence water was leveled in 7 elevations 943. 68, 953. 36, 973. 55, 983. 28, 993. 17, 1003. 13. In this study, using SPSS {{we have tried to}} predict the displacements for a situation in which water will be elevated to the elevations 1013, 1023, 1032 in the future for elevations which are equipped with anchor. The most predicted displacement pertaining to the left bank when water was leveled to the elevation 1013, was 3. 65 mms by R 2 = 0. 9997 for the implemented anchor. Proceeding further, as water is leveled to the elevations 1023 and 1033, the most predicted displacement respectively would be 4. 31 and 5. 66 by R 2 = 0. 9941; and is related to the anchor implemented in the elevation 936. 05. The most predicted displacement for the right bank is 5. 9397, 7. 2347 and 8. 6877 mms by R 2 = 0. 9995 for the elevation 888. 128 m...|$|E

The spillway {{is located on the}} embankment, rather than on one of the <b>rock</b> <b>abutments.</b> This had never been successfully attempted before in the design of dams of any significant height, due to problems in making allowance for embankment settlements. In the case of Crotty Dam, the embankment was partly composed of well graded gravels, and thus a very high modulus of embankment deformation was achieved. The high modulus limits embankment settlements. Additionally, the spillway was designed to articulate in order to accommodate any settlement that did occur.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Stability {{reliability}} analysis of <b>abutment</b> <b>rock</b> of arch dam {{is a very}} complicated problem which must be studied and solved. Generally, entirely sliding stability {{reliability analysis}} should be made when <b>abutment</b> <b>rock</b> bounded by structure planes like fault, joints and fissures, and layers is possible to slide. Due to the complex causes and structures, diverse litholigy, different rocks have different mechanics attributes. While the physical and mechanical parameters of the same rocks are of obvious dispersion and uncertainty. And it is also complex to calculate the pushing force at arch abutment on dam <b>abutment</b> <b>rock,</b> because the uncertain factors as water pressure, sediment, variable temperatures and materials parameters are contained. In this essay, based on Stochastic Finite Element Method, the formula of sliding stability reliability analysis of dam <b>abutment</b> <b>rock</b> is given.

30|$|Information {{about the}} in situ {{stresses}} {{of the rock}} field is a fundamental parameter for the dam–foundation analysis and has a direct effect on dynamic design of such a coupled system. The in situ stress in a rock mass is simply equal to {{the weight of the}} overlying material; therefore, the discontinuities will control the magnitude and direction of this stress field. In this study, firstly the static load of discontinuous rock weight was applied to investigate the in situ stress. For this loading case, the dam body should remain free of stress because of canyon deformation. To overcome this problem, the numerical program has the ability to change the material properties in loading steps. Therefore, in a pre-loading step, Young’s modulus of dam body and a region of the <b>rock</b> <b>abutments</b> near the dam gradually decrease and Poisson’s ratio increases to 0.49. In the next dummy load step, material properties gradually change to real values.|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of stope performance data from the narrow vein Kundana Gold mine in Western Australia has been made using the extended Mathews stability graph method and comparative statistics. For these Kundana stopes, a poor correlation was found between stope stability and both the Mathews stability number N and hydraulic radius HR. Given that both N and HR correlate well with stability {{in the vast majority}} of Mathews method case histories, this suggested that there is an overriding influence on stability at Barkers not accounted for in the Mathews method. Drill and blast issues were isolated as the most likely cause of this poor correlation. Blast pattern was found to have a statistically significant effect on overbreak. In terms of the drill and blast patterns used at the mine, the inline pattern performed significantly better than both the 2 ̆ 7 staggered 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 dice- 52 ̆ 7 patterns for the vein geometries at the time. Undercut footwalls were found to behave in a similar manner to non-undercut hangingwalls. There was no evidence that backfill abutments behave differently from solid <b>rock</b> <b>abutments</b> in terms of determination of stable stope dimensions. Drillhole accuracy was indirectly examined by considering the effect of stope heights within the limits of 13 - 20 m. Within these limits, stope height did not affect the magnitude of overbreak...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} Mathews {{method for}} predicting stope stability {{has been extended}} and now contains 483 open stoping and caving case histories {{over a wide range}} of geotechnical conditions and stope dimensions. The mathematical framework upon which the Extended Mathews stability graph is based and the large database has facilitated examination of a number of outstanding issues surrounding the application of empirical stability graphs. This paper summarises how the framework of the Extended Mathews stability graph framework has been applied to quantify the effect of stress relaxation upon excavation stability, examine site-specifi c effects and highlight the poor correlation between stability graph parameters for narrow stope stability. Back-analysis of case studies where stope surfaces were relaxed has enabled the effect of stress relaxation upon excavation stability to be quantified and bounded. Detailed statistical analyses have demonstrated that a reliable stable-failure boundary requires at least 150 case histories, of which a minimum of 10 % should be unstable stope surfaces. Marginal site-specifi c effects were observed for the operating conditions captured within the database. Apparent site-specifi c effects noted in previous literature were found to be attributable to operating conditions inadequately represented in the database. Statistical analysis of overbreak from 115 narrow-vein case studies has demonstrated that operating conditions in narrow-vein mines differ suffi ciently to warrant changes in the model framework to account for undercutting of stope walls and drill and blast parameters.

The Heidong cavern group consisting of 21 caverns was constructed about 1400 years ago for quarrying in massive Cretaceous tuff. The cavern No. 5 of the Heidong cavern group is characterized by an unsupported span up to 92  m, with the overburden thickness of only 3 – 25  m. To analyze its long-term stability, a detailed investigation was conducted to obtain its geometry and rock mass characteristics, and to monitor surrounding rock displacements. Based on field survey and laboratory tests, numerical simulations were performed using the finite difference code FLAC 3 D. The analysis results revealed that for the long-term {{stability of}} the cavern No. 5, some major factors should be carefully considered, such as cavern excavation method in hard massive rocks, site investigation using trial pits, tools like short iron chisel and hammer for manual excavation, geometric dome roof, and waste <b>rocks</b> within <b>abutment</b> or on the floor.

40|$|A {{convenient}} {{approach to}} performing stability analysis of concrete gravity dams {{is the so-called}} two dimensional ‘‘gravity method. ’’ However, concrete gravity dams located in valleys with sloped <b>rock</b> foundation <b>abutments</b> behave as three-dimensional (3 D) structures and are often able to share compressive and shear loads between adjacent monoliths, especially when shear keys are present. A general 3 D limit equilibrium method was developed in this study to compute global sliding safety factors (SSFg) by considering sequential load redistribution among adjacent monoliths when individual monoliths have mobilized their sliding strength. Two validation examples of the sliding safety assessment of existing dams are presented to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach {{compared to that of}} the full 3 D numerical analyses conducted using the distinct element method. It is shown that gravity dams may be formed by individual monoliths on sloped rock foundations that will slide if considered as isolated structures but will constitute a stable assembly when the load-sharing capabilities of monoliths are recognized in the analysis.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of large structures mostly requires a complete three dimensional finite element discretization. Stability of such structures {{includes not only}} the stability of structure itself but also that of foundation as well as interconnection elements. The general instability of a structure may be affected by two aspects, firstly, an inappropriate preliminary classical design of the structure and inadequate control over the geometry {{and quality of the}} materials used for construction. Secondary, the foundation <b>rock</b> and <b>abutments</b> may contain a number of faults and joints which may be unfavorable to stability of the structure. Therefore it is necessary to consider appropriately the influence of interaction between the structure, foundation and abutments under static and dynamic loads. from construction point of view some of the structures such arch dams are divided into vertical blocks, which are separated by vertical joints which are grouted at the later stage. Since the behavior of such and many other structures whose have contraction joints under static and dynamic loads depends largely on those joints, therefore, the presence of structural codes that can recommend the appropriate specifications on modeling these joints, seems to be necessary. The present study contribution deals with the development of three dimensional finite element software including interfacial behavior of joints between different substructures and interaction behavior of structure and foundation to evaluate the safety of the structure subjected to static and dynamic loads. The developed software is verified upon different points of view and the results are in agreement with experiments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Great {{achievements}} {{have been}} made in rock mass structure research to evaluate engineering properties of rock mass in the engineering geology field. In fact, rock mass structure can not only indicate the quantity of structural planes (discontinuities) and size of rock blocks, but also indicate the integrity and mechanical properties of the rock mass. More and more {{attention has been paid to}} rock mass quality classification by using rock mass structure. During the past 40 years, rock mass structure research has been carried out by many scholars, and various standards of rock mass structure classification have been proposed in different industries of different countries. In these standards, the most widely used index was the spacing of structural plane. However, it is a pity that the method of determining the spacing value is not unified in different standards, therefore, the structure type of a rock mass may be different according to different standard. But which kind of method to determine the spacing value is most reasonable? It becomes an important problem to be solved.

50|$|Bream are {{commonly}} caught around structures within an estuary, including fallen branches, piers, <b>rock</b> walls, bridge <b>abutments</b> and other man made structures {{as well as}} on mud and sand banks where shellfish and crustaceans dwell.Although bream are opportunistic feeders, they can often be very difficult to catch in areas subject to high fishing pressure. Light fishing lines and sinkers are used to avoid spooking the fish and, as with all fishing, live bait produces the best results. Various crustaceans such as nippers, prawns and crabs {{are commonly}} used alongside various species of beach and tube worm. Frozen and cut bait such as prawns, mussels, cockles and fish pieces are also effective. Rigs are usually kept simple and light, with running ball or bean sinkers used on a light line from two up to four kilograms in breaking strength tied to a size 6 - 1 hook. In fast flowing waters, heavier sinkers may be needed to keep the bait in the target area long enough to be noticed by a fish. Burley is often introduced into the water, with chopped pilchards or chicken pellets soaked in fish oil popular amongst anglers. In recent years, the use of lures and flies on southern black bream has been successfully developed, with the species known to attack both hard bodied minnow and spinnerbait type lures, as well as soft plastic lures and saltwater flies.|$|R

It is loosely structured and its strength is low, with some development of pores and cavities. Research on the hydro-mechanical coupling of the altered rock are of important significance to hydropower projects. In this study, the advanced fully automatic triaxial fluid flow-rheological test servo system is employed to study the hydro-mechanical coupling characteristics of the altered rock, and the water pressures and confining pressures in the laboratory tests are set to simulate the conditions of excavation and impoundment of Xiaowan Hydropower Station. Based on the test results, the stress-strain laws of the rock specimens under the effect of complete hydro-mechanical coupling, as well as the lateral strain and volumetric strain characteristics, are studied. The fluid flow laws of the rock specimens and the effects of the confining pressures on the fluid flow are analyzed. The fluid flow failure characteristic under the effect of the complete hydro-mechanical coupling is discussed. The research achievements show that with the change of the stress states, the permeability of the rock also changes, and the permeability evolution shows the phase characteristic during the process of stress and strain. The impacts of the confining pressures on the strength and deformation and permeability of the altered rock are obvious. The failure behaviours of the rock specimens under the effect of coupling relates to the confining pressures, including two kinds of splitting failure and shear failure. The fluid flow failure characteristic of the rock specimens depend upon the initiation, growth and coalesce of micro-cracks, heterogeneity, confining pressures and properties of the rock...|$|R
40|$|To reduce {{long-term}} {{maintenance costs}} {{arising from the}} deterioration of concrete bridges due to leaky expansion joints, integral bridges have been becoming increasingly popular in many countries. Abandoning expansion joints leads to complex soil-structure interaction problems including those caused by cyclic temperature changes in the deck. These have adverse effects {{on the performance of}} integral bridges in terms of deformation mechanisms, lateral earth pressures acting on the abutment wall, bending moment and axial stress in the deck. All these are of great concern to engineers. Centrifuge model tests were conducted on spread-base integral bridge abutments to simulate these temperature effects on the soil-structure interaction. Thermal expansion and contraction of the deck were modelled by imposing controlled cyclic displacements {{at the top of the}} abutment wall. Substantial horizontal sliding and the <b>rocking</b> of the <b>abutment</b> due to soil densification and "strain" ratchetting were observed. The measured lateral earth pressure increased with the amplitude of the displacements into the fill (in the passive sense) and the number of cycles, but at a decreasing rate. For the ultimate limit state and the 1 in 120 years return event, the measured lateral earth pressure coefficient was 3. 7 and 4. 2 for the abutment backfilled with dense and loose sand respectively. The measured bending moments varied fairly linearly with depth, rather than varying as a cubic function with depth as would be expected for a relatively flexible wall subjected to a triangular distribution of lateral pressure.

40|$|Substantial {{vulnerability}} of single-leaf vaults has repeatedly {{been observed in}} the aftermath of past earthquakes. Major vault damage or even collapse may follow the onset of mechanisms such as the indirect bending of the vault crown caused by the unconstrained <b>rocking</b> of the <b>abutments,</b> the shear failure of the vault lunettes induced by possible differential rocking of the supporting masonries, and the direct differential bending induced by the inertia forces acting as a uniformly distributed horizontal load along the vault crown. Unlike other mechanisms, which can be inhibited by traditional global retrofit interventions aimed at triggering a box-like seismic response of the existing building, limiting direct bending requires targeted measures on the vault crown. In this paper, extrados lightweight plywood restraining structures applying passive confinement actions are conceived to delay the onset of the vault direct bending failure mechanism. The reinforcement is designed as a 3 -hinged arch, hinged-constrained at the springing and at the vault key section to enable small relative displacements of the vault springing, which may follow the deformation of any internal ties or roof box structure. The technique is a lightweight and dry solution that does not require specialised labour; it is reversible and minimally impairs the structure's integrity, thus respecting major restoration principles. The effectiveness of the solution is verified through an experimental study on the behaviour of a strengthened single-leaf vault, also in the case of possible relative displacements of the abutments. A special pivoting testing frame is conceived to apply cyclic, uniformly distributed inertia-like forces. The strengthened vault is shown to substantially outperform the response of an unreinforced single leaf vault, tested in a previous research study...|$|R

We followed two US manuals for design of arch dams and designed our dam accordingly. These two manuals are published by United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) and Interior Department of United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The thesis starts with some basic information about arch dams. A review of references which are used in thesis is provided in chapter two. The static analysis of arch dam and {{the description of the}} selection procedures are presented with a brief description about finite element method (FEM) and its application. Layout and initial modeling of the dam were done by two graphical software; AutoCad and SketchUp. Analysis of the dam is based on FEM as implemented in SAP 2000 software. 3 D solid elements are used to model the dam. The material properties are defined based on typical values which are chosen on the recommendations found in literature. Two load cases were studied; hydrostatic pressure and concrete self-weight and various load combinations were applied to the structure. Some basic description about the temperature distribution and temperature load are also discussed, but they are not included into the finite element method. Special attention is dedicated to modeling of boundary conditions. In the first case the foundation is assumed to be rigid and in the second case elastic springs are used to model the foundation and part of dam body which is under <b>abutment</b> <b>rocks.</b> The stiffness of spring is defined on the bases of typical properties of foundation rocks. The results of analysis are presented by diagrams of displacements and stresses. We show, compare and discuss the response of both models under various load combinations...|$|R
