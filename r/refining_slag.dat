40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} model for calculating the sulfur distribution ratio between ladle furnace (LF) <b>refining</b> <b>slags</b> and molten steel {{has been developed}} by coupling with a developed {{thermodynamic model}} for calculating the mass action concentrations of structural units in LF <b>refining</b> <b>slags,</b> i. e., CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-FeO-MnO-Al 2 O 3 hexabasic slags, based on the ion and molecule coexistence theory (IMCT). The calculated mass action concentrations of structural units in CaO-SiO 2 -MgO-FeO-Al 2 O 3 -MnO slags equilibrated or reacted with molten steel show that the calculated equilibrium mole numbers or mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples, rather than mass percentage of components, in the slags can represent their reaction abilities. The calculated total sulfur distribution ratio shows a reliable agreement with the measured or the calculated sulfur distribution ratio between the slags and molten steel by other models under the condition of choosing oxygen activity based on (FeO) -[O] equilibrium. Meanwhile, the developed thermodynamic model for calculating sulfur distribution ratio can quantitatively determine the respective contribution of free CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO in the LF <b>refining</b> <b>slags.</b> A significant difference of desulfurization ability among free component as CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO has been found with approximately 87 - 93 pct, 11. 43 - 5. 85 pct, 0. 81 - 0. 60 pct and 0. 30 - 0. 27 pct at both middle and final stages during LF refining process, respectively. A large difference of oxygen activity is found in molten steel at the slag-metal interface and in bulk molten steel. The oxygen activity in molten steel at the slag-metal interface is controlled by (FeO) -[O] equilibrium, whereas the oxygen activity in bulk molten steel is controlled by [Al]-[O] equilibrium. Decreasing the high-oxygen-activity boundary layer beneath the slag-metal interface can promote the desulfurization reaction rate effectively or shorten the refining period during the LF refining process...|$|R

It is also necessary to improve the conditions of vacuum steel refining process by equipping steelworks with a new vacuum device, e. g. of VOD type.

The predicted sulfide capacity of the LF <b>refining</b> <b>slags</b> has better accuracy than the measured sulfide capacity of the slags at the middle and final stages during the LF <b>refining</b> process. Increasing <b>slag</b> binary basicity, optical basicity, and the Mannesmann index can {{lead to an increase}} of the predicted sulfide capacity for the LF <b>refining</b> <b>slags</b> as well as to an increase of the sulfur distribution ratio between the slags and molten steel at the middle and final stages during the LF refining process. The calculated equilibrium mole numbers, mass action concentrations of structural units or ion couples, rather than mass percentages of components, are recommended to represent the slag composition for correlating with the sulfide capacity of the slags. The developed sulfide capacity IMCT model can calculate not only the total sulfide capacity of the slags but also the respective sulfide capacity of free CaO, MgO, FeO, and MnO in the slags. The comprehensive contribution of the combined ion couples (Ca 2 + + O 2 -) and (Mn 2 + + O 2 -) on the desulfurization reactions accounts for 96. 23 pct; meanwhile, the average contribution of the ion couple (Fe 2 + + O 2 -) and (Mg 2 + + O 2 -) only has a negligible contribution as 3. 13 pct and 0. 25 pct during the LF refining process, respectively. The oxygen activity of bulk molten steel in LF is controlled by the [Al]-[O] equilibrium, and the oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface is controlled by the (FeO) -[O] equilibrium. The ratio of the oxygen activity of molten steel at the slag-metal interface to the oxygen activity of bulk molten steel will decrease from 37 to 5 at the initial stage, and further decrease from 28 to 4 at the middle stage, but will maintain at a reliable constant as 5 to 14 at the final stage during the LF refining process.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyse the steel refining technology in a ladle furnace including <b>refining</b> <b>slag</b> formation in the ladle. The research was conducted using chromium-nickel- molybdenum steel intended for heat treatment in order to produce crankshafts. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in a ladle furnace with the capacity of 65 Mg of steel. Data from 10 melts were analysed. Samples of <b>refining</b> <b>slag</b> and metal were taken to analyse their chemical composition. On their basis researchers analysed the process of desulphurisation of steel at the ladle furnace workstation. Calculations were made concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag to determine the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations. The calculations were made using a thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. Findings: Analysing the process of desulphurisation of steel under slag with the average chemical composition of: CaO – 54. 0 %, Al 2 O 3 - 30. 2 %, SiO 2 9. 0 %, MgO – 8. 2 %, and FeO content at the level of 0. 94 % drew attention to a high degree of desulphurisation at the level of 86 %. Due to this fact it was possible to obtain high basicity of slag: V=CaO/SiO 2 at the level of 6. 21. Mannesmann index, which characterizes the ability of slag to remove sulphur and non-metallic inclusions from steel and is defined as M=(CaO/SiO 2) /Al 2 O 3, amounted to 0. 21 %- 1 and was too low in comparison to the required one ranging from 0. 35 - 0. 45 %- 1. The calculations concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag, which determined the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations, were performed using the thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. These calculations showed that there were no solid precipitations present. The refining process under slag used in this research proved to be extremely efficient in terms of desulphurisation. Research limitations/implications: It was concluded that the slag forming technology in the ladle is correct in terms of materials used, both as far as their type and amount are concerned. Deoxidation is efficient. Practical implications: It is important to ensure that the furnace slag does not enter the ladle.

40|$|A {{promising}} type {{of steel}} slag for applications is the ladle furnace (LF) slag, {{which is also}} known as the basic slag, the reducing slag, the white slag, and the secondary <b>refining</b> <b>slag.</b> The LF slag is a byproduct from further refining molten steel after coming out of a basic oxygen furnace (BOF) or an electric arc furnace (EAF). The use of the LF slag in further applications requires knowledge of its characteristics. The LF slag characterization in this paper has been performed using the following analytical methods: chemical analysis by energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area properties by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, surface chemistry by infrared absorption (FTIR) spectroscopy, and morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results showed that the main compounds are calcium, silicon, magnesium, and aluminium oxides, and calcium silicates under their various allotropic forms are the major compounds in the LF slag.

40|$|The use {{of ceramic}} {{material}} as refractories {{in the manufacturing}} industry is a common practice worldwide. During usage, for example {{in the production of}} steel, these materials do experience severe working conditions including high temperatures, low pressures and corrosive environments. This results in lowered service lives and high consumptions of these materials. This, in turn, affects the productivity of the whole steel plant and thereby the cost. In order to investigate how the service life can be improved, studies have been carried out for refractories used in the inner lining of the steel ladles. More specifically, from the slag zone, where the corrosion is most severe. By combining thermodynamic simulations, plant trails and post-mortem studies of the refractories after service, vital information about the behaviour of the slagline refractories during steel refining and the causes of the accelerated wear in this ladle area has been achieved. The results from these studies show that the wear of the slagline refractories of the ladle is initiated at the preheating station, through reduction-oxidation reactions. The degree of the decarburization process is mostly dependent on the preheating fuel or the environment. For refractories without antioxidants, refractory decarburization is slower when coal gas is used in ladle preheating than when a mixture of oil and air is used. In addition, ladle preheating of the refractories without antioxidants leads to direct wear of the slagline refractories. This is due to the total loss of the matrix strength, which results in a sand-like product. Thermal chemical changes that take place in the slagline refractories are due to the MgO-C reaction as well as the formation of liquid phases from impurity oxides. In addition, the decrease in the system pressure during steel refining makes the MgO-C reaction take place at the steel refining temperatures. This reduces the refractory’s resistance to corrosion. This is a serious problem for both the magnesia-carbon and dolomite-carbon refractories. The studies of the reactions between the slagline refractories and the different slag compositions showed that slags rich in iron oxide lead mostly to the oxidation of carbon/graphite in the carbon-containing refractories. This leads to an increased porosity and wettability and therefore an enhanced penetration of slag into the refractory structure. If the slag contains high contents of alumina and or silica (such as the steel <b>refining</b> <b>slag),</b> reactions between the slag components and the dolomite-carbon refractory are promoted. This leads to the formation of low-temperature melting phases such as calcium-aluminates and silicates. The state of these reaction products during steel refining leads to an accelerated wear of the dolomite-carbon refractory. The main products of the reactions between the magnesia-carbon refractory and the steel <b>refining</b> <b>slag</b> are MgAl 2 O 4 spinels, and calcium-aluminates, and silicates. Due to the good refractory properties of MgAl 2 O 4 spinels, the slag corrosion resistance of the magnesiacarbon refractory is promoted. QC 2010101...|$|E
40|$|Key words: 38 CrMoAl steel; {{refining}} slag; mold powder; tundish powder; cleanliness. Abstract. Nozzle blockage {{is easy to}} {{take place}} in continuous casting process when producing 38 CrMoAl steel due to high content of aluminum ([Al]= 0. 7 %~ 1. 1 %). Slag-steel reaction will lead to large transformation for composition of molten steel and performance of slag on the condition of traditional high content of SiO 2 in slag. And it will reduce the cleanliness of steel as well. The control target of <b>refining</b> <b>slag</b> and tundish powder has been gotten through the analysis of refining & continuous casting characteristics of high aluminum steel. Based on this, the content of Si and Al in molten steel can be controlled accurately, and the cleanliness of steel has gone to a higher level. Moreover, mold powder with high basicity and vitrification ensures the stability of slag after sorbing Al 2 O 3 inclusions in theory. Continuous casting can be carried out successfully with the control of inclusion morphology through slag washing during tapping. Industrial practice shows that Si content is 0. 25 %~ 0. 40 %, Al content is 0. 80 %~ 1. 00 %, S content is below 0. 004 % and T[O] is below 0. 0015 % in steel products. Moreover, casting bloom with good surface quality is achieved, and the rate of bloom without cleaning is as high as 100 %. With all these countermeasures, 38 CrMoAl steel can be continuously cast for more than 6 heats...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{focuses on}} {{evaluation}} of slag regime by {{the help of}} synthetic slags based on Al 2 O 3. The comparion of influence of synthetic slags on the production of two chosen grades of steels focused on evaluation of effectivity of created <b>refining</b> <b>slag</b> during treatment in the secondary metallurgy was the objective of plant experiments. Design/methodology/approach: During evaluation of slag regime in the ladle, steel samples for assessment of desulphurization degree were taken under the plant conditions. Slag samples were also taken for evaluation of chosen parameters: basicity, content of easily reducible oxides, proportion of CaO/Al 2 O 3 and Mannesmann’s index. The temperature and oxygen activity in steel was continuously measured too. Findings: From plant experiments, it was found out that during using of {{two different types of}} synthetic slags during production of steel grades St 52 - 3 and S 34 MnV similar values of desulphurization degree were achieved. Chosen parameters of ladle slag were monitored and it was demonstrated that the developed synthetic slag B reaches the results comparable with the standard used synthetic slag A. Research limitations/implications: Plant experiments were made under conditions of VÍTKOVICE HEAVY MACHINERY a. s. plant Obtained results are limited by the testing during production of two different steel grades St 52 - 3, S 34 MnV and by the specific technology of production formed by EAF→LF→VD/VCD. Practical implications: The research results made it possible to realize the optimalization of slag regime under the plant conditions of VÍTKOVICE HEAVY MACHINERY a. s. plant. It was proved that developed synthetic slag B from the company JAP TRADING s. r. o. can adequately replace the common synthetic slag A. Originality/value: Results mentioned in this paper are intended for steel producers and they represent basic information about possibilities of slag regime optimalization in the ladle...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} to enhance silicon <b>refining</b> using <b>slag</b> has been developed. The enhancement {{of the process}} {{was carried out by}} applying electrical potential difference across the slag and the silicon phase. This resulted in a shift in the apparent equilibrium in favor of higher partition ratio for the impurities. The application of electrical potential difference also enhanced the mass transfer rate increasing the overall kinetics of the process. This has been demonstrated in laboratory experimentations for the removal of boron from silicon-boron melts using slag. A CaO-SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 slag was reacted with Si-B melt at 1823 K (1550 °C). Electrical potential differences were applied through graphite rods immersed in each of the liquid phase. The results showed that the apparent B-partition ratio and the apparent slag mass transfer coefficient were increased by a factor of 1. 2 and 1. 4, respectively, when a potential difference of 3 V was applied to the phases. The technique {{has the potential to be}} used for improving the existing <b>slag</b> <b>refining</b> process by increasing the overall kinetics and the slag capacity to absorb the impurities...|$|R

The slags {{were categorized as}} electric arc furnace (EAF) slag, argon oxygen decarburization/metal <b>refining</b> process <b>slag</b> and vacuum oxygen decarburization slag based on chromium content and basicity. EAF slags have higher potential in metal recovery {{than the other two}} slags due to its higher iron and chromium contents. The size of the iron-chromium-nickel alloy particles varies from a few μm up to several cm.

40|$|A new {{electric}} arc furnace (EAF) steelmaking process with increasing hot metal charging ratio and improving slagging regime simultaneouly was developed and applied in a 50 t {{electric arc}} furnace {{for more than a}} year at No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Shanxi Taigang Stainless Corporation Limited. The essential fact of the new EAF steelmaking process was to charge hot metal in two portions or steps: firstly, 35 wt%- 40 wt% hot metal was pretreated by blowing oxygen in a specially designed reactor for decarburization and improving hot metal temperature and melting premelted slag; secondly, 30 wt% hot metal was charged into EAF with high basicity <b>refining</b> <b>slags</b> from ladle furnace (LF) -vacuum degassing furnace (VD) refining process. The results show that the hot metal charging ratio can reach to about 65 wt%- 70 wt% for the new EAF steelmaking process; meanwhile, the tap-to-tap time of a 50 1 EAF can shorten by 5 - 10 min, the electricity consumption can decrease by 35 - 50 kW-h/t, the lime consumption can reduce by 10. 5 kg/t of molten steel, and the content of harmful heavy metals in molten steel can be easily controlled to less than the upper limits of aimed steel specification or grade compared with the traditional EAF steelmaking process. In addition, the dephosphorization ability shows a slight strengthening, however, a small degree of lessening for desulphurization ability is observed for the new EAF steelmaking process, but the weakness of desulphurization ability cannot become an obstacle to its further application since a stronger desulphurization ability can be achieved during secondary refining of LF coupled with VD after EAF steelmaking process...|$|R
