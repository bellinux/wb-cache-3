25|$|For 1996, Oldsmobile {{made some}} minor {{revisions}} to the Aurora including new <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> which has less distortion than previous models.|$|E
25|$|The bumpers {{were very}} small, {{no more than}} trim pieces. A strange and sour-looking front gave way to an ovoid rear end, {{culminating}} in an engine cover perforated by at least 50 vent openings. On the rear fenders two louvered vents allow air to the engine compartment; the right-hand one also opens to allow access to the fuel filler. Finally, a frameless opening <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> provides a measure of hatchback practicality.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{expected}} the Prius Prime {{to achieve an}} EPA rating of , a 26% enhancement over the first generation model. Toyota targeted the fuel economy in hybrid mode to be equal or better than regular fourth generation Prius liftback. To reduce weight, Toyota used aluminum for the hood, and high-tensile strength steel. The Prius Prime features Toyota’s first carbon fiber rear hatch, which saves weight, while a dual-wave <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> design helps cut drag.|$|E
5000|$|An {{optional}} [...] "360 Value" [...] {{package on}} the S model adds 16-inch alloy wheels, auto-dimming rear-view mirror with rear-view monitor, body-color rear spoiler, chrome grille, and <b>rear</b> privacy <b>glass.</b> An S Krōm trim edition includes Krōm integrated body design, center-exit exhaust, body-color rear spoiler, 17-inch brilliant-finish aluminum-alloy wheels, and <b>rear</b> privacy <b>glass.</b>|$|R
5000|$|N-TEC model {{includes}} darkened <b>rear</b> privacy <b>glass,</b> {{touch screen}} 'Connect' satellite navigation system ...|$|R
5000|$|The New Mini {{includes}} a blacked-out B-pillar and fixed <b>rear</b> side <b>glass,</b> {{although it is}} labeled 'Hardtop' in the United States.|$|R
25|$|The new Fronte was a {{big step}} away from the SS20, making the switch from a rear-engined, rear-wheel drive {{configuration}} to a more up-to-date transversely mounted engine in front, driving the front wheels. Wheelbase was increased from 2030 to 2150mm and the new car was much more spacious. The four-door Fronte had an opening <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> window, whereas the two-door Alto got a proper rear hatch. In some export markets the car was just known as the Suzuki SS40. In Europe, the Fronte (labelled Alto) was also sold with a 796cc four-stroke three (SS80) from July 1981 and was 100mm longer, thanks to bigger bumpers. These cars also received larger 12-inch wheels. Four-doors received the SS80F chassis code, while three-door passenger versions were called SS80G.|$|E
25|$|The {{convertible}} {{featured a}} removable rigid section over the passengers and a folding textile rear section with heatable <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> window. Power operated, lowering the top required unlatching two header catches, power lowering the top, exiting the car (or reaching {{over to the}} right side latch), and folding down the rigid section manually. Mazda introduced with the convertible the first integral windblocker, a rigid panel that folded up from behind the passenger seats to block unwanted drafts from reaching the passengers — thereby extending the driving season for the car in open mode. The convertible also featured optional headrest mounted audio speakers and a folding leather snap-fastened tonneau cover. The convertible assembly was precisely engineered and manufactured, and dropped into the ready body assembly as a complete unit — a first in convertible production.|$|E
25|$|After a {{hiatus of}} over a year, Suzuki {{returned}} to the sports minicar market with the new Cervo in October 1977. The SS20 Cervo was mainly a JDM model (although it was also sold as a LHD in Chile) with a 539cc three-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The SS20 used the chassis from the 1976 Fronte 7-S, but was equipped with the larger T5A engine (this was the rear-mounted version of the LJ50 used in the Jimny and Fronte Hatch, {{also known as the}} T5B in the FF Alto/Fronte). The body was based on the Giugiaro designed Fronte Coupé, but with a bulge in the front and bigger bumpers which led to the loss of some of the original's grace. Instead of square headlights, the Cervo received round items. The new <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> hatch added convenience.|$|E
40|$|Time of {{digestion}} {{experiments were}} carried out in a 15 -liter <b>rearing</b> <b>glass</b> aquaria (water volume 10 liters) containing 1, 500 larvae. The larvae were fed with sufficient rotifer, Artemia or Moina and then transferred to another <b>rearing</b> <b>glass</b> aquarium without food. Samples of 20 larvae were checked at 10 -minute intervals until no food remained in the larval digestive tract. It {{was found that the}} time required to empty the larval digestive tract with rotifer, Artemia or Moina was as follows. Larvae 3 - 18 days old fed with rotifertook 130 - 180 minutes to empty the digestive tract while larvae 21 - 27 days old fed with rotifer and Artemia took 110 - 120 minutes and larvae 30 - 45 days old fed with Moina took 80 - 100 minutes at water temperature of 25 - 29 ºC. Time consumed to empty the gut content tended to decrease as larval age increased. Experiments to determined the time and amount of prey required to get satiation {{were carried out}} in a 15 -liter <b>rearing</b> <b>glass</b> aquaria (water volume 10 liters) containing 1, 500 larvae. The larvae were fed with rotifer, Artemia or Moina after starvation of 24 hr. Samples of 20 larvae were checked at 10 - inutes intervals after the start of feeding until 3 hr. It was found the time required to fill the larval digestive tract with rotifer, Artemia or Moina for 3 - 18 days old larvae was 80 - 110 minutes and amount of rotifer to get satiation was 4. 8 - 26 ind/larvae. For 21 - 27 day-old larvae the corresponding time was 60 - 80 minutes and was 28. 5 - 31. 6 ind/ larvae. For 30 - 45 day-old larvae the time was 40 - 60 minutes and amount of Moina to get satiation was 34. 6 - 52. 4 ind/larvae at water temperature of 25 - 29 ºC. The time required to fill the larval gut, tends to decrease with larval age but the amount of prey required to fill the larval gut, tends to increase with larval age. Experiments to determined the amount of food uptake in a day were done in a 15 -liter <b>rearing</b> <b>glass</b> aquaria (water volume 10 liters) containing 500 larvae, and 10 ind/ml of rotifer, Artemia or Moina. The amount of food taken was calculated based on changes of rotifer, Artemia or Moina density in the <b>rearing</b> <b>glass</b> aquarium with and without fish larvae, the 5 samples of each replication were examined at 2 hourly intervals. The average amounts of rotifer uptake in a day for 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 day-old larvae were 58. 8, 95. 4, 64. 0, 88. 8, 134. 0 and 147. 4 ind/larvae, respectively. The mean numbers of rotifer added Artemia uptake in a day by 21, 24 and 27 -day old larvae were 181. 6, 185. 6 and 241 ind/larvae, respectively. And average amounts of Moina uptake in a day for 30, 33, 36, 39, 42 and 45 day-old larvae were 177. 4, 179. 4, 214. 8, 249. 6, 362. 8 and 366. 2 ind/larvae, respectively...|$|R
50|$|A {{commercial}} Cherokee {{version with}} 2.5 CRD engine and five-speed transmission rated at 34.4 mpgimp has a completely flat cargo area (the rear seat area has a carpeted full-length galvanized metal floor) and the <b>rear</b> quarter <b>glass</b> and <b>rear</b> door <b>glass</b> is replaced with fixed body colored aluminum panels (the front doors have power windows). For additional cargo security a removable {{floor to ceiling}} metal and mesh bulkhead is optional. In European markets, VAT registered buyers can claim back the tax paid as this qualifies as a Commercial Vehicle.|$|R

25|$|Older {{color and}} {{monochrome}} CRTs may contain toxic substances, such as cadmium, in the phosphors. The <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> tube of modern CRTs {{may be made}} from leaded glass, which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly. By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead, though {{the rear of the}} CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leache (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).|$|E
25|$|Powertrains were {{verbatim}} of the Camry, {{with the}} 3S-FC for the entry-level SL, and higher-end SLX and SLE models graced with the 3S-FE engine. An SLX option pack, {{known as the}} Executive was also available. The SL opened up the Apollo range with remote exterior mirrors, intermittent windscreen wipers, heated rear screen demister, remote trunk release for sedans and fuel filler door, a two-speaker radio cassette player and tinted side and <b>rear</b> <b>glass.</b> SLX variants were distinguished by their full wheel covers, {{as opposed to the}} SL model's steel wheels with centre caps. The Executive variant was not a stand-alone model, but an option pack for the SLX, adding power steering and automatic transmission. SLE equipment included the four-wheel disc brakes, variable intermittent windscreen wipers, a four-speaker stereo, body-coloured bumpers, dual odometers, automatic headlamp cut-off system, velour seat upholstery, centre back-seat armrest, power antenna, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock and front map lamps. As per the Camry, in May 1991, the EFI version of the engine was made standard.|$|E
25|$|The Mercury Sable, {{a sister}} {{model of the}} Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also {{redesigned}} for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the front light bar, wrap-around <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> and skirted rear fender, {{in favor of a}} design theme that more closely resembled that of the Taurus. For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered {{during the second half of}} the 1996 model year. The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; Automobile Magazine selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 Honda {{introduced}} the [...] "C Package" [...] option (¥330,000 JPY) to Japan's Civic Type R line-up which included an additional colour, Satin Silver Metallic, HID lighting, <b>rear</b> privacy <b>glass,</b> automatic air conditioner and {{outside air temperature}} sensor.|$|R

2500|$|The 1968 models saw {{stronger}} {{changes in}} the form of the [...] engine as included standard equipment in the station wagon while becoming optional equipment in both sedan models. These two body styles also received an all-new <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> without wraparound portions and all saw new larger side armrests. Front two-point seatbelts became standard for the first time. The rear differential was changed to 3.54:1 gear ratio.|$|E
2500|$|GM {{introduced}} a facelifted sedan at Auto Shanghai 2005, designed {{in cooperation with}} PATAC. Bearing the internal code T250 and sold in South Korea as the [...] "Daewoo Gentra", revisions included exterior styling changes, a new interior instrument panel and minor equipment changes, including increased sound deadening. Incorporation of the radio antenna into the <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> and extensive wind tunnel testing helped reduce the coefficient of drag from 0.348 to 0.326.|$|E
2500|$|An updated {{taillight}} {{design with}} three sections {{was the only}} major change to the 1986 Grand Prix. A new 2+2 model was offered for homologation of an aerodynamic coupe body for NASCAR competition, like Chevrolet's 1986 Monte Carlo SS Aerocoupe. 2+2-specific pieces are an aero nose, bubble <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> and a fiberglass trunklid with integral spoiler. All 2+2 models came equipped with a corporate [...] four-barrel engine, the 200-4R four-speed automatic transmission and 3.08:1 rear axle ratio. They have a two-tone paint job with silver on top and gray on the bottom, with 2+2 decals and striping and 15x7 steel Rally II wheels. [...] Modestly successful on superspeedways, where its bulbous rear end earned it a nickname of [...] "the whale", the 2+2 design was seriously flawed for street use. [...] Since the enormous <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> was fixed (not an opening hatch), it forced adoption of a dramatically shortened trunk opening. [...] Although it had modest horsepower, benign handling and design compromises, there were only approximately 1,225 Grand Prix 2+2s built in 1986 and all found buyers.|$|E

2500|$|A revised sedan was {{introduced}} in April 2005 at the Shanghai Motor Show, designed {{in cooperation with the}} Pan Asia Technical Automotive Center (PATAC). Bearing the internal code T250 and sold in South Korea as the [...] "Daewoo Gentra", the revision comprised primarily interior and exterior styling changes, a new interior instrument panel and minor equipment changes, including increased sound deadening. Incorporation of the radio antenna into the <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> and extensive wind tunnel testing helped reduce the coefficient of drag from 0.348 to 0.326. It was subsequently launched in Europe in September 2005 at the Frankfurt Motor Show.|$|E
2500|$|The new more {{aerodynamic}} body {{looked a}} bit more plain than its sharp predecessor, but the fastback shape echoed Giugiaro's original design. The headlights were square, there was more glass than on the SS20 (but with a broad B-pillar) and the larger <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> hatch (still not a proper hatch) now offered better access to a much more usable luggage space. The rear seat folded; some versions even offered a remote opening mechanism and heated rear window. The SS40 {{was also the first}} Cervo to offer automatic transmission, a two-speed. This all reflected a steady move away from the original [...] "mini Gran Turismo" [...] concept towards a much softer [...] "Personal Car".|$|E
2500|$|Geiger and Marsden then tested how the {{scattering}} varied with {{the thickness of}} the foil (i.e. if s ∝ t). They constructed a disc (S) with six holes drilled in it. [...] The holes were covered with metal foil (F) of varying thickness, or none for control. [...] This disc was then sealed in a brass ring (A) between two glass plates (B and C). [...] The disc could be rotated by means of a rod (P) to bring each window in front of the alpha particle source (R). On the <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> pane was a zinc sulfide screen (Z). Geiger and Marsden found that the number of scintillations that appeared on the zinc sulfide screen was indeed proportional to the thickness as long as said thickness was small.|$|E
50|$|The curved design scheme carried {{further to}} the rear of the Town Car, in the C-pillar (losing its opera windows) into the trunklid. To better {{differentiate}} itself from its Mercury counterpart, the Town Car switched to individual taillamps, deleting the filler panel on the trunklid; a large chrome surround was used on the trunklid to mount the license plate.In 2001, the stretched Town Car L was introduced, with a six-inch stretch in its wheelbase. To produce the variant at the lowest cost possible, the B-pillar was widened on 2001-2002 versions to use the existing <b>rear</b> door <b>glass</b> of the standard Town Car. In 2003, the Town Car L was redesigned, giving it model-specific doors proportioned to the longer roofline; these versions are distinguished by wider <b>rear</b> quarter <b>glass</b> in the doors.|$|R
50|$|All six {{generations of}} the Fiesta have been {{available}} in sedan delivery/panel van format, although not in all markets. The Mark I, II and III versions feature the standard 3 door bodyshell with the <b>rear</b> side <b>glass</b> replaced by body coloured metal and a flat floorpan instead of the rear seats.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a limited}} (107 units) of C30 T5 with either {{five-speed}} automatic transmission or 6 speed manual transmission with Geartronic for the US market, commemorating Boston Red Sox's 107 victories in 2007. It included red body colour, Boston Red Sox logo at <b>rear</b> hatch <b>glass,</b> Boston Red Sox fender badges.|$|R
2500|$|The XV40 was {{redesigned}} {{to incorporate}} a [...] longer wheelbase, wider wheel tracks, and a stiffer body. Although overall length {{is equal to}} its predecessor, Toyota maximized interior volume—especially fore-and-aft space. This was achieved by moving {{the base of the}} windshield and <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> outwards and by the redesigning of the front seats. At , cargo space has been reduced by [...] over the previous model. The SE/Sportivo provides [...] due to the placement of bracing behind the rear seat, with the hybrid version falling to [...] due to the placement of the battery pack. The XV40's underbody is stepped, creating a venturi effect and hence a low-pressure area under the front end to increase downforce. Other aerodynamic design features include a stepped engine undercover and rear wheel fairings to channel airflow around the tires. The coefficient of drag figure remains at 0.28, falling to 0.27 for the hybrid version (which makes it the most aerodynamic car built in Australia).|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Oldsmobile {{models were}} {{completely}} redesigned with a rocket motif {{from front to}} rear, as {{the top of the}} front fenders had a chrome rocket, while the body-length fins were shaped as rocket exhausts which culminated in a fin-top taillight (concave on the 98 models while convex on the 88 models). [...] The 1959 models also offered several roof treatments, such as the pillared sedan with a fastback rear window and the Holiday SportSedan, which was a flat-roofed pillarless hardtop with wraparound front and <b>rear</b> <b>glass.</b> [...] The 1959 models were marketed as [...] "the linear look", and also featured a bar-graph speedometer which showed a green indicator through , then changed to orange until , then was red above that until the highest speed read by the speedometer, [...] [...] Power windows were available on the 98 models, as was two-speed electric windshield wipers with electrically powered windshield washers. [...] The 88 still relied on vacuum-operated windshield wipers without a washer feature. [...] 1959 Oldsmobiles were offered with [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] (a dashboard-mounted automatic headlight dimmer) as well as factory-installed air conditioning and power-operated front bench seat as available options.|$|E
2500|$|The 1969 VAM Javelin {{obtained}} the previously optional heater as standard equipment, the foot pedals received bright trim and the accelerator was {{changed into a}} firewall-mounted unit, a support pull strap was applied on the passenger's side dashboard above the glove box, the center cover with the radio speaker grid changed into a woodgrain unit. A unique aspect of the 1969 Javelin is that it kept the same gauge configuration as the 1968 models in contrast to AMC's modifications to the Javelin (and AMX) instrument panel for 1969 with a larger 8,000 RPM tach on the right pod, leaving the smaller left pod exclusive for the clock. The VAM Javelins exterior now had bright trim package with new moldings starting {{at the corners of}} the tail lights running on the sides all the way to lower rear corner of the side glass and drip rails plus all around the <b>rear</b> <b>glass</b> and top edge of the C-pillars. The new Javelins looked more luxurious, even though a factory vinyl roof was not available. The front fender emblems were relocated to the base of each C-pillar and were accompanied by red-white-blue bulls eye emblems. A third Javelin emblem was applied near the lower right corner of the grille. The 1969 model year was also VAM's first self-engineered engine, the , 9.5:1 compression ratio [...] six-cylinder engine with a two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor and a new VAM-engineered 266 degree camshaft. In both standard and Go Pack versions.|$|E
50|$|Other {{standard}} {{features include}} Scratch Shield paint (first introduced on the Infiniti EX), black lacquer interior trim, high-intensity discharge (HID) headlamps, LED brake lamps, 12-point sequential welcome lighting, electronic liftgate closure assist, automatic dimming rear-view mirror with compass, <b>glass</b> moonroof, <b>rear</b> privacy <b>glass,</b> integrated <b>rear</b> spoiler, and dual chrome exhaust tips.|$|R
