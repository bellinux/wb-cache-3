40|$|Consumer imports {{have played}} {{a vital role in}} the {{development}} of Barbados over the years. It is not difficult to see the link between these imports and indirect taxes since, when consumer items arrive into Barbados, these are subject to import duties, value-added taxes and in some cases, excise duties, all components of indirect taxes, which represent the major tax <b>revenue</b> <b>category</b> of the Government of Barbados. With rising indirect taxes, a Government can use some of these funds to develop a country’s infrastructure and enhance its development. Although some reduction in savings is expected from an expansion in consumer imports (especially if financed by a drawdown in deposits), this loss can be minimised if some of the taxes collected from such an increase are directed into foreign exchange earning activities. This paper uses regression analysis to see to what extent changes in consumer imports will influence indirect taxes in the long and short run between 1970 and 2001. The results show that in the long run, a per unit change in consumer imports will boost indirect taxes by 0. 46 % while in the short run, a similar change in consumer imports will increase indirect taxes sharply by 0. 78 %. This implies a significant impact on Government’s fiscal account in the short run, with some slowing anticipated over the medium and long term. 2...|$|E
40|$|The {{construction}} industry can be, roughly, {{divided into four}} construction end-product categories – residential (homes/town-homes), commercial (retail/apartments), industrial (manufacturing/warehouses/storage) and mixed-use (multi-story with lower levels retail and upper levels condominiums). The “decision” to build (or not) is based is based on number of factors – some analytical, some not so analytical, i. e. “gut feelings”. It is the authors opinion that the “build/no-build” decision is entirely too non-analytical and unquantified. Decisions are made based on wild guesses, hunches and “gut-feelings”. This paper proposes to apply decision making theory, develop a decision model and document the decision making process. This analysis then {{can be used to}} quantify, the expected net income and the probability of such net income, on the project prior to making the “build/no-build” decision. Specifically, this paper analyzes the mixed-use category of construction end-product. The analysis uses costs and revenues to determine net incomes. Costs include land (dirt), hard costs, soft costs, construction loan interest and sales commissions. The <b>revenue</b> <b>category</b> is limited to condominium sales only. Initially, a uniformally random distribution for cost and revenues was assumed. It was determined that the results attained could be refined, to provide a more accurate estimation of net income, if the distribution was supplemented with Pairwise Comparison. Ten expert opinions were gathered to first, estimate the ranges about the cost and revenue components. The experts were provided an initial estimate, from which they estimated a range (lower and upper bound), around the initial estimate. The range for each component was divided into three equal intervals. Using a Pairwise Comparison, the intervals were evaluated by the experts. Probabilities were then computed for each possible outcome of net income. The probabilities were then plotted against the net income. The resultant output, the probability vs. net income graph (and associated table), are the tools that quantify the data and graphically depict, for the decision maker, the probability of economic success as predicted from expert opinion. The use of the Pairwise Comparison Technique indicated a slightly different, yet more robust (in the opinion of these authors) result, than the random distribution model had the Pairwise Comparison not been made...|$|E

The goal of this research was to determine visitor awareness and perception of museum funding models. Through interviews with visitors at two midsized museums in Seattle, Washington, the findings suggested that visitors had a limited awareness of how museums obtain and engage funders. Visitors were most aware of general <b>revenue</b> <b>categories</b> and funders who were displayed in the museum.

40|$|The paper uses a {{panel of}} {{athletic}} department revenue and expenditure data of 227 public colleges and universities to empirically investigate the behavior of NCAA Division I athletic departments over the period 2006 – 2011.

The empirical results show that when a school receives additional athletic revenue, expenditures for coaches can be as high as 10 times more than direct expenditures for athletes. For every one dollar increase in ticket sale revenue, total expenditures can rise by $ 0. 83 and reduce a school’s athletic subsidy by $ 0. 19. Lastly, changing conferences can increase total revenue and total expenditures by millions of dollars. ...|$|R

Researchers criticize intercollegiate athletics institutions {{for a lack}} of investment in revenue generating processes such as ticket sales (Bouchet et al., 2011; Drayer et al., 2012; Howard & Crompton, 2004; Irwin & Sutton, 2011) as well as failing to properly evaluate revenue generation programming (Martin et al., 2011). The purpose of this research project was to assess the relationships between high profile athletic success and athletics generated revenue in the form of ticket sales, basketball-specific, football-specific, and total athletics-related revenue in NCAA FBS schools as well as outline how this relationship should fit into the program theory evaluation model. The results of the fixed effects regression models for all four <b>revenue</b> <b>categories</b> support research that suggested there should be more to generating revenue from year to year within an athletics program than the overemphasis of the pursuit and achievement of high profile athletic success at the NCAA Division I FBS level. Not all high profile athletic success variables predicted revenue generation, and not all high profile athletic success variables that did predict revenue change, predicted a positive change. The relationship between high profile athletic success and revenue generation should be used as a mark of revenue generation programming stability and efficiency in the evaluation process.

40|$|The revenue {{composition}} of for-profit and non-profit organisations is fundamentally different. Non-profit organisations have diversified revenues and must therefore manage an income portfolio. For {{the management of}} the income portfolio of a non-profit sport club it is not only important that sufficient revenues are available, but also where they come from as complex interactions exist among different revenue sources. These interactions are referred to as crowd-out effects (increases in one revenue source lead to decreases in another source) and crowd-in effects, respectively. The interactions among <b>revenue</b> <b>categories</b> of non-profit sport clubs were analysed using a longitudinal dataset from a nationwide sport club survey in Germany (n = 5026). Elasticity measures were calculated within a regression framework which provided information about the nature and significance of interactions. The results revealed a significant positive interaction between revenues from donations and sport supply (e. g., membership and service fees) pointing towards a crowd-in effect, i. e., increased revenues from donations have crowded in revenues from sport supply. Moreover, increased revenues from subsidies were found to crowd in revenues from donations and economic activities (e. g., sponsorship). Significant negative interactions were observed for revenues from economic activities and other supply suggesting that increased revenues from economic activities have crowded out revenues from other supply. The findings indicated an increased level of commercialisation supporting a modernisation of German clubs. Furthermore, the uncertainties have increased and therefore sport clubs have to consider the level of uncertainty of their revenue sources when they manage their income portfolio.

40|$|Twenty states {{plus the}} District of Columbia now have {{renewable}} portfolio standards (RPS) {{in place that}} requires {{a certain percentage of}} energy to come from renewable sources by a specific year. With renewable energy on the verge of massive growth, much research emphasis is put on enabling the implementation of these technologies. This paper presents a novel method of site selection for wind turbine farms in New York State, based on a spatial cost-revenue optimization. The algorithm used for this is built in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop 9. 3. 1 software and consists of three stages. The first stage excludes sites that are infeasible for wind turbine farms, based on land use and geological constraints. The second stage identifies the best feasible sites based on the expected net present value from four major cost and <b>revenue</b> <b>categories</b> that are spatially dependent: revenue from generated electricity, costs from access roads, power lines and land clearing. The third stage assesses the ecological impacts on bird and their habitats. The proposed spatial multi-criteria methodology is then implemented in New York State and the results were compared with the locations of existing wind turbine farms. The wind farm site selection tool presented in this paper provides insights into the most feasible sites for a large geographic area based on user inputs, and can assist the planning of wind developers, utilities, ISO's and State governments in attaining renewable portfolio standards.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} providing timely forecasts for disaggregated fiscal data. In {{the aftermath of the}} 2008 - 2009 crisis governments have become increasingly aware of the importance to generate trustworthy, time-consistent budget forecasts. Recently, several papers (Onorante et. al., 2008; Pedragal & Perez, 2010; Hallet et. al., 2012. Ghysels & Ozkan, 2012) showed that using intra-annual data can increase forecasting performance. In addition, these models can provide governments with "early warning signals". A second strand of literature (Lutkepo, 2010; Asimakopoulos et. al., 2013) recognizes that aggregating the forecasts for different expenditure and revenue components reduces the forecast error of the resulting budget deficit. Unfortunately, little evidence is available concerning the best models for specific <b>revenue</b> <b>categories</b> like stamp duties or inheritance taxes. In this paper we contribute to the literature by modeling the regional revenues of stamp duties using quarterly and monthly data covering the time period 1994 - 2013. More than 60 models were tested, including a-theoretical AR and (E(G)) ARCH models, and more theory driven DL, ADL, VAR, VEC models. In addition, combination forecasts were produced. Forecast horizons vary from one month ahead to 2 years ahead; model selection is based on the Aikake Information Criteria and on theoretical arguments, stemming from housing models. Performance evaluation is based on MPE, MAPE and RMSPE of both insample as well as out-of-sample forecasts [...] In general, multivariate models show lower in-sample forecasting errors than univariate models. Based on the out-of-sample performance, theory driven models outperform the least complex models for shorter forecasting horizons. However, with forecasts heading for 2 years the outperformance of the more advanced models is less convincing. In addition, the results reveal that combination forecasts strongly enhance the accuracy of stamp duties revenues forecasting models. In general, the results are in line with the findings of Favero & Marcellino (2005) : simple forecasting models and combined forecasts outperform more complicated specifications...|$|R

5000|$|Another useful {{benchmark}} is {{the average}} price that customers pay for brands in a given category. This average can be calculated {{in at least two}} ways: (1) as the ratio of total <b>category</b> <b>revenue</b> to total <b>category</b> unit sales, or (2) as the unit-share weighted average price in the category. Note that the market Average Price Paid includes the brand under consideration. Note also that changes in unit shares will affect the average price paid. If a low-price brand steals shares from a higher-priced rival, the average price paid will decline. This would cause a firm’s price premium (calculated using the average price paid as a benchmark) to rise, even if its absolute price did not change. Similarly, if a brand is priced at a premium, that premium will decline as it gains share. The reason: a market share gain by a premium-priced brand will cause the overall average price paid in its market to rise. This, in turn, will reduce the price differential between that brand and the market average[...] [...] [...] To calculate the price premium using the average price paid benchmark, managers can also divide a brand’s share of the market in value terms by its share in volume terms. If value and volume market shares are equal, there is no premium. If value share is greater than volume share, then there is a positive price premium.|$|R
