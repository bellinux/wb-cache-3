Therefore, {{to better understand the}} pedal <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion of Australovenator, the pedal <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion of Dromaius novaehollandiae (commonly known as the emu) was analysed with and without soft tissue. We used a variety of innovative digital techniques to analyse the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion and biologically restore the Australovenator pes. Computed tomography scans of Dromaius pes in fully flexed and fully extended positions provided the soft tissue <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion limits. The bone on bone <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion of the same specimen was replicated following the removal of soft tissue. It was identified that there was an increase in <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion potential with the removal of soft tissue. This variation provided a guide to develop the potential <b>range</b> <b>of</b> motion of a fully fleshed Australovenator pes. Additionally, the dissection of the Dromaius pes provided a guide enabling the replication of the corresponding soft tissue and keratin sheaths of the Australovenator pes...|$|R

5|$|Greece's mountainous terrain {{favored a}} {{defensive}} strategy {{and the high}} <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> the Rhodope, Epirus, Pindus and Olympus mountains offered many defensive opportunities. However, air power was required to protect defending ground forces from entrapment in the many defiles. Although an invading force from Albania could be stopped by {{a relatively small number}} of troops positioned in the high Pindus mountains, the northeastern part of the country was difficult to defend against an attack from the north.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the {{confluence}} of the Vohimara and Antainambalana Rivers may have been a zone of hybridization between these two species, although no conclusive results have indicated current interbreeding. In general, the Antainambalana River appears to isolate the red ruffed lemurs from the neighboring subspecies of black-and-white ruffed lemur, V. v. subcincta. The subspecies V. v. variegata can be found further south, and V. v. editorum is the southernmost subspecies. The <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> these two southern subspecies overlap and intermediate forms are reported to exist, although this has not been confirmed.|$|E

In experimental conditions, they fail to interbreed and genetic analysis yields no evidence of gene flow or hybridization in the wild. Compared to O.couesi, the marsh rice rat shows less genetic variability within but more between populations in the contact zone, probably because the species is restricted to isolated populations near the coast.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} regular {{planetary}} moons, Callisto's rotation is locked to be synchronous with its orbit. The length of Callisto's day, simultaneously its orbital period, is about 16.7 Earth days. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> change are 0.00720.0076 and 0.200.60°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0.4 and 1.6°.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
