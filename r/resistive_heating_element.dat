5000|$|An {{infinite}} switch, simmerstat, {{energy regulator}} or infinite controller {{is a type}} of switch that allows variable power output of a <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> of an electric stove. It is called [...] "infinite" [...] because its average output is infinitely variable rather than being limited to a few switched levels. It uses a bi-metallic strip conductive connection across terminals that disconnects with increased temperature. As current passes through the bimetal connection, it will heat and deform, breaking the connection and turning off the power. After a short time, the bimetal will cool and reconnect. Therefore, infinite switches vary the average power delivered to a device by oscillating quickly between on and off states.

40|$|The {{invention}} of the atomic force microscope (AFM) revolutionized the scientific world by providing researchers {{with the ability to}} make topographical maps of both conducting and non-conducting surfaces with nanometer resolution. As an alternative to optical AFM methods, thermal cantilevers have been investigated as a method to measure topography. This study reports the fabrication and testing of heated AFM cantilevers. This study transfers a fabrication process first developed at Stanford University to the Georgia Institute of Technology micro-fabrication facility and fabricates six different heated AFM cantilever designs. Selective impurity doping of a silicon cantilever allows it to become electrically conductive with a resistive element near the cantilever free end. Voltage applied across the cantilever legs induces current flow through the cantilever that generates heat in the resistive element. A deep understanding of the operational behavior and limits of the AFM cantilever is required to use the cantilever as an experimental tool. Characterization experiments determined the cantilever electrical resistance and temperature response. Experiments were conducted that electrically test heated AFM cantilevers at various system input voltages. Electrical and thermal responses of these cantilevers were compared against a theoretical model. The model utilizes heat transfer fundamentals and links the thermal response to the cantilever temperature-dependent electrical characteristics. Results of this study show that the fabricated heated AFM cantilevers have a tip with a radius of curvature as small as 20 nm. Cantilever temperatures can exceed 700 㠩n short pulses and, because the <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> is also a temperature sensor, calibration of the cantilever temperature response is possible to within 1 㮍M.

40|$|A {{description}} of the soil thermal regime is necessary to evaluate energy balances which influence the rate of physical, chemical and biological reactions. A dual probe method for simultaneously determining soil thermal conductivity, volumetric heat capacity and thermal diffusivity in a nondestructive manner is evaluated in this study. An analytical solution of the conduction heat equation is {{used to describe the}} temperature distribution at a known distance from a heater probe. The theory is implemented by applying electrical power for a short time (typically 10 s) to a <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> located in the heater probe and monitoring the temperature at a known distance from the heater. Application of the method to an aqueous, colloidal suspension of [alpha]-alumina and an aqueous solution of glycerol provided a means of validating the method under conditions of known sample thermal properties {{and in the absence of}} void pore space which might lead to poor contact resistance between the probe surface and the sample and which might provide a path for vapor movement. The agreement between the measured and calculated temperature distribution was very good. The dual probe method was used on a sand and a sandy loam over a range of water contents. Error analysis was used to evaluate the results and place error bounds on the calculated thermal property values. Uncertainty in probe spacing and the time resolution for the temperature measurements were the major contributors to total error. The consequences of convective heat transfer were evaluated by using a transient finite element numerical model to describe the coupled heat and mass transport. Moisture migration occurred only in the region near the heater probe but never beyond 1. 5 mm from the probe. The simulations indicate that the convective heat transfer component is not a factor when temperature at the heater probe does not exceed 80 C. The work presented in this dissertation indicates that dual probe methods which implement analytical solutions of the conduction heat equation are useful for determining soil thermal properties...|$|E

The composite material is composed of a conductive network embedded in a polymer matrix.

30|$|Although DSC/TGA systems share broad commonalities, even {{specific}} {{models are}} often {{available in a}} broad set of configurations to accommodate a variety of sample, measurement, and environment types. The specifics of our instrument are as follows: The system consists of an open-loop, tap-water fed, water-cooled vertical tube furnace with cylindrical graphite <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> that is enveloped in Ultra High Purity Grade Argon gas. The alumina vertical furnace tube of this Setaram 16 / 18 contains a single platinum heat flux pan with two symmetric pockets for holding cylindrical 100  μL alumina crucibles, one for the sample and one for a reference material. This platinum pan is suspended from an alumina rod attached to an electromagnetically stabilized microbalance. In addition to transferring the load to the balance, the rod contains lead wires for a sample thermocouple and heat flow sensor for measuring the heat flux {{across the bottom of}} the two crucibles. During testing, the current compensated balance holds a sample (mass between 50 and 150  mg) and a reference (77  mg of NIST SRM 720 Sapphire rod) at a fixed height in the furnace so long as the balance is within +/− 200  mg of its zero point. This zero point can be adjusted to accommodate a variety of sample and reference masses via the addition and subtraction of tungsten shot from the counterweight arm of the balance. This entire balance, rod and pan assembly is mounted on a vertical moving linear actuator to enable loading and unloading of the pan outside the furnace tube. The balance environment is pressure sealed and coupled with the sample environment. Thus the sample and balance can be purged at various flow rates with a selectable so called carrier gas. In this work, Ar was used at a flow rate of about 1.5  L per hour to purge the sample. Type S Pt/Pt- 10 %Rh thermocouples were used for the sample temperature, heat flow sensor, and the furnace temperature measurement. While sample and heat flow sensors are integrated into the platinum pan on the DSC, the furnace thermocouple is separate and sits just below the pan {{at the end of an}} alumina rod with a notched disk alumina heat shield just below the exposed thermocouple junction. All thermocouple junctions are bare and as small as practical for maximum rate sensitivity.|$|E
40|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Professors Timothy Shedd and Gregory Nellis; 118 pp. Two test facilities were used to study the characteristics and method of spray cooling. Spray cooling {{is a process that}} delivers liquid droplets from an atomizer to a surface that is hotter than the saturation temperature of the fluid. The droplets impact the surface and spread, causing a thin liquid film to form. This liquid film is capable of removing large heat loads from the surface. Ten nozzle designs were tested, including arrays of between 1 and 16 nozzles. Each nozzle design was tested at a minimum of 4 flow rates. The emphasis {{of this study is to}} investigate the behavior of the film on the die surface to determine ways to improve on spray cooling designs for future designs. The first test facility used to investigate the limits and abilities of the nozzles was a heat transfer stand. Measurements of the applied heat load of each die and the junction tempera- tures at 8 locations per die were taken. Measurements were also recorded for the conditions of the fluid being delivered to the die. From these, values of critical heat fluxes, heat trans- fer coefficients, and surface temperature distributions were obtained. The measured critical heat fluxes of the nozzle designs that were tested ranged from 8. 5 to 75. 7 W/cm 2. Local heat transfer coefficients ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 4 W/cm 2 ? K. Another heat transfer related property that was investigated was the efficiency of the design. The efficiency was defined as the critical heat flux divided by the sum of the available latent and sensible heat capacities of the fluid. Experimental results showed that nozzle designs with lower efficiencies could reach higher levels of critical heat flux and had more desirable heat transfer coefficients. Efficiencies at critical heat flux were calculated to be between 0. 17 and 0. 35. Lower values of efficiency mean that the system is less reliant on the two-phase component of heat transfer. Designs that are capable of removing heat with-out surface nucleate boiling were found to perform better. A visualization test stand was also designed and constructed for the visualization por- tion of the study. A 2000 ?A thick coating of indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass die created a transparent, <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> Measurements of the film thickness under adia- batic conditions were taken using an optical technique based on the angle of total internal reflection. Experimental film thicknesses were measured to be 42 - 918 ?m. A numerical model was developed to predict the film thicknesses; values predicted were 79 - 280 ?m. The results of these two tests were correlated to understand how the spray distribution and patternization effects the heat transfer characteristics.

40|$|A frequently‐used hold‐and‐release {{mechanism}} for spacecraft deployables is the “meltwire” or “burnwire”. Here an electrically <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> melts through a fusible restraint to free some sliding, pivoting, or flexing element {{such as a}} hinged solar array, an instrument boom, or an antenna. The heating element is often a length of nichrome wire, but discrete electrical resistors, both surfacemount and through‐hole have also been used. Meltwire release mechanisms present a unique challenge for testing in that they cannot be reused; once melted, the fusible restraint must be replaced. Since this is often a laborious and time‐consuming task, the testing regime is often limited, particularly for small, low‐budget spacecraft. In addition, since the fusible restraint must be replaced after each use, the component that ultimately flies will be one that has not, itself, been tested. We have found that simple mechanisms actuated by Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) devices are an effective alternative to meltwires for small spacecraft applications. In contrast to meltwires, these mechanisms are easily resettable, enabling a low‐cost but robust test campaign to ensure operational reliability. In each case {{the heart of the}} device is a length of nitinol wire, nitinol being a nickel titanium alloy that can be configured to contract 3 to 4 % on heating. Heating is accomplished by passing an electrical current through the wire. The resulting contraction exerts a force {{that can be used to}} move a structure attached to the wire, so implementation of SMA‐actuated release mechanisms revolves around design of mechanisms that can be operated through a simple pull force. When the nitinol returns to its original temperature, it can be stretched mechanically to its original dimension with essentially no degradation of its properties (provided it has not been overheated), allowing the mechanism to be reset and ready for the next actuation. Many of the features of SMA wire actuators are particularly suited (but not limited to) to the kinds of one‐time‐use mechanisms found on satellites. They are light, simple, and easily tested and reset. They present no magnetic signature when not energized. They can also be built into more complex devices that have multiple discrete positions and can even be used to produce or control a motor. In addition, they are clean; they can often be designed without greases or other lubricants that could pose a contamination risk, and they produce no debris when actuated. While there are many reasons to consider SMA wire actuators, prudence demands an understanding of their limitations, particularly with respect to actuation speed, electrical efficiency, longevity, and force limitations. Another key consideration is that the performance of SMA actuators can be severely degraded by overheating. As such, the thermal design must take into account operations in both air and vacuum, and particular care must be taken to ensure that vacuum test procedures do not result in unacceptable thermal stresses. SMA actuators have flown and operated successfully on six spacecraft in the AeroCube series, and these actuators are designed into a number of upcoming missions. This paper will review design, assembly, and testing techniques and present several case studies from recent AeroCube flights...|$|E

The first methods is limited in that redundant thermocouples are also not completely reliable.

The outer perimeter of the asymmetric racetrack modulator is fully etched to maximize optical confinement, and the inner waveguide edge is shallowly etched to maintain an electrically conductive path to the embedded p-n diode and to control the propagation of the asymmetric optical mode and its coupling to the bus waveguide. The <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> based on highly doped Si strips are implemented at {{the outer edge of}} the modulator for thermo-optic control.

Devices with a bending radius of 10 µm and a novel “T”-shaped p-n diode layout have been fabricated, and exhibit electro-optic modulation and heater efficiencies of 28 pm/V and 42 pm/mW, respectively.

Here, the impact of harmonics at the PCCs according to IEEE is studied. This work is based on the simulations of industrial furnaces by means of simulation tool PSCAD/EMTDC in order to approach a reliable simulation method and have a better overview of industrial furnaces operational behaviours. By means of these simulation methods, the appropriate harmonic filters for the furnaces can be applied. Two main industrial furnaces which have been studied here are induction furnaces and <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> furnaces. In this case the study of industrial furnaces principle works is vital. The related wiring diagrams and actual measuring value are also needed. This work is focused on investigations and improvements of harmonic impacts at the Company’s intern PCCs more than harmonic impacts on the grid. These harmonics lead to the lower energy efficiency at the Company and cause damages on the electric devices. Then by reducing the harmonics under the standard limitations the economical benefits will be emerged. Evaluations of power factor values for verifying the existing phase compensation capacitors at the Company has been put into action. In this case the available measured and documented data and information have been used. In this master thesis four numbers induction furnaces and three numbers <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> group furnaces have been studied. All furnaces had one or some harmonic components over the IEEE limitations. By using passive harmonic filters for induction furnaces and two numbers of <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> group furnaces, the harmonic performance are improved and all harmonic components and total demand distortions are reduced under the IEEE limitations. One of the <b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> group furnaces (<b>heating</b> <b>elements</b> group furnace 6) is required structural amendment of its drive system, then applications of passive harmonic filters isn't a proper solution for its harmonic performance improvement. Since the PCCs are on the secondary side of Company’s feeding transformers (10. 5 (kV)), there were some limitations for doing actual measurements. So the studies of previous measurements which are prepared by consultant Companies were another part of this master thesis activities...|$|R
40|$|Herein is {{described}} the fabrication {{and use of}} a plastic multilayer 3 -channel microfluidic fixture. Multilayer devices were produced by laser machining of plastic polymethylmethacrylate and polyethyleneterapthalate laminates by ablation. The fixture consisted of an array of nine individually addressable gold or gold/ITO working electrodes, and a <b>resistive</b> platinum <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> Laser machining of both the fluidic pathways in the plastic laminates, and the stencil masks used for thermal evaporation to form electrode regions on the plastic laminates, enabled rapid and inexpensive implementation of design changes. Electrochemiluminescence reactions in the fixture were achieved and monitored through ITO electrodes. Electroaddressable aryl diazonium chemistry was employed to selectively pattern gold electrodes for electrochemical multianalyte DNA detection from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) samples. Electrochemical detection of dsDNA was achieved by melting of dsDNA molecules in solution with the integrated heater, allowing detection of DNA sequences specific to breast and colorectal cancers with a non-specific binding control. Following detection, the array surface could be renewed via high temperature (95 [*]°C) stripping using the integrated <b>heating</b> <b>element.</b> This versatile and simple method for prototyping devices shows potential for further development of highly integrated, multi-functional bioanalytical devices...|$|R
40|$|Interface {{is the key}} region which determines, to a great extent, the set of {{properties}} of all heterogeneous systems, including composite materials. We reported interface healing of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite material via <b>resistive</b> <b>heating.</b> The carbon fiber, T 700 carbon fiber, with a resistivity of 1. 66 · 10 - 3 Ω·cm {{was used as the}} <b>heating</b> <b>element</b> while the matrix is polyarylether sulfone with cardo. Micro-droplet experiment was used to study the interface strength before and after heating to determine the healing efficiency. The measurement shows (experimental results show) that <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> is an efficient way to heal cracks near interface.

40|$|Electroconsolidation{reg_sign} is {{a process}} for densifying complex-shaped parts using {{electrically}} conductive particulate Solids as a pressure-transmitting medium. The part is immersed within a bed of the particulate medium contained in a die chamber. Heating to sintering temperature is achieved by <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> of the medium while applying compaction pressure. The process is capable of ultra-high temperatures and short cycle times, and it offers the potential for low processing costs. Control of the process as well as selection of process conditions require knowledge of the temperatures within the die. Temperature gradients will exist {{because of the high}} heating rate and because of variations of density and electrical resistivity of the medium due to the presence of the part. Direct measurement of temperature with thermocouples or other conventional means is impractical because of the high temperatures, high currents, and high pressures. Therefore, a computer model was developed to predict the temperature as a function of time and applied voltage for any location in the die. The computer model contains three parts: a geometrical model to approximate the density and resistivity variations in the medium, a finite-element model to calculate the rate of <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> within each <b>element,</b> and a finite-difference model to calculate the temperature distribution based upon solution of the heat-transfer equations. Predicted temperatures {{have been shown to be}} in excellent agreement with measurements...|$|R
