Early recovery technology concentrated on chemical recovery as chemicals cost money and if one could recycle these chemicals then the profitability of pulp manufacture would improve. For pulp mills the significance of electricity generation from the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> was for long secondary. The most important design criterion for the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> was a high availability. The electricity generation in <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> process can be increased by elevated main steam pressure and temperature or by higher black liquor dry solids as well as improving its steam cycle. This has been done in the modern Scandinavian units. Post-print / final draf...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion of tubing used in black-liquor <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> is a {{major concern}} in all pulp and paper mills. Extensive {{corrosion}} in <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> tubes can result in a significant safety and environmental hazard. Considerable plant resources are expended to inspect <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> tubing. Currently, visual and ultrasonic inspections are primarily used during the annual maintenance shutdown to monitor corrosion rates and cracking of tubing. This project is developing guided acoustic waves for use on <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> tubing. The feature of this acoustic technique is its cost-effectiveness in inspecting long lengths of tubes from a single inspection point. A piezoelectric or electromagnetic transducer induces guided waves into the tubes. The transducer detects fireside defects from the cold side or fireside of the tube. Cracking and thinning on <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> tubes have been detected with this technique in both laboratory and field applications...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the main}} hazards in {{operation}} of <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> is the smelt-water explosion.

The smelt water explosion phenomena have been studied by Grace. By 1980 there were about 700 <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> in the world.

Second, Tomlinson <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> have a long life span, often around 40 years, and will probably not be replaced until the end of their economic lifetime, and may in the meantime be upgraded at intervals of 10 – 15 years.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the tasks}} in the project was to obtain data from {{operating}} <b>recovery</b> <b>boilers</b> {{for the purpose of}} model validation. Another task was to obtain water model data and computer output from University of British Columbia for purposes of benchmarking the UBC model against other codes. In the course of discussions on <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> modeling over the course of this project, it became evident that there would be value in having some common cases for carrying out benchmarking exercises with different <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> models. In order to facilitate such a benchmarking exercise, the data that was obtained on this project for validation and benchmarking purposes has been brought together in a single, separate report. The intent is to make this data available to anyone who may want to use it for model validation. The report contains data from three different cases.

40|$|For {{increased}} {{production in}} pulp mills, the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> {{is often a}} bottleneck. Two different approaches to debottleneck the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> have been investigated in two model mills that represent typical Scandinavian pulp mills. As a reference approach, the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> was upgraded. In connection with this, the turbine system was also upgraded to enable increased electricity production. As an alternative to this conventional approach, the load of the boiler was kept constant by extracting lignin from the black liquor {{in proportion to the}} production increase. To keep the steam balance, the specific steam consumption at the mill was reduced through steamsaving measures {{to such an extent that}} the amount of steam produced from burning the lignin-lean black liquor was sufficient. Consequently, the extracted lignin was not needed in-house and could be sold as a biofuel. The net profit of implementing lignin separation was calculated for different conditions. The result was that, depending on the conditions, the lignin price had to be 2 - 17 /MWh for lignin separation to be equally profitable as boiler upgrade. With an assumed lignin price of about 15 /MWh, the conclusion is that lignin separation should be an economically attractive alternative for debottlenecking the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler.</b> With a high power price and a long-term investment strategy, however, upgrading the <b>recovery</b> <b>boiler</b> and the turbine system can be more profitable...|$|R
