40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} interest rate regulation, and subsequent deregulation, on the efficacy of monetary policy and rigidity of <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> deposit rates in Hong Kong. Using an error-correction model, we find that interest rate deregulation increases the efficacy of monetary policy by improving the correlation between <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> deposit rates and market interest rates and increasing the degree of long-term pass-through for <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> deposit rates. Our study also shows that the adjustments in <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> deposit rates are asymmetric and rigid upwards during the regulated period, but tend to be rigid downwards during the deregulated period. The spreads between <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> deposit rates and market rates have also tightened sharply after the removal of interest rate controls.

5|$|The United States National Bank Building in {{downtown}} Portland, Oregon, is {{listed on the}} National Register of Historic Places. Designed by famed Portland architect A. E. Doyle in a Roman classical style, the four-story building's first section, facing Sixth Avenue, was completed and opened in 1917. An extension westward to Broadway, approximately doubling its size, was constructed in 1925. Since then the building has occupied one-half of a city block. It features a four-story-high colonnade of Corinthian order columns at its eastern end, originally the principal façade, and extensive use of glazed terracotta. The interior is also decorated extensively with highly textured materials. The building was constructed for the United States National Bank of Portland (USNB), which ultimately became part of U.S. Bancorp, whose <b>retail</b> <b>banking</b> division operates as U.S. Bank. In 2017, 100 years after the building's opening, it continues {{to serve as the}} bank's main Portland branch.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the pricing}} of bank loans and deposits in euro area countries. We show that <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> interest rates adjust {{not only to}} changes in short term interest rates but also to long-term interest rates. This result, which is arguably intuitive for long-term <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> rates, is also confirmed for bank interest rates on short-term instruments. The transmission of changes in short-term market interest rates along the yield curve {{is found to be}} a key factor explaining the sluggishness of <b>retail</b> <b>bank</b> interest rates. We also show that in the cases where we cannot reject that the adjustment of retail rates has changed since the introduction of the euro, this adjustment has become faster.
