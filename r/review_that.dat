The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, Goldwater {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} moderate Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois after traveling to the Midwest to gain delegates. Dirksen's support further deflated the Stop Goldwater movement, as the Senator had criticized Goldwater's earlier vote against the Civil Rights Act, but concluded upon further <b>review</b> <b>that</b> he was only being consistent with his views. Richard Nixon followed suit and endorsed Goldwater two days later.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a {{crossover}} or mashup title bringing the popular video game characters Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog into one game had been a long-running dream in video game culture. Although Somari does not feature both characters in the same game, the fact that Mario had been placed {{into the world of}} Sonic the Hedgehog was registered with astonishment. Russian gaming magazine Great Drakon scored the game 4/10 (only 2/10 for sales volume) and commented in a <b>review</b> <b>that</b> at last 8-bit console gamers could roughly gain the experience of 16-bit gaming as with Sonic.|$|E

5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company.

5|$|In From Alien to The Matrix: Reading Science Fiction Film, Roz Kaveney {{writes that}} Harold Andrews bullies Ellen Ripley, who is {{demoralized}} {{after the events}} of the first two Alien films. According to Kaveney, Andrews' method of directing the prison from monitors is ironic because David Fincher directed the film the same way (which Sigourney Weaver disliked). In David Fincher: Films That Scar, a literary analysis of the director, Mark Browning writes that Harold Andrews' totalitarian control of Fury 161 exempts Dillon's religiosity because Andrews views religion as a tool to prevent violence and provide control. Film critic Malcolm Johnson wrote in a Hartford Courant <b>review</b> <b>that</b> Andrews was a petty but potent dictator, similar to Benito Mussolini.|$|E

Booklist commented in its <b>review</b> <b>that</b> the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1911, Vermont cruised south the Gulf of Mexico, {{stopping}} {{first in}} Pensacola, Florida. She then continued to Galveston, Texas, stopping there from 7 to 12 June, {{before returning to}} Pensacola the following day. The ship returned to the Atlantic and steamed north to Bar Harbor, Maine; she was present there for the 4th of July celebrations, after which the typical routine of training with the Atlantic Fleet off Provincetown and in Cape Cod Bay followed. She remained off New England through mid-August. During this period, she visited Salem, Massachusetts and underwent repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. Later in the year, she moved south to Tangier Sound and the Virginia Capes for gunnery experiments and target practice. From 12 September to 9 October, Vermont was in the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs, after which she steamed to Hampton Roads before proceeding with the fleet to New York City for a Naval <b>Review</b> <b>that</b> lasted from 24 October to 2 November. After {{the conclusion of the}} review, she joined the 1st Squadron for maneuvers and then returned to Hampton Roads.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{addresses}} hominization from {{an ironic}} point of view. Mankind's evolution from the ape-like Australopithecus afarenses to modern society with history, technology and cultural expression is compressed into only seven days. The strong allusion to faith is contrasted by numerous references to scientific insights. With {{the evolution of}} mankind starting in Central Africa, Lucy is the name given to the first skeleton of an Australopitecus afarensis found. The characters mention that Homo erectus would be the hominid species to tame fire. Orrorin and Toumaï represent two of the oldest-known hominin ancestors, while Aegyptopithecus zeuxis {{is one of the}} earliest primates. Through scientific references and a distinct ironic tone, Ingrid Reichel makes it clear in her <b>review</b> <b>that</b> the book cannot be taken in by any religion or fundamentalism.|$|E

5|$|Typewriter in the Sky was {{generally}} well-received, and regular readers of Hubbard's stories {{at the time}} widely appreciated the work. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas wrote in a 1951 <b>review</b> <b>that</b> the story was amusing though it could have used copy editing, and Groff Conklin described its concept as silly. The New York Times review the same year said it had a lively pace. Damon Knight was critical of the depiction of the protagonist's fate, and concluded {{the ending of the}} book made up for this defect. Books including The Classic Era of American Pulp Magazines and Pulp Culture: The Art of Fiction Magazines characterized the work as one of Hubbard's best stories. Adam Roberts pointed out Hubbard likely based the character of pulp fiction writer Horace Hackett on himself.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} merger, Bernhard decided to retire, and {{approached}} Edward Ferman, {{the editor of}} Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Joel Davis, at Ziff-Davis, among others, about a possible sale of Amazing. Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, believed he had concluded a deal with Bernhard, and began to advertise for submissions, but the negotiations failed. Bernhard also approached George H. Scithers, who declined, but put Bernhard in touch with Gary Gygax of TSR. On 27 May 1982 TSR, Inc. acquired the trademarks and copyrights of Amazing Stories. Scithers was taken on by TSR as editor beginning with the November 1982 issue. He was replaced by Patrick Lucien Price in September 1986, and then by Kim Mohan in May 1991. TSR ceased publication of Amazing with the Winter 1995 issue, but in 1997, shortly after they were acquired by Wizards of the Coast, the magazine was relaunched, again with Mohan as editor. This version lasted for only ten issues, though it did include a special celebratory 600th issue in early 2000. The science fiction trade journal Locus commented in an early <b>review</b> <b>that</b> distribution of the magazine seemed to be weak. The title proved unable to survive: the last issue of this version was dated Summer 2000. The title was then acquired by Paizo Publishing, who launched a new monthly version in September 2004. The February 2005 issue was the last printed; a March 2005 issue was released in PDF format, and in March 2006 Paizo {{announced that it would}} no longer publish Amazing. In September 2011, the trademark for Amazing Stories was acquired by Steve Davidson, and online publication began in 2012 with two issues in July and August.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, 2013, reports {{surfaced}} {{that there}} will be a third G.I. Joe film, and it will likely be in 3D. The studio announced that Chu will return to direct the third film. While at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con, Chu talked about bringing Scarlett back in the next film. The writers of the second film are also thinking about bringing back the Baroness in the sequel. Johnson is interested in returning as Roadblock for the sequel, and Park has talked about a possible return as Snake Eyes and also including his pet wolf Timber. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura has stated he is open to doing a G.I. Joe/Transformers crossover, which Chu stated that he would be interested in directing. Bonaventura told Beijing News that he hoped that Johnson and Willis would return, the script is still in the writing stage, and that they are considering adding a third important role. On September 10, 2013, Chu was confirmed to direct the film, along with writer Evan Daugherty (Snow White and the Huntsman, Divergent, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) to pen the film's script. On December 5, 2013, Daugherty talked about writing the film's script and his feelings about Duke being killed, but Chu told MTV that Tatum may return as Duke in the sequel. On April 2, 2014, in an interview with Collider, Johnson believes that Chu may not return to direct, due to working on the live action Jem film, but they may find another director for the film. It was revealed that the third film will have a 2016 release date. On June 23, 2014, di Bonaventura told Collider in an interview that they're meeting with new directors and filming may start in early 2015. On July 1, 2014, Variety reported that Jonathan Lemkin will write the script for the film and will focus on Roadblock with Johnson returning. On February 5, 2015, Film Divider reported that the twins Tomax and Xamot and Matt Trakker from the TV series M.A.S.K. will be appearing. On April 2, 2015, the studio hired Aaron Berg to write the film, and D. J. Caruso to direct the film. On November 23, 2015, Deadline reported that Akiva Goldsman will lead a writers room for the next G.I. Joe film. In September 2016, Byung-Hun Lee told LRM <b>Review</b> <b>that</b> the studio doing the third film is waiting on the actors to return, including Johnson. On January 18, 2017, Caruso has stated to Collider that the script for the crossover movie is now being written. In May 2017, Dwayne Johnson stated that if the opportunity arises he would appear in any future G.I. Joe film, and that he hopes to be a part of the franchise expansion as well. It was announced in September 2017 that the third film is cancelled and a reboot of the franchise will happen.|$|E
