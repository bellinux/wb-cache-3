Utility relocation work started at Tysons Corner in mid-2008.|$|E
5|$|The first Secretary of Transportation was Alan Stephenson Boyd, {{nominated}} {{to the post}} by Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson. Ronald Reagan's second Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole, was the first female holder, and Mary Peters was the second. Gerald Ford's nominee William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr. was the first African American to serve as Transportation Secretary, and Federico Peña, serving under Bill Clinton, was the first Hispanic to hold the position, subsequently becoming Secretary of Energy. Japanese-American Norman Mineta, who had previously been Secretary of Commerce, is the longest-serving Secretary, holding the post for over {{five and a half}} years, and Andrew Card is the shortest-serving Secretary, serving only eleven months. Neil Goldschmidt was the youngest secretary, taking office at age thirty nine, while Norman Mineta was the oldest, retiring at age seventy four. On January 23, 2009, the sixteenth secretary <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> took office, serving under the administration of Democrat Barack Obama; he had previously been a Republican Congressman from Illinois for fourteen years. The salary of the Secretary of Transportation is $199,700.|$|E
25|$|On December 19, 2008, then-President-elect Barack Obama {{announced}} that he would nominate former Republican Congressman <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> to be the next Transportation Secretary. He was confirmed by a voice vote on January 23, 2009.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ray</b> H. <b>LaHood</b> (born December 6, 1945) is an American {{politician}} {{who served as}} United States Secretary of Transportation from 2009 until 2013. A Republican from Illinois, LaHood represented Illinois's 18th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 to 2009.

25|$|The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration is {{in talks}} {{with a number of}} {{countries}} with high-speed rail, notably Japan, France and Spain. On 16 May 2009, FRA Deputy Chief Karen Rae expressed hope that Japan would offer its technical expertise to Canada and the United States.

25|$|U.S. DOT {{initiative}} on distracted driving: Former Secretary of Transportation <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> has made prevention of distracted driving a policy priority within the Department. National summits {{on the topic}} were held in 2009 and 2010, the second of which emphasized the role of employer policies in reducing distraction-related crashes.

25|$|Anthony Foxx, Mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina was {{nominated}} by President Barack Obama on April 29, 2013, to succeed <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood.</b> On June 10, 2013 the Commerce, Science and Technology Committee unanimously approved Foxx's nomination. On June 27, 2013 Foxx was unanimously (100–0) {{confirmed by the}} U.S. Senate. Foxx was sworn in on July 2, as the 17th Secretary of Transportation.|$|E
25|$|After President Obama was re-elected in 2012, Granholm was {{reportedly}} {{considered for a}} position in Obama's second-term Cabinet, specifically to succeed Chu as Secretary of Energy, <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> as U.S. Secretary of Transportation, Hilda Solis as U.S. Secretary of Labor or Eric Holder as U.S Attorney General. Granholm herself dampened such speculation, citing her sharp criticism of Republicans during the 2012 election and her time presenting on Current TV.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, the Federal Highway Administration {{modified}} the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices {{which would have}} required the replacement of Lower Merion's historic street signs, some of which {{dating back to the}} early 1910s. After some campaigning by local residents and by Senator Pat Toomey, the Lower Merion Board of Commissioners declared, via an ordinance, the entire Lower Merion as a historic district and received a waiver from Secretary of Transportation <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of Tom DeLay's {{indictment}} in September 2005, Wamp campaigned among his fellow Republican House members to become the majority whip, the number three position in the Republican House leadership. Representatives <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> and Gil Gutknecht agreed to co-chair his campaign for the position. However, the incumbent, Roy Blunt, remained the majority whip because Blunt lost his race for Majority Leader (the position was won by John Boehner in February 2006).|$|E
25|$|On December 9, 2010, U.S. Transportation Secretary <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> {{announced}} {{that much of}} the $810 million that Wisconsin was supposed to get would be redistributed to other states, including California, Florida and Washington. According to Wisconsin Governor-elect Scott Walker, LaHood said Wisconsin would not have to pay the federal government back for money already spent. In addition, Wisconsin would get to retain $2 million to fund upgrades on Amtrak's existing Milwaukee-to-Chicago Hiawatha line.|$|E
25|$|Twice a Florida High Speed Rail {{system was}} {{proposed}} to connect Miami with Orlando and Tampa. First in 2000, which was opposed by then Florida governor Jeb Bush, then in 2009 {{the plan was}} revived with a grant offered under Obama's American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. However, Florida governor Rick Scott denied the funding in 2011, citing that {{it was still a}} risk due to uncertain ridership estimates and actual construction and maintenance costs, which could have been a burden to taxpayers. Many were disappointed in Scott's vehement denial of the money. 26 Florida senators from both political parties signed a letter to United States Secretary of Transportation <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> encouraging him to ignore Scott's decision, and even former governor Jeb Bush, who was against the previous high-speed rail proposal, was surprised by Scott's actions. The money was ultimately directed to other states and the plan killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{plans were}} {{approved}} by the Metro (regional government) council in July 2006 and by the Portland city council in September 2007, the council committing to allocating $27 million of city funds. The estimated {{total cost of the}} project is $147 million, just over half of which is to be paid for with federal funds. On April 30, 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> announced the approval of $75 million in federal funding for the Eastside streetcar project, the full amount that had been requested by Portland. This allocation, secured in large part through the efforts of Oregon Representatives Earl Blumenauer and Peter DeFazio, was both the largest and the final component of the financing plan, and consequently the announcement meant the project could proceed to construction as soon as the city council had approved construction contracts. Twenty million dollars in state funds, $15.5 million from a Local Improvement District and a combination of various other local or regional sources complete the funding plan. Construction began in August 2009.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-two {{members of}} the Obama {{administration}} are either in the United States Cabinet (15) or are in positions considered to be Cabinet-level (7) and must be confirmed by the current Senate. The {{members of the}} Cabinet are {{the heads of the}} fifteen major departments (State, Defense, Justice, etc.), and the seven cabinet-level positions are the Vice President, White House Chief of Staff, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador to the United Nations, and Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Since Robert Gates {{was a member of the}} previous administration, his letter of resignation (a formality at the end of a President's term) was simply not accepted, and he did not need confirmation. On January 19, 2009, Senate Democratic leaders requested fifteen of the twenty-two positions to be ratified by unanimous consent, and seven gained unanimous confirmation by voice vote the next day: Ken Salazar, Steven Chu, Arne Duncan, Peter Orszag, Eric Shinseki, Tom Vilsack, and Janet Napolitano. On January 21, Obama presided over the swearing in of the seven unanimous nominees. Later that day, the Senate confirmed Hillary Clinton by a 94–2 vote. On January 22, several more confirmations were approved unanimously: Susan E. Rice, <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood,</b> Lisa P. Jackson, and Shaun Donovan. On January 26, the Senate confirmed Timothy Geithner by a 60–34 margin, and Holder was confirmed on February 2 by a 75–21 margin. Of the 31 nominations that Obama has made to senior posts only 17 were approved in January.|$|E
500|$|The Democratic Party gained 30 {{seats in}} the House in the 2006 {{elections}} and Emanuel received considerable praise for his stewardship of the DCCC, even from Illinois Republican Rep. <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> who said [...] "He legitimately can be called the golden boy of the Democratic Party today. He recruited the right candidates, found the money and funded them, and provided issues for them. Rahm did what {{no one else could}} do in seven cycles." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 6, 2011, the MWAA Board voted 9 to 4 {{to build}} an {{underground}} station located [...] from the airport terminal rather than an above-ground station [...] away from the terminal. The underground station would be more convenient to travelers, but would come at an additional cost of $330 million and would extend the construction time of the project, delaying the expected opening to mid-2017. Former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell opposed the decision to build a more expensive underground station and threatened to withhold support for the project. U.S. Secretary of Transportation <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> offered to mediate the dispute. On March 7, 2012, the projected $3.8 billion cost for Phase II was reduced to $2.7 billion with {{the elimination of the}} underground station at Dulles Airport and other cost savings.|$|E

2500|$|Also on January 11, 2013, the FAA {{completed}} {{a comprehensive review}} of the 787's critical systems, including the design, manufacture and assembly. The Department of Transportation secretary <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> stated the administration was [...] "looking for the root causes" [...] behind the recent issues. The head of the FAA, Michael Huerta, said that so far nothing found [...] "suggests [...] is not safe".|$|E

The head of the FAA, Michael Huerta, said that so far nothing found [...] "suggests [...] is not safe". Japan's transport ministry also launched an investigation in response.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, U.S. Transportation Secretary <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> {{announced}} a new edition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, incorporating changes recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board. [...] One of the changes, {{in response to the}} inadequate marking of an HOV lane exit at [...] Northside Drive in Atlanta, is the addition of different lane markings for lanes not continuing beyond an intersection or interchange to give drivers more warning that they need to switch lanes if they don’t intend to turn.|$|E
2500|$|On October 2, 2006, Representative <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> (R-IL) {{called for}} the page program to be {{temporarily}} suspended. He stated that [...] "this is a flawed program. The fact that a member of Congress is sending e-mails to a page and {{that he can get}} away with it [...] obviously there are problems." [...] Two more Representatives, Jon Porter (R-NV) and Kay Granger (R-TX) also supported LaHood's recommendation to suspend the page program until an outside team could evaluate its security protocol. Hastert announced on October 5, 2006 that he was launching an investigation to evaluate and make improvements to the page program.|$|E
2500|$|The United Streetcar prototype, number 015 in the Portland Streetcar fleet, was {{delivered}} on May 15, 2009, {{but did not}} enter service until 2012. The car is model 10T, the same as Škoda-built cars 001-007, but features a slightly modified end design. Although the differences are relatively minor, car 015 {{is considered to be}} model variant 10T3, whereas cars 001-005 were 10T0 and cars 006-007 were 10T2. Car 015, which carries a red, white and blue paint scheme and large [...] "Made in USA" [...] lettering along the sides, was presented to the public in a July 1, 2009 ceremony, at which Secretary <b>Ray</b> <b>LaHood</b> was the featured speaker.|$|E
2500|$|Following his inauguration, Obama and the Senate {{worked to}} confirm his nominees to the United States Cabinet. Three Cabinet-level {{officers}} {{did not require}} confirmation: Vice President Joe Biden, who Obama had chosen {{as his running mate}} at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who Obama chose to retain from the previous administration. [...] An early list of suggestions came from Michael Froman, then an executive at Citigroup. Obama described his Cabinet choices as a [...] "team of rivals," [...] and Obama chose several prominent public officials for Cabinet positions, including former Democratic primary rival Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. Obama nominated several former Clinton administration officials to the Cabinet and to other positions. On April 28, 2009, the Senate confirmed former Kansas governor Kathleen Sebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services, completing Obama's initial Cabinet. During Obama's presidency, four Republicans served in Obama's Cabinet: <b>Ray</b> <b>Lahood</b> as Secretary of Transportation, Robert McDonald as Secretary of Veteran's Affairs, and Gates and Chuck Hagel as Secretaries of Defense.|$|E
