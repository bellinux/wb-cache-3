40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{consider}} the meaning of "economic substance" in taxation. 　In Japanese Income Tax Act （Article 12 ）, where a person to whom the revenue is legally imputed is merely nominal and other person enjoys it, the tax shall be imposed on the person who actually enjoys the revenue. This is called "the Principle of taxation on Actual Beneficiary". But it is not always easy to determine the person who actually enjoys the <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> <b>assets</b> or business. In such a case, there are two ways of thinking. The first is a way of thinking in which a valid private-law contract is considered more important than economic substance. The second is a way of thinking in which economic substance is considered more important than a private-law contract. 　This provision（ Article 12 ） was enacted in 1950 ＇s, but opinions are divided among scholars on this point and there is room for further consideration.

Thus non-tax revenue is defined as government revenue that is either requited or voluntary or both. In the case of voluntary requited payments a further distinction is made between <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> <b>assets</b> and <b>revenue</b> <b>from</b> sale of goods and services. Heads of accounts in state government budgets for different non-tax sources are then identified in a table.

Next, the relation between non-tax revenue and subsidies is discussed. Following this, principles for optimally pricing goods and services in which the government has market power are reviewed. These principles are of crucial importance for practical policy. The section closes with a preliminary attempt to devise a framework for assessing non-tax revenue performance, drawing on the conceptual discussion in the paper.

40|$|We empirically {{investigate}} {{the relevance of}} demand-side complementarity between electronic and traditional provision of banking services. Since no systematic data on prices for {{the two types of}} services is available, {{it is not possible to}} estimate cross-elasticities of demand. We resort to two indirect tests. The first test is based on estimating the relationship between branches and the diffusion of e-banking services in local markets, controlling for individual bank and market characteristics employing new data for Italian banks referring to 1998 - 2001. We find that banks expanded relatively more in the e-business in those local markets where they had relatively fewer branches, with the exclusion of markets where the banks were chartered. The second test is based on measuring the impact of the joint provision of banking services - electronically and at traditional branches - on banksÂ’ revenues per customer. We estimate a non-standard revenue function that relates <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> <b>asset</b> management, brokerage and payment services to the share of customers employing e-banking, given the total number of bank customers. Our results show that a high share of e-customers is associated with a reduction in revenues per customer. This evidence suggests that banks did not extract substantial consumer surplus from the joint provision of electronic services and traditional services at the branch. We interpret the results of both our test as not consistent with the hypothesis of complementarity between stores and e-commerce in the banking industry. commercial banks, e-banking, electronic transactions, store proximity...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} gradual {{administrative}} and political decentralization in Bulgaria started in 1991, {{but the real}} financial decentralization process started {{in the beginning of}} 2003 with the adoption of a comparatively clear expenditure assignment and introduction of a transparent and predictable intergovernmental transfer system. Step by step, local governments have been given full control over some of the own-source revenues (local fees, service prices and <b>revenues</b> <b>from</b> municipal <b>asset</b> management) and limited control over the local tax levy. This study is intended to examine and critically analyze the financial decentralization reform in Bulgaria, outlining the key achievements and basic weaknesses of expenditure assignment, local taxation and intergovernmental fiscal relations. The results indicate that local governments gradually became powerful component of the public sector. Although reducing financial resources of the public sector, worldwide economic and financial crisis can turn into an opportunity for some of the local governments in the country to gain financial independence and concentrate the efforts on strengthening local tax capacity.

40|$|China has {{experienced}} more than 25 years of extraordinary economic growth. Underlying this {{growth has been}} a decentralized fiscal system, in which provinces and large cities are given the freedom to make infrastructure investmentsto stimulate local development, and are allowed to retain {{a large part of}} the fiscal revenues that are generated from economic activity. Although successful as a growth strategy, this policy created two problems for national fiscal management. First, it significantly reduced the central government's share of fiscal <b>revenues,</b> which fell <b>from</b> 34. 8 percent in 1980 to 22 percent in 1992. Second, it widened economic and fiscal disparities between the rapidly growing urban coastal region and the rest of the country. Rapid growth in subnational debt (which rose 23 -fold in a decade) and subnational nonperforming loans (estimated by the authors to range between US$ 100 billion and US$ 150 billion) has placed pressure on China's financial system. Traditionally, China has favored bank lending as a source of finance because the banking system has provided a vehicle for central political control over local debt. But as China's financial system matures, creditworthiness standards must become more important. The authors recommend greater use of the <b>revenue</b> streams <b>from</b> infrastructure <b>assets</b> as a financing source, and gradual relaxation of central political control over subnational debt. One step in this direction would permit leading cities to issue municipal bonds based on objective financial standards.
