50|$|Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and <b>related</b> <b>polymers</b> (PEG {{phospholipid}} constructs) {{are often}} sonicated {{when used in}} biomedical applications. However, as reported by Murali et al., PEG is very sensitive to sonolytic degradation and PEG degradation products can be toxic to mammalian cells. It is, thus, imperative to assess potential PEG degradation {{to ensure that the}} final material does not contain undocumented contaminants that can introduce artifacts into experimental results.|$|E
50|$|Vulcanization or {{vulcanisation}} is {{a chemical}} process for converting natural rubber or <b>related</b> <b>polymers</b> into more durable materials {{by the addition}} of sulfur or other equivalent curatives or accelerators. These additives modify the polymer by forming cross-links (bridges) between individual polymer chains. Vulcanized materials are less sticky and have superior mechanical properties. The term vulcanized fiber refers to cellulose that has been treated in a zinc chloride solution to cross-link the cellulose fibers.|$|E

5000|$|Xanthate usually {{refers to}} a salt with the formula [...] (R = alkyl; M+ = Na+, K+). [...] The name {{xanthate}}s is derived from Greek [...] xanthos, meaning “yellowish, golden”, and indeed most xanthate salts are yellow. They were discovered and named in 1823 by the Danish chemist William Christopher Zeise. These organosulfur compounds are important in two areas, the production of cellophane and <b>related</b> <b>polymers</b> from cellulose and secondly in mining for the extraction of certain ores. [...] They are also versatile intermediates in organic synthesis. Xanthates also refer to esters of xanthic acid. These esters have the structure ROC(=S)SR′.|$|E

At low temperatures, the luminescence is longer lived, and at 77 K there is an interesting red shift of the emission during the first nanoseconds after photoexcitation. We consider that this arises from migration of excitons to more-conjugated (and therefore lower energy) regions of the sample...|$|E
