5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead space, or inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscles</b> {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscles</b> can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E

40|$|Question: After stroke, does <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> {{training}} increase <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> strength and/or endurance? Are {{any benefits}} carried over to activity and/or participation? Does it reduce respiratory complications? Design: Systematic review of randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Participants: Adults with <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> weakness following stroke. Intervention: <b>Respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training aimed at increasing inspiratory and/or expiratory muscle strength. Outcome measures: Five outcomes were of interest: <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> strength, <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> endurance, activity, participation and respiratory complications. Results: Five trials involving 263 participants were included. The mean PEDro score was 6. 4 (range 3 to 8), showing moderate methodological quality. Random-effects meta-analyses showed that <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training increased maximal inspiratory pressure by 7 cmH 2 O (95 % CI 1 to 14) and maximal expiratory pressure by 13 cmH 2 O (95 % CI 1 to 25); it also decreased {{the risk of}} respiratory complications (RR 0. 38, 95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 96) compared with no/sham respiratory intervention. Whether these effects carry over to activity and participation remains uncertain. Conclusion: This systematic review provided evidence that <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training is effective after stroke. Meta-analyses based on five trials indicated that 30  minutes of <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training, five times per week, for 5 weeks {{can be expected to}} increase <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> strength in very weak individuals after stroke.

30|$|<b>Respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> fatigue {{appears to}} result from {{increased}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> work combined with competition with the locomotor muscles of the limbs for blood flow (Romer and Polkey 2008).

5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common.

5|$|The lungs {{of mammals}} are spongy and honeycombed. Breathing is mainly {{achieved}} with the diaphragm, which divides the thorax from the abdominal cavity, forming a dome convex to the thorax. Contraction of the diaphragm flattens the dome, increasing {{the volume of}} the lung cavity. Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities, and travels through the larynx, trachea and bronchi, and expands the alveoli. Relaxing the diaphragm has the opposite effect, decreasing {{the volume of the}} lung cavity, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs. During exercise, the abdominal wall contracts, increasing pressure on the diaphragm, which forces air out quicker and more forcefully. The rib cage is able to expand and contract the chest cavity through the action of other <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscles.</b> Consequently, air is sucked into or expelled out of the lungs, always moving down its pressure gradient. This type of lung is known as a bellows lung due to its resemblance to blacksmith bellows.|$|E

Upper airway dilator and thoracic pump muscles retain a remarkable capacity for plasticity throughout life, both in health and disease states. Hypoxia, whatever the cause, is a potent driver of <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> remodeling with evidence of adaptive and maladaptive outcomes for system performance. The pattern, duration, and intensity of hypoxia are key determinants of <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> structural-, metabolic-, and functional responses and adaptation. Age and sex also influence <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> tolerance of hypoxia. Redox stress emerges as the principal protagonist driving <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> malady in rodent models of hypoxic disease. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that antioxidant intervention alleviates hypoxia-induced <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> dysfunction, and that N-acetyl cysteine, approved for use in humans, is highly effective in preventing hypoxia-induced <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> weakness and fatigue. We posit that oxygen homeostasis is a key driver of <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> form and function.

25|$|Scoliosis is also {{classified}} {{according to}} the region(s) they affect. The vertebral column can be deformed at the thoracic level, at the lumbar level or at both.

500|$|For {{people whose}} {{injuries}} are {{high enough to}} interfere with breathing, there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery. Weakness of <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscles</b> impairs the ability to cough effectively, allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs.

[...] Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations, postural drainage, respiratory muscle training, and assisted cough techniques.

500|$|It is {{not fully}} {{understood}} why some obese people develop obesity hypoventilation syndrome while others do not. It is likely {{that it is the}} result of an interplay of various processes. Firstly, work of breathing is increased as adipose tissue restricts the normal movement of the chest muscles and makes the chest wall less compliant, the diaphragm moves less effectively, <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscles</b> are fatigued more easily, and airflow {{in and out of the}} lung is impaired by excessive tissue in the head and neck area. Hence, people with obesity need to expend more energy to breathe effectively. These factors together lead to sleep-disordered breathing and inadequate removal of carbon dioxide from the circulation and hence hypercapnia; given that carbon dioxide in aqueous solution combines with water to form an acid (CO2 + H2O + excess H2O --> H2CO3), this causes acidosis (increased acidity of the blood). Under normal circumstances, central chemoreceptors in the brain stem detect the acidity, and respond by increasing the respiratory rate; in OHS, this [...] "ventilatory response" [...] is blunted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Enhanced <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> {{strength}} {{in patients with}} heart failure positively alters the clinical trajectory of heart failure. In an experimental model, <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training in rats with heart failure {{has been shown to}} improve cardiopulmonary function through mechanisms yet to be entirely elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The present report aimed to evaluate the <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training effects in diaphragm citrate synthase activity and hemodynamic function in rats with heart failure. METHODS: Wistar rats were divided into four experimental groups: sedentary sham (Sed-Sham, n= 8), trained sham (RMT-Sham, n= 8), sedentary heart failure (Sed-HF, n= 7) and trained heart failure (RMT-HF, n= 7). The animals were submitted to a RMT protocol performed 30 minutes a day, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks. RESULTS: In rats with heart failure, <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training decreased pulmonary congestion and right ventricular hypertrophy. Deleterious alterations in left ventricular pressures, as well as left ventricular contractility and relaxation, were assuaged by <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training in heart failure rats. Citrate synthase activity, which was significantly reduced in heart failure rats, was preserved by <b>respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training. Additionally, a negative correlation was found between citrate synthase and left ventricular end diastolic pressure and positive correlation was found between citrate synthase and left ventricular systolic pressure. CONCLUSION: <b>Respiratory</b> <b>muscle</b> training produces beneficial adaptations in the diaphragmatic musculature, which is linked to improvements in left ventricular hemodynamics and blood pressure in heart failure rats.
