40|$|The ever-growing {{number of}} out-of-home {{children}} in Italy {{over the last}} decade has urged an assessment of the available care services. Although foster care is spreading rapidly, many young people are still housed in residential <b>facilities.</b> Reflection on <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> quality has intensified at both a national and an international level. This paper presents the results of a study on <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> for children and young people in the region of Northern Italy (Lombardy). Four dimensions of ‘quality’ are considered: efficiency, effectiveness, participation in planning and intervention, and empowerment of children and their family relationships. The combined effects of these dimensions are defined as ‘relational quality’. The results show that <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> are generally good, while Social Services resources often appear inadequate for interventions aimed at birth families (efficiency). The well-being of children in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> is high, even if they tend to move from one facility to another, rarely returning to their birth family (effectiveness). The involvement of children and their families at different stages of the care path is limited (participative approach). Finally, the most critical element is the failure to properly involve birth families (empowerment) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis provides insight into the role animals play in different periods of a person’s life. The usefulness of human-animal interaction is demonstrated {{with a description of}} the ways of working with animals and the presentation of different animal species. The emphasis is put on children and minors placed in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> While the advantages of introducing animals into <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> are provided, the weaknesses and risks are also pointed out. In the empirical part, a mixed quantitative-qualitative research method was used to find in what ways and to what extent animals are included in educational activities as well as present in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> in Slovenia. An important question this dissertation poses is what care workers think about introducing animals into institutions where they work, what are their experiences and knowledge. The sample represents 73 care workers who filled in the questionnaire and one care worker who contributed his point of view through an open conversation. The results have shown that there are no animals permanently staying at institutions. The care workers are aware of the benefits that contact to animals could have for children and they involve animals in their work in different manners. The Animal Assisted Activity/Therapy are less known to them. They do express certain difficulties and obstacles that occur while integrating animals in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> and are mostly bound to the systematical regulations of the area. Some care workers are giving suggestions on how the animals could be more integrated, as care workers report that children/minors are expressing the need to have a contact with animals...|$|R
40|$|Aims - Characteristics of {{patients}} living in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> {{and the availability}} of mental hospital- and residential beds in Italy and The Netherlands were compared to assess whether differences in the process of deinstitutionalisation have influenced the composition of their residential patient populations. Methods - Data from the Dutch UTOPIA-study (UTilization & Outcome of Patients In the Association of Dutch <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> providers) and the Italian PROGRES-study were used. Results - Dutch residents were more likely to suffer from substance or alcohol abuse than Italian residents. The latter were more likely to suffer from schizophrenia or a related disorder, less likely to have experienced mental hospital admissions and showed an overall shorter duration of stay in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities.</b> Contrary to our expectations Dutch residents, who still have good access to long stay beds in mental hospitals, are not less disabled than Italian residents. Finally, the number of beds in <b>residential</b> <b>care</b> <b>facilities</b> per 10, 000 inhabitants in the Netherlands is twice (6) as high as in Italy (3). Conclusions - The Italian and Dutch deinstitutionalisation processes have resulted in a different availability in the number of residential beds. However, it did not influence the overall level of functioning of both residential populations.
