500|$|A {{radiative}} air well {{is designed}} to cool a substrate by <b>radiating</b> <b>heat</b> to the night sky. The substrate has a low mass so that it cannot hold onto heat, and it is thermally isolated from any mass, including the ground. A typical radiative collector presents a condensing surface at an angle of 30° from the horizontal. The condensing surface is backed by {{a thick layer of}} insulating material such as polystyrene foam and supported [...] above ground level. Such condensers may be conveniently installed on the ridge roofs of low buildings or supported by a simple frame. Although other heights do not typically work quite so well, it may be less expensive or more convenient to mount a collector near to ground level or on a two-story building.|$|E
500|$|The Cabernet grape variety has thriven in {{a variety}} of {{vineyard}} soil types, making the consideration of soil less of concern particularly for New World winemakers. In Bordeaux, the soil aspect of terroir was historically an important consideration in determining which of the major Bordeaux grape varieties were planted. While Merlot seemed to thrive in clay- and limestone-based soils (such as those of the Right Bank regions of the Gironde estuary), Cabernet Sauvignon seemed to perform better in the gravel-based soil of the Médoc region on the Left Bank. The gravel soils offered the benefit of being well drained while absorbing and <b>radiating</b> <b>heat</b> to the vines, aiding ripening. Clay- and limestone-based soils are often cooler, allowing less heat to reach the vines, delaying ripening. In regions where the climate is warmer, there is more emphasis on soil that is less fertile, which promotes less vigor in the vine which can keep yields low. In the Napa Valley wine regions of Oakville and Rutherford, the soil is more alluvial and dusty. Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon has been often quoted as giving a sense of terroir with a taste of [...] "Rutherford dust". In the South Australian wine region of Coonawarra, Cabernet Sauvignon has produced vastly different results from grape vines planted in the region's terra rosa soil– {{so much so that the}} red soil is considered the [...] "boundary" [...] of the wine region, with some controversy from wine growers with Cabernet Sauvignon planted on red soil.|$|E

Little was said; those of the Northland are early taught the {{futility}} of words and the inestimable value of deeds. With the temperature at sixty-five below zero, a man cannot lie many minutes in the snow and live. So the sled lashings were cut, and the sufferer, rolled in furs, laid on a couch of boughs. Before him roared a fire, built of the very wood which wrought the mishap.

A new moon was thrusting a dim horn above the white line of close-packed snow-capped pines which ringed the camp and segregated it from all the world. Overhead, so clear it was and cold, the stars danced with quick, pulsating movements. To the southeast an evanescent greenish glow heralded the opening revels of the aurora borealis. Two men, in the immediate foreground, lay upon the bearskin which was their bed. Between the skin and naked snow was a six-inch layer of pine boughs. The blankets were rolled back. For shelter, there was a fly at their backs,--a sheet of canvas stretched between two trees and angling at forty-five degrees. This caught the <b>radiating</b> <b>heat</b> from the fire and flung it down upon the skin. Another man sat on a sled, drawn close to the blaze, mending moccasins. To the right, a heap of frozen gravel and a rude windlass denoted where they toiled each day in dismal groping for the pay-streak. To the left, four pairs of snowshoes stood erect, showing the mode of travel which obtained when the stamped snow of the camp was left behind.|$|E
6000|$|And, finally, even on {{that great}} scale {{we are able}} to verify the result. The case is one of those rare cases, as we have shown them to be, in which nature works the {{experiment}} for us in the same manner in which we ourselves perform it; introducing into the previous state of things a single and perfectly definite new circumstance, and manifesting the effect so rapidly that there is not time for any other material change in the pre-existing circumstances. “It is observed that dew is never copiously deposited in situations much screened from the open sky, and not at all in a cloudy night; but if the clouds withdraw even for a few minutes, and leave a clear opening, a deposition of dew presently begins, and goes on increasing... Dew formed in clear intervals will often even evaporate again when the sky becomes thickly overcast.” The proof, therefore, is complete, that {{the presence or absence of}} an uninterrupted communication with the sky causes the deposition or non-deposition of dew. Now, since a clear sky is nothing but the absence of clouds, and it is a known property of clouds, as of all other bodies between which and any given object nothing intervenes but an elastic fluid, that they tend to raise or keep up the superficial temperature of the object by <b>radiating</b> <b>heat</b> to it, we see at once that the disappearance of clouds will cause the surface to cool; so that nature, in this case, produces a change in the antecedent by definite and known means, and the consequent follows accordingly: a natural experiment which satisfies the requisitions of the Method of Difference.(141) ...|$|E
40|$|On {{nearly every}} length scale <b>radiated</b> <b>heat</b> {{transfer}} between two objects {{can be described}} using the exact same theory. However, this theory, which is invariant {{with respect to the}} distances separating the objects, breaks down over distances of a few microns or less. <b>Radiated</b> <b>heat</b> flux between objects on these scales experiences an enhancement that grows as the distance between the objects shrinks. This enhancement, known as near field <b>radiated</b> <b>heat</b> transfer (NFRT) arises from phonon polartion resonances on the surfaces of the materials. Not all materials experience these resonances and only those that have resonances in the near IR will experience this phenomenon. One material with such resonances is sapphire. Expanding and improving upon previous work we created a calorimeter capable of probing this effect in sapphire. Our new methods remove many of the previous issues associated with thermal drift and electrostatic forces. This novel system combined with new probing techniques has allowed us to measure fluxes as small as 30 nW at separation distances as small as a few tens of nanometers. Using this system we were able to observe anomalous <b>radiated</b> <b>heat</b> flow between sapphire near room temperature. Furthermore, the system was robust enough to function at low temperatures allowing us to confirm the temperature dependence of this effect down to temperatures as low as 100 K...|$|R

The reed walls glistened {{in the light of}} the fire, the smoke of which, thin and blue, drifted slanting in a succession of rings and spirals across the doorway, whose empty blackness seemed to him impenetrable and enigmatical like a curtain hiding vast spaces full of unexpected surprises. This was only his fancy, but it was absorbing enough to make him accept the sudden appearance of a head, coming out of the gloom, as part of his idle fantasy or as the beginning of another short dream, of another vagary of his overtired brain. A face with drooping eyelids, old, thin, and yellow, above the scattered white of a long beard that touched the earth. A head without a body, only a foot above the ground, turning slightly from side to side on the edge of the circle of light as if to catch the <b>radiating</b> <b>heat</b> of the fire on either cheek in succession. He watched it in passive amazement, growing distinct, as if coming nearer to him, and the confused outlines of a body crawling on all fours came out, creeping inch by inch towards the fire, with a silent and all but imperceptible movement. He was astounded at the appearance of that blind head dragging that crippled body behind, without a sound, without a change in the composure of the sightless face, which was plain one second, blurred the next in the play of the light that drew it to itself steadily.
