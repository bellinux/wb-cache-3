40|$|Axon {{regeneration}} {{failure in}} the adult mammalian CNS is attributed {{in part to the}} inhibitory nature of CNS myelin. Three myelin-associated, structurally distinct proteins, Nogo, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, have been implicated in this inhibition. Neuronal Nogo receptor (NgR) binds to each of the three inhibitors and has been proposed to mediate their inhibitory signals by complexing with a signal-transducing coreceptor, the neurotrophin receptor p 75 NTR. To assess the contribution of NgR to mediating myelin inhibitory signals and regeneration failure in vivo, we generated and characterized NgR-deficient mice. Nogo transcripts are up-regulated in NgR mutants, indicating that NgR regulates Nogo in vivo. However, neurite outgrowth from NgR-deficient postnatal dorsal root ganglion or cerebellar granule neurons is inhibited by myelin and by a Nogo- 66 substrate to the same extent as is from wild-type neurons, whereas p 75 NTR-deficient neurons are less inhibited. The NgR ligand-binding domain promotes neurite outgrowth on Nogo- 66, regardless of the genotype of the neurons, indicating that the NgR ligand-binding domain can act independent of NgR. Thus, NgR is not essential for mediating inhibitory signals from CNS myelin, at least in the neurons tested, whereas p 75 NTR plays a central role in this response. Neither NgR-nor p 75 NTR-deficient mice showed enhanced regeneration of corticospinal tract axons in comparison with wild-type controls after spinal dorsal hemisection. Our results thus fail to support a central role for NgR in axonal growth inhibition in vitro or in corticospinal tract <b>regeneration</b> <b>block</b> in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Cachexia, a {{debilitating}} muscle wasting syndrome, increases mortality and morbidity {{of a significant}} fraction of chronically hill as well as ICU patients. We use tumor (C 26) -bearing mice and TNF expressing mice as models of cachexia. In the presence of elevated levels of cytokines several populations of cells with myogenic potential are stable or increased in muscle, including satellite (Pax 7 -expressing) cells, hematopoietic stem (Sca 1 - CD 45 -expressing) cells and muscle interstitial stem (Sca 1 - CD 34 -expressing) cells also characterized by PW 1 expression. PW 1 is involved in myogenic cell differentiation, fiber size control and p 53 -mediated pathways. The increase in myogenic cells in cachectic muscle suggests an attempt to cope with wasting by activation of a myogenic response. Nonetheless, we observe that muscle regenerative capacity is reduced by cytokines. TNF negatively affects the onset of regenerating fibers, without exacerbating fiber death following focal injury. Several interstitial cells, expressing Sca 1, CD 34 and PW 1, show caspase activity during regeneration {{and the number of}} caspase activated cells is markedly increased by TNF, concomitant with an inhibition in <b>regeneration.</b> <b>Block</b> of caspase activity improves muscle regeneration either in the absence or presence of TNF. Muscle treatment with the myogenic factor vasopressin (AVP) counteracts TNF effects on regeneration. Regeneration extent affects muscle performance and AVP-mediated rescue of TNF effects results in functional recovery of the regenerated muscle similar to controls. Our data show that cytokine negative effects on muscle are counteracted by hormonal or pharmacological approaches.

40|$|Possible {{solutions}} to the restoration of overmature forest stands in the Lány game enclosure [...] {{this is a problem}} that generations of foresters in the Křivoklátsko region have been faced with. The restoration has often been postponed; as a result, there has been a remarkable {{increase in the number of}} such stands in the game enclosure. Currently, almost a third of the game enclosure is covered by stands, predominantly beech, older than 160 years, and the suggestions on how to restore these stands are by no means unified, not only within the framework of the relevant authorities, but also among the management of the Lány forestry administration. In the past, the disintegration of stands in the highest age class was dealt with by a massive planting of large-sized plants in the whole area of the game enclosure, which has brought and will continue to bring about a remarkable increase in the forest protection costs. The aim of this PhD thesis is to answer the questions concerning the restoration of the local beech stands and to propose a solution that would be efficient in the long term. The basic questions have been phrased as follows: In what condition are the extensive large-sized plant plantings? What is the number of overmature forest stands in the Lány game enclosure and what will their future development be? Are these stands still capable of producing a sufficient number of beech seeds to ensure successful natural regeneration? In what way should we restore these overmature forest stands? How should we protect them from the game damage? It was necessary to find some of the answers within the framework of intermediate scientific tasks; however, the finding of a conceptual solution to the restoration of the game enclosure remained the main goal of this work. To fulfil the goals of this thesis, it was necessary to perform the inventory of large-sized plant plots; it was found out that the total number of individuals planted in the Lány game enclosure until the end of 2011 was 28, 994 at 840 plots. The plantings established in 2011 were surveyed as to their vitality and height increment between the years 2011 and 2014. In 2015, a sample was selected on which the condition of the root system was analysed according to the type of a container used for the raising of large-sized plants. It is evident from the results that despite considerable investment in fencing, the large-sized plant plantings are very often damaged by game and have to be repeatedly reinforced. The root system analysis revealed that a significant number of individuals show serious root system deformations. Consequently, the optimization of large-sized plant planting was proposed. The condition of the beech stands at PRP was ascertained with the aid of the FieldMap technology; the stand development prediction was carried out by the growth simulator SIBYLA. The verification of the fertility of the overmature beech stands took place at smaller plots demarcated within PRP. The results show that the occurrence of game eliminates natural regeneration in these stands; thus, it is necessary to find a way which will not be only efficient, but also economical. The fertility verification proved that despite their advanced age, the beech stands preserve their ability to produce seed material, which could be used for regeneration under a shelterwood. Finally, a model <b>regeneration</b> <b>block</b> presenting two possible reproduction methods (with maximum utilization of natural regeneration and accelerated one) was designed on the basis of both the differentiation of the game enclosure and the localization of stands with the highest degree of regeneration urgency...|$|E

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Trophic gut hormones (CCK and bombesin) stimulate the growth of the normal rat pancreas. However, the influence of endogenous gut hormones on pancreatic regeneration is unclear. METHODS: Male Fisher rats (n = 6 to 8 per group) were fed a protein-free diet and given ethionine (700 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily) for 8 to 9 days to induce degeneration of the pancreas. Regeneration was stimulated by giving the rats a regular chow diet. The effects of bombesin (10 micrograms/kg three times a day for 7 days) or FOY- 305 (200 mg/kg daily for 8 days) on the process of regeneration were examined. RESULTS: At the end of the degeneration phase, there was near-total destruction of pancreatic acinar cells. Both bombesin and FOY- 305 stimulated pancreatic regeneration. Growth measurements (weight and total content of DNA and protein) were significantly increased (p < 0. 05) in the bombesin- and FOY- 305 -treated rats compared with controls. Histologic examination revealed widespread repopulation of the pancreas with acinar cells in the bombesin- and FOY- 305 -treated groups. The stimulating effects of both bombesin and FOY- 305 on pancreatic <b>regeneration</b> were <b>blocked</b> completely by the CCK-receptor antagonist L- 364, 718.

40|$|SummaryMany neurons {{have limited}} {{capacity}} to regenerate their axons after injury. Neurons in the mammalian {{central nervous system}} do not regenerate, and even neurons in the peripheral nervous system often fail to regenerate to their former targets. This failure is likely {{due in part to}} pathways that actively restrict regeneration; however, only a few factors that limit regeneration are known. Here, using single-neuron analysis of regeneration in vivo, we show that Notch/lin- 12 signaling inhibits the regeneration of mature C.  elegans neurons. Notch signaling suppresses regeneration by acting autonomously in the injured cell to prevent growth cone formation. The metalloprotease and gamma-secretase cleavage events that lead to Notch activation during development are also required for its activity in <b>regeneration.</b> Furthermore, <b>blocking</b> Notch activation immediately after injury improves regeneration.

40|$|Flagella can {{be removed}} from the biflagellate Chlamydomonas and the cells begin to {{regenerate}} flagella almost immediately by deceleratory kinetics. Under usual conditions of deflagellation, more than 98 % of all flagella are removed. Under less drastic conditions, cells can be selected in which one flagellum is removed and the other left intact. When only one of the two flagella is amputated, the intact flagellum shortens by linear kinetics while the amputated one regenerates. The two flagella attain an equal intermediate length and then approach their initial length at the same rate. A concentration of cycloheximide which inhibits protein synthesis permits less than one-third of each flagellum to form when both flagella are amputated. When only one is amputated in cycloheximide, shortening proceeds normally and the degree of elongation in the amputated flagellum is greater than if both were amputated in the presence of cycloheximide. The shortening process is therefore independent of protein synthesis, and the protein from the shortening flagellum probably enters the pool of precursors available for flagellar formation. Partial regeneration of flagella occurs in concentrations of cycloheximide inhibitory to protein synthesis suggesting that some flagellar precursors are present. Cycloheximide and flagellar pulse-labeling studies indicate that precursor is used during the first part of elongation, is resynthesized at mid-elongation, and approaches its original level as the flagella reach their initial length. Colchicine completely <b>blocks</b> <b>regeneration</b> without affecting protein synthesis, and extended exposure of deflagellated cells to colchicine increases the amount of flagellar growth upon transfer to cycloheximide. When colchicine is applied to cells with only one flagellum removed, shortening continues normally but <b>regeneration</b> is <b>blocked.</b> Therefore, colchicine can be used to separate the processes of shortening and elongation.

Similarly, expansion of RFs was inhibited when muscle <b>regeneration</b> was <b>blocked</b> by irradiation.

Planarians {{are capable of}} whole-body regeneration and mount distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence {{and those that do}} not. A major question is how these distinct responses are activated. We describe a follistatin homolog (Smed-follistatin) required for planarian <b>regeneration.</b> Smed-follistatin inhibition <b>blocks</b> responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs (Smed-activin- 1 and Smed-activin- 2) are required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. Finally, Smed-follistatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. These data suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-Activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence and identify a mechanism critical for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was designed to}} determine the change in cell numbers in the trigeminal ganglia following unilateral section {{of one of its}} peripheral branches. In 9 young adult cats, under general anesthesia, the inferior alveolar nerve was transected. In 3 of the animals the cut ends were reapposed and in the other 6 <b>regeneration</b> was <b>blocked.</b> After 15 weeks the trigeminal ganglia were removed, and the number of neurons present estimated by counting nucleoli in every third section. The counts were compared with those obtained from 3 unoperated control animals. The mean number of cells in the ganglia of control animals was 14, 324 with no statistically significant difference between sides. There {{was no significant difference between}} counts from opposite sides of cats whose nerves were allowed to regenerate. In the animals in which regeneration was prevented the mean count on the operated side was 13, 874 and on the unoperated 18, 374. These differences were statistically significant and appeared to result from an increase in cell counts on the unoperated side rather than a reduction in the counts on the operated side. This may be explained by the presence of neurons with inconspicuous nucleoli in normal ganglia, which are stimulated to enlarge and become more prominent following peripheral nerve injury. This change could occur on both sides and would mask cell loss on the operated side and produce an apparent increase in the count on the unoperated side...|$|R
40|$|Rapamycin is an {{antibiotic}} inhibiting eukaryotic cell growth and proliferation by acting on target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase. Mammalian TOR (mTOR) {{is thought to}} work through 2 independent complexes to regulate cell size and cell replication, and these 2 complexes show differential sensitivity to rapamycin. Here we combine functional genetics and pharmacological treatments to analyze rapamycin-sensitive mTOR substrates {{that are involved in}} cell proliferation and tissue regeneration after partial hepatectomy in mice. After hepatectomy, hepatocytes proliferated rapidly, correlating with increased S 6 kinase phosphorylation, while treatment with rapamycin derivatives impaired <b>regeneration</b> and <b>blocked</b> S 6 kinase activation. In addition, genetic deletion of S 6 kinase 1 (S 6 K 1) caused a delay in S phase entry in hepatocytes after hepatectomy. The proliferative defect of S 6 K 1 -deficient hepatocytes was cell autonomous, as it was also observed in primary cultures and hepatic overexpression of S 6 K 1 -rescued proliferation. We found that S 6 K 1 controlled steady-state levels of cyclin D 1 (Ccnd 1) mRNA in liver, and cyclin D 1 expression was required to promote hepatocyte cell cycle. Notably, in vivo overexpression of cyclin D 1 was sufficient to restore the proliferative capacity of S 6 K-null livers. The identification of an S 6 K 1 -dependent mechanism participating in cell proliferation in vivo may be relevant for cancer cells displaying high mTOR complex 1 activity and cyclin D 1 accumulation...|$|R
