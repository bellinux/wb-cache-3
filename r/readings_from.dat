5|$|Banagher has a {{thriving}} poetry scene {{and an annual}} poetry festival called <b>Readings</b> <b>from</b> the Pallet takes place in local bars. The town {{was one of the}} settings for the series Pure Mule, as featured on RTÉ television. The mini-series was an RTÉ production and shot in 2005 in Banagher, Birr and Tullamore. The series was favourably received by the critics, although some locals maintain that it portrays Midlanders in a bad light. The series won four IFTA awards in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> a large number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E

5|$|However, known {{cases of}} the {{diffusion}} of writing, such as Sequoyah's invention of the Cherokee syllabary after seeing the power of English-language newspapers, or Uyaquk's invention of the Yugtun script inspired by <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> Christian scripture, involved greater contact than the signing of a single treaty. The glyphs could be crudely written rongorongo, {{as might be expected}} for Rapa Nui representatives writing with the novel instrument of pen on paper. The fact that the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was taboo; such taboos may have lost power along with the tangata rongorongo (scribes) by the time Rapanui society collapsed following European slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud's day. Orliac points out that Tablet C would appear to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.|$|E
5|$|Late on November8, Ida {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity with winds of 105mph (165km/h) and a barometric pressure of 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear and forward speed caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm. Only {{a small area}} of convection remained near the center by the morning of November9. Despite the strong shear, the storm quickly re-organized, attaining hurricane status {{for a third time}} during the afternoon. Based on <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> a nearby oil platform and reconnaissance data, it was determined that Ida attained its secondary peak intensity near the southeast coast of Louisiana with winds of 85mph (140km/h). However, this intensification was short-lived as a combination of increasing wind shear and decreasing sea-surface temperatures induced weakening to a tropical storm within three hours.|$|E

5|$|Mühe {{played a}} leading role in {{organizing}} the demonstrations that took place prior to the reunification of Germany. He often gave public <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> Walter Jenka's essay Schwierigkeiten mit der Wahrheit (Difficulties with the Truth, 1989) at the Deutsches Theater, before the book was permitted to be published in East Germany. On 4 November 1989 shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, in front of half a million people during the Alexanderplatz demonstration, he declared the Communists' monopoly on power to be invalid. In the same year he became internationally known after playing, next to Armin Mueller-Stahl and Klaus Maria Brandauer, the leading role in Bernhard Wicki's Das Spinnennetz (The Spider's Web, based on the expressionist, fragmentary novel of the same name by Austrian writer Joseph Roth) right-wing lieutenant Lohse who sleeps and murders his way to professional success in the early Weimar Republic following a near fatal injury during the Wilhelmshaven mutiny of 29 October 1918.|$|E
5|$|On September19 and 20, Georges {{underwent}} {{a period of}} rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45mph (85km/h) in a 24-hour span. At {{the end of this}} phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155mph (250km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937mbar (hPa; 27.68inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time of peak intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight-level winds up to 168mph (270km/h) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175mph (280km/h). One of the <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191mph (307km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm-force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time of peak intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35mi (55km) in diameter.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, he was completely unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually consigned to the background of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship and Constant, who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, and Constant began to believe that there was no remaining alternative to a coup d'état.|$|E

5|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was presented}} to the monastery of the Preaching Friars by Cardinal Ragusio (1380–1443), general of the Dominicans. It was used by Desiderius Erasmus in the first edition of his Novum Testamentum (1516); as a result, some of its readings are found in the Textus Receptus. Erasmus used this codex very little, because its text was different from other manuscripts with which he was acquainted. Oecolampadius and Gerbelius (Erasmus's sub-editors) insisted that he use more <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> this codex in his third edition; however, according to Erasmus the text of this codex was altered from the Latin manuscripts and had secondary value. Since 1559, it has been kept at the University of Basel, along with Codex Basilensis and minuscule 2 (GA).|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Jose {{was first}} {{identified}} as a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August8, 2005. On August13, the system spawned Tropical Depression Ten over the central Atlantic; the wave itself continued westward, entering the Caribbean on August17. Slight development took place as the system moved over the Yucatán Peninsula; however, {{by the time it}} entered the Bay of Campeche on August21, little convection was associated with the system. The following morning, convection exploded under highly favorable divergence from an upper-level anticyclonic flow. According to <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> the QuikSCAT satellite, a well-defined low pressure center developed by 1200UTC, prompting the National Hurricane Center to classify the system as Tropical Depression Eleven. At this time, the depression was situated roughly 110mi (175km) east of Veracruz, Mexico.|$|E
5|$|On September1, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{into the}} low found a closed circulation center and tropical storm-force winds. Upon finding the low-level circulation center, the NHC began monitoring {{the system as}} Tropical Storm Erika, the fifth named storm of the 2009 season. Erika was slightly disorganized due to moderate wind shear, with the center partially devoid of convection. However, with warm sea surface temperatures, the storm was forecast to intensify to a strong tropical storm within a few days. A mid-level ridge to the north led to Erika maintaining a general westward track {{for most of its}} existence. Several hours after being classified, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg). However, the peak intensity was operationally placed at 60mph (95km/h) based on <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> reconnaissance missions. In post-storm analysis of these readings, it was determined that the NHC had overestimated the wind speeds in an area of unusually heavy rains. By the morning of September2, Erika became significantly disorganized, and Hurricane Hunters reported the possibility that multiple circulation centers existed within the broader storm system.|$|E

5|$|Pressure <b>readings</b> <b>from</b> John's peak are not {{consistently}} available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity is measured by minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Following Voyager's {{encounters}} with Enceladus {{in the early}} 1980s, scientists postulated {{that it may be}} geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the Ering. Based on the connection between Enceladus and the Ering, scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the Ering, perhaps through venting of water vapor. <b>Readings</b> <b>from</b> Cassini's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism, where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, had been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005, though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement. Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17, 2005, encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the waves' frequency can be used to identify their composition, in this case ionized water vapor. During the two following encounters, the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower. The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.|$|E
