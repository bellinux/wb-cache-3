40|$|The {{materials}} in plastic protective gloves {{are thought to}} cause less contact allergy than rubber gloves. Our aim was to estimate the frequency of delayed <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> different types of reusable protective gloves among dermatitis patients. 2 x 2 cm pieces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves, nitrile gloves, and natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves were tested as is in consecutive dermatitis patients tested with the baseline series. Among 658 patients, 6 patients reacted to PVC gloves and 6 patients to the NRL gloves. None reacted to both these types of gloves. Five of six patients with <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> rubber gloves reacted to thiuram mix in the baseline series. Delayed <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> reusable PVC gloves may be as common as to reusable NRL gloves. In contrast <b>to</b> most <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the NRL glove, the <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> the PVC glove had no obvious association with <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> any allergen(s) in the baseline series...|$|R

40|$|Motivational priming theory (MPT) and {{preparedness}} theory generate competing {{hypotheses about}} the impact of an aversive US on responses to an affective foreground. MPT predicts the aversive US will fa-cilitate negative emotional <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> unpleasant pictures and inhibit positive emotional <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> pleasant pictures. Preparedness theory predicts an aversive US will increase negative emotional <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> unpleasant pictures, but will not impact responses to pleasant pictures. The present study (N = 125) compared these competing hypotheses by assessing how noxious shocks and non-noxious noises influ-ence responses to emotional pictures. Following each picture, participants rated how the picture made them feel using the Self Assessment Manikin. Results supported MPT—noxious USs, but not non-nox-ious USs, facilitated negative emotional <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> unpleasant pictures and inhibited positive emotional <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> pleasant pictures...|$|R
40|$|Data {{from two}} studies {{were used to}} {{estimate}} the reliability of facial EMG when used to index facial mimicry (Study 1) or affective <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> pictorial stimuli (Study 2). Results for individual muscle sites varied between muscles and depending on data treatment. For difference scores, acceptable internal consistencies were found only for corrugator supercilii, and test-retest reliabilities were low. For contrast measures describing patterns of <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> stimuli, such as high zygomaticus major combined with low corrugator supercilii, acceptable internal consistencies were found for facial <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> smiling faces and positive affective <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> affiliative images (Study 2). Facial <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> negative emotions (Study 1) and facial <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> power and somewhat less to achievement imagery (Study 2) showed unsatisfactory internal consistencies. For contrast measures, good temporal stability over 24 months (Study 1) and 15 months (Study 2), respectively, was obtained. In Study 1, the effect of method factors such as mode of presentation was more reliable than the emotion effect. Overall, people's facial <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> affective stimuli seem {{to be influenced by}} a variety of factors other than the emotion-eliciting element per se, which resulted in biased internal consistency estimates.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{relation}} between the occurrence of adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) prophylaxis and the subsequent course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a cohort of homosexual men. Adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMZ were associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS (P <. 001) and death (P <. 001) and with a more rapid decline in CD 4 + cell counts (P =. 001). The median time to progression to AIDS was 14. 9 months in subjects with adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMZ and 32. 5 months in those without adverse reactions. After exclusion of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis from the case definition of AIDS, the differences in the rate of progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMZ were still highly significant (P =. 004). A low CD 4 + cell count at baseline and the use of antiretroviral agents before the start of prophylaxis were predictors of adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMZ but did not account for the difference in progression to AIDS between subjects with and without adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMZ. In a univariate analysis, the relative hazard of adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS was 2. 54 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 50 - 4. 28); in a multivariate analysis, it was 2. 21 (95 % CI, 1. 29 - 3. 81). The relative hazards of adverse <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> TMP-SMZ for progression to AIDS with the exclusion of PCP and toxoplasmosis, CD 4 + cell counts of < 50 /mm 3, and death were 2. 16 (95 % CI, 1. 25 - 3. 72), 2. 37 (95 % CI, 1. 36 - 4. 12), and 3. 21 (95 % CI, 1. 80 - 5. 72), respectively.
