25|$|After this {{rigorous}} recruit training, {{these new}} Marines will receive ten days of leave and possibly more {{if they are}} assisting their local Marine recruiter with recruiting. The leave {{is a time to}} rest up and <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they have accomplished, as well as incorporate their newly found discipline into their civilian life. They are expected to conduct themselves during leave as a disciplined Marine would and maintain their physical and mental fitness. After the leave has expired, Marines will attend the School of Infantry (SOI); east coast graduates will attend SOI East at Camp Geiger; while west coast graduates will return to Camp Pendleton for SOI West. Non-infantry Marines will attend a course called Marine Combat Training for 29 days, then proceed to the appropriate school for their Military Occupational Specialty (which vary in length). Infantry Marines attend the Infantry Training Battalion for 59 days. Then these newly trained Marines are assigned to their first unit in the operating forces.|$|E

The riotous army figures into the unpredictable wrath of the Roman people giving Tiberius the chance to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> it means to lead. It serves to contrast the [...] "old-fashioned" [...] Republican values assigned to Germanicus, and the imperial values possessed by Tiberius. The mood of the masses is a recurring theme, with their reactions to the fortunes of Germanicus being a prominent feature {{of the relationship between}} him and Tiberius well into the Annals (as far as Annals 3.19).|$|E

500|$|The exact {{curriculum}} {{varies from}} country to country, but the training generally includes both theoretical and experiential learning. All course participants are introduced to the 1st Gilwell Scout group or Gilwell Scout Troop 1 (the latter name {{is used in the}} Boy Scouts of America and some other countries). In the Boy Scouts of America, they are also assigned to one of the traditional Wood Badge [...] "critter" [...] patrols. Instructors deliver training designed to strengthen the patrols. One-on-one work with an assigned troop guide helps each participant to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> he has learned, so that he can better prepare an individualized [...] "ticket". This part of the training program gives the adult Scouter the opportunity to assume the role of a Scout joining the original [...] "model" [...] troop, to learn firsthand how a troop ideally operates.

500|$|As {{his team}} was on its winter break, Müller was left to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> he {{described}} as [...] "an almost unbelievable first year as a pro". Müller began {{the second half of}} the season in good form, but was involved in an altercation with teammate Arjen Robben, who was angered when Müller showed his displeasure at a poor free-kick Robben took during a 3–1 win at Werder Bremen. Müller again played in every game of the season and scored 19 goals (12 in the league), but the season was less successful for Bayern, as they finished third in the league, and were knocked out of the DFB-Pokal in the semi-finals by Schalke 04 and in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League by Inter Milan; Bayern had won 1–0 at the San Siro, and Müller scored 31 minutes into the second leg to make it 3–1 on aggregate, but Inter levelled the score at 3–3 in the 88th minute to go through on the away goals rule. Müller's mentor Van Gaal was increasingly criticised for inflexibility in tactical, transfer and selection policy, and ultimately lost his job, being replaced with Jupp Heynckes.|$|E

There's a little bit of all of that in the album. I really appreciate what music was back then {{as well as in the}} early '90s when you had artists like Troop and Jodeci, and Michael Jackson was in his prime." [...] Usher explained that the album's lyrics also <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> has been going on with his relationship; 8701 is predominantly an R album. [...] "Can U Help Me", is about a deep relationship to which Usher experienced. [...] "U Don't Have to Call" [...] is a hip-hop song inspired by Jackson, while [...] "U Got It Bad" [...] is an R slow-jam. About [...] "U Got It Bad", Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that it makes use of the acoustic guitar and a [...] "slow-burning bassline" [...] throughout. The album's lead single [...] "U Remind Me" [...] is also an R track, and its lyrics is based on meeting a woman who reminds Usher of an ex-girlfriend, and therefore cannot date her.|$|E

500|$|Director Sakaguchi {{named the}} main {{character}} after his mother, Aki, who died in an accident several {{years prior to the}} production of the film. Her death led Sakaguchi to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> happened to the spirit after death, and these thoughts resurfaced while he was planning the film, eventually taking the form of the Gaia hypothesis. He later explained that the theme he wanted to convey was [...] "more of a complex idea of life and death and spirit", believing {{that the best way to}} portray this would be to set the film on Earth. By comparison, Final Fantasy video games are set in fictional worlds. Dan Mayers from Sight & Sound stated the film followed the same theme typically found in Final Fantasy video games: [...] "A party of heroes averts impending global holocaust by drawing on their individual skills, gaining knowledge through challenges and emerging victorious with new-found love and respect for themselves and their companions." [...] Writing in the book Robot Ghosts and Wired Dreams, Livia Monnet stated the film remediated [...] "the notion of life in the neovitalistic, evolutionary biology of Lynn Margulis and in contemporary theories on artificial life", going on to state that the film's exploration of the Gaia hypothesis raised interesting questions regarding the life and death process of both cinema and digital media, as well as contemporary life sciences, cybernetics, philosophy and science fiction. The concept of artificial life and resurrection was also discussed, and compared to similar themes in the 1914 book Locus Solus; the Phantoms in The Spirits Within were considered to be brought to life by various forces: by the alien planet's red Gaia and then by human spiritual energy.|$|E

2500|$|The modern reader may read sonnet 20 and {{question}} {{whether or not}} Shakespeare's sexuality is reflected in this sonnet. When looking at the sexual connotations in this sonnet {{it is important to}} <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> homoerotism meant during the time that Shakespeare was writing. [...] Casey Charles discusses the idea that there was no official identity for a gay person at this time. [...] There were words that identified what we would consider to be homosexual behaviour, but the idea of a [...] "gay culture" [...] or [...] "gay identity" [...] did not exist. [...] Charles {{goes on to say that}} early modern laws against sodomy had very few transgressors, which means that either people did not engage in homosexual behavior or these acts were more socially acceptable than the modern reader would think. Shakespeare's awareness of the possible homoeroticism in Sonnet 20 does not necessarily illuminate whether or not he himself was actually practicing homosexual behavior.|$|E
2500|$|One {{week after}} {{shooting}} began, the film's production company went bankrupt, leaving the production in short supplies {{of food and}} water. Antonioni still had a large supply of film stock and {{managed to get the}} cast and crew to work for free until funding for the film was found. At one point, ships stopped making trips to Lisca Bianca and the cast and crew were stranded for three days without food or blankets. Eventually the crew went on strike and Antonioni and his Assistant Director shot the film themselves. Due to the rough condition of the sea and the difficulty in landing a ship on the rough rocks of Lisca Bianca, the cast and crew were often forced to sleep on the island. Antonioni has stated that he [...] "woke up every morning at 3 o'clock in order to be alone and <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> I was doing in order to re-load myself against fatigue and a strange form of apathy or absence of will, which often took hold of us all." [...] After several weeks of Antonioni and the crew working without a budget, the production company Cino del Duca agreed to finance the film and sent money to him.|$|E
2500|$|Only in {{the last}} decades of the 20th century The Tenant started to get {{critical}} acclaim. Elizabeth Langland in her 1989 monograph Anne Brontë: The Other One said: [...] "It is worth pausing briefly to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> might have been Anne’s fate had The Tenant of Wildfell Hall been re-published with Agnes Grey so that critics could re-acquaint themselves with Anne’s greater novel and so that critics could take that opportunity to measure the substantial artistic growth between the two novels". Langland argued that the heroines in Anne's novels influenced those of Charlotte, and named Anne among the first women writers to adopt a woman as narrator. Langland concluded that [...] "if Charlotte Brontë was radical in claiming sexual identity for women, then Anne Brontë was radical in claiming professional identity for women". Robert Liddell, noting Anne's apparent distaste for Romantic tradition, claimed that The Tenant criticized both Branwell's life and Wuthering Heights. Edward Chitham in A Life of Anne Brontë (1991) also juxtaposed the novels of Anne and her sisters'. He stated that in Anne's view Wuthering Heights exhibited elements which she called {{in the preface to}} the second edition of The Tenant a [...] "soft nonsense", thus making [...] "almost an accusation against Emily". Unlike Chitham and Liddell, Maria H. Frawley named the criticism of 19th century domestic ideology that encouraged women to [...] "construct themselves as ethereal angels of morality and virtue" [...] the central element in The Tenant. Betty Jay, analyzing Helen's marital experience, concluded that The Tenant [...] "not only demonstrates that the individual is subject to powerful ideological forces which delineate his or her place within culture and society, but that there are ways in which these forces can subverted and resisted by those who suffer as a result. In a narrative which dramatizes the complex interplay between subject and society by focusing on the marital experience of a woman, Bronte highlights {{the extent to which the}} internal and supposedly private realms of desire and domesticity are also intensely political." ...|$|E
