25|$|Flowers of Poaceae are {{characteristically}} {{arranged in}} spikelets, each having {{one or more}} florets. The spikelets are further grouped into panicles or spikes. The part of the spikelet that bears the florets is called the <b>rachilla.</b> A spikelet consists of two (or sometimes fewer) bracts at the base, called glumes, followed {{by one or more}} florets. A floret consists of the flower surrounded by two bracts, one external—the lemma—and one internal—the palea. The flowers are usually hermaphroditic—maize being an important exception—and anemophilous or wind-pollinated. The perianth is reduced to two scales, called lodicules, that expand and contract to spread the lemma and palea; these are generally interpreted to be modified sepals. This complex structure {{can be seen in the}} image on the right, portraying a wheat (Triticum aestivum) spikelet.|$|E

500|$|Aiphanes {{species are}} pleonanthic—they flower {{repeatedly}} {{over the course}} of their lifespan—and monoecious, meaning that there are separate male and female flowers, but individuals plants bear both types of flowers. In Aiphanes, male and female flowers are borne together on the same inflorescence. [...] Usually only a single inflorescence is borne at each node, although A.gelatinosa often bears then in groups of three at a single node. [...] The inflorescence usually consists of a main axis consisting of a peduncle and a rachis. [...] The rachis bears <b>rachillae,</b> which are smaller branches which themselves bear the flowers, while the peduncle is the main stalk connecting the rachis with the stem of the plant.

50|$|In botany {{such words}} largely refer to hooked {{bristles}} {{such as the}} hooks on the <b>rachilla</b> of Uncinia, which attach the fruit to passing animals, or the similarly functioning hooks on Burdocks, well known as the alleged inspiration for Velcro.|$|E

5000|$|On flowering, the {{inflorescence}} in male {{plants is}} branched to three orders, in females to one, rarely two. The prophyll is large, splitting and becoming tattered, and armed with pseudo-whorls of black spines. Peduncular bracts are {{not present in}} the genus, the first order branches bear distichous, unarmed tubular bracts with fibrous limbs which subtend or wholly enclose, in the staminate spike, the second order branch system. These are subtended by tubular, membranous bracts, the third order <b>rachillae</b> have similar bracts subtending solitary staminate flowers.|$|R
