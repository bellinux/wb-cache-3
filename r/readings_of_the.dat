5|$|The {{third and}} last {{corrector}} (C3) {{wrote in the}} 800's, possibly in Constantinople.

He also added liturgical directions in the margin, and worked extensively on the codex. The codex was recycled in the twelfth century.|$|E
5|$|Another {{attack was}} made in 1521 by Paulus Bombasius, the prefect of the Vatican Library, because in Greek text Erasmus {{departed}} from the common <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vulgate. He informed Erasmus that in the Vatican Library is held an extremely ancient copy of the Scriptures (i.e. Codex Vaticanus). He sent two extracts from this manuscript containing 1 John 4:1-3 and 1 John 5:7-11 (it did not include Comma).|$|E

His preferred method of staying updated on current international events was through weekly <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Economist.|$|E

5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor.

In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} defacing the vellum from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 58 {{percent of}} series viewers were male and 42 percent female, {{and the average}} male viewer was 41 years old.

Vulture.com cited Westeros.org and WinterIsComing.net (news and discussion forums), ToweroftheHand.com (which organizes communal <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> novels) and Podcastoficeandfire.com as fan sites dedicated to the TV and novel series; and podcasts cover Game of Thrones.|$|E

It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Published on 19 December, {{the first}} edition sold out by Christmas Eve; {{by the end of}} 1844 {{thirteen}} editions had been released. Most critics reviewed the novella positively. The story was illicitly copied in January 1844; Dickens took action against the publishers, who went bankrupt, reducing further Dickens's small profits from the publication. He went on to write four other Christmas stories in subsequent years. In 1849 he began public <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story which proved so successful he undertook 127 further performances until 1870, the year of his death. A Christmas Carol has never been out of print and has been translated into several languages; the story has been adapted many times for film, stage, opera and other media.|$|E
5|$|Together with Mount Adams, Mount Rainier, and Mount St. Helens, the Goat Rocks volcano {{is part of}} a {{triangle}} of volcanoes, an arrangement not found elsewhere in the Cascades. This may be related to a mid-crust zone with abnormally high electrical conductivity, the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC), which is not well understood by geologists. Scientists from the United States Geodynamics Committee hypothesized in 1994 that this anomaly is associated with the thrust of a large deposit of sedimentary rock against a continental margin. However, Hill et al. (2009) dismiss this view as it proves inconsistent with maps made from magnetotelluric <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area. Instead, they propose that the anomaly is linked to the region's volcanism, which has caused partial melting of the crust.|$|E
5|$|Darabont looked {{initially}} {{at some of}} {{his favorite}} actors like Gene Hackman and Robert Duvall {{for the role of}} Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; Clint Eastwood and Paul Newman were also considered. Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Kevin Costner were offered, and passed on the role —Hanks due to his starring role in Forrest Gump, and Costner because he had the lead in Waterworld. Johnny Depp, Nicolas Cage, and Charlie Sheen were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> script, but refused to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror Jacob's Ladder. When Robbins was cast he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer Roger Deakins, who had worked with him on The Hudsucker Proxy. To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.|$|E

5|$|From 1807 to 1809, Champollion {{studied in}} Paris, under Silvestre de Sacy, the first Frenchman {{to attempt to}} read the Rosetta stone, and with orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langlès, and with Raphaël de Monachis who was now in Paris. Here he perfected his Arabic and Persian, in {{addition}} to the languages that he had already acquired. He was so immersed in his studies that he took up the habit of dressing in Arab clothing and calling himself Al Seghir, the Arab translation of le jeune. He divided his time between the College of France, the Special School of Oriental Languages, the National Library where his brother was a librarian and the Commission of Egypt, the institution in charge of publishing the findings of the Egyptian expedition. In 1808, he first began studying the Rosetta stone, working from a copy made by the Abbé de Tersan. Working independently he was able to confirm some of the <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demotic previously made by Johan David Åkerblad in 1802, finally identifying the Coptic equivalents of fifteen demotic signs present on the Rosetta stone.|$|E
5|$|S. Paranavitana {{offered a}} novel surmise {{explaining}} {{the origins of}} the Ariyacakravarti. According to him the Aryacakravarti are descendants of Chandrabhanu a Malay chieftain, who invaded the island from Tambralinga in 1247. According to him refugees and immigrants from the Indian kingdom of Kalinga founded similarly named Kingdoms in South East Asia, and some of them came due to various reasons to north Sri Lanka and founded the Jaffna Kingdom. This view has been refuted by noted Indian historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastry as having no credible evidence, and other historians such as Louis Charles Damais (1911–66), an expert on Indonesian studies, Yutaka Iwamoto (1910–88), a Buddhist scholar, and S. Pathmanathan. They assert that there were no kingdoms in South East Asia called Kalinga and such assertions are based on erroneous <b>readings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chinese name for a locality called Ho-ling which actually stood for Walain not Kalinga. Further S. Pathmanathan asserts that Chandrabhanu had categorically claimed Padmavamsa lineage whereas S. Paranavitana had adduced a Gangavamsa lineage to the Aryacakravarti. Further he notes that the inscriptions that S. Paranavitana used to make his theory have not been deciphered by any other scholar to imply a Javaka connection to the Aryacakravartis.|$|E
