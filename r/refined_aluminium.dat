40|$|During direct-chill (DC) casting of {{aluminium}} alloys high temperature gradients are developed across the ingot such that stresses are generated. These stresses may induce cracks or even lead to ingot fracture. There {{are two types of}} cracks to consider: hot tears which are formed at temperatures above the solidus and cold cracks which appear at temperatures below the solidus and can damage the entire ingot. High-strength aluminium alloys are more vulnerable to cold cracking mainly because of the poor thermal and mechanical properties in the genuine as-cast condition. Low thermal conductivities and large solidification temperature range are the main thermal properties which make the alloy more prone to cracking. The temperature range between rigidity temperature, the temperature below which the material starts holding thermal strains, and non-equilibrium solidus determines the solidification contraction range, and is the crucial factor for hot cracking susceptibility. In this Master’s thesis this temperature was defined for a group of AA 7050 alloys with different chemical compositions and prepared under different casting process, to study the effect of grain refinement, impurities and cooling conditions. The temperatures when the tested alloys started to contract, Tth, were between 510 - 548 ºC. The solidification range over which the material changes from liquid state to the solid was in the range from 176 ºC to 161 ºC. Grain refinement decreased Tth and the solidification range. Numerical simulations have been run using the thermal properties of an AA 7050 grain <b>refined</b> <b>aluminium</b> alloy to determine the stress and strain state of a DC-cast billet. Simulation results showed that material is prone to yielding at temperatures ranging from 400 ºC to rigidity point (510 ºC) and hot cracks can probably form, especially in the centre of the billet, where the residual thermal stresses are all tensile. Rapid propagation and catastrophic failure may occur later, if the formed micro-cracks get the chance to propagate in the residual stress fields...|$|E

40|$|The {{aluminium}} alloys for electrical conductivity applications {{are generally not}} grain refinedsince the addition of grain refiners drops the electrical conductivity by introducing impuritiesinto the melt. Non-grain <b>refined</b> <b>aluminium</b> may lead to bar fracture and cracks during themetalworking process. The present study focuses to find an optimum balance between the grain refiner addition andthe electrical conductivity of commercial EC grade 1070 aluminium alloy for electricalapplication. In order to reach this goal, the electrical conductivity and the macrostructure ofcommercial EC grade 1070 aluminium (commercial pure aluminium) have been studiedunder a series of controlled lab scale trails. Specific addition levels of different grain refiners(TiBloy, Al- 5 Ti- 1 B, Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 C, and Al- 3 Ti- 1 B) {{were added to the}} metal melt and sampleswere taken at specific time intervals. The collected samples were sectioned, ground andmacro-etched. Thereafter, the macrostructure was analysed by the use of a digital camera andthe electrical conductivity was measured at temperature. The obtained result was expressed asa percentage of the International Annealed Copper Standard (IACS %). The macro-structuralanalysis showed that TiBloy, Al- 5 Ti- 1 B, and Al- 3 Ti- 1 B, with the maximum addition level of 0. 1 %, cannot grin refine commercial pure aluminium. However, at higher grain refiner levelsthe number of columnar grains increased and their size decreased. The Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 C master alloy, with the same addition level as the once chosen for the othergrain refiners (up to 0. 1 %), showed significantly better grain refining. By the addition of 0. 1 % of this grain refiner the macrostructure became very equiaxed already after 30 minutesof grain refiner addition. The fading of the Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 master alloy was, however, observedfor samples with a long holding time. Nevertheless, by maximum addition level (0. 1 %) and a 90 minutes holding time the macrostructure remained as equiaxed grains. The electrical conductivity results showed that none of the applied grain refiners (TiBloy, Al- 5 Ti- 1 B, Al- 3 Ti- 0. 15 C, and Al- 3 Ti- 1 B), with the maximum addition level of 0. 1 %, decreasedthe electrical conductivity of commercial pure aluminium...|$|E
40|$|Wires of Al-Si and Al-Mg-Si alloys {{that are}} {{quenched}} from the homogeneous alpha phase region and are aged at temperatures around 200 °C and above develop an internal friction peak at 220 - 230 °C for a frequency of vibration of 1 c/s. The {{height of the}} peak is very sensitive to composition, heat treatment and grain size. It is easy to obtain spurious results on the alloys containing magnesium due to rapid volatilisation of this element during solution treatment. It proved to be possible to prevent this magnesium loss completely by anodising the specimens and heat treating them {{in an atmosphere of}} CO 2. The relaxation strength decreases and the peak temperature falls from the binary Al-Si values as the Mg concentration is increased and the peak height becomes very small in the pseudo-binary Al-Mg 2 Si alloys. For any composition, the peak height varies during ageing at temperatures above 200 °C. For the Al-Si alloys the peak is highest in the alloy that has been quenched and immediately heated to 250 °C. When magnesium is added the peak is small under these conditions but develops as the ageing temperature is increased to around 300 °C. For a particular treatment the peak height also drops sharply as the grain size is increased. The activation energy which describes the variation of peak temperature with frequency lies between 1. 5 and 1. 6 eV and compares with that of 1. 3 eV for the grain boundary relaxation in zone <b>refined</b> <b>aluminium.</b> Our interpretation of the peak in the alloys {{is that it is a}} grain boundary relaxation influenced by the segregation of Si to the boundaries. The concentration of Si there will depend on the concentration of Si in the alpha phase and the relative binding of Si in the precipitates and the boundary. This will cause changes in the equilibrium distribution of Si as the temperature varies. We explain the low values of the peak in the pseudo-binary Al-Mg 2 Si alloy by the strong binding of Si in Mg 2 Si and we can correlate the variations of damping with composition and temperature in the other alloys by the lower binding of Si in Si precipitates and the variation of distribution of Si with temperature deduced from the ternary equilibrium diagram. This interpretation will be outlined in more detail when the paper is presented...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this life}} cycle {{assessment}} is to investigate refining methods which {{makes it possible to}} utilise post-consumer aluminium scrap in production of aluminium products that have strict requirements to chemical purity. A further goal is to establish whether applying these methods are environmentally preferable compared to using primary aluminium to produce the same products. The investigation is based on a given scrap composition and given purity limits that must be achieved for the <b>refined</b> <b>aluminium,</b> related to six alloying elements. Based on the given requirements, a selection of refining processes which are able to refine the given scrap to meet the given limits are identified. Table A below gives the scrap composition and the desired range of removal to fit seven different alloy requirements. The scrap composition is given in weight%. Table A: Scrap composition and desired level of removal. 	Si	Mg	Fe	Cu	Mn	ZnScrap composition	 6. 11 	 0. 53 	 0. 53 	 1. 66 	 0. 23 	 0. 86 Desired removal	 10 ? 83 %	-	 6 - 57 %	 45 - 100 %	-	 77 - 100 %Different types of electrolysis and fractional crystallisation are identified as possible refining processes. Electrolysis can in theory be used to eliminate any tramp element in the scrap, as it extracts the pure aluminium from the melt using an electric current. Unfortunately this is an expensive, energy consuming process which requires use of chemicals. Fractional crystallisation does not require any chemicals and generally has low energy use, but this is a slow method which currently is not continuous. The ability of fractional crystallisation to remove the various elements depends on their solubility in aluminium in solid and liquid state. Various studies show that this method is promising for removal of Si, Fe and Cu, mediocre for Mg and Zn and poor for Mn. Based on this, six different production scenarios for secondary scrap, to meet the set of alloy requirements, were developed. The life cycle impact assessment conducted for the different refining scenarios shows that energy use is very closely linked to the environmental burden associated with each of the production scenarios. From an environmental perspective low temperature, electrolysis and fractional crystallisation seem to be the best alternatives. Since the assessment is based on specific requirements set by the scrap composition and the given purity limits, an overall impression is that other possibilities to handle excess scrap should be investigated further. For example better sorting processes to separate tramp elements earlier in the production or development of alloys which are made with a motive for recycling. Such methods {{are likely to be more}} relevant when the use of aluminium has increased even further and more stable sources of scrap can be established. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{most popular}} method of <b>aluminium</b> <b>{{refining}}</b> is blowing of refining gas through the liquid metal. The way the refining gas is {{introduced to the}} liquid metal significantly influences the time and course of degassing process. Rotary impellers {{seem to be the}} best solution, especially taking into account reaching good level of gas dispersion in the liquid aluminium. However, the construction of impellers also influences the obtained gas dispersion in liquid metal, especially considering the processing parameters such as flow rate of refining gas and rotary impeller speed. Design/methodology/approach: To observe the phenomena occurring during the <b>aluminium</b> <b>refining</b> process physical modelling was applied. Test stand for such modelling was built at 1 : 1 scale with the transparent tank to observe the level of gas dispersion in the liquid. The built model has to fulfill the rules coming from the theory of similarity. Findings: The choice of optimal parameters is very important to the particular type of impeller. As a result of research the processing parameters were chosen to the appropriate type of gas dispersion. The most desirable type of dispersion is an uniform dispersion. According to the research the best impeller seems to be impeller No 1. Research limitations/implications: There are differences between results coming from modelling research and industrial test. So, the further research should be conducted with a chosen impeller in industrial conditions.
