40|$|Background: Growing pains are a {{frequent}} clinical presentation {{that continues to}} puzzle practitioners, with very little conclusive evidence in any medical field, including chiropractic. Objective: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether lumbosacral manipulations have an effect on growing pain symptoms. Methods: Thirty participants with growing pains between the ages of 4 and 12 years were recruited. The participants were placed into two groups of 15 participants each. Group 1 received lumbosacral manipulations to restricted joints as determined by motion palpation, while Group 2 never received any professional intervention. Often parent(s) /guardian(s) of children who suffer from growing pains will rub the child's legs and offer verbal reassurance in an attempt to console their children. Parent(s) /guardian(s) of both groups were encouraged to continue to do this throughout the duration of the trial. Instructions were given to the parents so that the same rubbing technique and <b>rubbing</b> <b>cream</b> (aqueous cream) were used. Subjective changes were tracked using a pain diary that the parent(s) /guardian(s) were asked to complete, a six-week post-study follow-up question regarding children's growing pains and the Oucher self-report pain scale. Objective measures consisted of pressure algometer readings of the tibialis anterior muscle belly. Results: The statistical data was analysed using the Friedman test, Mann–Whitney test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. The results demonstrated that both groups responded favourably to their specific treatment over time. However, the group that received lumbosacral manipulations proved to show a quicker response to treatment; and the post-study follow-up of this same group showed markedly more positive feedback than the group that did not receive the treatment. These results highlighted the positive effects of chiropractic manipulation on growing pain symptoms. Conclusion: The results from this study, specifically the feedback from parent(s) /guardians(s) and the pain diaries, indicated that spinal manipulation is beneficial in the treatment of growing pains. The results also showed that other methods of treating growing pains, such as simple leg rubs, may also bring relief...|$|E

50|$|He decides {{the only}} way to win her is to indeed capture the slippers, so he goes to Puzaty Patsyuk, a local Zaporozhian Cossack who is {{believed}} to be in league with the devil. Vakula asks him to tell him the way to find the devil while Patsyuk eats magical varenyky that fly down into a basin of cream and then into his mouth, Vakula brushes one aside as it <b>rubs</b> <b>cream</b> on his closed lips. After asking Patsyuk about the devil, he remarks that he cannot give directions to the blacksmith to what is already on his back. Vakula does not understand until he puts down the sacks and the devil hops onto his back. Vakula tricks the devil into thinking he will obey him, then grabs his tail and threatens to use {{the sign of the cross}} until he agrees to help.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, {{dangerous}} {{diving for}} seaweed and pearls {{is done by}} women while, in America, powerful women are seen at work — United States Treasurer Elizabeth Rudel Smith who inspects the Bureau of Engraving each day and a New York-based female bank president who chairs {{a meeting of the}} bank's directors. Back in Southeast Asia, the [...] "Sisterhood of the Night Butterflies" [...] in Singapore gives thanks for enjoying prosperity during the cycle of business activity, and prostitution in Hong Kong is combatted by female police officers. Faraway and exotic locations are visited as Masai tribe members are baptized by nuns working as missionaries in Kenya, a European fashion pageant appears baffling to native women, tattoos are imprinted upon women in the Borneo jungle, while plastic surgeons cut into the flesh of European women who aspire to improve their appearance. In the Arabian desert, women in Bedouin tribes hold similar hopes as they <b>rub</b> <b>creamed</b> camel effluvia into their facial skin. Childbirth ritual among New Zealand's Māori involves dangerous feats of daring which the men perform while the mothers of their children are giving birth. Remaining with the topic of birth, a clinic in Switzerland is shown giving instructions in painless labor. Women in an Arab conflict zone risk their lives by running into battlefields to collect shrapnel which they sell for scrap metal, collecting small amounts of money to feed their children. At the end, children deformed by the drug Thalidomide are shown with their suffering mothers, while other crestfallen mothers travel to Lourdes as pilgrims to beseech God for their children's cure.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 Max Brown was {{diagnosed}} with cancer that he had reportedly had for over 7 years (it was only found out when the tumor burst inside him resulting in emergency surgery). The cancer was believed to have been caused by a simple <b>rub</b> down <b>cream</b> he and other players had been using for years after training and games. Brown was forced to take over 6 months off from work while he was undergoing treatment, and it was during this time that he {{came up with the idea}} for the Men of League foundation to assist rugby league players, coaches, referees, officials and administrators - from all levels of the game - plus members of their families who have fallen on hard times ...|$|R
50|$|Afterwards, the {{federation}} centered mostly on Adams, who again ran his wrestling {{school and was}} working a feud with both Price and Iceman Parsons; as well as assist in booking various matches. During one 1993 match, Adams accidentally tore the hair weave off the hair of Price, resulting in stitches on his head. Chris' former second wife Toni Adams, whom he brought in to the storyline, was also involved, siding with Price and Parsons; and during one match, she attempted to <b>rub</b> Freebird Hair <b>Cream</b> into Chris' eyes. The former couple also was wrestling in Memphis' United States Wrestling Association promotion, where Toni was billed as Nanny Simpson. Chris and Toni's son Chris Jr., then about 5, also made a few appearances in the ring.|$|R
50|$|On Christmas {{night in}} 1985, Adams and Hernandez reunited to face The Cosmic Cowboys (actually Kevin and Kerry Von Erich). During the match, Hernandez, {{claiming}} a knee injury, {{refused to be}} tagged in by Adams, who took a brutal beating {{at the hands of}} the Von Erichs. Adams deliberately threw Kevin over the rope to end the match, then slapped Hernandez for not tagging him and left the ring. This led to a 27 January 1986 encounter at the Convention Center in Fort Worth, where Adams and Hernandez faced each other with the stipulation that the loser would lose his hair again, this time by having Freebird Hair <b>Cream</b> <b>rubbed</b> into the scalp. Adams twice refused to pin Hernandez, and while arguing with referee Rick Hazzard, Hernandez threw some of the hair cream (actually a dark liquid substance) into Adams' eyes, causing Adams to win by disqualification.|$|R
6000|$|The toilet of Amelius, {{simple as}} it was, had its mysteries for Rufus. He {{was at a loss}} among the perfumes. They were all {{contained}} in a modest little dressing case, without labels of any sort to describe the contents of the pots and bottles. He examined them one after another, and stopped at some recently invented French shaving-cream. [...] "It smells lovely," [...] he said, assuming it to be some rare pomatum. [...] "Just what I want, it seems, for my head." [...] He <b>rubbed</b> the shaving <b>cream</b> into his bristly iron-gray hair, until his arms ached. When he had next sprinkled his handkerchief and himself profusely, first with rose water, and then (to make quite sure) with eau-de-cologne used as a climax, he felt that he {{was in a position to}} appeal agreeably to the senses of the softer sex. In five minutes more, he was on his way to Mr. Farnaby's private residence.|$|R
