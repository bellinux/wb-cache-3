5|$|Installation 03, also {{referred}} to as Gamma Halo, appears in Halo 4. It is monitored by 049 Abject Testament and is located in the Khaphrae system, orbiting a damaged planet. Whilst no gameplay takes place on the installation, an extremely dense asteroid field surrounding the installation is the site of the UNSC scientific <b>research</b> <b>base</b> Ivanoff. It is here that UNSC scientists are conducting experiments on the Forerunner artifact called the Composer, which has the ability to convert biological forms, specifically humans, into AIs. After the game's antagonist, the Didact, activates the device, the UNSC base is left uninhabited. In Halo: Escalation, a series of comics which follows many events after Halo 4, establishes that 049 Abject Testament has long disappeared from the ring, leading a monitor to arrive at the Installation, just to be ambushed by a still living Didact, using the Installation to use the Composer.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{takes place}} during the events of Human Revolution: after staging an {{explosion}} in the docks of Hengsha, Adam Jensen smuggles himself on board a ship bound for a secret <b>research</b> <b>base</b> inside a cryosleep pod. Adam is discovered and captured aboard the ship. Two Belltower commanders, Pieter Burke and Netanya Keitner, torture him for information on his identity. After the EMP chair holding him captive mysteriously deactivates, Adam is able to retrieve his equipment {{with the help of an}} unknown hacker who contacts him via radio. The ship docks at Rifleman Bank Station, a seaborne regional Belltower supply hub. After escaping into the station, Adam discovers that it was Keitner who set him free. Disillusioned with the unethical nature of local Belltower operations, she wants Adam to find concrete proof of illegal research that she can use to deliver to Interpol. She also instructs Adam to obtain weaponry from Garvin Quinn, resident technician and black market weapons trader.|$|E

25|$|However, the mite-infested beetles {{were not}} {{destroyed}} and were instead used to breed new generations of beetles under sterile conditions. Dung beetle eggs were dipped in 3% formalin for 3 minutes to sterilise them, then packed into hand-rolled dung balls for incubation. These eggs successfully developed into adult beetles and {{were among those}} in the first batches released into the wild on 30 January 1968 in Lansdown, near Townsville, Queensland. This quarantine method was subsequently adopted at the CSIRO <b>research</b> <b>base</b> in Pretoria, South Africa, with the added step of the eggs being transported by air in sealed containers of sterilised peat moss.|$|E

It addresses the need to create local expertise not only in research methodology, but also in research support and fund raising areas.” Its main goals are to study Syrian smoking practices qualitatively and quantitatively, to develop culturally appropriate and cost effective intervention techniques, and to train Syrian tobacco researchers in order to monitor the efforts to curtail the epidemic properly. One of its main strategies is multidisciplinary research, involving the efforts of medical anthropologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, behavioral pharmacologists, and physicians.|$|E
25|$|The first beetles to be {{imported}} to Australia came from Hawaii. Here, dung beetles, particularly the species Onthophagus gazella, {{had already been}} successfully introduced from Africa {{in order to help}} biologically control the numbers of horn fly. It was thought that these beetles would be a safe source since the only parasite present in Hawaii that does not already exist in Australia is the giant liver fluke, Fasciola gigantean, the eggs of which do not survive ingestion by beetles. Samples of O. gazella were shipped to the CSIRO <b>research</b> <b>base</b> in Canberra, where they were kept under quarantine and observed before potential release. Unfortunately, direct importation from Hawaii was found to be unviable since it was discovered that the beetles were infested with potentially harmful pyemotid mites. For this reason, these particular beetles were never released onto Australian pastures.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} find a {{suitable}} minifauna of beetles for Australia, Bornemissza set up the Australian Dung Beetle Research Unit in Pretoria, South Africa to find species that would complement the work of O. gazella. South Africa was chosen as a location to study dung beetles for several reasons. Firstly, there are {{a large number of}} different species from which to choose from (some 800 species south of the Zambezi and Kunene rivers alone), and these species have co-evolved alongside large bovids (e.g. African buffalo) for many thousands of years. There are also homologies between the sub-tropical climates of areas of the two countries. The political climate in other parts of Africa and the more advanced nature of scientific research in South Africa also made it an ideal location. The Plant Protection Research Institute in South Africa funded much of the work at this <b>research</b> <b>base.</b> Further field stations were also maintained in Cape Town during 1978-1980 and in Hluhluwe Game Reserve during 1981-1986.|$|E
25|$|The Fairfield Osborn Preserve is a 460-acre (1.86km2) {{nature reserve}} {{situated}} on the northwest flank of Sonoma Mountain in Sonoma County, California. There are several plant communities within the property, oak woodland being the dominant type. Other habitats include chaparral, native clump grassland, marsh, coastal scrub and riparian zone. A diverse fauna inhabits this area including black-tailed deer, coyote, bobcat and mountain lion; moreover, there are abundant avifauna, amphibians, reptiles and insects. The flora is extremely diverse including many native trees, shrubs, grasses, lichens and mosses. Copeland Creek and its tributaries drain the preserve as they wend their way down steep ravines toward eventual discharge to the Laguna de Santa Rosa. The property was originally a Spanish Land Grant holding and is now owned and managed by Sonoma State University, who uses it as a <b>research</b> <b>base</b> and as an educational tool for the general public. An understated natural trail system weaves through the property {{to provide access to}} creek canyons, ridges and marshy areas. The preserve is situated at elevations 1,600 to 1,900 feet (488–579 m) above sea level and features a landscape riddled with basalt exposures that betray the volcanic prehistory of Sonoma Mountain.|$|E
