Firstly, diagnostic <b>rhyme</b> <b>tests</b> (DRT), phonemically balanced (PB) word lists and phonemically balanced sentence lists have been compared under four room acoustic conditions defined by their speech transmission index (STI = 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 0. 8). The results obtained indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the word intelligibility scores of languages under all room acoustic conditions, apart from the STI = 0. 8 condition.

40|$|Due to the {{stability}} against the external noise, bone-conducted (BC) speech seems {{better to be}} used instead of noisy air-conducted speech in an extremely noisy environment. However the quality of bone-conducted speech is very low and restoring bone-conducted speech is a challenged topic in speech signal processing field. As the main issue to improve the BC speech, many studies try to model and resolve the degradation when the signal is conducted through bone transduction. In previous study, we proposed a linear prediction (LP) based blind-restoration model. In this paper, we therefore completely evaluated the proposed model in comparison with other models {{to find out whether}} our proposed model could adequately improve voice quality and the intelligibility of BC speech, using objective measures (LSD, MCD, and LCD) and carrying out Japanese word-intelligibility tests (JWITs), Vietnamese word-intelligibility tests (VWITs) and Modified <b>Rhyme</b> <b>Tests</b> (MRTs) for English.

It is my intention to investigate whether native speaker intuitions of this sort can provide a coherent picture of the geographical distribution of phonological oppositions in the British Isles, and whether they can provide us with crucial data for understanding the progression and interaction of processes such as standardisation (Milroy 2001), dialect levelling (Kerswill 2003) and the spread of mergers at the expense of distinctions (Herzog‚Äôs Principle, Labov 1994). In this study, speakers from a range of locations in Britain and Ireland are asked to judge whether pairs of words rhyme (e. g. cut and foot) or are pronounced the same (e. g. cot and caught) in their speech, and are asked to indicate whether this is always/usually the case, sometimes the case, or never/rarely the case for them.

40|$|Classrooms {{acoustics}} {{can affect}} students¬¥ speech intelligibility and learning performance depending on its background noise level and/or reverberation. Speech intelligibility is usually assessed in real classrooms through a subjective approach, by performing speech intelligibility tests, or through an objective approach, by evaluating speech transmission index (STI) from impulse response, speech and noise level measurements. Acoustic simulation technique {{makes it possible}} to assess acoustical conditions for speech reception in virtual environments, thus allowing for predicting intelligibility before a classroom is built or renovated. However, in order to obtain reliable results, the simulation model needs to be calibrated and validated with in-situ measurements. The aim of this work is to compare tests performed in-situ on a group of people, with tests performed on the same people by reproducing the auralized test signal through headphones, in terms of intelligibility scores (IS), response times (RT), listening efficiency values (DE) and related STI values.

30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{objective}} methods like RMS distance between measured and predicted facial feature points or accumulated color differences of pixels {{can be applied to}} data-driven approaches, visual speech synthesis is meant to be perceived by humans. Therefore, subjective evaluation is crucial in order to assess the quality in a reasonable manner. All submissions to this special issue were required to include a subjective evaluation. In general, subjective evaluation comprises the selection of the task for the viewers, the material‚Äîthat is, the text corpus to be synthesized‚Äîand the presentation mode(s). Two tasks were included within the LIPS Challenge: one to measure intelligibility and one to assess the perceived quality of the lip synchronization. For the former task subjects were asked to transcribe an utterance, and for the latter task they were asked to rate the audiovisual coherence of audible speech articulation and visible speech movements on an MOS scale. The material to be synthesized consisted of 42 semantically unpredictable sentences (SUSs). Compared to single words used, for example, in <b>rhyme</b> <b>tests</b> or logatome tests, SUSs offer the advantage that they are well formed complete sentences constructed from real words. Furthermore, the effect of context is minimized as the keywords to be identified cannot be predicted from one another. As the evaluation should focus on articulatory movements, the subjects were presented with {{the lower half of the}} face only. This avoids distractions from mouth movements by, for example, staring or blinking eyes. All synthesized videos were to be synchronized to the given auditory speech as a prerequisite. In addition to the lip-synched audiovisual sequences, subjects were presented with the (degraded) audio alone to assess any gain in intelligibility provided by the systems. Likewise the natural video was included to access the expected upper-bound on performance. Video only was not included as SUSs are virtually impossible to lip-read. In total 30 SUSs were presented for intelligibility testing (degraded to 5 [*]dB SNR using babble noise), and 12 SUSs were presented without degradation for rating the audiovisual synchrony.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to combine two areas of research, each of which has produced significant results, in an effort to find better ways to prepare children for reading. First is the training of preschoolers in specific reading readiness skills. ^ In the early grades, phoneme segmentation skills and reading skills are highly correlated. There is evidence of a causal relationship and further evidence that phoneme segmentation skills can be taught, resulting in enhanced reading acquisition (Bradley 2 ÃÜ 6 Bryant, 1985). ^ Recent research has found a correlation between an early metalinguistic skill, rhyming, and reading acquisition (Bradley 2 ÃÜ 6 Bryant, 1985). Since the metalinguistic skills of rhyming, syllable segmentation and phoneme segmentation develop sequentially (Liberman, et al., 1980), it seems likely that they build one upon the other. This study focuses on developing rhyming skills of preschool children. ^ The second area of research is the training of parents in techniques which will enhance their children 2 ÃÜ 7 s development. This approach has been effective in language, cognitive and social development. ^ This study involves working with mothers of Head Start children. Mothers of one experimental group were to read to their children from selected books which emphasize rhyme and were taught a strategy for enhancing rhyming skills.

Intelligibility was measured in a control condition, i. e. without vocoding, with each type alone and with two vocoders in tandem. AMBE and CVSD performed similarly, 92. 6 and 90. 4 %, respectively. CVSD-to-AMBE {{had little effect on}} intelligibility, measured at 89. 2 %. However, AMBEto-CVSD had a large degrading effect on intelligibility. The AMBE-to-CVSD direction scored about 81. 7 % intelligibility with clear, unaltered speech signals. The asymmetry between waveform-to-parametric and parametric-to-waveform encoders underscores the non-linear nature of tandem vocoders on intelligibility. When vocoders of the same type were in tandem, there was no additional effect on intelligibility. The double CVSD condition yielded 92. 2 % intelligibility and the double AMBE condition yielded 91 %. The deleterious effects of speech clipping were measured in a second experiment, as these are ubiquitous in military radio transmission systems. The AMBE parametric vocoder performed at the 88 % level in isolation and at 84 % when tandemed with the CVSD waveform vocoder. Alternative methods of encoding speech signals are being explored to improve speech intelligibility performance in military communication systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{recruitment}} phenomenon, that is, {{the reduced}} dynamic range between threshold and uncomfortable level, {{is attributed to}} the loss of instantaneous dynamic compression on the basilar membrane. Despite this, hearing aids commonly use slow-acting dynamic compression for its compensation, because this was found to be the most successful strategy in terms of speech quality and intelligibility rehabilitation. Former attempts to use fast-acting compression gave ambiguous results, raising the question as to whether auditory-based recruitment compensation by instantaneous compression is in principle applicable in hearing aids. This study thus investigates instantaneous multiband dynamic compression based on an auditory filterbank. Instantaneous envelope compression is performed in each frequency band of a gammatone filterbank, which provides a combination of time and frequency resolution comparable to the normal healthy cochlea. The gain characteristics used for dynamic compression are deduced from categorical loudness scaling. In speech intelligibility tests, the instantaneous dynamic compression scheme was compared against a linear amplification scheme, which used the same filterbank for frequency analysis, but employed constant gain factors that restored the sound level for medium perceived loudness in each frequency band. In subjective comparisons, five of nine subjects preferred the linear amplification scheme and would not accept the instantaneous dynamic compression in hearing aids. Four of nine subjects did not perceive any quality differences. A sentence intelligibility test in noise (Oldenburg sentence test) showed little to no negative effects of the instantaneous dynamic compression, compared to linear amplification. A word intelligibility test in quiet (one-syllable <b>rhyme</b> <b>test)</b> showed that the subjects benefit from the larger amplification at low levels provided b...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} current discussions has led to the hypothesis that domain-specific training programs alone are not enough to improve reading achievement or working memory abilities. Incremental or Entity personal conceptions of intelligence may be assumed to be an important prognostic factor to overcome domain-specific deficits. Specifically, incremental students tend to be more oriented toward change and autonomy and are able to adopt more efficacious strategies. This study aims at examining the effect of personal conceptions of intelligence to strengthen the efficacy of a multidimensional intervention progrm in order to improve decoding abilities and working memory. Participants included two children (M age= 10 years) with developmental dyslexia and different conceptions of intelligence. The children were tested on a whole battery of reading and spelling tests commonly used in the assessment of reading disabilities in Italy. Afterwards, they were given a multimedia test to measure motivational factors such as conceptions of intelligence and achievement goals. The children took part in the T. I. R. D. Multimedia Training for the Rehabilitation of Dyslexia (Rappo and Pepi, 2010) reinforced by specific units to improve verbal working memory for 3 months. This training consisted of specific tasks to rehabilitate both visual and phonological strategies (sound blending, word segmentation, alliteration <b>test</b> and <b>rhyme</b> <b>test,</b> letterr ecognition, digraph recognition,trigraph recognition, and word recognition as samples of visual tasks) and verbal working memory (rapid words and non- words recognition). Posttest evaluations showed that the child holding the incremental theory of intelligence improved more than the child holding a static representaton. On the whole this study highlights the importance of treatment programs in which both specificity of deficits and motivational factors are both taken into account. There is a need to plan multifaceted intervention programs based on a transverse approach, considering both cognitive and motivational factors...|$|R
