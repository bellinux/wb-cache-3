50|$|Juaymah Maureen Transport {{has brought}} up a bad image to many commuters, {{especially}} students. One such issue is the illegal increase of the fare upon orders of the bus company management. Based on the blog made by a nursing student, JMT {{was not included in}} the present fare hike, thereby charging a higher fare than that of a <b>required</b> <b>fare</b> approved by the LTFRB. It was surprising that the fare matrix the conductor had shown to him was actually a fake one. Until now, most of the conductors are still following rules from the management, though they were actually prohibited by the LTFRB and the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to charge illegal fares and to ply on designated routes.|$|E
50|$|The city lies {{in between}} the main Delhi - Mumbai line. More than 1000 {{travelers}} commute daily from Lakheri to Kota, Jaipur and many other large cities by local train like Dehradun express, Avadh express, Firozpur janta express train. But the city is ignored by Indian Railway which does not provide any super fast train to halt at the station in past but now gradually the superfast trains start stopping here like Kota Shriganganagar SF, Jodhpur Indore SF. In the same way, previously bus service in the city is also in poor condition as Rajasthan Roadways {{has no interest in}} the city and has no routine bus service and no express, silver line or blue line buses. Because of this the private buses charge more than the <b>required</b> <b>fare</b> and also take more time to reach the destination.|$|E

50|$|This machine's target {{audience}} is regular travellers who already know <b>required</b> <b>fares.</b> Passenger experiences for first-time customers can be confusing, but once customers learn this TVM, unreserved day ticket transactions are processed {{much faster than}} on typical full-feature machines. Machines need only electricity (not network connections) and staff to replace ticket stock, remove coins, and clear jams.Like soda machines, they are robust, self-contained, and have been deployed to remote locations.|$|R

50|$|Rapid {{transit systems}} have high fixed costs. Most systems are {{publicly}} owned, by either local governments, transit authorities or national governments. Capital investments are often partially or completely financed by taxation, {{rather than by}} passenger fares, but must often compete with funding for roads. The transit systems may be operated by the owner or by a private company through a public service obligation. The owners of the systems often also own the connecting bus or rail systems, or {{are members of the}} local transport association, allowing for free transfers between modes. Almost all transit systems operate at a deficit, <b>requiring</b> <b>fare</b> revenue, advertising and subsidies to cover costs.|$|R

2500|$|Select Bus Service or SBS, {{the brand}} name for MTA bus rapid transit service, is a variant of Limited-Stop bus service that <b>requires</b> <b>fare</b> payment to be made before {{boarding}} the bus, at fare payment machines in shelters at designated [...] "stations" [...] (such a shelter is shown to the right). Receipts given for payment of fare are [...] "proof-of-payment" [...] that must be shown to the MTA's fare inspectors upon request.
