5|$|Onions {{suffer from}} a number of plant disorders. The most serious for the home {{gardener}} are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white <b>rot,</b> and neck <b>rot.</b> Diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white <b>rot,</b> and neck <b>rot.</b> Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|E

5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{are white}} <b>rot</b> pathogens. They {{disintegrate}} the lignin {{of the host}} wood, whereby the infested wood parts become less stable and take a fibrous structure. The wood bleaches as fungal enzymes break down and remove the brown-pigmented lignin. The distribution in wood takes place mainly along the transport channels in the xylem. If the wood is crosscut, the red <b>rot</b> is vertically positioned, on which bleached, infested areas contrast with intact wood. Symptoms of infestion by the symbiotic partner—wood wasps—include circular exit holes in the crust and acute stress through dryness, common in hanging, falling or tanning needles.|$|E
5|$|White <b>rot</b> of onions, leeks, {{and garlic}} {{is caused by}} the soil-borne fungus Sclerotium cepivorum. As the roots <b>rot,</b> the foliage turns yellow and wilts. The bases of the bulbs are {{attacked}} and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. These resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. No cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.|$|E

40|$|Three on-orchard {{treatments}} to reduce postharvest <b>rots</b> of avocados were evaluated on two orchards, one organic orchard in the Bay of Plenty {{and the other}} conventional orchard in Whangarei.

Mulch was applied instead of phosphorous acid in the organic orchard to improve root health. Irrigation in combination with controlling root <b>rots</b> by injecting with phosphorous acid reduced both body <b>rots</b> and stem-end <b>rots</b> in fruit from the Whangarei orchard, but irrigation in combination with application of mulch did not reduce <b>rots</b> in fruit from the Bay of Plenty orchard. The application of calcium to trees reduced body <b>rots</b> in fruit from both orchards.

50|$|Soft <b>rots</b> {{are those}} where the {{pathogen}} {{breaks down the}} host cell walls, resulting in the exudation of juices from the infected tissue. The organ becomes mushy or pulpy and a foul smell often develops due to colonization by secondary invaders. Many fungi and bacteria cause soft <b>rots</b> on several fruits and vegetables. Species of the fungus, Rhizopus and bacterium Erwinia are two such commonly found pathogens causing soft <b>rots.</b>|$|R
5|$|Amylostereum is {{the single}} genus in the fungal family Amylostereaceae. The genus {{currently}} comprises four saprotrophic and parasitic species, which live off living or dead wood. The Amylostereaceae cause white <b>rot</b> in the wood by disintegrating the tissue component lignin. They produce crust-like, partially wavy fruit bodies {{on the surface of}} infested trees, which are similar to those produced by Stereum species.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure.

25|$|In 1668, Italian {{physician}} Francesco Redi disproved {{the theory}} of spontaneous generation. The accepted theory of Redi's day claimed that maggots developed spontaneously from <b>rotting</b> meat. In an experiment, he used samples of <b>rotting</b> meat that were either fully exposed to the air, partially exposed to the air, or not exposed to air at all. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed <b>rotting</b> meat developed fly maggots, whereas <b>rotting</b> meat that was not exposed to air did not develop maggots. This discovery completely changed the way people viewed the decomposition of organisms and prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and into entomology in general.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, semiochemicals present in {{extracts}} of <b>rotted</b> wood of termite tolerant and susceptible cultivars {{have been evaluated}} to develop an eco-friendly pest control agent. Of the extracts of tea cultivars tested in the present study, crude extracts from <b>rotted</b> tea wood from all the test tea cultivars were attractive to termites than extract of the healthy tea wood. Comparison of the extracts of four tea stem cultivars showed that the extracts of <b>rotted</b> wood of TRI 2027 and TRI 2023 were more attractive than that of other tea cultivars used in the experiment. It is suggested that chemical constituents present in extracts of <b>rotted</b> stem of cultivars, TRI 2027 and TRI 2023 may contain the correct percentages of attractive chemicals to attract the alates. Further analysis of the <b>rotted</b> stem extracts indicated that the termites were attracted to the hexane fractions of <b>rotted</b> stems while the chloroform and methanol fractions of <b>rotted</b> wood were not attractive against LCLWT suggesting non-polar, volatile compounds in <b>rotted</b> tea wood attract the alates. These results are {{in agreement with the}} preliminary findings in which termite alates were preferred <b>rotted</b> tea stems than that of the healthy tea stems (Sivapalan and Senaratna 1981; Samarasinghe et al. 1999). In a previous research, it has been demonstrated that LCLWT did not respond strongly to extracts of the fungi isolated from the <b>rotted</b> stem, hence combinations of fungal extracts with <b>rotted</b> wood were not {{used in the present study}} (Senanayake et al. 2012 a, b). However, several studies showed that positive responses by different species of termite for fungus invaded wood over healthy wood (Esenther et al. 1961; Smythe et al. 1967; Cornelious et al. 2002). Extracts of wood decayed by different species of fungi were tested using orientation bioassay and Smythe et al. (1967) reported that the eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes showed a strong response for fungal extracts obtained from wood decayed by fungi. Interactions between Formosan subterranean termites and wood decay fungi have been studied and the results indicated that the fungus, Marasmiellus troyanus produced a chemical during the process of metabolizing lignin that elicited a positive response in termites (Cornelious et al. 2002).|$|R
