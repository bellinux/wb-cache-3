25|$|Iver Johnson made {{an unusual}} model from 1940 to 1947, called the Trigger Cocking Double Action. If the hammer was down, {{pulling the trigger}} would cock the hammer. If the trigger was pulled with the hammer cocked, it would then fire. This meant that to fire the <b>revolver</b> from a <b>hammer</b> down state, the trigger must be pulled twice.|$|R

Items include flashlight, ammo for any of the weapons, adrenaline shots, pills, and medkits. A remastered version of the game was released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on December 17, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|John Henry Fitzgerald was an {{employee}} of Colt prior to World War II and was known to carry {{of a pair of}} New Service [...] "Fitz Specials" [...] in his front pockets. These <b>revolvers</b> had bobbed <b>hammers,</b> 2" [...] barrels, shortened and rounded grip frames, and the front of the trigger guard was removed. Although less than 30 left the factory, it became an after-market conversion for many gunsmiths. Colonels Rex Applegate and Charles Askins were proponents of this model.|$|R
2500|$|In a single-action <b>revolver,</b> the <b>hammer</b> is {{manually}} cocked, {{usually with}} the thumb of the firing or supporting hand. This action advances the cylinder {{to the next}} round and locks the cylinder in place with the chamber aligned with the barrel. The trigger, when pulled, releases the hammer, which fires the round in the chamber. To fire again, the hammer must be manually cocked again. This is called [...] "single-action" [...] because the trigger only performs a single action, of releasing the hammer. Because only a single action is performed and trigger pull is lightened, firing a revolver in this way allows most shooters to achieve greater accuracy. Additionally, the need to cock the hammer manually acts as a safety. The Colt Paterson Revolver, the Walker Colt, the Colt's Dragoon and the Colt Single Action Army pistol of the American Frontier era are all good examples of this system.|$|R
2500|$|A single-action <b>revolver</b> {{requires}} the <b>hammer</b> {{to be pulled}} back by hand before each shot, which also revolves the cylinder. This leaves the trigger with just one [...] "single action" [...] left to perform - releasing the hammer to fire the shot - so the force and distance required {{to pull the trigger}} can be minimal. In contrast, with a self-cocking revolver, one long squeeze of the trigger pulls back the hammer and revolves the cylinder, then finally fires the shot. They can generally be fired faster than a single-action, but with reduced accuracy in the hands of most shooters.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} notable {{drawbacks}} {{to the external}} hammer system compared to other modern, internal designs. In single-action revolvers, specifically, there is an ever-present danger of accidentally discharging the weapon if the hammer is struck with a shell loaded in the chamber. There is nothing to prevent the hammer from contacting the firing pin and by default the cartridge, in some models, and so the gun will be discharged unintentionally.Other models do have an internal safety mechanism that prevents contact between the hammer and the firing pin unless the trigger is actually pulled. Even so, many single-action revolver owners choose to carry their <b>revolver</b> with the <b>hammer</b> resting on an empty chamber {{to minimize the risk}} of accidental discharge. Additionally, for those who carry their firearm as a personal defense weapon, there is the ever-present worry that an external hammer may catch on a loose article of clothing in an emergency situation, because the hammer protrudes at an angle {{from the rear of the}} weapon, and as the owner moves to quickly draw their weapon, the hammer may snag on clothing and cause the loss of seconds in a dangerous situation. Paul B. Weston, an authority on police weapons, called the external a “fish hook” that tended to snag clothing during a fast draw.|$|R
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to show that Vanzetti's {{revolver}} {{was taken from the}} slain Berardelli, the prosecution traced the history of Berardelli's [...]38 Harrington & Richardson (H) revolver. Berardelli's wife testified {{that she and her husband}} dropped off the gun for repair at the Iver Johnson Co. of Boston a few weeks before the murder. According to the foreman of the Iver Johnson repair shop, Berardelli's revolver was given a repair tag with the number of 94765, and this number was recorded in the repair logbook with the statement [...] "H. & R. <b>revolver,</b> [...]38-calibre, new <b>hammer,</b> repairing, half an hour". However, the shop books did not record the gun's serial number, and the caliber was apparently incorrectly labeled as [...]32 instead of [...]38-caliber. The shop foreman testified that a new spring and hammer were put into Berardelli's Harrington & Richardson revolver. The gun was claimed and the half-hour repair paid for, though the date and identity of the claimant were not recorded. After examining Vanzetti's [...]38 revolver, the foreman testified that Vanzetti's gun had a new replacement hammer in keeping with the repair performed on Berardelli's revolver. The foreman explained that the shop was always kept busy repairing 20 to 30 revolvers per day, which made it very hard to remember individual guns or keep reliable records of when they were picked up by their owners. But, he said that unclaimed guns were sold by Iver Johnson at the end of each year, and the shop had no record of an unclaimed gun sale of Berardelli's revolver. To reinforce the conclusion that Berardelli had reclaimed his revolver from the repair shop, the prosecution called a witness who testified that he had seen Berardelli in possession of a [...]38 nickel-plated revolver the Saturday night before the Braintree robbery.|$|R
