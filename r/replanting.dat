5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some <b>replanting</b> and even dispersed grass seed by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no <b>replanting</b> was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E
40|$|When {{orchards}} are <b>replanted</b> {{to maintain}} productivity, apple <b>replant</b> disease (ARD) often causes major problems. Soil fumigants sometimes control ARD, but biological and cultural alternatives are needed.

40|$|We used a next-generation, Illumina-based {{sequencing}} {{approach to}} characterize the bacterial community development of apple rhizosphere soil in a <b>replant</b> site (<b>RePlant)</b> and a new planting site (NewPlant) in Beijing. Dwarfing apple nurseries of 'Fuji'/SH 6 /Pingyitiancha trees were planted {{in the spring of}} 2013. Before planting, soil from the apple rhizosphere of the <b>replant</b> site (ReSoil) and from the new planting site (NewSoil) was sampled for analysis on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In late September, the rhizosphere soil from both sites was resampled (<b>RePlant</b> and NewPlant). More than 16, 000 valid reads were obtained for each replicate, and the community was composed of five dominant groups (Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes and Actinobacteria). The bacterial diversity decreased after apple planting. Principal component analyses revealed that the rhizosphere samples were significantly different among treatments. Apple nursery planting showed a large impact on the soil bacterial community, and the community development was significantly different between the <b>replanted</b> and newly planted soils. Verrucomicrobia were less abundant in <b>RePlant</b> soil, while Pseudomonas and Lysobacter were increased in <b>RePlant</b> compared with ReSoil and NewPlant. Both <b>RePlant</b> and ReSoil showed relatively higher invertase and cellulase activities than NewPlant and NewSoil, but only NewPlant soil showed higher urease activity, and this soil also had the higher plant growth. Our experimental results suggest that planting apple nurseries has a significant impact on soil bacterial community development at both <b>replant</b> and new planting sites, and planting on new site resulted in significantly higher soil urease activity and a different bacterial community composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{level of}} mollusks and environmental conditions in <b>replanted</b> {{as well as}} natural mangrove forests were investigated to determine the restoration level in <b>replanted</b> mangroves. This study was performed in 2 <b>replanted</b> and 2 natural mangrove forests in 2003 and 2004 in Viti Levu Island, Fiji. The ages of the trees in each <b>replanted</b> mangrove were 1 - 3 and 7 years old. The main mangrove tree species <b>replanted</b> in both areas was Rhizophora stylosa. The mangrove trees in the natural forest were between 5 m and 20 m in height. However, those in the forests <b>replanted</b> 1 - 3 - and 7 years previously were from 1 m to 1. 5 m and from 3 m to 4 m in height, respectively. Trees near the landside were taller than those on the seaside {{in all of the}} mangrove forests examined. Salinity in the regions of the <b>replanted</b> mangroves was about 3 % but that in natural mangrove forests was from 0. 2 to 3 %. The older mangrove forests had neutral pH but younger forests were alkaline. About 10 mollusks were counted in natural forests but the <b>replanted</b> mangrove forests contained only 2 to 3 mollusks. Each quadrate showed a different frequency of observed mollusks. Littorina scabra was the dominant species in the 1 - 3 -year-old mangrove forest. Nerita planospira and Littorina scabra were the dominant species near the landside but only Littorina scabra were dominant near sea side in the 7 -year-old <b>replanted</b> mangrove. Environmental conditions and biodiversity levels in <b>replanted</b> mangrove forests were different from those in natural mangrove forests. However, the 7 -year-old mangrove forest showed a slightly higher biodiversity level than 1 - 3 -year-old forest and environmental conditions {{similar to those of the}} natural forest. ...|$|R

5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent exhaustion doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for <b>replanting.</b> The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by <b>replanting</b> soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent exhaustion, because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the aim {{to make use of}} {{renewable}} resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo. Bamboo is considered {{to one of the most}} ecologically friendly materials for use in home furnishing and flooring, because it can be harvested without felling the entire tree. There is therefore no need for <b>replanting,</b> and the bamboo is allowed to regain its full height again over about five years, ready to be harvested again.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleotide}} sequence of chromosomes of Azotobacter vinelandii, strain AvOP, is partially determined. This chromosome is a circular DNA molecule which contains 5,342,073 nucleotide pairs and 5,043 genes, of which 4,988 encode proteins. The fraction of guanine + cytosine pairs is 65 mole percent. The number of chromosomes in the cells and the DNA content increases upon aging, {{and in the}} stationary growth phase, cultures may contain more than 100 copies of a chromosome per cell. The original DNA content (one copy) is restored when <b>replanting</b> the culture into a fresh medium. In addition to chromosomal DNA, Azotobacter can contain plasmids.|$|E
5|$|Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and {{has only}} been {{collected}} from Texas and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, {{and then it was}} not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and <b>replanting</b> with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant and Hunt counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{potential}} risk factors associated with the failure of an upper extremity replantation with a focus on cigarette or tobacco use. A cohort of 102 patients with 149 <b>replants</b> (6 extremities, 143 digits) and a mean age of 41 years (range 5 to 72 years) was enrolled in this study. The data collected included age, gender, tobacco/cigarettes use, trauma mechanism, underlying disease (e. g., hypertension (HTN), diabetes mellitus (DM), etc.), and vein graft use. An analysis with a multivariable regression was conducted to identify the risk factors of <b>replant</b> failure and their respective odds ratios (ORs). Multilevel generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with a binomial distribution and logit link showed that smoking did not increase the risk of <b>replant</b> failure (p = 0. 234). In addition, the survival of <b>replants</b> was not affected by DM or HTN (p = 0. 285 and 0. 938, respectively). However, the replantation results were significantly affected by the age of the patients and the mechanism of injury. Patients older than 50 years and those with avulsion or crush injuries tended to have a higher risk of <b>replant</b> failure (OR = 2. 29, 6. 45, and 5. 42, respectively; p = 0. 047, 0. 028, and 0. 032, respectively). This study showed that the use of cigarettes/tobacco did not affect the replantation outcome. The main risks for <b>replant</b> failure included being older than 50 years and the trauma mechanism (avulsion or crush injuries) ...|$|R
