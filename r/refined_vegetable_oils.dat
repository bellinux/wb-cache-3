A semi-batch reactor operating mode was tested and compared to conventional batch in two-step esterification-transesterification process to investigate mixing effects. Based on experimental results, esterification conversion close to 99 % is achieved by using sulphuric acid as catalyst and a biodiesel yield of 93. 6 % is obtained after transesterification employing a combination of potassium carbonate and potassium hydroxide as catalysts.

However, it is impractical to use the <b>refined</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> as the feedstock for biodiesel production due to its high production cost and priority for food products. Thus, low-grade oil with high free fatty acids (FFA) content, typically waste cooking oil has been a promising choice to improve the economical feasibility of biodiesel. In the present study, superacid sulfated tin oxide catalyst, SO 42 -/SnO 2 has been successfully prepared through impregnation method. Bimetallic effect was also studied at which SnO 2 mixed with SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3, respectively at different weight ratio {{in order to enhance}} the catalytic activity of SnO 2. The effect of different reaction parameters such as calcinations temperature and period, reaction temperature, catalyst loading, methanol to oil ratio and reaction time were studied to optimize the reaction conditions.

40|$|The {{traditional}} quality characteristics for <b>refined</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> {{focus on}} a bland taste, a light colour and a good oxidative stability. Currently, an increased interest is observed for functional minor components naturally present in oils and fats performing a beneficial nutritional effect. Refining of crude vegetable oils involving degumming, bleaching and deodorisation has a high influence {{on the content of}} functional minor components. In this study the difference of chemical versus physical refining will be studied. Especially the reduction of the tocopherol content in refined oil is mainly due to oxidation of the tocopherol. Also the content of sterols in free and esterified form is changing during the various stages of refining. As the economic value of physical deodoriser distillates is much lower compared to chemical distillates an improved deodorization technology to increase the quality of physical deodoriser distillates by condensation of the distillate in two separate fractions was developed. Free fatty acids distillated in the initial stages of the deodorization process are collected in a first distillate, followed by a condensation of tocopherols and phytosterols in a second distillate with a high economic value. The fractionated distillation of free fatty acids and tocopherols / phytosterols was achieved by optimisation of the deodorization temperature profile...|$|E
