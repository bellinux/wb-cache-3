The extent of the deletions establishes the order att[lambda]-int-(exo,red) -[beta]-cIII, for markers in the [lambda] center. The correlation in position of the exo and red markers suggest that the exonuclease protein is involved in genetic recombination, and the viability of exo-[beta]- [lambda]bios shows that neither exonuclease nor [beta]-protein is essential for [lambda] growth.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{deterministic}} dependency parsing algorithm {{that attempts to}} create the easiest arcs in the dependency structure first in a non-directional manner. Traditional deterministic parsing algorithms {{are based on a}} shift-reduce framework: they traverse the sentence from left-to-right and, at each step, perform one of a possible set of actions, until a complete tree is built. A drawback of this approach is that it is extremely local: while decisions can be based on complex structures on the left, they can look only at a few words to the right. In contrast, our algorithm builds a dependency tree by iteratively selecting the best pair of neighbours to connect at each parsing step. This allows incorporation of features from already built structures both to the left and to the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> the <b>attachment</b> point. The parser learns both the attachment preferences and the order in which they should be performed. The result is a deterministic, best-first, O(nlogn) parser, which is significantly more accurate than best-first transition based parsers, and nears the performance of globally optimized parsing models. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDifferentiation between {{anomalous}} {{connection and}} anomalous drainage of the pulmonary veins in hypoplastic left heart syndrome is important before either the Norwood procedure or heart transplantation is performed. To determine {{the prevalence of}} echocardiographically detected anomalous connection or drainage, or both, of pulmonary veins in patients with this syndrome, preoperative two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler color flow mapping studies of 317 patients who underwent the stage I Norwood procedure were reviewed. The term “connection” was {{used to describe the}} precise anatomic <b>attachment</b> <b>of</b> the pulmonary veins and the term “drainage” to describe the physiologic end point of pulmonary venous flow. Twenty patients (6. 3 %) had anomalous connection or drainage, or both, of the pulmonary veins by preoperative echocardiographic and Doppler examination. The subcostal and suprasternal scans best showed the anatomic details of the pulmonary veins. All these patterns were confirmed intraoperatively and could be grouped as follows: 1) partial anomalous connection and drainage (two patients); 2) total anomalous connection and drainage (eight patients); 3) normal connection with total anomalous drainage (eight patients); and 4) normal connection with partial anomalous drainage (two patients). The advantage of adding Doppler color flow mapping to two-dimensional echocardiography and conventional Doppler study was clearly demonstrated in the detection of small accessory vertical veins, their course and {{the presence or absence of}} obstruction.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the study of recent {{scientific}} literature about the development <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> the author answers the following questions: which are the postulates the theory <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> has about the stability of the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> which level <b>of</b> stability in the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> from infancy to adulthood these studies illuminate and which factors significantly influence the (in) stability of the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> in time. The theory <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> assumes that normal circumstances elicit stability. Changes, however, can be the result of important events influencing the sensitivity of the object <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> Agreement has not yet been reached regarding the percentage of stability in the patterns <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> There is more agreement regarding attachment in adulthood than that in childhood. The results depend on the size and characteristics of the subjects of the research, the measuring instruments, type of data analysis etc. The author concludes that attachment is a dynamic system influenced by significant changes in life (the cognitive development of the child, external care, parents&# 39; divorce, different stressful situations).

The results showed that poor quality <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> with parents and peers predicts bullying and victimization.

Fifty-nine children and adolescents from a New York RTC/TDP participated in this study.

In addition, there was a significant effect <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> as measured by the categorical measure, on self-esteem. In examining attachment and self-control, there was not a significant effect <b>of</b> <b>attachment</b> on self-control using the categorical measure <b>of</b> <b>attachment,</b> nor was there a significant correlation between self-control on the secure and avoidant scales of the continuous measure <b>of</b> <b>attachment.</b> However, a positive correlation was found between the anxious/ambivalent scores and self-control.
