Overall, individuals of both species exhibited greater spitting success rate when alone than in a group.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{considerable}} {{progress in the}} understanding of anomalous transport, many ques-tions and issues raised in the early papers in this field of research are still of interest today. In this Section we will briefly discuss some of these issues. In particular the role of the concept of correlation functions in the search for modifications of the conventional diffu-sion equations and for scaling laws, in order to describe non-classical diffusion. Turbulent diffusion can also be viewed within the context of correlation functions. A direct relationship between the diffusion coefficient and the autocorrelation function of the velocity was introduced by Taylor [1]. Actually, he introduced a new ”tool ” for the analysis of diffusion processes. Following the ideas of Einstein and Langevin, Taylor in-troduced a stochastic equation for the motion of a Lagrangian test particle in a random field. Consider the equation for the trajectory of a fluid parcel in a turbulent velocity field u(x, t), dx dt = u(x, t). (1) Since the velocity on the <b>right</b> hand <b>side</b> (<b>rhs)</b> depends on the trajectory x(t), (1) is highly nonlinear! Suppose we follow a particle along its Lagrangian trajectory. It is obvious that the La-grangian velocity v(x 0, t) is equal to the Eulerian field value u(x, t) if the particle trajec-tory x(t) which starts at x 0 passes through the point x at time t, i. e., v(x 0, t) = u(x(t), t) ...|$|R

40|$|Rh 17 S 15 has {{recently}} {{been shown to be}} a strongly correlated superconductor with a transition temperature of 5. 4 K. In order {{to understand the nature of}} strong correlations we study the effect of substitution of some of the Rh and S atoms by other elements such as Fe, Pd, Ir and Ni on the <b>Rh</b> <b>side</b> and Se on the S side in this work. We find that while substitution of Ir and Se lower the transition temperature considerably, that of Fe, Pd and Ni destroy superconductivity down to 1. 5 K. The resistivity data in these doped samples show a minimum which is presumably disorder induced. A reduction of Tc is always accompanied by a reduction of electron correlations as deduced from heat capacity and magnetization data. Interestingly, the Fe doped sample shows some possible antiferromagnetic ordering at low temperatures. Comment: Published in Journal of Physics Condensed Matte...|$|R
