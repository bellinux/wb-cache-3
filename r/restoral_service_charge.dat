40|$|A web {{study of}} nearly 500 U. S. -based {{respondents}} compared three possible formats for presenting the <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> for a prix fixe meal, namely, {{as a percentage}} added to the meal price, as a dollar amount added to the meal price, and as an unknown amount obscured by inclusion in the full meal price. For those who received a single price only (with an unstated <b>service</b> <b>charge),</b> the respondents estimated a mean <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> just over 13 percent, which is reasonably close to inferring the commonly applied 15 -percent <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> The respondents thought that a 12 -percent added charge was good value, but when the stated <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> was higher than the conventional 15 percent they viewed the meal as a bad deal compared to the meal with the unknown <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> included. Survey participants regarded the dollar-amount <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> similarly, but this format also may serve to obscure the service-charge calculation. The chief implication for restaurants is that even with a prix fixe menu, guests are making value calculations at all times, and the <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> {{is one of those}} value issues—one that seems to stick out in customers’ minds...|$|R

A modern <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> may therefore include provision for the recovery of a multiplicity of services.

40|$|Mass {{customization}} (MC) {{service is}} a pertinent industrial practice in the fashion industry. To foster trust and enhance demand, some brands now allow dissatisfied customers to return the MC fashion product for a full refund minus a <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> The <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> is a measure to avoid the abuse of the return right and to subsidize the operations cost (e. g., shipping) and loss from the return. Motivated by this observed industrial practice, this paper analytically examines the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> policy. We separate the study into two cases?those of risk-neutral and those of risk-averse MC companies, respectively. For each case, we derive the closed-form expression of the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge,</b> and we conduct analytical sensitivity analysis to illustrate how different important parameters in the model affect the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge.</b> In addition, by comparing the two cases, we reveal how the MC service provider's level of risk aversion affects the optimal return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> policy. Finally, we derive {{the conditions under which}} it is optimal to offer a zero return <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> (i. e., free return with a full refund). These conditions provide insight on the real-world practice in which some fashion companies offer free return service to their registered members but not to every customer.

40|$|AbstractThe {{wastewater}} {{construction projects}} {{are needed for}} meeting the environment regulatory and compliance, preserving the sewer system and treatment infrastructure and reducing the sewer spills. However, most business owners {{do not understand the}} fundamental of the sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> program and the current sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> adjustment guideline only provides very basic information for the program. These business owners end up with significant amount of money and time wasted since they often fall short of qualification for sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> adjustment. More importantly, no sewer <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> evaluation or cost benefit analysis is conducted for new construction projects. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate wastewater charge saving strategies through two case studies that include hospital buildings and large residential complex buildings having more than 100 units. Detailed cost comparative analysis is presented to show if the saving strategies are achievable for each case.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the world}} of {{commerce}} and industry, every business outfit seeks to maximize its profit. The optimal values of sales mark-up price and <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> sustain this objective. This is true since some firms could sell their products for cash or for no money down with cost spread over some period of equal payments. Thus, the firm’s income comes from sales and the <b>service</b> <b>charges</b> collected on time payment accounts. In most cases, based on each firm’s experience, sales marked-up price and <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> were randomly fixed. In this paper, I present a mathematical model for optimizing sales mark-up price and <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> in a profit-maximizing firm. Testing the model on real life problems confirms that the model is accurate. The numerical {{results show that the}} model is amenable to financial analysis and computer automation...|$|R

Firstly, it gave leaseholders and landlords specific rights to apply to a Court or Tribunal to vary the terms of a lease. Secondly, it introduced specific rules about retaining <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> contributions in designated trust accounts. Thirdly, it introduced an obligation for Landlords to provide their name and address when issuing <b>service</b> <b>charge</b> demands.

5000|$|As we have seen, if {{the banks}} were {{permitted}} to retain as earning assets what private and Government bonds and notes they now have as backing for their demands deposits, {{there would be no}} immediate change in the earnings of the banks.

The banks might then be pressed to find additional income to compensate them for the additional work required.
