5|$|As {{they came}} to the elbow, on the 494-yard run-in to home, Cahervillahow, <b>Romany</b> King, The Committee and Esha Ness {{remained}} tight and vying for position. But it was 50/1 shot Esha Ness, ridden by John White and trained by Jenny Pitman, who crossed the line first, in the second-fastest time in Grand National history. Cahervillahow came home second despite trailing in fourth at the elbow, <b>Romany</b> King was third and The Committee fourth. Givus A Buck completed in fifth, with On The Other Hand and Laura's Beau completing the seven finishers of the National that never was.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the water jump — the final fence of the first circuit — that many riders became aware of the {{situation}} and pulled up, including champion jockey Peter Scudamore on Captain Dibble, Garrison Savannah, and Zeta's Lad, who was widely considered by tipsters as the form horse in the field, having raced unbeaten in his five starts that season, including beating <b>Romany</b> King in the Racing Post Chase at Kempton two months prior. Most of the horses at the rear were pulled up too, including Stay On Tracks, David's Duky, Direct, Mister Ed and the tailed-off Quirinus.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} how <b>romanies</b> {{look upon}} schooling {{and how they}} reflect upon the possibility of getting an education. Many inquiries relating to <b>romanies</b> {{have been published in}} Sweden but very few are based on fieldwork among <b>romanies.</b> The aim of this thesis is therefore to through fieldwork focus on how <b>romanies</b> themselves look upon their educational situation. The main questions for this study are: How is the image of <b>romanies</b> as a problem constructed in school? How are <b>romanies</b> separated from other students? How is the interplay between <b>romanies</b> and school representatives formed? How do <b>romanies</b> look upon the possibility of getting an education and does their perception differ from the usual official apprehension? An important conclusion concerns how social workers and teachers continuously categorize <b>romanies</b> as different. The group is constantly differentiated from other ethnic groups and is often the target of integration projects. This leads to a constant stigmatization of the group but also to “weak power”. In certain situations where the ethnic identity may be an advantage the ethnic identity is over communicated while it is under communicated in an inferior situation...|$|R
50|$|In August 1997, TV Nova, {{a popular}} {{television}} {{station in the}} Czech Republic, broadcast a documentary on the situation of <b>Romanies</b> who had emigrated to Canada. The short report portrayed <b>Romanies</b> in Canada living comfortably {{with support from the}} state, and sheltered from racial discrimination and violence. At the time, life was particularly difficult for many <b>Romanies</b> living in the Czech Republic. As a result of the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, many <b>Romanies</b> were left without citizenship in either the Czech Republic or Slovakia. Following the large flood in Moravia in July, many <b>Romanies</b> were left homeless yet unwelcome {{in other parts of the}} country.|$|R
50|$|Most Eastern European <b>Romanies</b> are Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, or Muslim. Those in Western Europe and the United States {{are mostly}} Roman Catholic or Protestant in {{southern}} Spain, many <b>Romanies</b> are Pentecostal, {{but this is}} a small minority that has emerged in contemporary times. In Egypt, the <b>Romanies</b> are split into Christian and Muslim populations.|$|R
5|$|This put <b>Romany</b> King {{into the}} lead, which he {{held on to}} until being passed at the final fence and {{finishing}} third. The horse had been narrowly beaten by Party Politics in the previous year's National but had won just one of his six races since, a moderate event at Exeter in November. He shared pre-race favouritism with Party Politics until shortly before the start when he drifted to 15/2 joint-second favourite. His Irish jockey, Adrian Maguire, was one of nine riders making their debut in the race.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 2015, Amazon Studios {{released}} a pilot {{episode of the}} American adaptation along with their 4th season of new pilots. The adaptation was written by original series creator and writer Cris Cole, who has also signed on for the whole series if it is commissioned. Also, The Shield creator Shawn Ryan joined Cole as an executive producer on the pilot episode. The series stars Michael Imperioli, Billy Zane, Steve Zahn, and <b>Romany</b> Malco, as well as Ben Chaplin, who appeared in the British Mad Dogs series {{in the role of}} Alvo, played by Zane in the US series. The pilot episode is 55 minutes long and has been rated 18, compared to the 15 rating provided to the original series. The American pilot also ends at a different point to the original.|$|E
5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and <b>Romany</b> Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as script editor on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as script editor on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Discourse & Society [© SAGE Publications]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] article examines the particulars of extreme prejudiced discourse about ethnic minorities in a Romanian sociocultural context. It concentrates on a detailed analysis of a single case taken from a wider project aimed at comparing and contrasting the way Romanians talk about Hungarians with the way they talk about <b>Romanies.</b> The article examines in detail the discourse of a middle-class Romanian accounting for prejudice and discrimination towards <b>Romanies</b> as part of an interview on a series of controversial issues surrounding ethnic minorities. This article tries to highlight and interrogate claims that <b>Romanies</b> are to blame for prejudice against them. The analysis, inspired by a critical discursive approach, has a discursive and conversational analytic focus to examine switches in talk about 'us' to talk that blames 'them'. The analysis suggests that talk about <b>Romanies</b> is more extreme than the anti-alien, anti-immigrant prejudiced talk studied by numerous western critical researchers. It is more extreme because <b>Romanies</b> are not merely portrayed as being different, but also as being beyond the moral order, beyond nationhood, difference and comparison. Talk about <b>Romanies</b> employs a style that, at the same time, denies, but also protects extreme prejudice. This article illustrates and discusses some of the discursive, rhetorical and interpretative resources used to talk about and legitimate the blaming of <b>Romanies.</b> In examining the dynamics of extreme prejudice against <b>Romanies,</b> this article provides a critical investigation of the social and political consequences of extreme discursive patterning. Implications for the study of discursive construction and representation of difference in talk about <b>Romanies</b> are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{historical}} {{group of}} Bohemian <b>Romanies</b> must {{be distinguished from}} those <b>Romanies</b> groups that live in Bohemia presently. The latter are post-World War II immigrants from Slovakia (especially Romungro), who do not speak Bohemian Romani.|$|R
50|$|The first {{ancestors}} of Bohemian <b>Romanies</b> probably arrived in Bohemia in the 16th and 17th centuries, from Slovakia via Moravia. Small-scale migration of <b>Romanies</b> from Slovakia to the Czech Lands (as well as backwards) continued throughout the following centuries. The Bohemian <b>Romanies</b> {{have always been}} a numerically insignificant minority. In 1939, there were ca. 6,000 people of different Romani groups in the territory of today's Czech Republic (Nečas 1995). Of these, a smaller fraction, perhaps some 2,000 people, lived in Bohemia. The proportion of different Romani groups in this figure is unknown, though the estimate of 500-1,500 of Bohemian <b>Romanies</b> cannot be wildly off the mark.|$|R

50|$|Some <b>Romanies</b> {{migrated}} from Persia through North Africa, reaching Europe via Spain in the 15th century. The two currents met in France. <b>Romanies</b> began immigrating to the United States in colonial times, with small groups in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger-scale immigration {{began in the}} 1860s, with groups of Romnichal from Britain. The largest number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the Vlax group of Kalderash. Many <b>Romanies</b> also settled in Latin America.|$|R
50|$|In 1879, a {{national}} meeting of <b>Romanies</b> {{was held in}} the Hungarian town of Kisfalu (now Pordašinci, Slovenia). <b>Romanies</b> in Bulgaria set up a conference in 1919 to protest for their right to vote, and a Romani journal, Istiqbal (Future) was founded in 1923.|$|R

50|$|Many {{countries}} that were formerly {{part of the}} Eastern bloc and former Yugoslavia have substantial populations of <b>Romanies.</b> The level of integration of <b>Romanies</b> into society remains limited.

Only a small fraction of Romani children graduate from secondary schools, though numerous official efforts have been made, past and present, to compel their attendance. <b>Romanies</b> frequently feel rejected by the state and the main population, creating another obstacle to their integration.|$|R

The remaining three thousand <b>Romanies</b> were gassed in the period from July to August 3. Steinbach, her mother, two brothers, two sisters, aunt, two nephews and niece were part of this latter group. Of the Steinbach family, only the father survived; he died in 1946 and is buried in the cemetery of Maastricht.|$|R
