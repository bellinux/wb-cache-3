The measurement system {{is based on}} the continuous repetition of a pulse that endlessly travels along the distance to be detected. There is a <b>pulse</b> <b>repeater</b> {{at both ends of the}} distance or cable to be measured. The endless repetition of the pulse generates a frequency that varies almost inversely with the distance to be measured. The resolution and distance or cable length range could be adjusted by varying the repetition time delay introduced at both ends and the measurement time. With this design a distance can be measured with centimeter resolution using electronic system with microsecond resolution, simplifying classical time of flight designs which require electronics with picosecond resolution.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Conducted vasodilation {{is part of}} the physiological response to increasing metabolic demand of the tissue. Similar responses can be elicited by focal electrical or chemical stimulation. Some evidence suggests an endothelial pathway for non-decremental transmission of hyperpolarizing pulses. However, the underlying mecha-nisms are debated. Here, we focus on dynamical aspects of the problem hypothesizing the existence of a bistability-powered mechanism for <b>regenerative</b> <b>pulse</b> transmission along the endothelium. Bistability implies that the cell can have two different sta-ble resting potentials and can switch between those states following an appropriate stimulus. Bistability is possible if the current–voltage curve is N shaped instead of monotonically increasing. Specifically, the presence of an inwardly rectifying potas-sium current may provide the endothelial cell with such properties. We provide a theoretical analysis as well as numerical simulations of both single- and multiunit bistable systems mimicking endothelial cells to investigate the self-consistence and stability of the proposed mechanism. We find that the individual cell may switch read...|$|R

Current {{research focuses on}} their application to glaucoma and cataract surgery as well as cornea transplant procedures. To avoid unwanted tissue damage during the surgical intervention it is of utmost importance to maintain a working energy just above the ablation threshold and maintain the laser energy at this working point independently of the local and global tissue properties. To quantify the attenuation of the laser power density in the tissue by absorption, scattering and modification of the point spread function we monitor the second harmonic radiation generated in the collagen matrix of the cornea when exposed to ultrashort laser pulses. We use a CPA system with a <b>regenerative</b> amplifier delivering <b>pulses</b> at a wavelength of 1. 06 µm, pulse durations of 400 fs and a maximum energy of 60 µJ. The repetition rate is adjustable from single shot up to 10 kHz. The experiments are performed on human corneas provided by the French Eye bank. To capture the SHG radiation we use a photomultiplier tube connected to a lockin amplifier tuned to the laser repetition rate.

The front-end system includes master oscillator, pulse shaping system, beam splitter and regenerative amplifier according to the demand of the ICF solid-state laser driver. In this paper, the front-end system is realized in all-solid-state with high reliability and stability by using LD pumping, pulse stacking in the optical fiber and integrated optics technology. In the first chapter, three-aspect literatures relating to the thesis are summarized. In the first part, it is stated and evaluated the present situation {{and the development of}} the pulse shaping system on the high power laser facilities in the world famous laboratories(Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Laboratory on Laser Energetics in America, Institute on Laser Engineering of OSAKA University in Japan and National Laboratory on High Power laser and Physics in Shanghai Institute of Optics & Fine Mechanics in China). In the second part, it is stated the history, present situation and development of the diode pumped solid state laser and its advantages compared with the laser diode itself and the flash-lamp pumped solid state laser. In the third part, it is introduced the development's course of injected locating of the single longitudinal mode laser and regenerative amplification of the ultra-short laser pulse. In the second chapter, diode-pumped-solid-state lasers (DPSL) are investigated. Three aspects are investigated in this chapter. In the first part, three kinds of single-longitudinal-mode (SLM) lasers are provided for the master oscillator in the front-end system by using novel cavity construction and new SLM selecting technique. In the second part, Nd:YLF and Nd:YAG linear cavity lasers passively Q-switched by Cr~(4 +) :YAG are realized, and the reason why passive Q-switching can not be realized in the linear-cavity Nd:YVO 4 laser is analyzed. In the third part, additive-pulse mode-locking (APM) of Nd:YLF and Nd:LMA lasers with output pulse duration of 2. 0 ps and 1. 8 ps respectively are realized, and the mechanism of APM and self-starting is analyzed. In the third chapter, arbitrary time shaping of SLM laser pulse is realized by using pulse stacking in the optical fiber stacker and integrated optical wave-guide modulator. The mechanism and the way of realization of optical fiber stacker and integrated optical waveguide modulator are discussed in detail, and the satisfactory results are obtained in the experiments. In this chapter, arbitrary electrical waveform generator (AWG) is realized by using the voltage-controlled-current property of GaAs field-effect transistor (FET), this method will make the computer-controlled AWG possible. In the fourth chapter, the theory and experiment results on regenerative amplifier of the SLM laser pulse are investigated. In an amplified approach with a master cavity and a slave cavity, an injected pulse does not interfere with itself in the slave cavity and the etalon's function of the slave cavity to the injected pulse is eliminated as long as the pulse duration is shorter than the round-trip time in the slave cavity. And, the instantaneous coherent effect is non-existent because the transverse relaxation time of a solid-state laser medium is much shorter than the pulse duration and round-trip time in the cavity. Owing to the above causes, the slave cavity brings no modulation to the frequency of the injected laser pulse, only reflects the injected pulse back and forth, thus the requirement of cavity length match between the two cavities is not necessary. In this chapter, the propagation and transport equations about intensity of electric field and inverse population are derived from the Maxwell equations about intensity and inverse population are obtained. Calculating results about the buildup process of the <b>regenerative</b> amplified <b>pulse,</b> pulse reshape and output stability are given. The buildup process from the injecting to the dumping is discussed in detail in the experiment, the total gain as high as 2 * 10 ~ 7 of the regenerative amplifier for the SLM laser pulse is obtained.

It is coupled to a confocal microscopy observation system to investigate intrastromal {{effects of the}} femtosecond laser. Methods: The femtosecond laser is a CPA system with a <b>regenerative</b> amplifier delivering <b>pulses</b> at a wavelength of 1. 065 µm, with a pulse duration of 500 fs, an energy of 60 µJ for a repetition rate of 10 KHz. The amplified pulses power fluctuations are lower than 1 %. Pulses repetition rate is adjustable up to 10 kHz and can even be reduced to single shot. The laser beam has a Gaussian distribution shape TEM 00. The obtainable peak power density is {{on the order of}} 10 ^ 15 W/cm^ 2. The laser beam travels to the samples guided by one six–lens set and one magnifier. The last lens can be changed to adjust the focal distance from 2 to 5 cm and the focal spot from 1 to 4 µm. The samples are fixed to an anterior chamber system, which is driven by a micrometric precision motor system. The 3 dimensional movements are computer controlled.

40|$|International audiencePurpose: The authors {{present a}} multiphoton {{microscope}} set–up {{mounted on a}} microsurgery experimental system using a Nd:glass femtosecond laser. The system allows for non–linear optical imaging before, during, and after the surgical intervention. Methods: The femtosecond laser is a CPA system with a <b>regenerative</b> amplifier delivering <b>pulses</b> at a wavelength of 1. 06 µm, pulse durations of typically 400 fs and a maximum energy of 60 µJ. The repetition rate is adjustable from single shot up to 10 kHz. The delivery system provides spot sizes down to the micron range and peak power densities well above 1015 W/cm 2. The human corneas are mounted on an anterior chamber system, which is installed on a computer controlled step motor positioning system. Photons generated by non–linear processes in the cornea travel backwards through the front part of the beam delivery optics and are captured by a photomultiplier tube behind a dichroic mirror. The signal is filtered by a lock–in amplifier tuned to the laser repetition rate and recorded by a personal computer. Scanning the sample permits the acquisition of 2 D or 3 D images. Results: When working above the ablation threshold, the set–up permits to induce laser cuts following complex geometries in human cornea. Penetrating and lamellar cuts could be performed. Below the ablation threshold the femtosecond laser pulses create secondary photons by the stimulation of non–linear processes in the samples. The interaction process could be identified as being predominantly second harmonic generation (SHG) and, to a lesser extent, two–photon fluorescence. The images obtained from the multi–photon module permitted to monitor, control and optimise the surgical intervention in situ without the need to move the sample or to match results from different characterisation methods. Conclusions: The combination of multiphoton imaging and corneal surgery necessitates only minimal modifications of the optical system of a femtosecond surgical laser system which do not compromise its performance. It is demonstrated that a combined system significantly improves parameter control and the monitoring of the surgical intervention...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{promising}} development {{direction of}} space propulsion engineering is to use, as spacecraft controls, low-thrust rocket engines (RDTM) on clean fuels, such as oxygen-methane. Modern RDTM {{are characterized by}} a lack <b>regenerative</b> cooling and <b>pulse</b> mode of operation, during which there is accumulation of heat energy {{to lead to the}} high thermal stress of RDTM structural elements. To get an idea about the thermal state of its elements, which further will reduce the number of fire tests is therefore necessary in the development phase of a new product. Accordingly, the aim of this work is the mathematical modeling and computational study of the thermal state of gaseous oxygen-methane propellant RDMT operating in pulse mode. In this paper we consider a model RDTM working on gaseous propellants oxygen-methane in pulse mode. To calculate the temperature field of the chamber wall of model RDMT under consideration is used the mathematical model of non-stationary heat conduction in a two-dimensional axisymmetric formulation that takes into account both the axial heat leakages and the nonstationary processes occurring inside the chamber during pulse operation of RDMT. As a result of numerical study of the thermal state of model RDMT, are obtained the temperature fields during engine operation based on convective, conductive, and radiative mechanisms of heat transfer from the combustion products to the wall. It is shown that the elements of flanges of combustion chamber of model RDMT act as heat sinks structural elements. Temperatures in the wall of the combustion chamber during the engine mode of operation are considered relatively low. Raised temperatures can also occur in the mixing head in the feeding area of the oxidant into the combustion chamber. During engine operation in the area forming the critical section, there is an intensive heating of a wall, which can result in its melting, which in turn will increase the minimum nozzle throat area and hence will change the operating conditions of engine. </p...|$|R
