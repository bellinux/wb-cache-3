The gardeners had been mowing, {{and there was still}} the smell of fresh-cut grass--the thundery air kept all scents close to earth. The sky was of a purplish hue--the poplars black. Two or three boats passed on the river, scuttling, as it were, for shelter before the storm. 'Three days fine weather,' thought Soames, 'and then a storm!' Where was Annette? With that chap, for all he knew--she was a young woman! Impressed with the queer charity of that thought, he entered the summer-house and sat down. The fact was--and he {{admitted}} it--Fleur was so much to him that his wife was very little--very little; French--had hardly been more than a mistress, and he was getting indifferent to that side of things! It was odd how, with all his ingrained care for moderation and secure investment, Soames ever put his emotional eggs into one basket. First Irene--now Fleur. He was just conscious of it, sitting there, conscious of its odd dangerousness. It had brought him to wreck and scandal once, but now--now it should save him! He cared so much for Fleur that he would have no further scandal. If only he could get at that anonymous letter writer, he would teach the fellow not to meddle and stir up mud at the bottom of water which he wished should remain stagnant!... A distant flash, a low rumble, and large drops of rain spattered on the thatch above him. He remained indifferent, tracing a pattern with his finger on the dusty surface of a little rustic table. Fleur's future! 'I want fair sailing for her,' he thought. 'Nothing else matters at my time of life.' A lonely business--life! What you had you never could keep to yourself! As you warned one off, you let another in. One could make sure of nothing! He reached up and pulled a red <b>rambler</b> <b>rose</b> from a cluster which blocked the window. Flowers grew and dropped--you couldn't keep them! The thunder rumbled and crashed, travelling east along the river, the paling flashes flicked his eyes; the poplar tops showed sharp and dense against the sky, a heavy shower rustled and rattled and veiled in the little house wherein he sat, indifferent, thinking.|$|E

5000|$|Nearby {{accessible}} only by two almost invisible paths and completely hidden away is the Sweet Scented Garden. This stands alone among gardens - an oval gem surrounded by tall dark shrubs. All known sweet scented flowers grow here in round and oval beds arranged down the centre with scented lilies {{in the middle of}} each bed (these scented lilies {{can be seen in the}} photo to the right). Around the edges of this oasis of concentrated perfume are set rustic seats in arbours of honeysuckle with, between them pools fed by miniature waterfalls (these water features are still in the Sweet Scented Garden at Lowther Castle today.) In the centre bed is an old French vase which was originally in the gardens of a house in Coblentz and had been much admired by Lord Lonsdale when in Germany for the Army manoeuvers. Round it are carved the lines from Omar Khayyam which commence “O moon of my delight”. This was placed in the Sweet Scented Garden by the Kaiser himself as a gift to Lord Lonsdale, during one of his visits to Lowther. To this garden came Lord and Lady Lonsdale on most evenings after dinner — to sit and enjoy its scents and quiet. Close to it, and equally hidden away, is the Japanese Garden, adorned with Chinese and Japanese ornaments, life-size bronze birds and animals, Japanese shrines, dwarf trees, scarlet lacquer dwarf bridges set among miniature lakes, filled with Japanese water-lilies and iris, tiny islands, and hidden paths. Beyond the Japanese Garden lies the Rose Garden. Here are set out some 25,000 rose bushes with <b>rambler</b> <b>rose</b> tents in all four corners. The bushes are planted on a stretch of green turf with a fountain and small rockery in the centre. (the remains of this fountain are still in the garden today) Leading out of the Rose Garden is an Iris Garden enclosed by a clipped hedge and containing more lily ponds with stone seats and lead figures arranged round and about them.” ...|$|E

6000|$|Here, {{where he}} had passed that {{wonderful}} week with her--the tug of her enchantment, the ache in his heart increased with every minute {{that she was not}} there to make the room, the garden, the very air magical. Would he ever be able to live down here, not seeing her? And he closed up utterly, going early to bed. It would not make him healthy, wealthy, and wise, but it closeted him with memory of Fleur in her fancy frock. He heard Val's arrival--the Ford discharging cargo, then the stillness of the summer night stole back--with only the bleating of very distant sheep, and a night-jar's harsh purring. He leaned far out. Cold moon--warm air--the Downs like silver! Small wings, a stream bubbling, the <b>rambler</b> <b>roses!</b> God-how empty all of it without her! In the Bible it was written: Thou shalt leave father and mother and cleave to--Fleur! ...|$|R

He stood still before the Goya copy. Accustomed to her own way in everything--Flower of his life! And now that she couldn't have it. He turned to the window for some air. Daylight was dying, the moon rising, gold behind the poplars! What sound was that? Why! That piano thing! A dark tune, with a thrum and a throb! She had set it going--what comfort could she get from that? His eyes caught {{movement}} down there beyond the lawn, under the trellis of <b>rambler</b> <b>roses</b> and young acacia-trees, where the moonlight fell. There she was, roaming up and down. His heart gave a little sickening jump. What would she do under this blow? How could he tell? What did he know of her--he had only loved her all his life--looked on her as the apple of his eye! He knew nothing--had no notion. There she was--and that dark tune--and the river gleaming in the moonlight! ...|$|R
50|$|Stern {{collected}} plants between 1900 - 1910, {{working with}} Reginald Farrer, Frank Ludlow, Joseph Rock, and George Sherriff. In 1914 he financially {{participated in a}} plant collecting expedition by Farrer and William Purdom to Yunnan and Kansu. He cultivated some of the novelties collected in Yunnan and Gansu in his garden at Highdown. Other plant hunters sent new plants to Stern, and he acquired an extensive collection of plants from Veitch & Son in 1912. Over the years, Stern introduced many new plants to the garden and created new hybrids of Berberis, Eremurus, hellebore, lily, Magnolia, rose and snowdrop, among which Magnolia 'Highdownensis' (probable cultivar of M. wilsonii), <b>rambler</b> <b>roses</b> 'Coral' (a triploid R. sinowilsonii hybrid), 'Weddingday' (1950, R. sinowilsonii hybrid), and Rosa ×highdownensis (1928, R. moyesii hybrid). He {{is also the author}} that first described the snowdrop Galanthus rizehensis. Herbarium specimens of some of the plants from Highdown Gardens are kept at the Natural History Museum, London. He was chairman of the John Innes Horticultural Institute (1947-1961). He was also vice-president of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1962. He was vice-president and treasurer of the Linnean Scociety from 1941 to 1958. Stern was knighted in 1956 for his services to horticulture. Several plants species have been named in his honour, such as Buddleja sterniana (now B. crispa), Cotoneaster sternianus, Helleborus ×sternii (= H. argutifolius × H. lividus) and Paeonia sterniana.|$|R
50|$|Begun in 1996, the National Rose Trial Garden is {{the first}} garden {{of its kind in}} Australia where roses are tested for their {{suitability}} for Australian climates. The Garden is a joint venture between the Botanic Gardens of Adelaide, the National Rose Trial Society of Australia and the rose industry. It has been built on part of the former Municipal Tramways Trust Hackney Depot. Roses are planted in groups such as, Noisette Roses, Bourbon <b>Roses,</b> Tea <b>Roses,</b> <b>Ramblers,</b> and Perpetual <b>Roses.</b> A trial is conducted over two growing seasons and all plants are treated equally with regard to horticultural practices. The roses are judged by a panel of 10 experienced rosarians who view them and allocate points over the two growing seasons. The results are announced publicly {{at the end of the}} trial and the best performing roses receive an award.|$|R
50|$|The Cranford Rose Garden {{opened in}} June 1928. It was {{designed}} by Harold Caparn, a landscape architect, and Montague Free, the Garden's horticulturist. Many of the original plants {{are still in the}} garden today. There are over 5,000 bushes of nearly 1,400 kinds of roses, including wild species, old garden roses, hybrid tea roses, grandifloras, floribundas, polyanthas, hybrid perpetuals, climbers, <b>ramblers,</b> and miniature <b>roses.</b> The garden also features a stone statue.|$|R

6000|$|About {{five o'clock}} {{of that same}} afternoon, Gerald Malloring went to see Tod. An open-air man himself, who often deplored the long hours he was {{compelled}} to spend in the special atmosphere of the House of Commons, he rather envied Tod his existence in this cottage, crazed from age, and clothed with wistaria, <b>rambler</b> <b>roses,</b> sweetbrier, honeysuckle, and Virginia creeper. Freeland had, in his opinion, quite a jolly life of it--the poor fellow not being able, of course, to help having a cranky wife and children like that. He pondered, as he went along, over a talk at Becket, when Stanley, still {{under the influence of}} Felix's outburst, had uttered some rather queer sayings. For instance, he had supposed that they (meaning, apparently, himself and Malloring) WERE rather unable to put themselves in the position of these Trysts and Gaunts. He seemed to speak of them as one might speak generically of Hodge, which had struck Malloring as singular, it not being his habit to see anything in common between an individual case, especially on his own estate, and the ethics of a general proposition. The place for general propositions was undoubtedly the House of Commons, where they could be supported one way or the other, out of blue books. He had little use for them in private life, where innumerable things such as human nature and all that came into play. He had stared rather hard at his host when Stanley had followed up that first remark with: [...] "I'm bound to say, I shouldn't care to have to get up at half past five, and go out without a bath!" [...] What {{that had to do with}} the land problem or the regulation of village morality Malloring had been unable to perceive. It all depended on what one was accustomed to; and in any case threw no light on the question, as to whether or not he was to tolerate on his estate conduct of which his wife and himself distinctly disapproved. At the back of national life there was always this problem of individual conduct, especially sexual conduct--without regularity in which, the family, as the unit of national life, was gravely threatened, to put it on the lowest ground. And he did not see how to bring it home to the villagers that they had got to be regular, without making examples now and then.|$|R
