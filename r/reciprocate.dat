40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors operation under the control of Vibration-Based Diagnostics monitoring systems, dwells upon the issues of usage of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors valves by various vendors and their influence on compressors’ vibroactivity. An adequate evaluation of vibroactivity of piston machines is provided by the Russian regulative database on vibration parameters. Main differences of Russian and global methods of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors health evaluation, particularly, used frequency range, are presented in the article. It is shown that the approach laid in Russian standards on <b>reciprocating</b> compressors vibration regulations, ensures true-to-life assessment of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors assemblies and details condition. The examples given in the article confirm that the criteria of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors repair correctness assessment should be the machinery health, including its vibroactivity, not just mindless usage of new components purchased from the global brands. Practical examples of operation and monitoring of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors show that Russian developments and products, particularly, scientific-methodological and standards base of Vibration-Based Diagnostics monitoring, <b>reciprocating</b> compressors monitoring systems, <b>reciprocating</b> compressors valves are highly competitive with foreign ones, and sometimes even superior to them in parameters and characteristics, which is a positive factor under the conditions of current economic situation and import substitution policy...|$|R

50|$|The {{compression}} process occurs over approximately 2 to 2½ rotations of the crankshaft, {{compared to}} one rotation for rotary compressors, and one-half rotation for <b>reciprocating</b> compressors. The scroll discharge and suction processes occur {{for a full}} rotation, compared to less than a half-rotation for the <b>reciprocating</b> suction process, and less than a quarter-rotation for the <b>reciprocating</b> discharge process. <b>Reciprocating</b> compressor have multiple cylinders (typically, anywhere from two to six), while scroll compressors only have one compression element. The presence of multiple cylinders in <b>reciprocating</b> compressors reduces suction and discharge pulsations. Therefore, {{it is difficult to}} state whether scroll compressors have lower pulsation levels than <b>reciprocating</b> compressors as has often been claimed by some suppliers of scroll compressors. The more steady flow yields lower gas pulsations, lower sound and lower vibration of attached piping, while having no influence on the compressor operating efficiency.|$|R

Oliver pushes himself {{too far in}} an attempt to impress Greg, which earns the senior doctor a reprimand for leaving him unsupervised. Oliver tries to earn back Greg's respect, but panics while attempting to insert a chest drain, and has to be rescued by ward sister Frieda Petrenko (Olga Fedori). He invites her for a drink as thanks, but when Penny discovers that Frieda has romantic feelings for him, Oliver cancels as he does not <b>reciprocate</b> them.

5|$|The February 1852 {{death of}} Prime Minister Rainiharo left the queen without her consort, long-time {{political}} adviser and military Commander-in-Chief. She consequently awarded Rainilaiarivony a double promotion to Twelfth Honor ten days afterward, {{in preparation for}} an increase in military and political responsibilities. Shortly thereafter the queen expressed romantic interest in Rainilaiarivony and proposed that he assume the former role of his father as prince consort and Prime Minister. The young man refused on the double basis of their age difference, the queen being forty years his senior, as well as the perceived impropriety of becoming intimate with his father's former lover. Ranavalona continued to harbor feelings for him throughout her lifetime but she did not express resentment over his refusal to <b>reciprocate</b> them and went on to take another high-ranking official as consort: Rainijohary, who was jointly awarded the role of Prime Minister along with the new Commander-in-Chief, Rainivoninahitriniony.

50|$|A <b>reciprocating</b> {{electric}} motor is a motor {{in which the}} armature moves back and forth rather than circularly.

50|$|<b>Reciprocating</b> {{compressors}} {{often have}} better unloading capabilities than scroll compressors. <b>Reciprocating</b> compressors operate efficiently in unloaded mode when flow {{to some of}} the cylinders is completely cut off by internal solenoid valves. Two-stage <b>reciprocating</b> compressors are also well suited for vapor injection (or what may be called economized operation) when partially expanded flow is injected {{between the first and second}} compression stages for increased capacity and improved efficiency. While scroll compressors can also rely on vapor injection to vary the capacity, their vapor injection operation is not as efficient as for the case of <b>reciprocating</b> compressors. This inefficiency is caused by continuously changing volume of the scroll compressor compression pocket during the vapor injection process. As the volume is continuously being changed the pressure within the compression pocket is also continuously changing which adds inefficiency to the vapor injection process. In case of a two-stage <b>reciprocating</b> compressor the vapor injection takes place between the two stages, where there is no changing volume. Both scroll and <b>reciprocating</b> compressors can be unloaded from mid-stage compression, however <b>reciprocating</b> compressors are also more efficient for this mode of unloading than scroll compressors, because the unloaded port dimensions in case of scroll is limited by the internal port size, which would not be the case for a <b>reciprocating</b> compressor where unloading again occurs from between the two stages.|$|R
40|$|Background: Spinal {{cord injury}} {{patients}} walk with a flexed trunk when using <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthoses. Reduction of trunk flexion during ambulation may produce {{an improvement in}} gait parameters for <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis users. Objectives: To investigate the effect on kinematics and temporal–spatial parameters when spinal cord injury patients ambulate with an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis while wearing a thoracolumbosacral orthosis to provide trunk extension. Study design: Comparative study between before and after use o thoracolumbosacral orthosis with the advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthoses. Methods: Four patients {{with spinal cord injury}} were fitted with an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis and also wore a thoracolumbosacral orthosis. Patients walked along a flat walkway either with or without the thoracolumbosacral orthosis at their self-selected walking speed. Temporal–spatial parameters and lower limb kinematics were analyzed. Results: Mean walking speed, step length, and cadence all improved when walking with the thoracolumbosacral orthosis donned compared to the trunk support offered by the advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis. Hip and ankle joint ranges of motion were significantly increased when wearing the thoracolumbosacral orthosis during ambulation. Conclusion: Using an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis when wearing a thoracolumbosacral orthosis can improve walking speed and the step length of walking as compared with walking with an advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis, probably due to the extended position of the trunk. Clinical relevance Donning the thoracolumbosacral orthosis produced a relatively extended trunk position in the advanced <b>reciprocating</b> gait orthosis for all the patients included in the study, which resulted in improved gait parameters...|$|R
