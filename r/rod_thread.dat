40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} of the neurones of Cambarus clarkii consists, in osmium or silver preparations, {{of a number}} of small, black or dark brown bodies {{in the form of a}} <b>rod,</b> <b>thread</b> or crescent, and scattered in the cytoplasm around the nucleus. They are again made up of impregnated filaments of different calibers. There is no doubt that they correspond to the structure which was indicated as the dictyosomes by earlier authors. Observations of living neurones with phase optics reveal the occurrence of corresponding bodies in the cytoplasm which are provided with canalicules or vacuoles and darker appearing walls. The canalicules and vacuoles have been observed to represent internal cavities of the Golgi bodies. The lipochondria are granular and homogeneously black or dark brown in classical Golgi preparations. Under the phase microscope, they are slightly yellowish with a dark periphery, showing no internal cavity. The Golgi bodies are not usually stained supravitally with neutral red or methylene blue. But on prolonged staining, the walls of their canalicules or vacuoles show an affinity to the dye. The lipochondria, on the contrary, are stained quite easily and homogeneously...|$|E
40|$|A lifting fixture {{has been}} {{designed}} to handle the Samus counters. These counters are being removed from the D-zero area and will be transported off site for further use at another facility. This fixture is designed specifically for this particular application and will be transferred along with the counters. The future use of these counters may entail installation at a facility without access to a crane and therefore a lift fixture suitable for both crane and/or fork lift usage has been created The counters weigh approximately 3000 lbs. and have threaded rods extended through the counter at the top comers for lifting. When these counters were first handled/installed these rods were used in conjunction with appropriate slings and handled by crane. The rods are secured with nuts tightened against the face of the counter. The <b>rod</b> <b>thread</b> is M 16 x 2 ({approx}. 625 -inch dia.) and extends 2 -inch (on average) {{from the face of the}} counter. It is this cantilevered rod that the lift fixture engages with 'C' style plates at the four top comers. The strongback portion of the lift fixture is a steel rectangular tube 8 -inch (vertical) x 4 -inch x. 25 -inch wall, 130 -inch long. 1. 5 -inch square bars are welded perpendicular to the long axis of the rectangular tube at the appropriate lift points and the 'C' plates are fastened to these bars with 3 / 4 - 10 high strength bolts -grade 8. Two short channel sections are positioned-welded-to the bottom of the rectangular tube on 40 feet centers, which are used as locators for fork lift tines. On the top are lifting eyes for sling/crane usage and are rated at 3500 lbs. safe working load each - vertical lift only...|$|E
30|$|There are two {{different}} failure modes (<b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture and <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> pullout fracture) for glued-in rods on connection strength of bamboo glulam. In <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture mode, rod necking and tensile fracture of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> also were found. However, in <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> pullout fracture mode, interface shear failure of the bamboo glulam around the anchoring zone of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> happened. The mechanical performances and the failure modes of the glued-in rod materials are mainly influenced by the inherent base materials.|$|R
30|$|When {{the rods}} {{were in the}} same {{slenderness}} ratio λ but different <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameters d, the influence of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameter d on peak load was analyzed. As Fig.  3 showed that the peak load increased with <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameters. When λ =  5, as <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> diameters increasing, the failure mode of three series samples (M 8, M 12, M 16) changed from <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture to pull out fracture. However, when λ ≥  10, the failure mode of three series samples (M 8, M 12, M 16) was same which was <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> tensile fracture (Table  1). Therefore, to satisfy the utilization of glued <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> connection bamboo glulam in engineering and structure, λ ≥  10 was very necessary.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} explore bamboo glulam {{utilization}} in structure construction, the adhesive bonded steel connection of bamboo glulam {{was investigated in}} this study. By carrying out both-end pullout tests on glued-in <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> in bamboo glulam, the effects of depth and diameter of embedded rods in bamboo glulam on the pullout strength and the failure modes were discussed. Results showed that <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> fracture and adhesive interface failure were the two main different failure modes in the tests. The pullout peak load of both-end glued-in rods in bamboo glulam increased with the diameter and the embedded length of the <b>threaded</b> <b>rods.</b> To satisfy tensile load of the glued <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> (quality 4.8) used in the connections between engineering structural materials, the slenderness ratio (λ, the ratio of depth and diameter of glued-in <b>threaded</b> <b>rods)</b> equal to 10 or over was necessary.|$|R

40|$|Threaded {{connections}} are responsible assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in <b>rod</b> body and <b>threaded</b> connections. In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker <b>rods</b> <b>threaded</b> joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker <b>rods</b> <b>threaded</b> connections using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard threaded connections with a diameter of 19 mm have been created. Screw connections were loaded by axial force and torque make-up. Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in pin thread becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the threaded connection durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the thread coupling, resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|R

40|$|Following {{recent studies}} on the fatigue {{behaviour}} of noise barriers for high speed railways for train transits, <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> bonded with epoxy resin for column base plate anchorage had to be qualified.

40|$|Abstract Background Retraction, atrophy and fatty {{infiltration}} {{are signs}} subsequent to chronic rotator cuff tendon tears. They {{are associated with}} an increased pennation angle and a shortening of the muscle fibers in series. These deleterious changes of the muscular architecture are not reversible with current repair techniques and are the main factors for failed rotator cuff tendon repair. Whereas fast stretching of the retracted musculotendinous unit results in proliferation of non-contractile fibrous tissue, slow stretching may lead to muscle regeneration in terms of sarcomerogenesis. To slowly stretch the retracted musculotendinous unit in a sheep model, two here described tensioning devices have been developed and mounted on the scapular spine of the sheep using an expandable <b>threaded</b> <b>rod,</b> which has been interposed between the retracted tendon end and the original insertion site at the humeral head. Traction is transmitted in line with the musculotendinous unit by sutures knotted on the expandable <b>threaded</b> <b>rod.</b> The <b>threaded</b> <b>rod</b> of the tensioner is driven within the body through a rotating axis, which enters the body on the opposite side. The tendon end, which was previously released (16 [*]weeks prior) from its insertion site with a bone chip, was elongated with a velocity of 1 [*]mm/day. Results After several steps of technical improvements, the tensioner proved to be capable of actively stretching the retracted and degenerated muscle back to the original length and to withstand the external forces acting on it. Conclusion This technical report describes the experimental technique for continuous elongation of the musculotendinous unit and reversion of the length of chronically shortened muscle. </p...|$|R
