5|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} to purify DNA from organisms, such as phenol-chloroform extraction, and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as restriction digests and the polymerase chain reaction. Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in <b>recombinant</b> DNA technology. <b>Recombinant</b> DNA is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as <b>recombinant</b> proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of <b>recombinant</b> DNA techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the <b>recombinant</b> techniques.|$|E
5|$|Wary of the {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility of a}} prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on <b>recombinant</b> DNA research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on <b>Recombinant</b> DNA created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.|$|E
40|$|Influenza A virus <b>recombinants</b> {{derived from}} "resistant" and "sensitive" parental viruses were {{examined}} for susceptibility to inhibition by amantadine.

All amantadine-sensitive <b>recombinants</b> derived an M gene from the amantadine-sensitive parent.

40|$|High-frequency {{recombination}} is {{a hallmark}} of HIV- 1 replication. Recombination can occur between {{two members of the}} same subtype or between viruses from two different subtypes, generating intra- or intersubtype <b>recombinants,</b> respectively. Many intersubtype <b>recombinants</b> have been shown to circulate in human populations. We hypothesize that sequence diversity affects the emergence of viable <b>recombinants</b> by decreasing recombination events and reducing the ability of the <b>recombinants</b> to replicate. To test our hypothesis, we compared recombination between two viruses containing subtype B pol genes (B/B) and between viruses with pol genes from subtype B or F (B/F). Recombination events generated during a single cycle of infection without selection pressure on pol gene function were analyzed by single-genome sequencing. We found that recombination occurred slightly (∼ 30 %) less frequently in B/F than in B/B viruses, and the overall distribution of crossover junctions in pol was similar for the two classes of <b>recombinants.</b> We then examined the emergence of <b>recombinants</b> in a multiple cycle assay, so that functional pol gene products were selected. We found that the emerging B/B <b>recombinants</b> had complex patterns, and the crossover junctions were distributed throughout the pol gene. In contrast, selected B/F <b>recombinants</b> had limited recombination patterns and restricted crossover junction distribution. These results provide evidence for the evolved coadapted sites in variants from different subtypes; these sites may be segregated by recombination events, causing the newly generated intersubtype <b>recombinants</b> to undergo purifying selection. Therefore, the ability of the <b>recombinants</b> to replicate is the major barrier for many of these viruses...|$|R
40|$|For a fully {{penetrant}} trait, apparent <b>recombinants</b> {{between the}} trait and marker loci {{result in an}} estimate of the recombination fraction θ > 0. Given allowance for reduced penetrance and/or sporadic cases, this no longer need be true. In this short communication, we describe conditions under which θ is estimated to be zero despite the presence of apparent <b>recombinants.</b> We demonstrate that even if a large proportion of unaffected individuals are apparent <b>recombinants</b> and the penetrance is moderately high, the lod score may be maximized at θ = 0. Despite maximization at θ = 0, presence of apparent <b>recombinants</b> reduces the maximum lod score in comparison to its value if no apparent <b>recombinants</b> are present. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{recombination}} {{between a}} nontandem duplication of two partially deleted lactose operons (lacMS 286 phi 80 dIIlacBK 1) in Escherichia coli K- 12 has been examined. Since the deletions were nonoverlapping, rare lactose-fermenting (Lac+) <b>recombinants</b> occurred and were detected qualitatively on lactose tetrazolium agar indicator plates as white papillae {{growing on the}} surface of red colonies or quantitively on lactose minimal agar plates. Formation of Lac+ <b>recombinants</b> required the recA, recB, and recC gene products. Indirect suppression of recB 21 by sbcB 15 led to an increase in the frequency of Lac+ <b>recombinants</b> over wild-type levels. recF 143 did not appreciably alter the number of Lac+ progeny, whereas recL 152 and sbcB 15 strains yielded increased numbers of Lac+ <b>recombinants.</b> The nature and formation of Lac+ <b>recombinants</b> was also examined.

40|$|We are {{reporting}} the physical location of parental DNA sequences in 28 <b>recombinants</b> produced by crossing herpes simplex viruses (HSV) 1 and 2. The parental crosses were of two kinds.

The DNAs of the <b>recombinants</b> were mapped with XbaI, EcoRI, HpaI, HsuI, BglII, and, in some instances, KpnI restriction endonucleases. The results were as follows. (i) We established the colinear arrangements of HSV- 1 and HSV- 2 DNAs. (ii) There was extensive interchange of genomic regions, ranging from the exchange or the entire L of S component of HSV DNA to substitutions of regions within the same component. In some <b>recombinants,</b> the reiterated sequences ab and ac bracketing the L and S components of HSV DNA were heterotypic. Most <b>recombinants</b> grew well and showed no obvious defects.

(v) As previously reported, HSV DNA consists of four populations, differing in relative orientation of the L and S components.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A current {{paradigm}} for visual function {{centers on the}} metarhodopsin I (MI) to metarhodopsin I 1 (MII) conformational transition as the trigger for an intracellular enzyme cascade leading to excitation of the retinal rod. We investigated the influences of the membrane lipid composition on this key triggering event in visual signal transduction using flash photolysis techniques. Bovine rhodopsin was combined with various phospholipids to form membrane <b>recombinants</b> in which the lipid acyl chain composition was held constant at that of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), while {{the identity of the}} lipid headgroups was varied. The ratio of MII/MI produced in these <b>recombinants</b> by an actinic flash at 28 OC was studied as a function of pH. The results were compared to the photochemical function observed for rhodopsin in native retinal rod outer segment (ROS) membranes, in total native ROS lipid <b>recombinants,</b> and in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) <b>recombinants.</b> In membrane <b>recombinants</b> incorporating lipids derived from egg PC, {{as well as in the}} total ROS lipids control and the native ROS disk membranes, MI and MI 1 were found to coexist in a pH-dependent, acid-base equilibrium on the millisecond time scale. The <b>recombinants</b> of rhodopsin with egg PC, either alone or in combination with egg PC-derived phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) or phosphatidylserine (PS), exhibited substantially reduced photochemical activity at pH 7. 0.

40|$|One-ended {{transposition}} of Tn 21 generates <b>recombinants</b> usually {{containing a}} whole {{copy of the}} donor replicon plus a short duplication of it (S. Mötsch, R. Schmitt, P.

This work shows that <b>recombinants</b> containing less than a whole copy of the donor replicon (hereafter called short <b>recombinants)</b> could also be detected when plasmid donors which contained two selectable genetic markers were used. Short <b>recombinants</b> were produced at the same frequency from TnpR+ donor molecules as from TnpR- donor molecules in a RecA- background. Therefore, they were not resolution products of larger <b>recombinants.</b> This result invalidates a previous hypothesis to explain one-ended transposition, that is, that one-ended transposition arises {{from the use of}} secondary ends by the transposition apparatus.

40|$|Recent studies {{led to the}} {{proposal}} that meiotic gene conversion can result after transient engagement of the donor chromatid and subsequent DNA synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA). Double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates were previously proposed to form both reciprocal crossover <b>recombinants</b> (COs) and noncrossover <b>recombinants</b> (NCOs); however, dHJs are now thought to give rise mainly to COs, with SDSA forming most or all NCOs.

Thus, a total of 89 isolates of worldwide origin was analysed for <b>recombinants.</b> Eighteen recombination sites were found spaced throughout the 59 two-thirds of the genome, but {{there were only two}} in the 39 one-third; thus, 24 and 35 % of the P 1 and NIa-VPg gene sequences examined were <b>recombinants,</b> whereas only 1 % of the corresponding NIa-Pro and CP gene sequenceswere <b>recombinants.</b> <b>Recombinants</b> with parents from the same or fromdifferent lineages were found, and some recombination sites characterized particular lineages.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the nature of this dermal influence on epidermal maintenance. Epidermis was well maintained in epidermal <b>recombinants</b> with tendon, tendon sheath and fascia.
