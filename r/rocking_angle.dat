Unfortunately, it is not so easy to measure directly these phase variations in a conventional scattering experiment. It was recently suggested that the transmitted phase can be directly measured in ptychography experiments performed on nanocrystal samples. Results of such experiment for different crystal thickness, reflections and incoming photon energies, in principle, can be fully described in the frame of dynamical theory. However, dynamical theory does not provide a simple analytical expression for the further analysis.

Chemical rate constants are evaluated (by varying the diffusion layer thickness) employing the DigiElch 4. F simulation package.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the polarization evolution and dispersive {{properties of the}} eigenmodes of birefringent media with arbitrarily twisted axes of birefringence. Analytical and numerical methods based on a transfer matrix approach are developed and used to study specifically helically twisted structures and the Bloch modes of periodically twisted media, as represented in particular by structural "rocking" filters inscribed in highly birefringent photonic crystal fibers. The presence of periodically twisted birefringence axes causes the group velocity dispersion curves to separate strongly {{from each other in}} the vicinity of the anti-crossing wavelength, where the inter-polarization beat-length equals an integer multiple of the rocking period. The maximum separation between these curves and the bandwidth of the splitting depend on the amplitude of the <b>rocking</b> <b>angle.</b> We also show that suitably designed adiabatic transitions, formed by chirping the rocking period, allow a broadband conversion between a linearly polarized fiber eigenmode and a single Bloch mode of a uniform rocking filter. The widely controllable dispersive properties provided by rocking filters may be useful for manipulating the phase-matching conditions in nonlinear optical processes such as four-wave mixing, supercontinuum generation, and the generation of resonant radiation from solitons.

40|$|A two-straight-legged walking {{mechanism}} {{with flat}} feet is {{designed and built}} to study the passive dynamic gait. It is shown that the mechanism having flat feet can exhibit passive dynamic walking as those with curved feet, but the walking efficiency is significantly lower. It is also shown that the balancing mass and its orientation are etfective for controlling side-to-side rocking and yaw, which have significant effects on steady walking. The effects of various parameters on the gait patterns are also studied. lt is shown that changes in the ramp angle have the most dominant effect on the gait pattern {{as compared with the}} changes in the hip mass, ramp surface friction and size of the flat feet. More specifically, as the ramp angle increases, the step length increases while the range of the side-to side <b>rocking</b> <b>angle</b> decreases and the step length dictates the walking speed and the gravitational power Another finding, is that adding a hip mass improves the walking efficiency by allowing the mechanism to walk on a flatter ramp.

40|$|International audienceCollection of {{selected}} area channeling patterns (SACPs) {{on a high}} resolution FEG-SEM is essential to carry out quantitative electron channeling contrast imaging (ECCI) studies, as it facilitates accurate determination of the crystal plane normal {{with respect to the}} incident beam direction and thus allows control the electron channeling conditions. Unfortunately commercial SACP modes developed in the past were limited in spatial resolution and are often no longer offered. In this contribution we present a novel approach for collecting high resolution SACPs (HR-SACPs) developed on a Gemini column. This HR-SACP technique combines the first demonstrated sub-micron spatial resolution with high angular accuracy of about 0. 1 degrees, at a convenient working distance of 10 mm. This innovative approach integrates the use of aperture alignment coils to rock the beam with a digitally calibrated beam shift procedure to ensure the rocking beam is maintained on a point of interest. Moreover a new methodology to accurately measure SACP spatial resolution is proposed. While column considerations limit the <b>rocking</b> <b>angle</b> to 4, this range is adequate to index the HR-SACP in conjunction with the pattern simulated from the approximate orientation deduced by EBSD. This new technique facilitates Accurate ECU (A-ECCI) studies from very line grained and/or highly strained materials.

40|$|International audienceGaP, quasi-lattice {{matched to}} Si, allows growth of low defect density III-V/Si pseudosubstrates [1]. However, Antiphase {{boundaries}} (APB) likely appear {{and must be}} avoided. In this context, X-ray nanodiffraction and Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) {{have been used as}} non-destructive techniques for local characterization of APB configuration [2]. Different GaP/Si nanolayers were studied at ID 01 /ESRF with an 8 keV coherent xray beam. Here a 140 nm thick GaP presents annihilated APB (less than 3 /m emerging APB). Bragg geometry ptychography of the APB has been attempted using (002) GaP weak reflection. This shows a peak splitting, characteristic of a heterogeneous APB density. But a still too high defect density precludes successful phase retrieval imaging. Two-dimensional fast mapping (kmap) [3] over the (004) and the (002) reflections shows for different regions of integrated intensities (ROI) (Fig. 1 a) weak (Bragg maximum - 0. 5 ° on <b>rocking</b> <b>angle)</b> and strong scattering conditions (Fig. 1 b and 1 c respectively). As shown fig. 1 b), the weak scattered intensity in ROI 1, exhibits contrast lines oriented along both [1 1 0] and [- 1 1 0] crystallographic directions. This contrast corresponds to regions of high tilt, surrounding misfit dislocations [3]. Strong scattering conditions performed on the (004) (Fig. 1 c) and the (002) Bragg reflections present a quite different contrast with large spotty regions. We believe that this anisotropic contrast is due to weak tilt/strain, associated to the APD annihilation process. 1. Y. P. Wang et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 107, 191603 (2015). 2. S.

And the evolvement of forebody vortices with angle of attack should be responsible for the sinusoid like motion. Firstly, the wing rock is triggered by forebody asymmetric vortices at moderate angle of attack (about 30 °). Secondly, the variation of forebody asymmetric vortices with angle of attack sustains the wing <b>rock</b> during <b>angle</b> of attack 30 °∼ 60 °.
