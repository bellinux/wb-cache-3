5|$|British colonial {{secretary}} Lord Hillsborough, {{hoping to}} prevent {{a repeat of the}} Stamp Act Congress, instructed the colonial governors in America to dissolve the assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also directed Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to have the Massachusetts House <b>rescind</b> the letter. On June 30, the House refused to <b>rescind</b> the letter by a vote of 92 to 17, with Adams citing their right to petition as justification. Far from complying with the governor's order, Adams instead presented a new petition to the king asking that Governor Bernard be removed from office. Bernard responded by dissolving the legislature.|$|E
5|$|In Great Britain, Lord Hillsborough, who had {{recently}} been appointed to the newly created office of Colonial Secretary, was alarmed {{by the actions of}} the Massachusetts House. In April 1768 he {{sent a letter to the}} colonial governors in America, instructing them to dissolve the colonial assemblies if they responded to the Massachusetts Circular Letter. He also ordered Massachusetts Governor Francis Bernard to direct the Massachusetts House to <b>rescind</b> the letter. The house refused to comply.|$|E
5|$|In Star Wars and History {{published}} by Lucasfilm, it describes Palpatine's consolidation of power as being {{similar to the}} Roman political figure Augustus, named Octavian before renaming himself. Both legitimized authoritarian rule by saying that corruption in the Senate was hampering {{the powers of the}} head of state; both pressured the Senate to grant extraordinary powers to deal with a crisis, falsely claiming that they would <b>rescind</b> those powers once the crisis was over; and both relied on their strong control over military force.|$|E

5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to <b>rescind</b> the death penalty, with the same three-judge panel convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.|$|E
5|$|Akane and Kogami arrest Makishima but he escapes. Akane is {{disappointed}} when Kogami leaves {{the police force}} to hunt him alone. Akane soon discovers {{that members of the}} Sibyl System, a private organization that manages the Psycho-Pass technology, want to use her to capture Makishima alive. Akane agrees on the condition they <b>rescind</b> their orders to kill the defecting Kogami. Despite her efforts, Akane fails to stop Kogami from killing Makishima. The Sibyl System members allow her to live on condition she does not reveal the truth about them. In the epilogue, Akane becomes the de facto leader of Unit One; she is seen briefing a newly recruited Inspector in the finale of season one.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{candidate}} and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch)—whose campaign platform includes {{the elimination of}} funding for school arts programs—editorializes on television to <b>rescind</b> {{the budget of the}} school's production of West Side Story. She succeeds after an angry mother throws a brick at Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). Glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) recruits the members to sell advertising space in the program book to raise money; when Kurt (Chris Colfer) asks his father Burt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) to purchase an ad, he instead gathers a group of businessmen to fund the musical. He then announces that he is running for congress against Sue.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 25 {{academic}} institutions have <b>rescinded</b> honorary degrees they awarded to Cosby. Most of them cited Cosby's 2005 depostion. Several {{of these institutions}} had never <b>rescinded</b> an honorary degree before, or only once before.|$|R

50|$|The {{policy is}} a {{political}} flashpoint in the abortion debate, with Republican administrations adopting it and Democratic administrations <b>rescinding</b> it. The policy was enacted by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1984, <b>rescinded</b> by Democratic President Bill Clinton in January 1993, re-instituted in January 2001 as Republican President George W. Bush took office, <b>rescinded</b> on January 23, 2009, as Democratic President Barack Obama took office and reinstated on January 23, 2017, as Republican President Donald Trump assumed the office.|$|R
5|$|From 1993 to 1996, Apple {{developed}} a marketing strategy that promised free and unlimited live-telephone support on certain products {{for as long}} as the original purchaser owned those products; by 1997, however, changes in Apple's AppleCare support policy led Apple to <b>rescind</b> the offer, resulting in a consumer class action lawsuit for breach of contract. Apple denied wrongdoing but, in settlement of the claims, Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected by the change were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support, had been charged per incident, or had incurred third party support charges.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{was furious}} over {{the failure to}} destroy the convoy, and ordered that all {{remaining}} German major warships be broken up for scrap. In protest, Raeder resigned; Hitler replaced him with Admiral Karl Dönitz, who persuaded Hitler to <b>rescind</b> the order to dismantle the Kriegsmarine's surface ships. In March, Lützow moved to Altafjord, where she experienced problems with her diesel engines. The propulsion system proved to be so problematic that repairs in Germany were necessary. She briefly returned to Norway, {{but by the end}} of September 1943, a thorough overhaul was required. The work was completed in Kiel by January 1944, after which she remained in the Baltic Sea to conduct training cruises for new naval personnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{months prior}} to the settlement, Seattle {{publicly}} released email conversations that took place within Bennett's ownership group alleging they indicated that some members of the group had a desire to move the team to Oklahoma City prior to its purchase in 2006. The city used these conversations to argue that ownership failed to negotiate in good faith and as a result, Schultz filed a lawsuit seeking to <b>rescind</b> the sale of the team and transfer the ownership to a court-appointed receiver. The NBA claimed the lawsuit was void because Schultz signed a release forbidding himself to sue Bennett's group but also argued that the proposal would have violated league ownership rules. Schultz dropped the case {{before the start of the}} 2008–09 NBA season.|$|E

5|$|After this success, which {{secured the}} Balkans, Maurice {{intended}} to consolidate Roman control {{by bringing in}} Armenian settlers who would be given land in exchange for military service. To this end, Priscus was sent to Armenia to recruit men and their families. His mission there, however, {{was interrupted by a}} large-scale military revolt that brought about the downfall of Maurice. In 602, Maurice again ordered his troops on the Danube frontier to winter north of the river. Again, this provoked widespread discontent, and when Peter, who had replaced Priscus, refused to bow down and <b>rescind</b> the order, an outright mutiny broke out. The army chose the officer Phocas as its new leader and marched down to Constantinople. Without any credible military forces of his own, Maurice had to flee, but was captured with his family and executed by Phocas, who now became emperor.|$|E
5|$|Becket excommunicated both de Brocs {{again on}} Christmas Day, 1170. On 28 December 1170, de Broc {{received}} at Saltwood Castle four knights– William de Tracy, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, and Richard le Breton– {{who had arrived}} from the continent. The five men conceived a plan to surround Canterbury Cathedral and force Becket to <b>rescind</b> his excommunications. On 29 December 1170, the five men arrived at Canterbury, where it appears that de Broc {{was in charge of}} the soldiers surrounding the cathedral while the other four went inside to negotiate with the archbishop. The four did not succeed in persuading the archbishop and the situation degenerated into the four men murdering Becket at one of the altars of the cathedral. After this, the four rejoined de Broc and searched the archiepiscopal residence for papers and other documents that de Broc was to send to the king. The party then returned to Saltwood.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the new Constitution, the 2009 general election was called. The opposition sought to delay the election by demanding a new biometric registry system, hoping that it would give them time to form a united front against MAS. Many MAS activists reacted violently against the demands, and attempting to prevent this. Morales went on a five-day hunger strike in April 2009 to push the opposition to <b>rescind</b> their demands. He also agreed to allow for the introduction of a new voter registry, but insisted that it was rushed through so as not to delay the election. Morales and the MAS won with a landslide majority, polling 64.2%, while voter participation had reached an all-time high of 90%. His primary opponent, Reyes Villa, gained 27% of the vote. The MAS won a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Morales notably increased his support in the east of the country, with MAS gaining a majority in Tarija.|$|E

The parole board then held a hearing and eventually <b>rescinded</b> Powell's release date.|$|R
5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided to <b>rescind</b> their promise to nominate him as Secretary of State because {{they want him to}} remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s education reform agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if he will continue to be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his statement to the contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which he shares with his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, the Clean Water Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E
5|$|General-in-Chief He Jin (d.189 AD), {{half-brother}} to Empress He (d. 189 AD), plotted with Yuan Shao (d.202 AD) {{to overthrow}} the eunuchs by having several generals march {{to the outskirts of}} the capital. There, in a written petition to Empress He, they demanded the eunuchs' execution. After a period of hesitation, Empress He consented. When the eunuchs discovered this, however, they had her brother He Miao (何苗) <b>rescind</b> the order. The eunuchs assassinated He Jin on September 22, 189 AD. Yuan Shao then besieged Luoyang's Northern Palace while his brother Yuan Shu (d.199 AD) besieged the Southern Palace. On September 25 both palaces were breached and approximately two thousand eunuchs were killed. Zhang Rang had previously fled with Emperor Shao (r.189 AD) and his brother Liu Xie—the future Emperor Xian of Han (r. 189–220 AD). While being pursued by the Yuan brothers, Zhang committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, the Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Jakob Sundevall {{moved the}} bluebuck and its closest relatives to the genus Hippotragus; he had originally named this genus for the roan antelope (H. equinus) in 1845. This revision was commonly accepted by other writers, {{such as the}} British zoologists Philip Sclater and Oldfield Thomas, who restricted the genus Antilope to the blackbuck (A. cervicapra) in 1899. In 1914, the name Hippotragus was submitted for conservation (so older, unused genus names could be suppressed) to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) with the bluebuck as type species. However, the original 1845 naming of the genus with the roan antelope as single species was overlooked and later suppressed by the ICZN, leading to some taxonomic confusion. In 2001, the British ecologist Peter J. Grubb proposed that the ICZN should <b>rescind</b> its suppression of the 1845 naming and make the roan antelope the type species of Hippotragus, since too {{little is known about}} the bluebuck for it to be a reliable type species. This was accepted by the commission in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In 1975, the Jones Beach Parkway Authority {{raised the}} {{toll on the}} Southern State Parkway from to 25cents, while the Loop Parkway {{retained}} its 25cent toll. The change faced immediate criticism from the New York State Legislature, and the Democratic members tried to <b>rescind</b> the toll hike. The power Robert Moses still had in {{a deal with the}} State of New York made sure that only his authority could choose when to raise and rollback tolls. However, the deals never prohibited the state from buying out the bonds the authority had themselves and thus take over the roads maintained by the Jones Beach Parkway Authority. Governor Hugh Carey had yet to craft the $12billion state budget for 1978, and he proposed a deal to forgo the $24 million (1978USD) debt that the agency had accumulated and eliminate the toll on the Loop Parkway by taking over the roads.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed gangs, and agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This was more of a triumph for the senate than it was for Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept that the senate decided to override him, and <b>rescind</b> the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced a renewal of the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.|$|E
5|$|Reaction in the U.S. Congress to the {{incursion}} {{was also}} swift. Senators Frank F. Church (Democratic Party, Idaho) and John S. Cooper (Republican Party, Kentucky), proposed {{an amendment to}} the Foreign Military Sales Act that would have cut off funding not only for U.S. ground operations and advisors in Cambodia, but would also have ended U.S. air support for Cambodian forces. On 30 June the United States Senate passed the act with the amendment included. The bill was defeated in the House of Representatives after U.S. forces were withdrawn from Cambodia as scheduled. The newly amended act did, however, <b>rescind</b> the Southeast Asia Resolution (better known as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution) under which Presidents Johnson and Nixon had conducted military operations for seven years without a declaration of war.|$|E
