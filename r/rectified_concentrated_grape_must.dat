50|$|The most {{commonly}} found six Lambrusco varieties are Lambrusco Grasparossa, Lambrusco Maestri, Lambrusco Marani, Lambrusco Montericco, Lambrusco Salamino, and Lambrusco Sorbara. All of these various Lambrusco grapes are indigenous to Emilia and neither clones nor sub-clones. Most Lambruscos {{are made from}} more than one Lambrusco variety and additionally often blended with a number of specific blending grapes (max. 15%), such as Ancellotta (for color), Marzemino, Malbo Gentile, Cabernet Sauvignon (for body and structure), and others. The grape vines are often trained high above the ground to prevent the development of mildew. Historically the vines were trained to climb up poplar trees. The grape itself is not particularly sweet but many of the commercial Lambrusco versions are sweetened by either partial fermentation or with the addition of <b>rectified</b> <b>concentrated</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> When not fermented sweet, the Lambrusco grape is capable of producing an excellent dry wine with strawberry notes and a slight bitter finish.|$|E

5000|$|Ice wine (or icewine; Eiswein) {{is a type}} of {{dessert wine}} {{produced}} from grapes that have been frozen while still on the vine. The sugars and other dissolved solids do not freeze, but the water does, allowing a more <b>concentrated</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> to be pressed from the frozen grapes, resulting in a smaller amount of more concentrated, very sweet wine. With ice wines, the freezing happens before the fermentation, not afterwards. Unlike the grapes from which other dessert wines are made, such as Sauternes, Tokaji, or Trockenbeerenauslese, ice wine grapes should not be affected by Botrytis cinerea or noble rot, at least not to any great degree. Only healthy grapes keep in good shape until the opportunity arises for an ice wine harvest, which in extreme cases can occur after the New Year, on a northern hemisphere calendar. This gives ice wine its characteristic refreshing sweetness balanced by high acidity. When the grapes are free of Botrytis, they are said to come in [...] "clean".|$|R

40|$|Since 1994 Argentinean {{government}} {{implemented the}} diversification policy to reduce wine {{supply in the}} domestic market and stabilize prices through reducing the share of grapes allocated for wine production in favour of must production. The policy has set a minimum percentage of <b>grapes</b> for <b>concentrated</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> (CGM) production for every wine maker. The research aims to investigate {{the effects of the}} policy on the sector applying spatial equilibrium analysis, based on the model of Interregional Trade of Wine products in Argentina. The qualitative analysis of the sector under the current policy revealed, that the policy had a) no impact on the grape segment, b) a slight positive impact on <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> production due to 14 % increased grapes reallocated from wine sector, and c) an expected but modest 20 % decrease of wine production. The anticipated increase of wine and grapes prices was not observed. Moreover the policy affects largely the optimal recourse allocation process, because it encourages CGM production among others also in those regions, which have non favourable agro-climatic conditions for CGM production. The advantageous development of CGM segment benefiting from “infant industry argument” of the policy is although a positive outcome, on the long run it will cause stagnation and discourage investments for advanced technologies. The elimination of the diversification policy will ensure the competitive development of this emerging industry. spatial equilibrium analysis, infant industry argument, Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

30|$|<b>Grape</b> <b>must</b> is {{a complex}} {{chemical}} matrix that depends on grape variety, ripeness stage, terroir characteristics, climate, and viticultural factors (Ribereau-Gayon et al.

While transforming <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> into wine, yeast converts sugars to ethanol and produces various other compounds, which add new degrees of complexity and variability to the original matrix (Lambrechts and Pretorius [2000]). The use of natural <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> (NGM) in the laboratory under simulated enological conditions is the best experimental approach and most precise way to study how wine yeast cope with stress conditions in the winery environment (Rossouw et al.

Metals of special oenological and food safety importance (Al, Co, Cu, Cd, Pb) were used as model elements to achieve the optimum working conditions. The study was conducted by monitoring their concentration in experimental samples by ETAAS. Different combinations of HNO 3 and H 2 O 2 were tested and an optimal volume of 1 mL of each reagent, added to 2 mL of sample, was selected for further studies. In comparison with experimental conditions described in literature for the mineralization of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and wine by HPMW, the proposed procedure requires very low reagent consumption. Time and temperature were regarded as factors in the optimization study of microwave oven program, resulting in 72 minutes of extension including ventilation.

Troubles about their isolation and cultivation in laboratory media has been well reported. The viable but not cultivable state seems mainly influenced by environmental stress conditions and current isolation methods allow to access only a small subset of AAB population. Also the handling and preservation of strains isolated from high selective sources is still a hard practice. Among vinegars, traditional balsamic vinegar is made through cooking the <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> in which spontaneous alcoholic fermentation and acetic oxidation take place, then it is aged to be bottled. Cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> is characterized by very low pH and high sugars content. In previous works we observed high selective pressure of cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> on AAB growth and the loss of strains viability under laboratory conditions. Moreover culture independent studies by PCR/DGGE, highlighted that only easier cultivable strains are isolated from cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> by conventional culture-dependent methods. In this study AAB strains were isolated from cooked <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> by plating system using three isolation media, molecular characterized by PCR/RFLP analysis and partial sequencing of rDNA region. To test the ability to carry out the oxidation process in high selective substrates, cooked <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> wine and “Passmore and Carr” medium, with different pH, titrable acidity, soluble solids and ethanol content, were used as substrates.

In this study we investigated the antioxidant properties of TBV in relation to its content in phenolic compounds, polymeric tannins and Maillard reaction products (MRPs). Results show that TBV has a high antioxidant activity measured with both FRAP and ABTS assay that is higher or equal to those obtained in some red wine. About 45 % of the antioxidant activity of TBV {{is due to the}} total polyphenolic fraction. Among polyphenols, tannins contribute to about 50 % of the antioxidant activity of the total polyphenolic fraction. The residual antioxidant activity of TBV is due to the melanoidins (about 45 %) synthesized during the boiling of the must and the ageing of TBV and to other compounds such as low molecular weight MRPs. When we investigated the effect of heating on the browning and on the formation of antioxidant MRPs in must model systems we observed a major formation of antioxidant MRPs for the model system containing both amino acids and sugars with respect to the model system containing only sugars. We also tested the effect of some representative phenolic compounds present in must. Only polyphenols were stable in the model solution, however, in our experimental conditions they did not influence the browning and the formation of MRPs.

Six <b>grape</b> <b>musts,</b> with different nitrogen composition, from cultivars of the ‘Vinhos Verdes’ Region, in Portugal, were used. Addition of methionine to <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> enhanced the content of wines in 3 -(methylthio) - 1 -propanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester, 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid and some unidentified sulphur compounds. Increase of cysteine concentration in musts led to the production of wines with high levels of hydrogen sulphide and cis- 2 -methyltetrahydrothiophene- 3 -OL and also unidentified sulphur compounds; however, the content of 3 -(methylthio) propionic acid in the wines decreased considerately with the addition of cysteine to <b>grape</b> <b>musts.</b> This work showed that cultivars from the Vinho Verde Region show different sulphur compound contents. Avesso wines, elaborated from <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> with low amino acids level, presented the highest total sulphur compounds content.
