5000|$|<b>Rain</b> <b>Repellent</b> - This is {{made for}} car {{windshield}} for repelling rain water during rain {{in order to improve}} driving visibility.|$|E
5000|$|Aquapel is a <b>rain</b> <b>repellent</b> glass {{treatment}} {{created by}} PPG Industries. It is a competitor {{to the more}} widely known Rain-X product, but unlike Rain-X, is not a silicone-based compound. Aquapel Glass Treatment consists of fluorinated compounds which create a chemical bond with glass surfaces, causing water to bead up and roll off. Because of this chemical bond with glass, Aquapel is reported to last much longer than silicone-based rain repellents. Aquapel has gained popularity in microfluidic based biochemistry, specifically the Drop-Seq method pioneered by the McCarroll lab at Harvard.|$|E

5000|$|During the Vietnam War, ASD set up {{a special}} {{division}} called Limited War/Special Air Warfare {{to respond to the}} special requirements dictated by the conflict. Part of this concept was [...] "Project 1559" [...] which provided a means for rapidly evaluating new hardware ideas to determine their usefulness for conducting limited war. Support systems included a highly mobile tactical air control system, disposable parachutes, intrusion alarms for air base defense, and a grenade launcher for the AR-15 rifle. In response to the unique climate found in Southeast Asia ASD an evaluation of chemical <b>rain</b> <b>repellents</b> for fighter aircraft and discovered that varieties of repellant applied to cockpit windshields on the ground prior to the flight had a long life and could last several hours, even days.|$|R
