25|$|The {{formulae}} in {{the previous}} sections give the auxiliary latitude {{in terms of the}} geodetic latitude. The expressions for the geocentric and <b>reduced</b> <b>latitudes</b> may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases: the rectifying, authalic, conformal, and isometric latitudes. There are two methods of proceeding. The first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude. The methods available are fixed-point iteration and Newton–Raphson root finding. The other, more useful, approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of Lagrange reversion. Such series are presented by Adams who uses Taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity. Osborne derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package Maxima and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening. The series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate step.|$|R

50|$|Vincenty's {{goal was}} to express {{existing}} algorithms for geodesics on an ellipsoid {{in a form that}} minimized the program length (see the first sentence of his paper). His unpublished report (1975b) mentions the use of a Wang 720 desk calculator, which had only a few kilobytes of memory. To obtain good accuracy for long lines, the solution uses the classical solution of Legendre (1806), Bessel (1825), and Helmert (1880) based on the auxiliary sphere. (Vincenty relied on formulation of this method given by Rainsford, 1955.) Legendre showed that an ellipsoidal geodesic can be exactly mapped to a great circle on the auxiliary sphere by mapping the geographic latitude to <b>reduced</b> <b>latitude</b> and setting the azimuth of the great circle equal to that of the geodesic. The longitude on the ellipsoid and the distance along the geodesic are then given in terms of the longitude on the sphere and the arc length along the great circle by simple integrals. Bessel and Helmert gave rapidly converging series for these integrals, which allow the geodesic to be computed with arbitrary accuracy.|$|E

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of numerical integration, we solve {{the direct and}} inverse geodetic problems on the ellipsoid. In general, the solutions are composed of a strict solution for the sphere plus a correction to the ellipsoid determined by numerical integration. Primarily the solutions are integrals along the geodesic {{with respect to the}} <b>reduced</b> <b>latitude</b> or azimuth, but these techniques either have problems when the integral passes a vertex (i. e., point with maximum/minimum latitude of the arc) or a singularity at the equator. These problems are eliminated when using Bessel's idea of integration along the geocentric angle of the great circle of an auxiliary sphere. Hence, this is the preferred method. The solutions are validated by some numerical comparisons to Vincenty's iterative formulas, showing agreements to within 2 x 10 (- 10) of geodesic length (or 3. 1 mm) and 4 x 10 (- 5) as seconds of azimuth and position for baselines in the range of 19, 000 km.

30|$|The {{transformation}} between Cartesian coordinates and {{geodetic coordinates}} {{is a basic}} problem frequently encountered in geodesy and astronomy, e.g., in GPS positioning. Computing Cartesian coordinates from geodetic coordinates is a very easy task, but the inverse transformation poses a difficulty. For the latter, numerous solutions have been proposed, which can be classified into two categories. One category is an iterative solution. Bowring (1976) derived a trigonometric equation which was solved by the Newton algorithm with a single iteration. Fukushima (1999) solved a modified Borkowski’s quartic equation by the Newton method, and, later, Fukushima (2006) developed a new and faster iterative procedure using Halley’s method. Jones (2002) found a new solution with the Newton method in the <b>reduced</b> <b>latitude.</b> Pollard (2002) presented two vector methods which do not involve quartic equations, and Feltens (2009) has also presented a vector method. The other category are closed form solutions, which maybe more straightforward and efficient; however, they are relatively rare until recently. Paul (1973) proposed a closed form solution based on the well-known theory for solutions of biquadratic equations (Burnside and Panton, 1904). Borkowski (1989) proposed two accurate closed solutions, of which one is approximate {{and the other is}} exact. Vermeille (2002) proposed a closed-form algebraic method, which is well known and is used the most. Vermeille (2004) improved the formulae of Vermeille (2002) to extend the validity domain. Zhang et al. (2005), using the method of extrema with constraints and generalized La-grange’s multipliers obtained a four new equations, and presented an alternative algebraic algorithm. Gonzalez-Vega and Polo-Blanco (2009) have used symbolic tools to characterize the Vermeille and Borkowski approaches. Feath-erstone and Claessens (2008) have reviewed {{the state of the art}} of closed-form transformations between geodetic and ellipsoidal coordinates.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} contributions the ocean makes to Earth's climate is through its poleward heat transport: about 1. 5 PW or more than 30 % of that accomplished by the ocean-atmosphere system (Trenberth and Caron, 2001). Recently, concern has arisen over whether global warming could affect this heat transport (Watson et al., 2001), for example, <b>reducing</b> high <b>latitude</b> convection and triggering a collapse of the deep overturning circulation (Rahmstorf, 1995). While the consequences of abrupt changes in oceanic circulation should be of concern, we argue that the attention devoted to deep circulations is disproportionate to their role in heat transport. For this purpose, we introduce a heat function which identifies the contribution to the heat transport by different components of the oceanic circulation. A new view of the ocean emerges in which a shallow surface intensified circulation dominates the poleward heat transport...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of the {{perturbation}} of the meridional flow in the activity belts detected by local helioseismology on the development and strength of the surface magnetic field at the polar caps. We carried out simulations of synthetic solar cycles with a flux transport model, which follows the cyclic evolution of the surface field determined by flux emergence and advective transport by near-surface flows. In each hemisphere, an axisymmetric band of latitudinal flows converging towards the central latitude of the activity belt was superposed onto the background poleward meridional flow. The overall effect of the flow perturbation is to <b>reduce</b> the <b>latitude</b> separation of the magnetic polarities of a bipolar magnetic region and thus diminish its contribution to the polar field. As a result, the polar field maximum reached around cycle activity minimum is weakened by the presence of the meridional flow perturbation. For a flow perturbation consistent with helioseismic observations, the polar field is reduced by about 18 % compared to the case without inflows. If the amplitude of the flow perturbation depends on the cycle strength, its effect on the polar field provides a nonlinearity that could contribute to limiting the amplitude of a Babcock-Leighton type dynamo.

As a result, much effort is being placed on reducing the k 1 for hole patterning to the range of 0. 35 - 0. 40. However, the consequences of operating at such low k 1 values are a small DOF, <b>reduced</b> exposure <b>latitude,</b> and high MEF. To achieve this level of k 1, it is necessary to employ resolution enhancement techniques that require phase shifting reticles and/or strong off axis illumination. Recent results show that by using strong off axis illumination to achieve resolution for the dense pitch contacts and by adding subresolution scattering bars for the semi dense to isolated, it is possible to achieve contact hole imaging through the entire pitch range. [1] To generate such reticle designs, the current technique commonly used is to apply a set of rules to define the assist features (scattering bars, anti-scattering bars, non-printing assist features, phase shifted and non-phase shifted) through pitch, whether for binary or attenuated phase shifting reticles. But this approach is not capable of deriving correct assist feature placement for the entire range of pitches and for the randomly placed contact holes that occur in actual device patterns.
