40|$|Estimation of {{adequate}} <b>reserves</b> <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> {{is one of}} the main activities of actuaries in property/casualty insurance and a major topic in actuarial science. The need to estimate future claims has led to the development of many loss reserving techniques. There are two important problems that must be dealt with in the process of estimating reserves for outstanding claims: one is to determine an appropriate model for the claims process, and the other is to assess the degree of correlation among claim payments in different calendar and origin years. We approach both problems here. On the one hand we use a gamma distribution to model the claims process and, in addition, we allow the claims to be correlated. We follow a Bayesian approach for making inference with vague prior distributions. The methodology is illustrated with a real data set and compared with other standard methods.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is concerned with}} the application of statistical methodology to general insurance, in particular to the motor insurance branch. The research consists of two independent investigations in which two important aspects of motor insurance claims were studied. The aim of the first phase was to measure the influence of a given set of rating factors on both average claim size and claim frequency, and the second phase aimed at estimating an average pattern of settlement delays for motor insurance claims. In the first investigation, five rating factors were considered: mileage, zone of garage, no claim bonus, vehicle make and vehicle age. No strong evidence was found that these five rating factors had a significant influence on the average claim, but the same was not true for the claim frequency, in which such an influence was not only detected, but also measured for a limited set of the observations. An average pattern of settlement delays for motor insurance was estimated in the second investigation, based on two years of claims experience. It was shown that such a delay could give rise to a marginal profit for an insurance company, provided that the corresponding <b>reserves</b> <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> were appropriately invested. Due to the difficulty in getting data from the insurance industry, the two phases of the research had to be carried out using data from different sources. Thus, the first investigation was based on data from the Swedish claims experience during the year of 1977 and the second was based on data from a medium sized British insurance company relating to claims payments associated with accidents which took place {{in the course of the}} years 1972 and 1973...|$|E
40|$|In the {{presented}} work {{we study}} two different statistical methods <b>for</b> estimating IBNR <b>reserve</b> {{that is a}} part of the <b>reserve</b> <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> <b>reserves.</b> The first method is stochastic version of the Chain ladder method and the second one is a PTF model. We describe theories of the methods and show their different properties. The Chain ladder method does not assume any distribution of claims amount, on the other hand PTF models assume normal distribution of logarithms of incremental data. In practical part of this work we apply both methods on illustrative data and then we compare the results. We inspect especially probabilistic distribution of estimate of reserves and their statistical characteristics. An important part of this work is statistical testing of assumptions of both methods.

40|$|Non-life {{insurers}} {{are often}} {{faced with the}} challenge of estimating the future reserves necessary to handle claims that are not fully settled. A well-known and popular technique to obtain <b>reserve</b> estimates <b>for</b> these <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> is the (deterministic) chain-ladder method. Exactly the same estimates can also be obtained by applying special cases of generalized linear models. To obtain a prediction interval <b>for</b> the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims,</b> we need an estimate for the variance of the resulting reserve estimate. Computing analytic expressions for the variance is notoriously difficult and bootstrap methodology offers a simple and popular alternative. However, classical procedures are very sensitive to the possible presence of outliers. These atypical observations, deviating from the pattern {{of the majority of the}} data, may both inflate or deflate classical future claim estimates. Even when paired with robust estimators for generalized linear models, classical bootstrap estimators may break down. We present and discuss some popular and state of the art robust bootstrap procedures in the claims reserving framework. Their performance will be investigated in a simulation study and on real data. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{settlement}} delay {{for very}} large claims in liability insurance may extend to {{quite a few}} years; a delay often years in automobile third‐party liability {{is by no means}} an exception. The companies consequently have to set aside huge amounts as provisions <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims.</b> As the total provision may attain 100 times the underwriting profit, an underestimation of this provision of a few per cent could mean short‐term bankruptcy for the company. A precise forecast of those outstanding liabilities is therefore of crucial importance Owing to the special nature of the information set (a triangular array of cumulative payments, called the‘run‐off triangle’), actuaries have in the past neglected the time series analysis approach and devised their own forecasting models. Those methods are reviewed, and illustrated by a real‐life example. Two new autoregressive methods are proposed. Copyright © 1982 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{construct}} an optimal investment strategy for a non-life insurance business. We consider an insurance company which provides, in exchange for a single premium, full coverage to a portfolio of risks which generates losses according to a compound Poisson process. The insurer invests the premium and trades contin-uously on the financial market which consists of one risk-free asset and n risky assets (Black-Scholes market). We deal with the insurer’s wealth path dependent disutility optimization problem and apply a quadratic loss function which penalizes deviations below a <b>reserve</b> <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> liabilities as well as above a given upper barrier. An opti-mal investment strategy is derived using the stochastic control theory in the absence of constraints on control variables.

25|$|With {{the nation}} {{on the brink of}} defaulting, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands sent {{warships}} to Santo Domingo to press the claims of their nationals. In order to preempt military intervention, United States president Theodore Roosevelt introduced the Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that the United States would assume responsibility for ensuring that the nations of Latin America met their financial obligations. In January 1905, under this corollary, the United States assumed administration of the Dominican Republic's customs. Under the terms of this agreement, a Receiver-General, appointed by the U.S. President, kept 55% of total revenues to pay off foreign claimants, while remitting 45% to the Dominican government. After two years, the nation's external debt was reduced from $40 million to $17 million.

40|$|As {{commonly}} known, {{to evaluate}} the claims reserve (otherwise known as the provision <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims),</b> the loss adjuster uses as a first component the claims reserve given by {{the sum of the}} estimated provision <b>for</b> each <b>outstanding</b> <b>claim</b> (known as case reserve). Traditional statistical-actuarial methods are used to control and/or asseverate the evaluation and recent developments have tended to ensure that these enable an independent assessment of the claims reserve. In some European countries, a large subset of motor liability claims is managed within a direct reimbursement (DR) scheme. In Italy, the introduction of the direct compensation CARD system for third-party liability insurance has resulted in greater attention in the use of these traditional methods due to the heterogeneity of the data available for evaluations. This paper presents the results of a study undertaken to define a calculation method that, using the different assumptions that describe the evolution of settlement mechanisms, is able to quantify the claims reserve. The proposed methodology reduces the loss adjuster’s discretion in applying statistical methods since all assumptions must be made explicit and can hence be monitored and controlled. Furthermore, a stress test can be performed on all the parameters that influence the settlement and thus the claims reserve. Finally, in a backtesting perspective, the proposed methodology enables an ex-post analysis of actual cash flow deviations compared to expected values, identifying the variables that lead to these differences. In particular, a calculation method is presented that using the different assumptions describing the evolution of the settlement of different claim handling procedures (Non-Card, Card, Handler Forfait and Debtor Forfait) is able to quantify the claims reserve. Via simulations, future payments, the expected value of the claims reserve and some indicators of variability are also estimated. The numerical application allows comparing the results obtained with those deriving from the application of traditional statistical methods. The problem of aggregating the four claim handling procedures is dealt with by using copulas with the goal of building a single distribution of the aggregate claims reserve. Furthermore, in a Solvency II perspective, the capital requirement is determined against the reserve risk based on the internal model proposed and is compared with the standard formula proposed by EIOPA...|$|R
40|$|For as long {{as anyone}} remembers {{non-life}} insurance companies have used the so called chain ladder method to <b>reserve</b> <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> liabilities.

These two new methods unbundle the incurred data to aggregates of estimates of the future cash flow. By a re-distribution to the right algorithm, the estimated future cash flow is incorporated in the overall estimation process and considered as data.

In this paper we present an application of Bayesian forecasting methods with stable seasonal patterns to insurance claims; specifically to claims incurred but not yet reported, IBNR. We assume that the time it takes for the claims to be completely paid is fixed and known, that payments are made annually and that the development of partial payments follow a stable pay-off pattern. We present a Bayesian approach to forecasting either the total number claims or the total amount, given complete information for one or two past years and partial information on some development years for several occurrence years. Essentially the data corresponds to a run-off triangle in IBNR. Bayesian analysis of these problems allows the computation of forecasts <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> when there is not enough data to carry out time series analysis. Two different exact models are presented: one for discrete processes and one for continuous, which can be applied to forecast the number and amount of claims, respectively. The advantage of using the Bayesian procedure presented here is that we can derive the complete predictive distribution of the reserve requirements, from which, in turn, we can obtain a point estimate as well as probability intervals.

40|$|Stochastic models <b>for</b> <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> {{valuation}} {{have been}} recently developed {{with the aim}} to obtain either a variability coefficient or the probability distribution of the <b>reserve,</b> useful <b>for</b> {{the assessment of the}} Reserve Risk capital requirement. Different methodologies, like Bootstrapping or Bayesian methods, allow to determine the prediction error and the claims reserve distribution under some assumptions based on the data figured out in the run-off triangle. The International Actuarial Association (IAA) proposed a different way to analyse out-standing claim reserve, focused on a paper by Meyers, Klinker and Lalonde where the overall reserve of a single LoB (without any distinction among different accident years) is described as a compound mixed poisson process, by a similar approach used for aggregate amount of claims when premium risk is to be estimated. In the present paper we extend this approach assuming that each single cell of {{the lower part of the}} run-off triangle follows a Compound Poisson Process (either Pure or Mixed). This assumption leads, under independence constraint, to obtain quite easily the exact moments of the reserve distribution only through the knowledge of the characteristics of the two main random variables (number and claim size of future payments). Furthermore, Monte Carlo methods allow to simulate <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> distributions <b>for</b> each accident year, for both the overall reserve until complete run-off and the next calendar year only (in case of a one-year time horizon as prescribed in Solvency II). Model s parameters are calibrated from observed data and through a deterministic model (in the present paper an average cost method is used, namely Fisher-Lange method) based on the separate estimate of number of claims to be paid and future average costs for each cell of the lower triangle to be estimated. Finally, we analyze the one-year reserve risk in the perspective adopted by Solvency II. In particular a simulation approach, now usually called re-reserving, is here applied with the target to estimate the variability of claims development result and the percentiles, in order to quantify the capital requirement <b>for</b> the <b>reserve</b> risk.
