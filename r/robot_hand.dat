500|$|The {{majority}} of the special effects were done by Industrial Light & Magic. Salvation {{was one of the}} last films that Stan Winston, the visual effects supervisor on the first three films, worked on. He died on June 15, 2008, from multiple myeloma, and McG dedicated the film to him in the end credits. John Rosengrant and Charlie Gibson replaced Winston, and McG commented that they are [...] "trying to achieve something that's never been done before" [...] and [...] "push the envelope". Asylum Visual Effects created digital plates, Marcus' endoskeleton, and a digital T-600. Rising Sun Pictures did the digital correction of day for night scenes, the destruction of the submarine and Marcus' <b>robot</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
500|$|A {{writer of}} Rolling Stone {{described}} the video as [...] "quite a hot mess", further comparing the dancers with the {{ones from the}} video for [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)". The writer finished the review calling it [...] "a four-minute art-school film unworthy of her Sasha Fierceness". Jennifer Cady of E! Online commented that the video was [...] "all about being gritty and edgy, like strutting around a downtown L.A. warehouse in crazy designer fashion and chewing bubblegum. Hard-core style". Cady further described the dance in the video for [...] "Diva" [...] as [...] "way easier to learn than [...] in 'Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)'". However, she chose the C-3PO-inspired mannequins, the lack of Beyoncé's <b>robot</b> <b>hand</b> and the [...] "obnoxious camera work or car explosion" [...] as the worst parts of the video. Entertainment Weeklys Michael Slezak commented: [...] "The video has the production values of the clearance bin at Family Dollar, and yet somehow it works." [...] Slezak further described the set as a [...] "trunk full of mannequins, Cylon-y fringed sunglasses, and angry-lady dancing {{on display in the}} accompanying video". The video was ranked at number 13 on Black Entertainment Television's (BET's) Notarized: Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

30|$|Restoring {{human hand}} {{function}} by mechatronic means is very challenging in robotics research. In this paper, we first make a brief review {{on the development}} of dexterous robotic/prosthetic hands, and then detail our design philosophy of several <b>robot</b> <b>hands.</b> We make a concentration on a type of intrinsically-actuated <b>robot</b> <b>hands,</b> wherein the driving, transmission, and control elements are totally embedded in the hand. According to different application scenarios, we develop <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> in two parallel lines, dexterous robotic hand and anthropomorphic prosthetic hand. In both, the hand’s actuation, sensing, and control subsystems are highly integrated and modularized. This feature endows our <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> with compact appearances, simple integration, and large flexibilities. At last, we give some perspectives on the future development of dexterous hands from the aspects of structure, functionality, and control strategies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a Human-Robot Interaction study that investigates the issues of participants’ preferences {{in terms of the}} robot approach direction (directionRAD), robot base approach interaction distance (distanceRBAID), <b>robot</b> <b>handing</b> over <b>hand</b> distance (distanceRHOHD), <b>robot</b> <b>handing</b> over arm gesture (gestureRHOAG), and the coordination of both the robot approaching and gestureRHOAG {{in the context of a}} <b>robot</b> <b>handing</b> over an object to a seated person. The results from this study aim at informing the development of a Human Aware Manipulation Planner. Twelve participants with some previous human-robot interaction experience were recruited for the trial. The results show that a majority of the participants prefer the robot to approach from the front and hand them a can of soft drink in the front sector of their personal zone. The <b>robot</b> <b>handing</b> over hand position had the most influence on determining from where the robot should approach (i. e distanceRAD). Legibility and perception of risk seem to be the deciding factor on how participants choose their preferred robot arm-base approach coordination for handing over a can.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} perceptual {{system for a}} {{humanoid}} robot that autonomously discovers its hand from less than 5 minutes of natural interaction with a human. The perceptual system combines simple proprioceptive sensing with a visual attention system that uses motion to select salient regions. We show that during natural interactions with a person, the selected visual regions primarily correspond with the person’s head, eyes, hands, and fingers, and the <b>robot’s</b> <b>hand</b> and fingers. The system clusters the selected image regions, models their spatial distribution over a sensory ego-sphere, and uses mutual information to determine how well the robot’s arm can control each cluster. In our tests, the cluster that is best controlled by the robot’s arm primarily contains images of the <b>robot’s</b> <b>hand.</b> It also has a spatial distribution that can predict the visual location of the <b>robot’s</b> <b>hand</b> {{as a function of}} the arm’s configuration. 1 I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} adding {{autonomy to}} <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> used in teleoperation systems. Currently, the finger positions of <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> in teleoperation systems are controlled via a robot master using a Dataglove or exoskeleton. There are several difficulties with this approach: accurate calibration {{is hard to}} achieve; <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> have different capabilities from human hands; and complex force reflection is difficult. In this paper, we propose a model of hand teleoperation in which the input device commands the motions of a grasped object rather than the joint displacements of the fingers. To achieve this goal, the hand requires greater autonomy and the capability to perform high-level functions with minimal external input. Therefore, a set of general, primitive manipulation functions that can be performed automatically is defined. These elementary functions control simple rotations and translations of the grasped objects. They are incorporated into a teleoperation system by using a simple i [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{developmental}} perceptual {{system for a}} humanoid robot that autonomously discovers its hand from less than 2 minutes of natural interaction with a human.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a miniature robot finger which uses {{shape memory alloy}} as the actuator. Aiming at developing <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> to perform human work instead of men, numerous research have been conducted. By miniaturizing <b>robot</b> <b>hands,</b> execution of more detailed work becomes possible. In developing miniature <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> for dexterous manipulation, {{it is necessary to}} consider miniaturizing and simplification. The miniature robot finger proposed in this paper is driven by shape memory alloy (SMA) wires. The structure of the robot finger imitates the musculoskeletal system of humans, since SMA wires exhibit nonlinear features similar to human muscles. Highly precise position control of fingertip is performable by using SMA owing to its shape memory effect. Force control of the fingertip is performed by measuring the tension of the SMA wire. We used strain gages to measure tension. We confirmed that stiffness control of the finger joint can be conducted by controlling tension of the SMA simultaneously. 1...|$|R

30|$|We {{find that}} some {{underactuated}} hand exoskeletons have developed [15, 16]. Transmission mechanisms of these hand exoskeletons are designed outside the joints. And the underactuated mechanisms are significant for simplifying control systems. These hand exoskeletons can {{get much more}} powerful grasping force due to the bigger outside-driving space. Also, we learn that more joints can better adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes [17]. Inspired by {{all of that and}} the flexible bending of octopus’ tentacles, this paper proposes a novel self-adaptive underactuated multi-fingered hand (OS Hand), combing the advantages of traditional rigid <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> and flexible <b>robot</b> <b>hands.</b> OS Hand has high adaptability and powerful grasping force which can be widely used in industrial fields.|$|R

40|$|Object {{manipulation}} using multi-fingered dextrous <b>robot</b> <b>hands</b> poses formidable control challenges due to {{the complexity}} of the manipulator and its workspace limitations. To address large-scale manipulation tasks, finger gaits are often used to reposition fingers. In this paper, an approach to finger gaiting is presented which constructs behavior on-line by activating combinations of reusable feedback control laws with formal stability and convergence properties drawn from a control basis. Finger gaits are constructed as finite state control strategies in a DEDS framework, while actual contact locations and object motions are computed reactively based on local contact information. This leads to manipulation strategies that are robust with respect to a limited range of perturbations, object geometries, and manipulator kinematics. To demonstrate this, two finger gaits are constructed and applied to different object geometries and <b>robot</b> <b>hands...</b>|$|R
