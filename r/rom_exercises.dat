2500|$|Initial {{physical}} therapy consists {{of range of}} motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercises,</b> often with the guidance of a physical therapist. Range of motion exercises are used to regain {{the flexibility of the}} ligament, prevent or break down scar tissue from forming and reduce loss of muscle tone. Range of motion exercise examples include: quadriceps contractions and straight leg raises. In some cases, a continuous passive motion (CPM) device is used immediately after surgery to help with flexibility. The preferred method of preventing muscle loss is isometric exercises that put zero strain on the knee. [...] Knee extension within two weeks is important with many rehab guidelines.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to chronic}} {{isolated}} injuries, {{patients with chronic}} combined posterolateral knee injuries showing varus alignment will first require an opening wedge osteotomy {{as part of a}} staged procedure. With chronic combined PLC injuries the surgeon should treat the injury as if it was isolated with an anatomic reconstruction concurrent with a standard reconstruction of the accompanying ACL and/or PCL injuries. The key point here is that the multiligament reconstructions be done {{at the same time and}} not as a staged procedure. This will allow for early range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercises</b> to begin and prevent the formation of arthrofibrosis in the joint. In addition, failing to address a chronic posterolateral knee injury when repairing a deficient ACL or PCL has been shown to cause increased forces of the graft leading to cruciate reconstruction graft stretching and/or failure.|$|E
5000|$|Isolated {{injuries}} to the posterolateral corner are best repaired in an anatomic fashion {{by attempting to}} reestablish the previous location of the damaged structure. Typically damaged structures can be directly sutured or anchored back to their bony attachments. The goal is to always achieve a stable and secure repair so that patients can initiate <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises.</b> Certain situations require more complicated repairs:Femoral avulsions of the FCL or popliteus typically require a slightly more complex repair using a recess procedure in which stitches are placed through a bone tunnel and around the avulsed structure to proved further stabilization and return to range of motion exercises. [...] Avulsion fractures that occur at the fibular head or fibular styloid typically are caused by detachment of the popliteofibular ligament, direct arm of either the long or short heads of the biceps femoris or FCL. [...] These fractures are best repaired with nonabsorbable suture or with wires. If the fracture is large enough, open fixation with surgical hardware may be required.|$|E

The subjects were 18 DMD patients (21. 3 ± 4. 1 years old). The jaw <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> consisted of therapist-assisted training (2 times a week) and self-training (before each meal every day). The therapist-assisted training consisted of the application of a hot pack on the cheek of the masseter muscle region (15 minutes), the massage of the masseter (10 minutes), and jaw <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> (5 minutes). The self-training involved jaw <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> by opening the mouth to the maximum degree, ten times. These trainings continued for six months. Outcomes were evaluated by measuring the greatest occlusal force and the distance at the maximum degree of mouth opening between an incisor of the top and that of the bottom.

[Subjects and Methods] In total, twenty-six 9 -week-old adult male Wistar rats were used in this study. The rats were randomly divided into three groups, the immobilization group (n= 10), ex-ercise group (n= 10), and control group (n= 6). The immobilization group and exercise group were anaesthetized and operated on under sterile conditions. The right knee joints in the immobilization group and exercise group were im-mobilized with external fixation at 120 degrees of flexion. Range of motion exercise was started from the day after immobilization. <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> was performed in the exercise group once a day for 3 minutes, 6 days a week, for 2 weeks. [Result] The joint capsule in the immobilization group and exercise group showed narrowing of the collagen bundles in interstitial spaces but was less dense in the control group. In the immobilized group, a hyperplastic reac-tion was associated with infiltration into the articular cavity and adhesion to the surface of the articular cartilage.

(i) Range {{of motion}} (ROM) {{exercise}}s: Patients with SCI at T 10 and above are usually ambulated for exercise [19]. <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> are of two types, i.e., active and passive. Active (self) <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> included the exercises {{performed by the}} patient himself such as stretching; the patient uses his strong arm that helps the weaker arm to perform exercises. Studies report the use of stretching as {{an effective way to}} treat and prevent contractures [20, 21]. Passive <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> needed the assistance of a physiotherapist. They were performed within the ROM to avoid fatigue, swelling and pain. Though, they did not strengthen the muscles, but, helped in avoiding stiffness of joints and maintained functional capacity [22].|$|E
30|$|Based on the aforementioned, {{it would}} be {{safe to say that}} our working {{hypothesis}} was confirmed: Early ankle <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> and PWB mobilization after uncomplicated medial StD seem to provide better functional results than those achieved by longer periods of immobilization, as already mentioned in literature. As joint instability, following closed reduction of medial subtalar dislocation, is not a possible complication, protracted immobilization only adds to joint stiffness and minimizes ankle and foot functionality. In contrast, early active <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> may help the ligaments and the tendons of the site to heal without compromising proprioception of the joint.|$|E
40|$|Background: Although closed {{reduction}} and percutaneous pinning is accepted as {{the treatment of}} choice for displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus, there are some debates on the pinning techniques, period of immobilization, elbow range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercise,</b> and perceptions on the restoration of elbow ROM. This {{study was to investigate}} the consensus and different perspectives on the treatment of supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children.

40|$|Modified {{constraint}} {{induced movement}} therapy is {{a focus of}} rehabilitation research for stroke survivors with hemiplegia that relies on physically constraining a patient's unaffected limb to modify a patient's behavior and force {{the use of the}} affected limb in a rehabilitation setting. In this study, we attempt to cognitively induce a constraint in patients engaging in virtual therapy via a Kinect and Unity based platform. The platform included four games that each utilized a different active range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercise</b> for control of game objects. Five stroke survivors with hemiparesis were recruited for a two week study consisting of five, 25 -minute therapy sessions each. Users were allowed to use either their unaffected or affected limb to play each game at any time and allowed their choice of games during each session. For each game, the difficulty level remained at baseline while the user used their affected side to play but the difficulty was increased at varying rates when the user used their unaffected side to play. Results were evaluated for compliance to the therapy (usage rate of affected side), choice of games, performance, efficacy of therapy (ROM), and qualitative behavior of users. Compliance during virtual mCIT seems to be higher than that of traditional mCIT but a more extensive user test is necessary to validate this result. ROM measurements did not provide a clear trend due to the small size and duration of the data set. Trends were found in several areas of user behavior: (1) users preferred games utilizing only one axis of control and not reliant on orientation of the limb, (2) users also tended to play games in a certain order, (3) user performance increased over time, and (4) users often incorrectly performed the desired active <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise</b> for each game which may indicate the necessity to observe and coach patients during virtual rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) is highly prevalent, {{generally}} categorised as ‘non-specific’ as clear diagnosis for pain is often absent, and further categorised into acute, sub-acute and chronic, with 69 - 75 % of acute cases developing into chronic. This chronic LBP population {{accounts for the}} majority of economic costs worldwide associated with LBP. Although LBP is often ‘non-specific’, many physical dysfunctions are associated with it. Thus LBP can be regarded as multifactorial in nature. Dysfunctions include, but are not limited to: deconditioning of the lumbar extensor musculature, limited range of motion (ROM), gait abnormality and disc disorders. The novel approach of this thesis was to consider lumbar extensor deconditioning, LBP and its associated physical dysfunctions within a multifactorial framework, and the potential improvement of associated dysfunctions from intervention using isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) specifically aimed at addressing lumbar extensor deconditioning. Findings from three empirical studies are reported. The first examined limited <b>ROM</b> ILEX <b>exercise</b> compared with full <b>ROM</b> <b>exercise.</b> Results from this study support that limited ROM training is as effective as full ROM training at improving full ROM ILEX strength, pain and disability. The second study examined the effects of ILEX exercise upon lumbar spine kinematic waveform pattern variability during gait. Results from this study demonstrate that ILEX exercise significantly improves sagittal plane variability in chronic LBP participants. The final study examined the effects of ILEX exercise upon disc hydration determined indirectly through measurement of spinal height using seated stadiometry. Results from this study showed improved ILEX strength, pain and disability but did not demonstrate improvement in disc hydration. These results provide evidence for adopting a multifactorial conceptualisation of LBP in the use of ILEX exercise as a treatment. It is concluded that a wide range of improvements including pain, disability and various aspects of function relating to the multifactorial model are possible through use of a single minimal intervention involving ILEX. This conclusion has potential implications for considering direction of treatments from clinicians towards chronic LBP. Such a minimal intervention offering a wide range of benefits may reduce the need for costly and complex multi-disciplinary interventions...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This {{case study}} is aimed at {{determining}} if Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) and physical therapy (PT) are better for increasing lower extremity strength and function in patients following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) compared to physical therapy alone. Background: TKA surgery is increasing yearly {{and is expected to}} greatly increase by 2030. After a TKA, patients may suffer from decreased strength and physical function even after physical therapy has been performed. The use of NMES and exercise for quadriceps activation post-ACL reconstruction {{has been found to be}} highly effective. Its use has been suggested to be just as effective after a TKA at improving a patient’s quadriceps strength and increase overall function. Case Description: Patient is a 75 year old man who underwent a left TKA in October of 2014. The physical therapy for this patient revolved around performing knee range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercise,</b> non-weight bearing exercise, gait training, and weight bearing exercises. Outcomes: A review of current literature revealed that the use of NMES and physical therapy after TKA may help to attenuate the loss of quadriceps strength and activation after surgery and return lower extremity strength and function to a higher level than exercise alone. Discussion: A 2010 Cochrane review of this topic determined that there were not enough high quality research articles to make a recommendation on the use of NMES after TKA. Subsequently, four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been published. Within these four RCTs there was a wide variety in research methodology, specifically, the parameters used during the NMES treatment. Despite this inconsistency, the studies have shown that NMES may be an effective treatment after TKA for increasing quadriceps strength and returning lower extremity function...|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} also showed {{significantly}} decreased ankle dorsiflexion ROM on days 2 – 4 after exercise. Previous {{studies have reported}} decreased joint ROM for several days after eccentric exercise as an indirect evidence of muscle damage (Nosaka and Clarkson 1996; Murayama et al. 2000; Nosaka et al. 2001; Ingham et al. 2010). The decrease in ROM observed {{in the present study}} is expected to reflect increased longitudinal muscle stiffness in the ankle plantar flexors, {{partly as a result of}} a damage-induced increase in the intracellular Ca 2 + level in muscle fibers after eccentric exercise (Whitehead et al. 2001; Hoang et al. 2007; Reisman et al. 2009). Judging from post-exercise T 2 elevation, the damaged MG might contribute greatly to the decreased ankle dorsiflexion <b>ROM</b> after <b>exercise.</b>|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. (Chiropractic) Myofascial {{pain and}} {{dysfunction}} syndrome (MPDS) is presently {{considered to be}} the leading diagnosis amongst pain management physicians and the leading diagnosis amongst pain sufferers reporting to general practitioners (Harden, Bruehl, Gass, Niemiec & Barbick, 2000). The goal of dry needling and the other above mentioned soft tissue treatments is to alleviate the MTrP’s in the muscle, thereby restoring the muscle to its normal tissue mobility and returning it to proper functional capacity (Travell & Simons, 1999). A post-needling protocol may be used to reduce post-needling soreness at the needling site, to facilitate tissue repair after needling and to normalise muscle function and ROM after needling (Travell & Simons, 1999). The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the efficacy of dry needling on its own and in combination with a widely prescribed post-needling protocol of heat, active range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercises</b> and passive stretches, with regards to changes in pressure pain threshold, pain and cervical spine ranges of motion, to determine which the superior treatment is. Participants who went to the University of Johannesburg Chiropractic Day Clinic were eligible to participate in the study once they met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants were recruited by means of word of mouth as well as with the use of advertisements that were placed around the respective campuses of the University of Johannesburg. Thirty participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups, each consisting of 15 participants. Group A received only dry needling to the upper trapezius muscle TP 1 or TP 2 whereas group B received dry needling to the upper trapezius muscle TP 1 or TP 2, moist heat, active <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> and passive stretching of the upper trapezius muscles.

40|$|Osteochondral lesions of the talus {{can often}} {{present to the}} {{podiatrist}} as localized ankle pain; this study evaluates the success of arthroscopic intervention. Methods: 50 patients with subacute or chronic osteochondral lesions of the talus, no prior ankle surgery, and no other associated injuries of the ankle joint were selected for arthroscopic repair. Lesions were staged based on intra-operative findings, and loose lesions were removed and drilled. Transmalleolar or transtalar drilling was performed for lesions that were not loose with 0. 045 or 0. 062 K-wires, and abrasion arthroplasty was performed for extensive lesions. Cystic lesions were drilled if the cartilage was intact; {{if it was not}} intact, the lesions were curetted before drilling. Patients were splinted post-operatively, early <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> 3 - 4 times a day were encouraged, and PT was initiated 3 - 5 weeks post-operatively.

30|$|Some {{surgeons}} {{believe that}} delay in full extension exercises may protect the reconstructed ACL. Otto et al. retrospectively reviewed the 5 -year results of 68 patients who underwent single-bundle ACLR. Extension loss of > 3 ° {{was seen in}} 5  % of the patients; however, the postoperative therapy regimen consisted {{of the use of}} a brace which did not allow full extension for the first 4  weeks after reconstruction. It was concluded that this technique results in excellent stability of the knee and allows return to a high level of function [22]. On the other hand, in an analysis of data from 191 consecutive patients with ACLR, 12  % developed arthrofibrosis [17]. This study showed that postoperative limitation in knee extension may increase the risk of extension loss. Bracing the knee in full extension with motion starting within 24  h dropped the incidence of arthrofibrosis from 23 to 3  % [11]. All patients in the current study used an extension brace up to 3  weeks just for walking and early knee <b>ROM</b> <b>exercises</b> especially extension exercises was encouraged. Therefore, the effect of postoperative rehabilitation was excluded.|$|E

In this study, we assessed {{the effect of this}} method of training on peak force, load lifted, and concentric work performed. Six male subjects with resistance training backgrounds (age 20. 2 +/- 1. 3 years, height 179. 4 +/- 4. 6 cm, weight 89. 6 +/- 9. 9 kg, 6 -repetition maximum [6 RM] bench press 92. 5 +/- 14. 3 kg) participated in this study. Testing consisted of 6 RM bench press strength tests during full (FULL), three quarter (3 / 4), one half (1 / 2), and one quarter (1 / 4) ROM from full elbow extension bench press performed on a Smith machine. The 6 RM load, peak force (PF), and concentric work (W) performed during each ROM was examined using a one-way analysis of variance performed at an [alpha] level of p < 0. 05. The 6 RM load increased significantly as the ROM was decreased for all tests (FULL = 92. 5 +/- 14. 3 kg, 3 / 4 = 102. 1 +/- 14. 3 kg, 1 / 2 = 123. 3 +/- 23. 6 kg, 1 / 4 = 160. 9 +/- 26. 2 kg).

40|$|Background Early passive motion {{exercise}} {{has been}} the standard rehabilitation protocol following rotator cuff repair. However, recent research studies show that longer immobilization may enhance tendon healing. Aim The {{aim of this study}} was to compare early passive range of motion (<b>ROM)</b> <b>exercise</b> with a delayed rehabilitation protocol with regard to the effectiveness of stiffness reduction and functional improvements and rates of tendon healing in patients undergoing arthroscopic repair for torn rotator cuffs. Patients and methods This study was performed on 164 patients having a full-thickness tear of the supraspinatus muscle that was repaired using the arthroscopic single-row suture anchor technique along with subacromial decompression. The patients were divided into two groups, early (group 1) and delayed ROM (group 2). In group 1, 78 patients were started on passive elevation and rotation exercises on the second day after surgery. In group 2, 86 patients had their shoulder immobilized for 6 weeks, after which passive motion exercise was started. Patients were followed-up clinically for a minimum of 12 months, and rotator cuff healing was assessed using MRI. Results Both groups had a statistically significant difference between preoperative and postoperative results. As regards American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon scores, the early group improved from 45. 4 preoperatively to 90. 9 postoperatively (P< 0. 0001) and the delayed group improved from 44. 59 preoperatively to 91. 6 postoperatively (P< 0. 0001). As regards Constant score, the early group improved from 35. 7 preoperatively to 86. 5 postoperatively (P< 0. 0001) and the delayed group improved from 37. 8 preoperatively to 88. 1 postoperatively (P< 0. 0001). However, there were no statistically significant differences in rotator cuff healing between the two groups. The follow-up mean of visual analog scale was significantly better in group 2 compared with group 1 at 6 weeks postoperatively but no difference was found after 3 months. In contrast, ROM was better in group 1 compared with group 2 at 6 months postoperatively but no difference was found after 1 year. Conclusion Significant improvement in pain, ROM, and function after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was seen at 1 year postoperatively, regardless of early or delayed postoperative rehabilitation protocols. However, early motion increases pain scores and may increase the possibility of rotator cuff retear but with early regain of ROM. A delayed rehabilitation protocol with immobilization for 6 weeks would be better for tendon healing without risk for retear or joint stiffness and easily convalescence with less postoperative pain...|$|R
