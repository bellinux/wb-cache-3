25|$|While foraging, army ants cause many {{invertebrates}} to {{flee from}} their hiding places under {{leaves of the}} forest floor, under tree bark, and other such locations, thereby allowing predators to catch them more easily. For example, in the tropical rainforests of Panama, swarms of army ants attract many species of birds to this feast of scrambling insects, spiders, scorpions, worms, and other animals. Some of these birds are named “antbirds” due to this tendency. While focused on feeding on these invertebrates, birds at army-ant swarms typically allow very close approach by people—within 1 or 2 meters in many cases—often providing the best opportunities to see many of these species. Depending {{on the size of}} the ant swarm and the amount of prey the ants stir up, birds can number from a few to dozens of individuals. Birds that frequent army-ant swarms include the white-whiskered puffbird, <b>rufous</b> <b>motmot,</b> rufous-vented ground cuckoo, gray-necked wood rail, plain-brown woodcreeper, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, and gray-headed tanager.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>motmot</b> (Baryphthengus martii) is a near-passerine bird {{which is}} a {{resident}} breeder in rain forests from northeastern Honduras south to western Ecuador, northeastern Bolivia, and southwestern Brazil.|$|E
50|$|This large motmot is 46 cm {{long and}} weighs 195 g. It is mainly cinnamon-rufous, {{with a black}} face mask and central breast spot, green wings and sides, a greenish-blue lower belly, and dark blue tail and flight feathers. The tail is very long and has a bare-shafted racket tip. The bill and legs are black. Young birds are paler and duller than adults, and lack the tail rackets and black breast spot. The call of the <b>rufous</b> <b>motmot</b> is a low owl-like hoop hoop huhuhuhuhuhu.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rufous</b> <b>motmots</b> feed on insects, lizards, fish, crabs, {{and also}} consume many fruits, {{especially}} those of palms and Heliconias. These birds often sit still on a canopy perch, and in their dense forest habitat {{can be difficult to}} see, despite their size and colour.|$|R
5000|$|In {{several species}} of motmots, the barbs near {{the ends of the}} two longest (central) tail {{feathers}} are weak and fall off due to abrasion with substrates, or fall off during preening, leaving a length of bare shaft, thus creating the racket shape of the tail. It was however wrongly believed in the past that the motmot shaped its tail by plucking part of the feather web to leave the racket. This was based on inaccurate reports made by Charles William Beebe. It has since been shown that these barbs are weakly attached and fall off due to abrasion with substrates and during routine preening. There are however also several species where the tail is [...] "normal", these being the tody motmot, blue-throated motmot, rufous-capped motmot, and the Amazonian populations of the <b>rufous</b> and broad-billed <b>motmots.</b>|$|R
50|$|The park {{is popular}} with birdwatchers {{due to its}} {{abundance}} of bird species; some 525 bird species are found here. Pipeline Road extends for 17.5 km north-south through the park and passes through old-growth and secondary forest. Pipeline Road {{is one of the}} best places to see tropical birds in the Americas, with a bird species list exceeding 400. Birds regularly seen along Pipeline Road include double-toothed kite, slaty-backed forest-falcon, orange-chinned parakeet, brown-hooded parrot, blue-headed parrot, red-lored parrot, squirrel cuckoo, white-necked jacobin, violet-bellied hummingbird, crowned woodnymph, blue-chested hummingbird, white-tailed trogon, gartered trogon, black-throated trogon, black-tailed trogon, slaty-tailed trogon, black-mandibled toucan, keel-billed toucan, collared aracari, black-cheeked woodpecker, cinnamon woodpecker, crimson-crested woodpecker, white-whiskered puffbird, broad-billed motmot, <b>rufous</b> <b>motmot,</b> northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, fasciated antshrike, black-crowned antshrike, checker-throated antwren, dot-winged antwren, white-flanked antwren, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, southern bentbill, brownish twistwing, olivaceous flatbill, ruddy-tailed flycatcher, bright-rumped attila, purple-throated fruitcrow, red-capped manakin, blue-crowned manakin, golden-collared manakin, bay wren, song wren, gray-headed tanager, white-shouldered tanager, red-throated ant-tanager, blue-black grosbeak, scarlet-rumped cacique, and yellow-rumped cacique.|$|E
