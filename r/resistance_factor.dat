For this he established the Anti-Fascistic Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) giving an actual liberating character to the whole region of Macedonia. Besides, KKE was very positive to the option of a greater Macedonia, including the Greek region, since it realized that a victory in the Greek Civil War was utopic. Later EAM and SNOF disagreed in issues of policy and they finally crashed and the latter was expelled from Greece (1944).|$|E

25|$|Plasmodium vivax {{has a wide}} {{distribution}} in tropical countries, but is absent or rare in a large region in West and Central Africa, as recently confirmed by PCR species typing. This gap in distribution {{has been attributed to}} the lack of expression of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) on the red cells of many sub-Saharan Africans. Duffy negative individuals are homozygous for a DARC allele, carrying a single nucleotide mutation (DARC 46 T → C), which impairs promoter activity by disrupting a binding site for the hGATA1 erythroid lineage transcription factor. In widely cited in vitro and in vivo studies, Miller et al. reported that the Duffy blood group is the receptor for P. vivax and that the absence of the Duffy blood group on red cells is the <b>resistance</b> <b>factor</b> to P. vivax in persons of African descent. This has become a well-known example of innate resistance to an infectious agent because of the absence of a receptor for the agent on target cells.|$|E

40|$|The {{field of}} {{geotechnical}} engineering {{has evolved from}} Allowable Stress Design (ASD) to Load <b>Factor</b> and <b>Resistance</b> Design (LRFD) {{which has led to}} a need to quantify the measures of uncertainty and the level of reliability associated with a project. The measures of uncertainty are quantified by load and <b>resistance</b> <b>factors,</b> while the level of reliability is driven by the amount of risk an owner is willing to take and is quantified by the reliability index. The load factors are defined through structural design codes, but the <b>resistance</b> <b>factors</b> have uncertainties that can be mitigated through reliability based design. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) have recommended <b>resistance</b> <b>factors</b> that are dependent on the type of load tests conducted and are available as a reference to state agencies.

This thesis describes the calibration process used to select the load and <b>resistance</b> <b>factors</b> for the fatigue limit states of steel bridge members within the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications. The process presented within this thesis builds upon work completed as part of the Strategic Highway Research Program No. 2 including the determination of the fatigue load model. The resistance model was developed using available fatigue test data and statistically analyzed using specially developed techniques. Target reliability indices of 1. 0 were chosen for all steel detail types based upon a procedure using Monte Carlo simulations and engineering judgment. Load and <b>resistance</b> <b>factors</b> were finally chosen for both Fatigue I and Fatigue II service limit states. The load and <b>resistance</b> <b>factors</b> for the Fatigue I limit state are 2. 0 and 1. 0 respectively. Similarly, the load and <b>resistance</b> <b>factors</b> are 0. 80 and 1. 0 for the Fatigue II limit state.

However, the partial safety factors of the load are various in different criterions.

Firstly the simplified format of design expression in the ultimate state was obtained according to the expression in routine structural design. Then the failure probability of a structure during design reference period was taken as the sum of the probability of all incompatible failure events in this period, and the objective reliability index of the structure could be obtained. Finally using trial-and-error procedure and JC method, reliability analysis was performed for structural members to obtain the partial safety factors of load effects and resistance and the coefficient for combination value of load effects in design expression in the ultimate state.
