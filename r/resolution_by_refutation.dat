40|$|Because {{of several}} {{technological}} limitations of traditional silicon based computing, for {{past few years}} a paradigm shift, from silicon to carbon, is occurring in computational world. DNA computing has been considered to be quite promising in solving computational and reasoning problems by using DNA strands. Resolution, {{an important aspect of}} automated theorem proving and mathematical logic, is a rule of inference which leads to proof by contradiction technique for sentences in propositional logic and first-order logic. This can also be called refutation theorem-proving. In this paper we have shown how the theorem proving with <b>resolution</b> <b>refutation</b> <b>by</b> DNA computation can be represented by the semantics of process calculus and strand graph.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we develop a {{comprehensive}} human-oriented theorem proving system that integrates several different proof systems. The main theorem proving environment centers around a natural Gentzen first-order logic system. This allows construction of natural proofs, encourages user {{involvement in the}} search for proofs, and facilitates understanding of the resulting proofs. We integrate more abstract automatically generated proofs such as <b>resolution</b> <b>refutations</b> <b>by</b> transforming them to proofs in the Gentzen system. Expansion trees are another proof system used as an intermediate stage in transformations between the abstract and natural systems. They are a compact representation useful for transformations and other computations. We develop a programming language approach to theorem proving based on tactics and tacticals. Our extended tactics provide a method for doing proof transformations, as well as facilitate interactive theorem proving, allowing full integration of interactive and automatic theorem proving. In the system, we explicitly represent proofs in each proof system and view expansion tree proofs as types for Gentzen proof terms. This explicit proof representation allows proofs to be manipulated as meaningful data objects and used in various computations. For example, the proof terms in the natural Gentzen system can be used to obtain natural language explanations of proofs. We foresee several applications for this kind of theorem proving system, such as use a...|$|R
40|$|The cut-elimination method CERES (for first- and higher-order {{classical}} logic) {{is based}} on the notion of a characteristic clause set, which is extracted from an LK-proof and is always unsatisfiable. A resolution refutation of this clause set {{can be used as a}} skeleton for a proof with atomic cuts only (atomic cut normal form). This is achieved by replacing clauses from the <b>resolution</b> <b>refutation</b> <b>by</b> the corresponding projections of the original proof. We present a generalization of CERES (called CERESs) to first-order proof schemata and define a schematic version of the sequent calculus called LKS, and a notion of proof schema based on primitive recursive definitions. A method is developed to extract schematic characteristic clause sets and schematic projections from these proof schemata. We also define a schematic resolution calculus for refutation of schemata of clause sets, which can be applied to refute the schematic characteristic clause sets. Finally the projection schemata and resolution schemata are plugged together and a schematic representation of the atomic cut normal forms is obtained. A major benefit of CERESs is the extension of cut-elimination to inductively defined proofs: we compare CERESs with standard calculi using induction rules and demonstrate that CERESs is capable of performing cut-elimination where traditional methods fail. The algorithmic handling of CERESs is supported by a recent extension of the CERES system...|$|R

50|$|According to {{the theory}} of {{thematic}} dialectic, the forms of thematic tension fall in two principal groups, each of which is divided into three main positions. On the one hand, we have the group of dualistic resolutions, and on the other hand, we have the group of monistic resolutions. The former are dualistic in that they accept the existence of two competing themes, and the latter are monistic in that they do not accept the existence of two competing themes. The dualistic group consists of (1) <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> equilibrium, (2) <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> suppression, and (3) <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> subordination. The monistic group consists of (4) <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> fusion, (5) <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> elimination, and (6) <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> absorption. If we add to these six forms of resolution the form of exclusion, the theory of thematic dialectic denotes, in all, seven ways in which the interplay of dialectical opposites can take place. The systematic quality of the theory is manifest, for example, {{in the fact that the}} <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> equilibrium is the dualistic counterpart to the monistic <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> fusion, the <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> suppression is the dualistic counterpart to the monistic <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> elimination, and the <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> subordination is the dualistic counterpart to the monistic <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> absorption.|$|R

If it succeeds, this corresponds to a counter-example for the conjecture, i.e. it disproves the (claimed) theorem.|$|R

Subject of study as much as 241 students of class X from three Public Senior High School from high, medium, and low school level. Research instrument consist of one set of student’s mathematical communication, and one set of student’s Self Regulated Learning scale. Data analysis use Kosmogorov-Smirnov Test (Test-Z), Level Test, Test-t, one-way and two-way ANOVA, Post Hoc Test (Scheffe) and also Chi-Square Test. Study found that learning with PR 4 R strategy accompanied <b>by</b> <b>Refutation</b> Text Reading give consistent influence compared with conventional learning as viewed as a whole, based on school level and also mathematical early knowledge. In addition, study also found: (1) there is no interaction between learning (PQ 4 R) accompanied <b>by</b> <b>Refutation</b> Text reading and conventional and school level toward (a) student’s mathematical communication and (b) student’s Self Regulated Learning; (2) {{there is no significant}} interaction between learning and student’s mathematical early knowledge toward (a) student’s mathematical communication ability and (b) student’s Self Regulated Learning; and (3) there is association between student’s mathematical communication ability and student’s Self Regulated Learning.

50|$|The {{superposition}} calculus is a calculus for {{reasoning in}} equational first-order logic. It {{was developed in}} the early 1990s and combines concepts from first-order resolution with ordering-based equality handling as developed in the context of (unfailing) Knuth-Bendix completion. It {{can be seen as a}} generalization of either resolution (to equational logic) or unfailing completion (to full clausal logic). As most first-order calculi, superposition tries to show the unsatisfiability of a set of first-order clauses, i.e. it performs proofs <b>by</b> <b>refutation.</b> Superposition is refutation-complete—given unlimited resources and a fair derivation strategy, from any unsatisfiable clause set a contradiction will eventually be derived.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> fusion {{means to}} fuse two {{conflicting}} themes into one. For example, {{the idea of}} a supernatural order can be fused with {{the idea of a}} natural order by making the former immanent in the latter, as it was advocated in the Romantic idea of natural supernaturalism or supernatural naturalism. <b>Resolution</b> <b>by</b> elimination denotes that one theme eliminates another. Extreme scientism is an example of this type of <b>resolution.</b> <b>By</b> looking upon physical things from a strictly positivistic and materialist point of view, the scientistic position eradicates every spiritual experience and reduces all things to physical matter. Scientific materialism is reductive; it reduces mind to matter. The opposite reduction is also possible; it is to reduce matter to mind. This is also a <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> elimination. Unlike these reductive methods, the <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> fusion rejects reduction. But all of them produce a monistic result. The last type of resolution is the <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> absorption, which denotes that one theme absorbs another. This type of resolution is perhaps the most difficult to comprehend because it can easily get mistaken for the <b>resolution</b> <b>by</b> fusion. In Seung’s words: ...|$|R
