500|$|Fayette State Park {{encompasses}} {{an historical}} iron smelting town site from the 1800s. Now a ghost town, the Jackson Iron Company operations lasted here from 1867–1891. The town {{was used as}} a location to produce charcoal iron, a purified form of the iron ore mined in the UP. After the furnaces shut down, the town operated as a resort community until the park was created. The Michigan Conservation Department created the park in 1959 after it traded land to obtain the [...] from the Escanaba Paper Company and the [...] from Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company. The Delta County Commission had been <b>requesting</b> <b>state</b> assistance for improving the road since 1975. In February 1985, MDOT took control of the road from the county road commission and designated it M-183. The number was chosen to reflect the CR483 designation it once bore. After the transfer, the state resurfaced the road as part of a program of improvements to benefit park visitors.|$|E
50|$|If the {{requested}} state has legislation {{outside of the}} Convention which allows for the repatriation of minors upon request, the Convention also allows repatriation {{in cases where the}} <b>requesting</b> <b>state</b> deems the minor's presence in {{the requested}} state to be incompatible with the interests of the minor or the interests of the <b>requesting</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} secure the {{confiscation}} of the instruments and proceeds from crime, the Convention provides two forms of international co-operation. Firstly, the execution by the <b>requested</b> <b>State</b> of a confiscation order made abroad and, secondly, the institution, under its own law, of national proceedings leading to a confiscation by the <b>requested</b> <b>State</b> at the <b>request</b> of another <b>State.</b>|$|R

Extradition from China can be sought if: (1) the conduct {{indicated in the}} request for extradition constitutes an offence according {{to the laws of}} both China and the <b>Requesting</b> <b>State</b> and (2)the request for extradition is made for the purpose of instituting criminal proceedings, the offence indicated in the request for extradition is, under the laws of both China and the <b>Requesting</b> <b>State,</b> punishable by a fixed term of imprisonment for one year or more or by any other heavier criminal penalty. Additionally, provision (2) grants states the ability to request extradition when persons already been convicted, but have a remaining sentence of at least six months {{at the time of the}} request.|$|E

50|$|For the {{purposes}} of international co-operation, the Convention provides for forms of investigative assistance (assistance in procuring evidence, transfer of information to another <b>State</b> without a <b>request,</b> adoption of common investigative techniques, lifting of bank secrecy etc.), provisional measures (freezing of bank accounts, seizure of property to prevent its removal) and measures to confiscate the proceeds of crime (enforcement by the <b>requested</b> <b>State</b> of a confiscation order made abroad, institution by the <b>requested</b> <b>State,</b> of domestic proceedings leading to confiscation at the <b>request</b> of another <b>State).</b>|$|R

50|$|Applied {{examples}} {{that many people}} could encounter in their day-to-day lives include elevator call buttons and crosswalk buttons. The initial activation of the button moves the system into a <b>requesting</b> <b>state,</b> until the request is satisfied. Subsequent activations of the button between the initial activation and the request being satisfied have no effect.|$|E
50|$|Indeed, UNCAC Section 54 2A also {{provides}} for the provisional freezing or seizing of property where there are sufficient grounds for taking such actions in advance of a formal request being received. Generally, dual criminality must also exist between the jurisdictions, whereby the predicate offense must {{be recognized as a}} crime by both the requested and <b>requesting</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Conference {{also led}} the {{transformation}} of the 14-block Penn-Liberty Corridor into the Pittsburgh Cultural District.

Strategy 21 not only resulted in projects that ranged from the new Pittsburgh International Airport to The Andy Warhol Museum.|$|E
50|$|The {{consensus}} {{in international law}} is that a state {{does not have any}} obligation to surrender an alleged criminal to a foreign state, because one principle of sovereignty is that every state has legal authority over the people within its borders. Such absence of international obligation, and the desire for the right to demand such criminals from other countries, have caused a web of extradition treaties or agreements to evolve. When no applicable extradition agreement is in place, a sovereign may still request the expulsion or lawful return of an individual pursuant to the <b>requested</b> <b>state’s</b> domestic law. This can be accomplished through the immigration laws of the <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> or other facets of the <b>requested</b> <b>state’s</b> domestic law. Similarly, the codes of penal procedure in many countries contain provisions allowing for extradition to take place {{in the absence of an}} extradition agreement. Sovereigns may, therefore, still request the expulsion or lawful return of a fugitive from the territory of a <b>requested</b> <b>state</b> in the absence of an extradition treaty.|$|R

50|$|Generally the act {{for which}} {{extradition}} is sought must constitute a crime punishable by some minimum penalty {{in both the}} requesting and the <b>requested</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 2011 {{extradition}} review, however, {{concluded that}} the forum bar clause [...] "would require the judge to consider the evidence available to the <b>requesting</b> <b>State</b> and the evidence available to the domestic prosecution authorities. It would also require scrutiny of the prosecution decision making process", and that to do this would be [...] "time consuming, costly and undermine the efficient and effective operation" [...] of the Act.|$|E
5000|$|Legislation {{solves the}} {{problems}} of liability and responsibilities of cost. Once the conditions for providing assistance to a <b>requesting</b> <b>state</b> have been set, the terms constitute a legally binding contractual agreement that makes affected states responsible for reimbursement. Responding states can rest assured that sending aid {{will not be a}} financial or legal burden, and personnel who are deployed are protected under workers compensation and liability provisions.|$|E
5000|$|Chapter V of UNCAC {{establishes}} {{asset recovery}} as a [...] "fundamental principle" [...] of the Convention. The provisions on asset recovery lay a framework, in both {{civil and criminal}} law, for tracing, freezing, forfeiting and returning funds obtained through corrupt activities. The <b>requesting</b> <b>state</b> will in most cases receive the recovered funds {{as long as it}} can prove ownership. In some cases, the funds may be returned directly to individual victims.|$|E

5000|$|Through the {{extradition}} process, {{a sovereign}} (the <b>requesting</b> <b>state)</b> typically makes a formal request to another sovereign (the requested state). If the fugitive is {{found within the}} territory of the requested state, then the requested state may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process. [...] The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the requested state.|$|E
50|$|Extradition is the {{mechanism}} by which one sovereign requests and obtains custody of a fugitive located within the jurisdiction and control of another sovereign. It is an ancient mechanism, dating back to at least the thirteenth century BCE, when an Egyptian Pharaoh negotiated an extradition treaty with a Hittite King. Through the extradition process, a sovereign (the <b>requesting</b> <b>state)</b> typically makes a formal request to another sovereign (the requested state). If the fugitive is found within {{the territory of the}} requested state, then the requested state may arrest the fugitive and subject him or her to its extradition process. The extradition procedures to which the fugitive will be subjected are dependent on the law and practice of the requested state.|$|E

50|$|The {{questions}} {{involved are}} often complex {{when the country}} from which suspects are to be extradited is a democratic country with a rule of law. Typically, in such countries, the final decision to extradite lies with the national executive (prime minister, president or equivalent). However, such countries typically allow extradition defendants recourse to the law, with multiple appeals. These may significantly slow down procedures. On the one hand, this may lead to unwarranted international difficulties, as the public, politicians and journalists from the requesting country will ask their executive {{to put pressure on}} the executive of the country from which extradition is to take place, while that executive may not in fact have the authority to deport the suspect or criminal on their own. On the other hand, certain delays, or the unwillingness of the local prosecution authorities to present a good extradition case before the court on behalf of the <b>requesting</b> <b>state,</b> may possibly result from the unwillingness of the country's executive to extradite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the offence in criminal law treaty plays several roles. First and foremost, it has the symbolic, normative role of expressing society's condemnation of the forbidden acts. Second, it facilitates agreement. Since states tend to be reluctant to undertake stringent obligations in matters related to the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction, a precise {{definition of}} the crime, which restricts the scope of those obligations, makes agreement less costly. Third, it provides an inter-subjective basis for the homogeneous application of the treaty's obligations on judicial and police cooperation. This function is of particular importance in extradition treaties because, to grant an extradition, most legal systems require that the crime be punishable both in the <b>requesting</b> <b>state</b> and the requested state. Fourth, it helps states to enact domestic legislation to criminalize and punish the wrongful acts defined in the treaty in conformity with their human rights' obligations. The principle of nullum crimen sine lege requires, in particular, that states define precisely which acts are prohibited before anyone can be prosecuted or punished for committing those same acts.|$|E
50|$|The United Kingdom Government {{had chosen}} to read the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, {{relating}} {{to the treatment of}} prisoners of war, as protecting Astiz from criminal prosecution in its jurisdiction and from extradition from it. Meyer argues that this was an incorrect reading but was justified at the time by four points. Astiz was in protective custody because of special circumstances, i.e. surrendering during war. The Geneva Conventions exhort custodial powers to leniency. Astiz was accused of crimes—kidnapping, wounding and torture—which were illegal in Argentina, and he could, in theory, be prosecuted there. Meyer argues that nothing in the Geneva Conventions expressly prohibited the prosecution or extradition of Astiz. However, the extradition treaties between Argentina and the UK, and Sweden and France, referred only to crimes committed within the territory of the <b>requesting</b> <b>state</b> and crimes against international law, while Astiz was accused of crimes committed in Argentina against their nationals which were not, at the time, crimes under international law. Consequently, he could not be handed over to another country. Criminal prosecution of Astiz within the UK was also not possible because he was not accused of any crimes against British subjects, their possessions or the British State.|$|E
