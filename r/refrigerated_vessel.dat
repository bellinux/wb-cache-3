40|$|This {{contribution}} {{provides an}} account of several months aboard the POLAR PARAGUAY, a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vessel</b> of the Hamburg-Südamerikanische Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft, told {{from the perspective of}} the Third Navigating Officier. The year is 1975. Under charter by the Salén Reefer Services of Sweden, the ship has just completed two banana transports from Nicaragua to Long Beach. Now she receives the somewhat unusual order to take a cargo of oranges to the Persian Gulf. Three trial deliveries, carried out by the POLAR PARAGUAY and two new ships of Salén's SNOW class, are intended to prove the feasibility of this technically challenging transport: The trip will take six to seven weeks, including what is normally a long wait for permission to dock at the Iranian port of delivery. Throughout this entire period, a temperature of 4. 5 ºC has to be guaranteed, despite a constant supply of fresh air. A large number of long-unused sea charts must be updated by hand. As it turns out, many of the charts into which a lot of work has been invested are never needed after all: Due to overcrowding at the originally planned port of discharge Khorramshahr on the Shatt al Arab, Bandar Abbas - located at the entrance to the Persian Gulf - is declared the new port of destination. There 'the ship with fresh oranges' is cleared unexpectedly quickly. Only six days after her arrival, the POLAR PARAGUAY is back at sea. The original plans, based on the assumption of a much longer idle period in Iran, had provided for a subsequent transport of apples from South Africa to Europe. This journey is now replaced by the order to take on bananas in the southern Philippines. For the Gulf of Davao a chart has to be specially drawn - on the basis of the officiers’ own measurements and observations - to supplement the existing chart of the 1880 s. Now, in 1975, not only are there official warnings of pirate raids, but due to political unrest on the island of Mindanao, taxi drivers can hardly be persuaded to take on fares after nightfall. All these inconveniences are quickly forgotten, however, thanks to the extremely cordial welcome extended to the crew by the people of Davao. From Japan, where the bananas are discharged, the ship transports a cargo of automobiles to El Salvador and Costa Rica, then taking on bananas in Guayaquil for delivery to Long Beach, where oranges are once again loaded. This time, however, the oranges are destined for Europe and thus apparently of a much more average quality than the wonderful fruits shipped to Iran with the hope of conquering a new market.

25|$|Trollers – {{catch fish}} by towing astern {{one of more}} {{trolling}} lines. A trolling line is a fishing line with natural or artificial baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large <b>refrigerated</b> <b>vessels</b> 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built trollers are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by topping lifts, held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used to haul in the lines.|$|R

5000|$|Rabbits were {{typically}} kept {{as part of}} the household livestock by peasants and villagers throughout Europe. Husbandry of the rabbits, including collecting weeds and grasses for fodder, typically fell to the children of the household or farmstead. These rabbits were largely ‘common’ or ‘meat’ rabbits and not of a particular breed, although regional strains and types did arise. Some of these strains remain as regional breeds, such as the Gothland of Sweden, while others, such as the Land Kaninchen, a spotted rabbit of Germany, have become extinct. Another rabbit type that standardized into a breed was the Brabancon, a meat rabbit of the region of Limbourg and what is now Belgium. Rabbits of this breed were bred for the Ostend port market, destined for London markets. (Whitman, pg 10) The development of the <b>refrigerated</b> shipping <b>vessels</b> led to the eventual collapse of the European meat rabbit trade, as the over-population of feral rabbits in Australia could now be harvested and sold.

50|$|Refrigerated cargo is a {{key part}} of the income for some {{shipping}} companies. On multi-purpose ships, refrigerated containers are mostly carried above deck, as they have to be checked for proper operation. Also, a major part of the refrigeration system (such as a compressor) may fail, which would have to be replaced or unplugged quickly in the event of a fire. Modern container vessels stow the reefer containers in cellguides with adjacent inspection walkways that enable reefer containers to be carried in the holds as well as on the deck. Modern <b>refrigerated</b> container <b>vessels</b> are designed to incorporate a water-cooling system for containers stowed under deck. This does not replace the refrigeration system but facilitates cooling down of the external machinery. Containers stowed on the exposed upper deck are air-cooled, while those under deck are water-cooled. The water cooling design allows capacity loads of refrigerated containers under deck as it enables the dissipation of the high amount of heat they generate. This system draws fresh water from the ship's water supply, which in turn transfers the heat through heat exchangers to the abundantly available sea water.|$|R
40|$|In the Celtic Sea and ICES Division VIIj the herring {{fishery is}} divided into 3 main {{catching}} seasons. In quarters four and one, the fishery is focused on autumn and winter pre-spawning and spawning aggregations. In the 2004 / 05 season 34 vessels participated in the fishery, ranging from small dry hold polyvalent vessels (< 20 m) to purpose built RSW (<b>Refrigerated</b> seawater) <b>vessels</b> of 23 - 40 m. Single and pair midwater trawling are common, with the latter representing the preferred catching method. In recent years a quarter- 3 summer fishery has developed targeting offshore feeding aggregations, 78 nmi (nautical miles) offshore on the Labadie Bank. This offshore fishery is restricted to the RSW fleet {{on the grounds of}} product quality delivered to processors. The 2006 autumn survey is the most comprehensive survey carried out in the current time series. The geographical extent of the annual 21 day survey was extended further offshore to include areas to the south of the main coastal spawning grounds to target winter spawning fish on an inward spawning migration. Spatial resolution of acoustic transects were increased over the entire south coast survey areas, with a special focus on spawning grounds throughout the survey confines.

40|$|The {{northwest}} and west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) herring acoustic survey programme was first established in 1994. A larval survey programme was initially carried out between 1981 and 1986. In the early 1990 s, the ICES herring working group (HAWG) identified {{the need for}} a dedicated herring acoustic survey in this area (Anon, 1994). From 1994 to 1996 surveys were carried out on this stock during the summer feeding phase. In 1997 a two-survey spawning aggregation program was established covering both autumn and winter components. In 2004, a single spawning stock survey was carried out early in quarter 1 and continued until 2007, whereupon it was decided that this survey should be incorporated into the larger coordinated Malin shelf survey. This survey will be the first in a new time series and a step away from the traditional spawning stock surveys. The Irish survey will be carried out concurrently with the West of Scotland (MarLab) and Irish Sea surveys (AFBI) and was coordinated through the ICES Planning Group of Herring Acoustic Surveys (PGHERS). Combined survey data on herring distribution, abundance and age will be used to provide a measure of the relative abundance of herring within the Malin shelf stock complex. Survey data on stock numbers at age are submitted to the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) and used in the annual stock assessment process. The {{northwest and}} west coast (ICES Divisions VIaS & VIIb, c) herring stock is composed of 2 of spawning components (Autumn and Winter spawners) covering a large geographical area, which extends over a 4 -month period from late September through to late March (Molloy et al, 2000). Traditionally fishing effort has been concentrated on spawning and pre-spawning aggregations. In Vlas, fishing begins in late Novemember and continues until late March (winter spawners). Further south in Vlllb, peak fishing takes place from October to December (Autumn spawners). The protracted spawning period of herring and the overlap between the two spawning stocks in this area (October to February) is highly dynamic with variations between annual spawning events of up to 3 weeks. Up to 40 vessels commonly participate in the fishery, many of which are based in the Co. Donegal port of Killybegs. The fleet is made up of 20 RSW (<b>Refrigerated</b> Seawater) <b>vessels</b> of 40 - 70 m in length; 20 polyvalent trawlers 10 of which are vessels of 22 - 40 m and 10 of less than 25 m.

40|$|In the Celtic Sea and ICES Division VIIj, to {{the south}} and {{southwest}} of Ireland, herring are an important commercial species to the pelagic fleet. The local fleet is composed of dry hold polyvalent vessels and a number of purpose built RSW (<b>Refrigerated</b> seawater) <b>vessels.</b> This stock is composed of both autumn and winter spawning components. The commercial fishery has historically taken place within 6 nmi (nautical miles) of the coast and focused on aggregated schools within the spawning cycle. In recent years the RSW fleet has actively targeted offshore summer feeding grounds in the south Celtic Sea. In division VIIj, the fishery traditionally begins in early October and is concentrated within several miles of the shore bays and inlets. The division VIIaS fishery peaks towards the year end in December, but may be active from mid October depending on location. In division VIIg, along the south coast herring are targeted from October to January at a number of known spawning sites and surrounding areas. Overall, the protracted spawning period of the two components extends from October through to January, with annual variation of up to 3 weeks. Spawning occurs in successive waves in a number of well known locations including large scale grounds and small discreet spawning beds. The stock structure and discrimination of herring in this area is not fully understood. It is known that fish in the eastern Celtic Sea recruit from nursery areas in the Irish Sea and tagging studies have shown linkages between these areas also. For the purpose of stock assessment and management these areas have been combined since 1982. For a period in the 1980 ’s, egg and larval surveys were conducted for herring in this area. However, since 1989, acoustic surveys have been carried out, and currently are the only tuning indices available. In the Celtic Sea and VIIj, herring acoustic surveys have been carried out since 1989, and the current survey is the 16 th in the series. The autumn 2005 survey is the most comprehensive survey carried out in the current time series. The geographical confines of the annual 21 day survey were expanded to include areas {{to the south}} of the main winter spawning grounds in an effort to identify the whereabouts of winter spawning fish before the annual inshore spawning migration. Spatial resolution of acoustic transects were increased over the entire south coast survey areas. The acoustic component of the survey was complimented by a continuation of the detailed hydrographic work carried out in the Celtic Sea in 2004. In addition a second inshore survey was carried out along the southern coast using a chartered commercial fishing vessel (FV Regina Ponti). This second survey focused on area between 0. 5 nmi and 10 nmi offshore and covered the main autumn and winter spawning areas along the south coast.

40|$|In the {{southwest}} of Ireland and the Celtic Sea (ICES Divisions VIIaS, g & j), herring {{are an important}} commercial species to the pelagic and polyvalent fleet. The local fleet is composed of dry hold polyvalent vessels and {{a small number of}} purpose built <b>Refrigerated</b> seawater <b>vessels</b> (RSW). The stock is composed of both autumn and winter spawning components and the fishery targets pre-spawning and spawning aggregations. The Irish commercial fishery has historically taken place within 1 - 20 nmi (nautical miles) of the coast and focused on aggregated schools within the spawning cycle. In recent years the larger RSW vessels have actively targeted offshore summer feeding aggregations in the south Celtic Sea. In VIIj, the fishery traditionally begins in mid September and is concentrated within several miles of the shore including many bays and inlets. The VIIaS fishery peaks towards the year end in December, but may be active from mid October depending on location. In VIIg, along the south coast herring are targeted from October to January at a number of known spawning sites and surrounding areas. Overall, the protracted spawning period of the two components extends from October through to January, with annual variation of up to 3 weeks. Spawning occurs in successive waves in a number of well known locations including large scale grounds and small discreet spawning beds. The stock structure and discrimination of herring in this area has been investigated recently. Hatfield et al. (2007) has shown the Celtic Sea stock to be fairly discrete. However, it is known that fish in the eastern Celtic Sea recruit from nursery areas in the Irish Sea, returning to the Celtic Sea as young adults (Brophy et al. 2002; Molloy et al., 1993). The stock identity of VIIj herring is less clear, though there is evidence that they have linkages with VIIb and VIaS (ICES, 1994; Grainger, 1978). Molloy (1968) identified possible linkages between young fish in VIIj and those of the Celtic Sea herring. For the purpose of stock assessment and management divisions VIIaS, VIIg and VII j have been combined since 1982. For a period in the 1970 s and 1980 s, larval surveys were conducted for herring in this area. However, since 1989, acoustic surveys have been carried out, and currently are the only tuning indices available for this stock. In the Celtic Sea and VIIj, herring acoustic surveys have been carried out since 1989, and this survey represents the 18 th in the overall acoustic series or the fourth in the modified time series. The geographical confines of the annual 21 day survey have been modified in recent years to include areas to the south of the main winter spawning grounds in an effort to identify the whereabouts of winter spawning fish before the annual inshore spawning migration.

40|$|This survey {{represents}} the first dedicated exploratory research survey for boarfish (Capros aper) undertaken {{along the western}} seaboard. The commercial fishing vessel the MFV Felucca, {{an active participant in}} the fishery was equipped with a calibrated scientific echosounder. A consultant biologist from the Killybegs Fisherman’s Organisation (KFO) and a Marine Institute scientist headed the biological and acoustic research respectively during the cruise. Exploratory fishing for boarfish by Irish vessels began in the later 1980 s when commercial quantities were encountered during the spring horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and mackerel (Scrombrus scomber) fishery in northern Biscay. Several landings were made into Ireland for fishmeal during this time but due to logistical problems related to handling (prominent dorsal spines) this species was not favoured by processors. Interest increased again around the mid 1990 s when Dutch pelagic vessels landed frozen samples to determine if a market could be developed for human consumption. From the early 1970 s onwards the abundance of boarfish was seen to increase exponentially and distribution ever increasingly spread northwards along the western seaboard (Blanchard and Vandermeirsch, 2005). With this increase in abundance boarfish were taken as bycatch in both the pelagic and demersal fisheries in ever increasing quantities and this caused serious problems relating to damaged target species due to the aforementioned formidable dorsal spines. During the early 2000 s the Irish landings were relatively small (< 700 t per yr) and it wasn’t until 2006 that the directed fishery developed in earnest. Fishing was undertaken primarily by vessels from the Castletownbere and Killybegs based RSW fleets (<b>refrigerated</b> seawater <b>vessels)</b> which targeted boarfish from northern Biscay to the southern Celtic Sea. In 2007 - 08 Scotland and Denmark also began targeting boarfish in quantity. Irish landings are primarily landed into fishmeal plants in Denmark and the Faroe Islands with increasing amounts being landed in Killybegs. The boarfish fishery bridged an important gap between the short season fisheries for horse mackerel, mackerel and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) affectively extending the fishing season for the RSW fleet from late August through to May. A precautionary interim management plan was adopted in November 2010 covering ICES Divisions VI, VII and VIII and an EU TAC of 33, 000 t was set. Of this the Irish allocation for 2011 was 22, 000 t. This precautionary TAC was based on 50 - 75 % of total landings from the period 2007 - 2009 which peaked at over 83, 400 t (2009). Landings in 2010 reached over 137, 000 t in a scramble to build up a track record in the fishery prior to a fixed quota allocation. In 2010 Sweden now also shares the TAC allowance with those actively involved in the fishery. In addition to the TAC control, seasonal closures were also implemented; from September 1 -October 31 ICES (area VIIg) to protect herring feeding and pre spawning aggregations and from March 15 –August 31 where mackerel are frequently encountered as a large bycatch. A catch rule ceiling of 5 % bycatch was also implemented within the fishery where boarfish are taken with other TAC controlled species. Data from this survey, in addition to the extensive biological research carried out on this species forms part of a larger program aimed at increasing the knowledge of this species and its abundance outside of the commercial fishery. Data from this survey will be presented for inclusion into the ICES Planning Group meeting for North Atlantic Pelagic Ecosystem Surveys in August 2011 (WGNAPES) and for the ICES assessment Working Group for Widely Distributed Stocks (WGWIDE) also meeting in August 2011.

40|$|Marine resources, {{so crucial}} to the {{countries}} of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist, and these should be developed. June 11, 2005, saw a confrontation in Senegal between fishermen from Kayar and Guet-Ndar. The toll: one dead and several wounded. The cause of the dispute: rivalry over access to an increasingly scarce resource fish. Incidents of this kind are symptomatic of a serious problem. In August 2003, Spore sounded a cautionary note, urging the introduction of extensive political and economic changes if fish stocks were to be maintained. In March 2005, FAO confirmed that 75 % of fishery resources had been fished to their maximum yield, over-exploited or exhausted. Encouragingly, there is growing awareness of the need to move towards sustainable fisheries management, which combines long-term viability with a strategy that satisfies the needs of fishers and ensures the economic development of resources. This has translated into a growing understanding, shared by all those involved, and in a range of measures, binding or otherwise, developed to regulate fishing. But there {{is still a long way}} to go before responsible and voluntary management of marine resources is adopted by all players in the fisheries sector. As long as stocks are over-exploited, and their profits diminished, fishers will continue to break the law. That was the clear message from several participants in an internet debate organised by CTA in 2004. Crucial for ACP states The problem of fisheries surveillance is gradually being perceived as a major issue. Experts are coming up with acronyms such as IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing), MCS (monitoring, control and surveillance) and VMS (vessel monitoring system). In June 2005, a conference on the impact of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing on developing countries was held in London. These developing nations are particularly badly affected, the meeting heard, because of a lack of funds, technical capacity, manpower, cooperation between states and, occasionally, of political will. Look out, fishers on patrol In an effort to reduce the number of conflicts between industrial and small-scale fishers, sparked by the incursion of trawlers into the zone reserved for small-scale fishing, a community surveillance project was set up in Guinea in 2002 (see Spore 110). It aimed to lower the number of trawlers by teaming up the institutions charged with coastal surveillance with the fishing communities themselves. According to Hassimiou Tall, technical advisor to the Ministry for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Guinea, the results have been very encouraging. The programme has succeeded in reducing illegal incursions by industrial trawlers by 60 % as crews now know that some small-scale fishers are working for the authorities. Relatively inexpensive (US$ 20, 000 less than 16, 500) and holding considerable promise, the Guinean experiment is due to be extended to Congo, Gabon and Mauritania. But in Guinea itself, the pilot project has been (provisionally?) suspended, due to lack of funds. More proof, if it were needed, that good ideas are not enough, unless they are backed up by adequate resources. The countries of the South are not alone. Published last May, the European Commission s annual report on serious breaches to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy revealed that the number of infringements recorded rose from 6, 756 in 2002 to 9, 502 in 2003. Five EU member states detected nearly 90 % of all breaches. Unauthorised fishing accounted for 22 % of the cases, while the figure for unlicensed fishing was 17 %. A fine was imposed in 84 % of cases. In 4, 720 cases, fishing gear was seized. The June 2005 bulletin of the Fisheries News Update section on CTA s Agritrade website concluded that the report offered interesting lessons for ACP countries, noting that greater transparency over infringements and sanctions will increase confidence in the fair and equitable enforcement of regulations. Fisheries infringements come in many guises, they include: fishing with unlicensed boats; and failing to land catches in local ports, in spite of the obligations of fisheries agreements and falsely reporting tonnage caught. Whatever the measures taken, whether they are aimed at getting fishing zones respected, at better regulating fishing gear, at limiting the size of catches, at guaranteeing a biological rest period or at developing the economic activity of ports by making it mandatory to land all or part of catches locally, the notion of self-regulation appears to be an illusory one, and control measures are certainly needed. Some of these are already in place, and fall into two groups so-called hardware and software measures. Means and human resources Hardware measures consist of advanced and often costly and cumbersome techniques, such as radar, onboard systems and satellite. To monitor an economic zone of 200 square miles, it takes several rapid intervention boats, surveillance vessels, radar stations and even airplanes. And, of course, a computer system capable of cross checking data, with permanent internet access. For ACP countries, it is hard to reconcile such demands with budgetary constraints. These systems are essential, but they are also inadequate unless they are backed by human resources. The software techniques refer to onboard observers or the participation of fishing communities. Officially, any such observers go onboard to collect scientific data. But since they are equipped with communication tools, their information is by default used for surveillance. They run the risk therefore, if this aspect of their work were to be known, of no longer being allowed on board. Senegal s fishing committees By limiting their catches and adopting good practices, the fishers of Kayar, in Senegal, have enabled fish stocks to be replenished. A local initiative, surveillance committees see to it that this Kayar code is respected. Fishing zones have been defined and a limit imposed of 45 kg of fish per canoe per day. Highly destructive techniques such as the use of explosives or drag nets have been banned. These days, catches are smaller, but they fetch a better price. Not surprisingly, this initiative has quickly spread throughout Senegal s main fishing zones since 2001, around 50 local committees have been created. But the incidents of June 11 show that not all fishers are ready to take the idea on board. The presence of onboard observers is crucial for providing independent information on fishing activities, both on a daily and a case-by-case basis, the CTA online debate concluded. But to be effective, such methods depend on the inspectors receiving adequate training and payment, as Ms Janet Uronu, joint president for fisheries at the Ministry for Natural Resources and Tourism in Tanzania pointed out, The high levels of technology (and the principles on which it is based) to be found on modern fishing vessels were well beyond the comprehension of those fishery officers sent to inspect the vessels. The job of these inspectors also carries risks: vulnerability to corruption, especially if they are poorly paid, violence and the risk of being taken hostage, to prevent them from reporting what they have seen. A number of experiments closely linking fishing communities with surveillance operations have been carried out in West Africa. After all, the fishermen know the fishing grounds better than anyone. However, while these initiatives have produced positive results, they also raise the question of motivation the fishers are simultaneously acting as inspectors and stakeholders. This approach effectively establishes that small-scale fishers are also responsible for the over-exploitation of resources. A culture of change None of these methods will work unless at least two conditions are met. First, there must be clear rules about what is and is not allowed, accompanied by sanctions which are properly enforced. Secondly, there needs to be regional cooperation between countries facing the same problem. That is true for the North: on March 14, 2005, the EU Fisheries Council finally agreed to establish a Community Fisheries Control Agency, based in Vigo, Spain which should coordinate fishing control systems within community waters, but also an important point for ACP countries within the framework of bilateral fisheries agreements. It is also true for the South, where one of the most successful initiatives in this respect has been the MCS Programme set up by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). Financed by the EU, it has, since 2003, allowed bilateral and trilateral surveillance operations to be carried out between the countries concerned, and strengthened the equipment, human resources and capacity to exchange information of member countries which needed support in these areas. Tanzania, for example, now has more than 30 trained observers. According to Ms Uronu, the first change needed to achieve such results involves overcoming inertia and bureaucracy. A culture of change is essential. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which numbers seven mainland or island East African countries among its members, is another example of regional cooperation. According to Mark Pearson, at the Secretariat of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), this cooperation has already enabled the number of <b>refrigerated</b> fishing <b>vessels</b> practising IUU fishing to be cut from 140 to 40. One method used is the exchange, between member countries and others, of lists of authorised vessels, together with their tonnage (known as the positive list). Other regional groupings in the fisheries sector may lead to similar initiatives. That has already happened in the case of the Programme pêche, commerce et environnement en Afrique de l Ouest (PCEAO), a programme set up to promote sustainable fishing in six West African states, which met in Dakar in early June 2005. The question of surveillance was not specifically on the agenda, but the West African sub-regional commission on West African fisheries, la Commission sous-régionale des pêches d Afrique de l Ouest (CSRP), does have a project to address this issue, supported by the Luxembourg Development Agency among others. In the Caribbean, the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism lists the development of a monitoring, control and surveillance system as a priority. Finally, the Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Unit of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), based in the Solomon Islands, has, since 1999, installed a satellite surveillance system to monitor fishing vessels on behalf of its member states. It has proved to be highly effective the number of cases of illicit fishing recorded by the authorities is, and continues to be, very small. Fisheries surveillance requires considerable means. How should available resources be best used, and what kind of support is needed? That is what future fisheries agreements being drawn up between ACP countries and the EU should try to clarify. Equally, they should encourage greater harmony between national fisheries legislation, as well as regional cooperation in various forms: data exchange, joint patrols, exchange of personnel and experiences between crews, and of surveillance systems in the EU and the ACP regions concerned. In the long run, it makes sense all round. Marine resources, so {{crucial to the}} countries of the South, are being over-exploited. Regulatory measures have been put in place, but must be accompanied by close surveillance of fishing vessels to be effective. Positive examples do exist [...] ...|$|R
