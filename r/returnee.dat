Studies and reports on Afghan <b>returnees</b> in Herat and Nimroz provinces are also scarce. One reason for this gap in the literature is that the population of <b>returnees</b> from Iran is considerably lower than <b>returnees</b> from Pakistan.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{experience}} of women <b>returnees</b> in rural-urban migration in contemporary China. Based on in-depth interviews with women migrants, <b>returnees,</b> their family members, friends and fellow villagers in both sending and receiving areas, the research investigates the return and remigration decision-making of rural women, their life as <b>returnees,</b> their identity shaping and the negotiation of the gender relations in the household. The author argues that the current government policies addressing 'the problem of rural migrant returnees' are inadequate in aiding women <b>returnees</b> in the villages to resettle as they fail to acknowledge the needs of rural women <b>returnees.</b> As a result, many women <b>returnees</b> will have to re-migrate again to the cities. As in their first migration, their seemingly free choice of remigration is a choice out of necessity. The government needs to devise policies and programmes that are more gender-sensitive to help women migrant <b>returnees</b> in their settlement and remigration...|$|R
5|$|As {{the green}} flag flew on lap 38, Chip Ganassi Racing held a one–two with Franchitti leading Dixon, {{with two of}} the Dreyer & Reinbold cars—Conway and Wilson—holding third and fourth places, with the only {{remaining}} KV car of E. J. Viso holding fifth, the Venezuelan disposing of Castroneves just after the restart. Realising that the gamble had backfired, the lead quintet pitted on laps 41 and 42, which cycled Hunter-Reay back through to the lead. Power made an error which allowed Matos and Briscoe to move ahead of him. Briscoe moved ahead of Matos on lap 45 and set off in chase of Hunter-Reay. Four laps later, the Australian was on the American's tail, and moved ahead after an outbraking move into the final hairpin. Hunter-Reay immediately regained the position into the first chicane on Lap 51, before Briscoe sealed the place with a similar final hairpin move {{at the end of the}} lap. Briscoe's luck would run out, however, when he overcooked it into turn five on lap 54, and nudged the barriers with his nose assembly, bringing out the fourth and final caution of the race. The time limit meant that only six laps remained at the restart, with Hunter-Reay leading Power, Matos, Meira and Wheldon. Meira soon passed his fellow Brazilian for third on Lap 57, and began to chase down the lead duo, who had changed positions after Power used the slipstream to overtake Hunter-Reay into the final corner. Power moved away from Hunter-Reay in the final laps, taking the chequered flag to cap his return from injury with a victory. Hunter-Reay took his best result for a year in second, with another injury <b>returnee,</b> Meira, finishing third. Matos was fourth, holding off seven other cars, as fourth to eleventh were covered by 3.49 seconds at the race's conclusion. Wheldon led those seven in fifth, ahead of the Ganassis, Conway, Castroneves, Kanaan and Wilson. Viso finished twelfth ahead of top rookie Beatriz, a recovering Briscoe, Danica Patrick and de Silvestro, the final two off the lead lap.|$|E

In this paper I discuss the social mobility among Swedish <b>returnees</b> between 1900 and 1930 and compares my results to the existing research. The general view in the previous Swedish research are that the Swedish-American <b>returnees</b> had no upward social mobility and that the migration brought no major changes upon the <b>returnees.</b> In this paper I explore the methodological issues dealing with {{the problem of how to}} measure social mobility among <b>returnees</b> and how the results may differ depending on which method being used. Time is in many ways an essential factor when measuring social mobility. It is not possible to measure social mobility among <b>returnees</b> by only investigating them at the time of their return. By doing this, the researcher fails to take in to account that it took time to find the right property to buy or to establish a company as well as to establish oneself in the community after being absent for several years. In this paper I argue both that the previous Swedish research on social mobility among <b>returnees</b> does not provide reliable results due to the lack of adequate methods and that the upward social mobility among the <b>returnees</b> were considerably higher and faster than among the non-emigrants...|$|R

30|$|Study {{findings}} show that access to the reviewed minimum standards of shelter could be a challenge for Afghan <b>returnees.</b> The living conditions of some Afghan <b>returnees</b> are so dire that their lives can be put at risk (Simpson et al. 2017). As stated by Afghan <b>returnees</b> themselves, shelter is their most important need and an essential element in their reintegration into Afghan society (Assessment Capacities Project 2016). It is estimated that 900, 000 people will need shelter assistance in Afghanistan in 2018 and among them are 440, 000 <b>returnees</b> (United States Agency for International Development [USAID] 2017). The literature suggests that {{lack of access to}} a durable shelter {{is one of the main}} reasons for the secondary displacement of Afghan <b>returnees</b> (Abbasi-Shavazi et al. 2005; Barr and Sanei 2013; Macdonald 2011; Schmeidl 2009; Milani 2006; Simpson et al. 2017). Estimates show that on average around 15 % of the registered <b>returnees</b> in Afghanistan are forced to secondary displacement (UNHCR 2012). Afghan <b>returnees</b> who are forced to secondary displacement may stay with the borders of Afghanistan or may decide to pass international borders once more in search of protection.|$|R
30|$|Few Afghan <b>returnees</b> own {{property}} in Afghanistan {{and the majority}} live in rented houses upon return (Kent et al. 2017). In {{a study conducted by}} UNHCR, lack of land was the main concern of {{more than half of the}} <b>returnees,</b> and lack of shelter was the main concern of over 15 % of the <b>returnees</b> (UNHCR 2017 b). One of the reasons for lack of access to shelter for Afghan <b>returnees</b> is that years of conflict destroyed many properties and changed land ownerships. <b>Returnees</b> are either unable to reclaim their properties or do not own land; therefore, they have to rent. However, the current emphasis on Afghan repatriation created an influx of <b>returnees,</b> and impacted Afghanistan’s housing market by creating high and unaffordable rent costs (IOM 2017). Only in 2017, around 59, 000 refugees and nearly 500, 000 undocumented Afghans returned to Afghanistan (Majidi 2017). Consequently, <b>returnees</b> are forced to rent houses in remote areas that have lower rates, share a house with other families to make rents more affordable, live in tents or sub-standard shelters, borrow money to afford rents, rely on child labor to increase income, or live in open areas (IOM 2017; Samuel Hall et al. 2018).|$|R

40|$|Migration {{scholars}} {{argue that}} return migrants {{have the potential to}} become a developing force in their countries of origin, but that the realization of this 'diaspora solution to innovation capacity development' depends on different context factors. This paper contributes to capturing theoretically such context factors by making use of concepts of the Cultural-Historical Activity Theory. Based on an explorative empirical approach, a model of processes of return migration in a specific country (Serbia) is created. According to the findings of this paper, <b>returnees</b> offer potential for Serbian transnational innovation systems, which subsequently could strongly contribute to the social and economic development of Serbia. However, at present, the developmental potential of highly skilled <b>returnees</b> in Serbia has not bee realized yet. <b>Returnees</b> arrive with hopes to earn a living in Serbia and possibly to {{contribute to the development of}} the society. Still, there are many barriers for <b>returnees,</b> such as nepotism, as well as the existing power structures at potential workplaces and markets. At the same time, state institutions or independent organizations do not provide sufficient support to make a difference for the majority of <b>returnees.</b> Although there are some examples of <b>returnees</b> who are successful in developing innovative start-ups or becoming innovators in the existing organizations, their number remains limited. Nevertheless, it seems possible that <b>returnees</b> can become a developing force in Serbia and similar countries in transition. In order to realize this, the establishment of a sustainable support system for highly skilled <b>returnees</b> to Serbia and scientific diaspora members is needed...|$|R
30|$|High rent {{costs in}} recent years have led to the {{eviction}} of many <b>returnees</b> from their residences, forcing them to live in tents, half-constructed buildings, or in the open air (IOM 2017; Kent et al. 2017). In some cases, <b>returnees</b> are forced to move constantly in search of more affordable housing (Samuel Hall et al. 2018). An IOM baseline mobility assessment report (2017) shows that rents have nearly doubled between mid- 2016 and March 2017 in Nangarhar province in Afghanistan, and prices are expected to further increase if the influx of <b>returnees</b> continues. This assessment, which was conducted in Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman, estimates that around 14 % of the <b>returnees</b> lived in tents or open areas, and only 35 % had access to a private durable covered living space (IOM 2017). This assessment also indicates that more than 50 % of <b>returnees</b> in these three provinces live with families or friends (IOM 2017). Another survey conducted by the IOM in Nangarhar province shows that up to 40 % of the Afghan <b>returnees</b> lived in open areas or semi-constructed buildings (IOM 2016).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores how US immigration {{influenced the}} racial conceptions of Brazilian <b>returnees,</b> individuals who {{immigrated to the}} US and subsequently returned to Brazil. Since Brazil was once regarded as a multi-racial utopia and represents a very distinct social environment {{when compared to the}} US, the dissertation objective was to learn how <b>returnees</b> adapted to the US racial system and if they “brought back” US racial ideals to Brazil upon returning. I conducted semi-structured retrospective interviews with 49 Brazilian <b>returnees</b> in Governador Valadares, Brazil, the country’s largest immigrant-sending city to the US to explore how these individuals perceived and navigated racial classification and relations in Brazil and the US before, during, and after the US migration. To more effectively isolate the influence of immigration for <b>returnees,</b> I also interviewed a comparison group of 24 non-migrants. Findings suggest that <b>returnees</b> relied on a transnational racial optic to navigate the US racial system as immigrants and to readapt to the Brazilian racial system after returning to Brazil. I use the term “transnational racial optic” to demonstrate how migration transformed returnees’ observations, interpretations, and understandings of race in Brazil and the US. <b>Returnees</b> felt the US racial system was characterized by more rigid racial classification, overt forms of racism, and pervasive interracial social and residential segregation compared to Brazil. The US migration also influenced returnees’ perceptions of racial stratification in both societies, particularly with regard to the socio-economic positions and behaviors of US and Brazilian blacks. After the US migration, most <b>returnees</b> were not conscious of how their racial classifications or perceptions changed, although the results indicate shifts in their racial and skin tone classifications {{over the course of the}} migration. Furthermore, <b>returnees</b> felt that they did not remit US racial ideals to Brazil after returning. While both <b>returnees</b> and non-migrants thought racism existed in Brazil, <b>returnees,</b> after having lived in the US, were more cognizant of the structural manifestations of racism than non-migrants. This suggests that returnees’ observations of race in the US influenced their perceptions of race in Brazil post-migration, which is indicative of the transnational racial optic...|$|R

40|$|With {{the growing}} number of foreign-educated {{graduates}} returning to China, few studies have been done on what happens when they return, especially those who work in Chinese universities. The purpose of the study is to explore the re-entry experiences of <b>returnees</b> who have been employed in higher education institutions in Yunnan Province, China, from three different perspectives: the perspectives of <b>returnees,</b> non-returnees and administrators via one-to-one interviews. The study assesses what difficulties and challenges these <b>returnees</b> face when they returned to China to work at Chinese academic communities and also make recommendations on how Chinese universities can make use of returnees’ social and cultural capital based on the findings of the study. In this study qualitative and quantitative research methods have been used to collect information from different sources. Qualitative method was adopted as the primary method and quantitative as supporting role. Twenty-four foreign-educated <b>returnees</b> and 11 non-foreign-educated graduates were interviewed. Nine management leaders were also interviewed to explore the organisational perspectives in dealing with the <b>returnees.</b> Simultaneously three different group questionnaires were distributed to these participants to collect quantitative data. Analysis of the data suggested that these <b>returnees</b> encountered challenges in re-adapting into Chinese universities, both academically and culturally, even though they were regarded as having social and cultural capital advantages. The data indicated that <b>returnees</b> had difficulties in utilising their knowledge in Chinese universities. They had limited influence on the universities’ research, teaching, and management or on changing the academic environment. The Chinese academic culture, the administration systems and returnees’ changing of cultural perceptions helped to influence returnees’ re-entry experiences. Among these factors, academic re-adaptation and the bureaucratic system were the two factors that influenced returnees’ experiences most. The <b>returnees</b> reported negative attitudes towards Chinese universities in two areas: the Chinese academic culture; the bureaucratic nature of the Chinese universities. It is argued in this study that if the Chinese government and the management levels of universities want to make use of returnees’ social and cultural capital, universities should build a healthy organisational culture and improve their services to <b>returnees.</b> It is critically important for Chinese universities to establish a more reasonable assessment system to guide research and teaching. Also, in a healthy academic environment, research should not be connected with bureaucratic power. That is, universities’ management systems would focus on professionalism instead of managerialism. Further, establishing a supportive management system will help <b>returnees</b> to re-adapt to their Chinese academic life smoothly. For <b>returnees,</b> it is suggested that they should hold realistic expectations towards Chinese academic and social culture in order to manage issues in re-adaptation. To deal with workplace cultural and sociocultural issues, it is important for them to communicate with colleagues and friends as often as possible, thus to help them become familiar with the cues and norms of the home culture again. Further, <b>returnees</b> would need to actively establish research teams that include both <b>returnees</b> and non-returnee colleagues.
