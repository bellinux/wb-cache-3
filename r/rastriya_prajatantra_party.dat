Such unfair practices demoralised members, including Hitan who had been totally committed to the party.In the aftermath of people’s revolution in 1990, political parties who had been promoting ethnic people’s right began to sprout up across Nepal and in 1991, the Rastriya Janamukti Party was formed under the leadership of Gorebahadur Khapangi Magar. He was regarded as the voice of indigenous and ethnic groups, with membership predominantly coming from ex servicemen, and the indigenous and ethnic people of Nepal, many of whom were previously members of the NC and the Communist Party of Nepal - also known as the United Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML). Hitan was also asked to join but felt that he was unable to leave the NC due to his strong ideology and loyalty to the Party. He instead promised to fight on within the NC for the rights and equality of the Ethnic, Indigenous, Dalit and Muslim societies, and it is evident in his articles that he never hesitated to voice such issues. He used to campaign that the ruling <b>party,</b> <b>Rastriya</b> <b>Prajatantra,</b> should work together with small parties such as Sadbhawana, and Rastriya Janamukti in order to strengthen and promote parliamentary democracy.|$|R

The initial transition phase, backed by the spirit of the 1990 popular movement and restoration of multi-party system in April 1990, promulgation of a new Constitution in November 1990, general elections 1991 and local elections 1992, was smooth in demolishing partyless panchayat structures and setting up democratic institutions. The stability of the obtaining democratic structures is ensured by the Constitution providing for popular sovereignty, constitutional monarchy, multi-party parliamentary system, and fundamental rights of citizens as unamendable (Constitution, 1990).
