The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the use of <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> by private practitioners in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for operative and endodontic procedures and to assess dentists′ attitude towards the use of <b>rubber</b> <b>dam.</b> Materials and Methods: Three senior dental students of the University of Sharjah distributed 200 "closed" surveys among private clinics in the UAE. A total of 151 questionnaires was filled and returned. Data was entered into an electronic database (Microsoft Excel 2003) and the results were statistically analyzed through SPSS Statistics version 18. Results: 64. 5 % of dentists agreed that the use of <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> provides clearer access during restorative treatment and there was a higher clinical standard achieved. However, the majority of these dentists did not use the <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> in actual practice.

Questions were asked about areas where the students used <b>rubber</b> <b>dam,</b> its advantages and difficulties, and whether they agreed or disagreed with {{some aspects of the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>dam.</b> The private school students rated isolation whereas those of the state school selected prevention of aspiration which the top advantage <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> provides. Students of the state school agreed with the opinion that isolation cannot be achieved without <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> and it extended the procedure with a significantly higher ratio compared to the private school. Within the limitations of the present study, it can be concluded that the perceptions of dental students on <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> needs to be improved and strategies should be developed so that this valuable adjunct will comprise one of the indispensable elements of dental care. 1...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} the attitudes towards {{and use of}} <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> by Irish general dental practitioners. Methodology A pre-piloted questionnaire was distributed amongst a group of 600 dentists randomly selected from the Irish Register of Dentists. Replies from dentists working in specialist practice or the hospital dental service were excluded. Dentists were surveyed {{in relation to their}} use of <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> during a variety of operative and root canal treatments, as well as their attitudes to the use of <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> in dental practice. Results A total of 300 replies were considered from a total of 324 that were received. Seventy-seven per cent of respondents (n ¼ 231) worked in general dental practice and 23...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Rubber</b> <b>dam</b> is {{recommended}} for isolating the working field during adhesive dentistry procedures; however, dentists often omit <b>rubber</b> <b>dam,</b> particularly in paediatric dentistry, supposing that it would stress the patient. AIM The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate stress parameters during a standardized dental treatment procedure performed with or without <b>rubber</b> <b>dam.</b> The treatment time was measured as a secondary outcome variable. DESIGN This study was designed as a randomized, controlled, clinical study with 72 patients (6 - 16 years; mean age, 11. 1). During standardized fissure sealing procedures, objective parameters of stress (e. g., skin resistance, breath rate) were recorded. The operator's stress level was measured by pulse rate. Subjective pain (patients) and stress perception (operator) were evaluated by an interview. RESULTS The breath rate was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower and the skin resistance level was significantly higher during treatment with <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> compared to the control group. Subjective pain perception was significantly lower for the test group. The treatment time needed for the fissure sealing procedure was 12. 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{randomised}} controlled {{clinical trial}} was to investigate whether subjective and clinical stress parameters {{in children and adolescents}} differ depending on the isolation technique used (<b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> vs. Cotton roll isolation) during dental treatment. Pit and fissure sealants were applied in 72 patients (6 to 16 years) in a private dental practice. The test group (n = 34) was treated while using <b>rubber</b> <b>dam,</b> the control group (n = 38) while using cotton rolls for the isolation of the operation field. During the treatment period the patients skin resistance, respiratory resistance, pulse and blood pressure was measured on 5 selected time points. Straight after the treat-ment both patients and dentist stated their subjective opinion on the situation during action. In addition the duration of the treatment in total and the length of time the <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> was applied were documented. Subjective answers showed that patients in the test group sensed significantly less pain than those in the control group (p< 0. 05). There was no significant difference referring to contentment with the treatment. Looking at the clinical stress parameters the rubber dam-group revealed no significant difference to the control group with regard to respiratory resistance, skin resistance response (SRR) and pulse. Blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) decreased significantly more and the skin resistance level was significantly higher. In the rubber dam-group this can be interpreted as a considerable sign of relaxation during the treatment. The dentist felt significantly less mental and physical stress during the treatment with <b>rubber</b> <b>dam.</b> Throughout the treatment his pulse was lower than during the treatment carried out using cotton rolls. On average, treatment with <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> took 12. 4 % less time than in the control group. As a result of the distinctions mentioned above it can be concluded, that treatment with <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> -performed by a dentist with experience using this technique- determines less stress for children and adolescents than treatment using cotton rolls. The results of this paper could encourage more dentists to learn the technique of using <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> and to apply this knowledge regularly in their practice as a contribution to a more relaxed atmosphere free of fear...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{technical}} preferences of general dental practitioners when restoring anterior composite restorations. How the level of clinical experience or post-graduate training infuenced their options was also tested. Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed using a questionnaire with general dental practitioners (GDPs) (n= 276) in Southern Brazil. Information regarding post graduation training (specialization, master's or PhD degree) and linical experience (years since completing graduation) were gathered. The options regarding anterior composite restorations (type of composite, adhesive system, light curing unit, polishing procedures and <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> use) were collected. Data were submitted to descriptive analysis and associations were tested. Results: Response rate was 68 % (187). GDPs selected microhybrid composite (52 %) and 2 -step total etch adhesive system (77 %). LED was the preferred method of activation for 72. 8 %. Immediate polishing was preferred by 75 %, using a combination of techniques. Most of the respondents (74. 3 %) did not use <b>rubber</b> <b>dam.</b> More experienced clinicians used more halogen lights (p< 0. 022), performed more light monitoring (p< 0. 001) and were resistant to use <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> (p< 0. 012). Dentists with post-graduation training used 3 -etch-and-rinse system more frequently (p< 0. 04), usually monitored light intensity (p< 0. 014) and placed <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> more frequently (p< 0. 044). Conclusions: Hybrid composite, simplifed adhesives, LED units and immediate polishing were preferred by Southern Brazilian dentists for anterior composite restorations. Few dentists used <b>rubber</b> <b>dam</b> to perform composite restorations in anterior teeth. Clinical experience and post-graduation training infuenced the dentists' choices...|$|R
