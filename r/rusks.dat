Upstairs, Hector strips Katy and ties her to a chair, while Shell feeds Andras his [...] "last supper": <b>rusks</b> and baby milk, the only food he can manage.

500|$|After her {{admission}} to the care home Maison du Lac [...] in January 1985 {{at the age of}} 109, she initially had a highly ritualized daily routine whereby, uniquely among the care home residents, she requested to be woken at 6:45 am and started the day with a long prayer at her window thanking God for being alive and for the beautiful day which was starting, sometimes loudly asking the reason for her longevity and why {{she was the only one}} alive in her family. Seated on her armchair she did gymnastics wearing her stereo headset. Her exercises included flexing and extending the hands ("a distinguished woman must have beautiful hands"), then the legs, and her carers noted that she moved faster than the other residents, who were 30 years younger, despite her blindness. Her breakfast consisted of coffee with milk, and <b>rusks.</b>|$|E

2500|$|A typical Pakistani breakfast, locally called nāshtā (...) , {{consists}} of eggs (boiled/scrambled/fried/omelette), {{a slice of}} loaf bread or roti, parathas, sheermal with tea or lassi, kulcha with chole, qeema (minced meat), fresh seasonal fruits (mangoes, apples, melons, bananas, etc.), milk, honey, butter, jam, shami kebab or nuts.

60|$|Upon this, the {{old woman}} cleared the little table, {{went out of the}} room, and quickly {{returned}} with a tray on which was a dish of little <b>rusks</b> and a small precise pat of butter, cool, symmetrical, white, and plump. The old man who had been standing by the door in one attitude during the whole interview, looking at the mother up-stairs as he had looked at the son down-stairs, went out at the same time, and, after a longer absence, returned with another tray on which was the greater part of a bottle of port wine (which, to judge by his panting, he had brought from the cellar), a lemon, a sugar-basin, and a spice box. With these materials and the aid of the kettle, he filled a tumbler with a hot and odorous mixture, measured out and compounded with as much nicety as a physician's prescription. Into this mixture Mrs Clennam dipped certain of the <b>rusks,</b> and ate them; while {{the old woman}} buttered certain other of the <b>rusks,</b> which were to be eaten alone. When the invalid had eaten all the <b>rusks</b> and drunk all the mixture, the two trays were removed; and the books and the candle, watch, handkerchief, and spectacles were replaced upon the table. She then put on the spectacles and read certain passages aloud from a book--sternly, fiercely, wrathfully--praying that her enemies (she made them by her tone and manner expressly hers) might be put {{to the edge of the}} sword, consumed by fire, smitten by plagues and leprosy, that their bones might be ground to dust, and that they might be utterly exterminated. As she read on, years seemed to fall away from her son like the imaginings of a dream, and all the old dark horrors of his usual preparation for the sleep of an innocent child to overshadow him.|$|E

60|$|It {{was very}} dull {{for the rest}} of us. The Story Girl sat rather sulkily in her corner; she was angry because Felicity would not let her make the <b>rusks,</b> and also, perhaps, a little vexed because she could not charm Great-aunt Eliza with her golden voice and story-telling gift.

6000|$|I feel a glow {{of moral}} rectitude in saying this of her; for, though a perfect pelican to her young, she pecked and cackled (I don't know that {{pelicans}} usually express their emotions in that manner,) most obstreperously, when others invaded her premises; {{and led me}} a weary life, with [...] "George's tea-rusks," [...] "George's foot bath," [...] "George's measles," [...] and [...] "George's mother;" [...] till after a sharp passage of arms and tongues with the matron, she wrathfully packed up her <b>rusks,</b> her son, and herself, and departed, in an ambulance, scolding to the very last.|$|E
60|$|She {{was asked}} {{accordingly}} and said grace without any hesitation, after which she proceeded to eat heartily of the excellent supper Felicity had provided.
