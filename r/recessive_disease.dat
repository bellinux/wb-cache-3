5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to the extent that they accumulate copper.|$|E
25|$|Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT or A-T), also {{referred}} to as ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome or Louis–Bar syndrome, is a rare, neurodegenerative, autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> causing severe disability. Ataxia refers to poor coordination and telangiectasia to small dilated blood vessels, both of which are hallmarks of the disease.|$|E
25|$|Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome* is an {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> {{which results}} in mature neutrophils being unable to migrate from the bone marrow into the blood. Affected pups have chronic infections and fail to thrive. Other symptoms can include stunted growth and a ferret like facial appearance. The disease is common in Border collies.|$|E

25|$|Since CAH is an {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> <b>disease,</b> {{most children}} with CAH {{are born to}} parents unaware of the risk and with no family history. Each child will have a 25% chance of being born with the disease. Families typically wish to minimize the degree of virilization of a girl. There is no known prenatal harm to a male fetus from CAH, so treatment can begin at birth.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme which mediates 11β-hydroxylase {{activity}} {{is now known}} as P450c11β since {{it is one of the}} cytochrome P450 oxidase enzymes located in the inner mitochondrial membrane of cells of the adrenal cortex. It is coded by a gene at 8q21-22. Like the other forms of CAH, a number of different defective alleles for the gene have been identified, producing varying degrees of impaired 11β-hydroxylase activity. Also like the other forms of CAH, 11β-OH CAH is inherited as an autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
25|$|Trichothiodystrophy (TTD) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> whose symptoms span {{across multiple}} systems and can vary greatly in severity. The incidence rate of TTD {{is estimated to be}} 1.2 per million in Western Europe. Milder cases cause sparse and brittle hair, which is {{due to the lack of}} sulfur, an element that is part of the matrix proteins that give hair its strength. More severe cases cause delayed development, significant intellectual disability, and recurrent infection; the most severe cases see death at infancy or early childhood.|$|E

25|$|Friedreich ataxia (FA) is {{the most}} common genetic cause of ataxia in children. Like A-T, FA is a <b>recessive</b> <b>disease,</b> {{appearing}} in families without a history of the disorder. FA is caused by mutation in the frataxin gene, most often an expansion of a naturally occurring repetition of the three nucleotide bases GAA from the usual 5-33 repetitions of this trinucleotide sequence to greater than 65 repeats on each chromosome. Most often the ataxia appears between 10 and 15 years of age, and differs from A-T by the absence of telangiectasia and oculomotor apraxia, a normal alpha fetalprotein, and the frequent presence of scoliosis, absent tendon reflexes, and abnormal features on the EKG. Individuals with FA manifest difficulty standing in one place that is much enhanced by closure of the eyes (Romberg sign) that is not so apparent in those with A-T – even though those with A-T may have greater difficulty standing in one place with their eyes open.|$|E

50|$|There are {{examples}} of eugenic acts that managed to lower the prevalence of <b>recessive</b> <b>diseases,</b> although not influencing the prevalence of heterozygote carriers of those diseases. The elevated prevalence of certain genetically transmitted diseases among the Ashkenazi Jewish population (Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis, Canavan's disease, and Gaucher's disease), has been decreased in current populations by the application of genetic screening.|$|R
5000|$|In humans, many genetic traits or {{diseases}} are classified simply as [...] "dominant" [...] or [...] "recessive". Especially with so-called <b>recessive</b> <b>diseases,</b> which are indeed {{a factor of}} recessive genes, but can oversimplify the underlying molecular basis and lead to misunderstanding {{of the nature of}} dominance. For example, the <b>recessive</b> genetic <b>disease</b> phenylketonuria (PKU) results from any of a large number (>60) of alleles at the gene locus for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Many of these alleles produce little or no PAH, as a result of which the substrate phenylalanine (Phe) and its metabolic byproducts accumulate in the central nervous system and can cause severe intellectual disability if untreated.|$|R
2500|$|Hexokinase {{deficiency}} is {{a genetic}} autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> that causes Chronic Haemolytic Anaemia. [...] Chronic Haemolytic Anaemia {{is caused by}} a mutation in the HK gene, which codes for the HK enzyme. The mutation causes a reduction of the HK activity, which causes hexokinase deficiency.|$|E
2500|$|Activation of trypsin from {{proteolytic}} cleavage of trypsinogen in {{the pancreas}} {{can lead to}} a series of events that cause pancreatic self-digestion, resulting in pancreatitis. [...] One consequence of the autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> cystic fibrosis is a deficiency in transport of trypsin and other digestive enzymes from the pancreas. [...] This leads to the disorder termed meconium ileus. This disorder involves intestinal obstruction (ileus) due to overly thick meconium, which is normally broken down by trypsin and other proteases, then passed in feces.|$|E
2500|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} is {{the most}} common life-limiting autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> among people of European heritage. In the United States, about 30,000 individuals have CF; most are diagnosed by six months of age. In Canada, about 4,000 people have CF. Around 1 in 25 people of European descent, and one in 30 of Caucasian Americans, is a carrier of a CF mutation. Although CF is less common in these groups, roughly one in 46 Hispanics, one in 65 Africans, and one in 90 Asians carry at least one abnormal CFTR gene. [...] Ireland has the world's highest prevalence of CF, at one in 1353.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the organic}} acidemias result from {{defective}} autosomal genes for various enzymes important to amino acid metabolism. Neurological and physiological harm is caused by this impaired ability to synthesize a key enzyme required to break down a specific amino acid, or group of amino acids, resulting in acidemia and toxicity to specific organs systems. Most are inherited as autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>diseases.</b>|$|R

She also first hypothesized that CF was a <b>recessive</b> <b>disease</b> and first used pancreatic enzyme replacement to treat affected children. In 1952, Paul di Sant’Agnese discovered abnormalities in sweat electrolytes; a sweat test was developed and improved over the next decade.|$|E
2500|$|CF {{is caused}} by a {{mutation}} in the gene cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation, ΔF508, is a deletion (Δ signifying deletion) of three nucleotides that results in a loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position on the protein. This mutation accounts for two-thirds (66–70%) of CF cases worldwide and 90% of cases in the United States; however, over 1500 other mutations [...] can produce CF. Although most people have two working copies (alleles) of the CFTR gene, only one is needed to prevent cystic fibrosis. CF develops when neither allele can produce a functional CFTR protein. Thus, CF is considered an autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The disease most {{commonly}} associated with mutations in SCNN1A is the multi-system form of type I pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B) that was first characterized by A. Hanukoglu as an autosomal <b>recessive</b> <b>disease.</b> This is a syndrome of unresponsiveness to aldosterone in patients that have high serum levels of aldosterone but suffer from symptoms of aldosterone deficiency with {{a high risk of}} mortality due to severe salt loss. Initially, this disease was thought to be [...] a result of a mutation in the [...] mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) that binds aldosterone. But homozygosity mapping in 11 affected families revealed that the disease is associated with two loci on chromosome 12p13.1-pter and chromosome 16p12.2-13 that include the genes for SCNN1A and SCNN1B and SCNN1G respectively. Sequencing of the ENaC genes identified mutation in affected patients, and functional expression of the mutated cDNAs further confirmed that identified mutations lead to the loss of activity of ENaC.|$|E
