5|$|As the IX Corps {{gave up on}} Triangle Hill, the PVA 31st Division of the 12th Corps was in {{position}} to take back Sniper Ridge. Under the cover of inclement weather, an assault was launched by the 92nd <b>Regiment</b> at 4pm on November 11. The Chinese soon drove off the defending 1st Battalion of the ROK 32nd <b>Regiment,</b> but Chung Il-kwon immediately replied with a counterattack by the ROK 17th <b>Regiment</b> of the ROK 2nd Infantry Division on the dawn of November 12. After two hours of fighting, the 1st Battalion of the ROK 17th <b>Regiment</b> recaptured two-thirds of Sniper Ridge and inflicted heavy casualties on the PVA 92nd <b>Regiment.</b> The 31st Division relieved the 92nd <b>Regiment</b> with its 93rd <b>Regiment</b> to launch another assault on November 14, but the ROK 17th <b>Regiment</b> responded by committing all units to blunt the attack.
