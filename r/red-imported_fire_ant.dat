40|$|Background: Introduced organisms {{can alter}} {{ecosystems}} by disrupting natural ecological relationships. For example, red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> (Solenopsis invicta) have disrupted native arthropod communities {{throughout much of}} their introduced range. By competing {{for many of the}} same food resources as insectivorous vertebrates, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> also have the potential to disrupt vertebrate communities. Methodology/Principal Findings: To explore the effects of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> on a native insectivorous vertebrate, we compared the reproductive success and strategies of eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) inhabiting territories with different abundances of <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> We also created experimental dyads of adjacent territories comprised of one territory with artificially reduced <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance (treated) and one territory that was unmanipulated (control). We found that more bluebird young fledged from treated territories than from adjacent control territories. <b>Fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance also explained significant variation in two measures of reproductive success across the study population: number of fledglings and hatching success of second clutches. Furthermore, the likelihood of bluebird parents re-nesting in the same territory was negatively influenced by the abundance of foraging <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> and parents nesting in territories with experimentally reduced abundances of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> produced male-biased broods relative to pairs in adjacent control territories.

Experimental evidence has shown that red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may have a detrimental impact on native species, both invertebrate and vertebrate, and that these impacts may be both direct and indirect. This segment of research was designed to determine if <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> {{have a negative impact}} on Florida grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarumfloridanus) populations at Avon Park Air Force Bombing Range, Florida. The sampling reported herein was conducted during June and October, 1997, and all analyses are restricted to data collected during those periods. As assessed by baits, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> were dominant on about half the sites, and absent from others. In particular, OQ Range sites tended to have fewer <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> present, while Delta Trail sites were more heavily infested, although there were exceptions. June <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance was strongly negatively correlated with both native ant abundance (r = - 0. 743, P = 0. 006) and native ant species richness (r = - 0. 730, P = 0. 007). October <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance was strongly negatively correlated with both native ant abundance (r = - 0. 690, P = 0. 013) and native ant species richness (r = - 0. 736, P = 0. 006). The patterns of <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> abundance as assessed by pitfalls were very similar to those determined from bait sampling.

Releases of fire-ant-decapitating phorid flies {{have been made in}} several southern states. Mass rearing and additional releases of these flies {{are underway}} now. Experimental releases of a disease-causing protozoan have been made in ten southern states. A number of least-toxic <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> control materials are discussed. Sources for some materials are provided in the Resources section. Physical controls such as hot water, steam, and ant traps are discussed. <b>Fire</b> <b>Ant</b> Ecology and Biological Controls The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis invicta, arrived in the U. S. from central Brazil between 1933 and 1945 by hitchhiking on ship cargo. Though S. invicta has become quite a pest, not all <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> species have achieved pest status. The black imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis richteri, arrived before the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> sometime around 1918. S. invicta has out-competed its black cousins and also crossed with them, creating hybrids between the two species (1). The Texas red ant, S. geminata, a native American <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> found in much of Texas, is not considered a pest. The red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> prospers in open sunny areas such as cropland, pastures, and urban lawns. It is an insect of disturbed, low-diversity habitats.

In particular, competition between introduced and native species can strongly influence the distribution and spread of exotic species {{and in some cases}} competition among introduced species can be important. The Caribbean crazy ant, Nylanderia fulva, was recently introduced to the Gulf Coast of Texas, and appears to be spreading inland. It has been hypothesized that competition with the red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ant,</b> Solenopsis invicta, may be an important factor in the spread of crazy ants. We investigated the potential of interspecific competition among these two introduced ants by measuring interspecific aggression between Caribbean crazy ant workers and workers of Solenopsis invicta. Specifically, we examined the effect of body size and diet on individual-level aggressive interactions among crazy <b>ant</b> workers and <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> We found that differences in diet did not alter interactions between crazy ant workers from different nests, but carbohydrate level did {{play an important role in}} antagonistic interactions with <b>fire</b> ants: crazy <b>ants</b> on low sugar diets were more aggressive and less likely to be killed in aggressive encounters with <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> We found that large <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> engaged in fewer fights with crazy <b>ants</b> than small <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> but <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> size affected neither <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> nor crazy ant mortality.

Transplanted <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies were favored by disturbance. In the absence of disturbance and on their own, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> do not invade the forest habitats of native ants. Our results demonstrate that <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> are “passengers” rather than “drivers” of ecological change. We propose that <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may be representative of other invasive species that would be better described as disturbance specialists. Current pest management and conservation strategies should be reassessed to better account for the central role of human impacts in the process of biological invasion...|$|R
50|$|How {{formic acid}} {{acts as an}} {{antidote}} against the much more toxic <b>fire</b> <b>ant's</b> venom is unknown. <b>Fire</b> <b>ant</b> venom {{is a mixture of}} toxic alkaloids and proteins that presumably enable the alkaloids to enter rival ants’ cells. Each alkaloid in the <b>fire</b> <b>ant’s</b> venom, including solenopsin, has a six-membered heterocyclic ring with fat-soluble side chains. The researchers who discovered the antidote property of formic acid in crazy ants speculate that the formic acid denatures the proteins in <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> venom. Another possibility is that the nitrogen on an alkaloid’s heterocyclic ring is protonated, rendering the ionic molecule less lipophilic, thus less likely to penetrate the tawny crazy ant’s cells.|$|R
40|$|The {{preference}} of red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> Solenopsis invicta, for microen-capsulated (MC) pyriproxifen based corn grit baits (P-bait) {{was conducted in}} laboratory and field conditions. A positive correlation between the micro-encapsulation rate and water tolerance ability of P-bait was observed. A 20 % increment of water tolerance ability of P-baits was observed when P-baits were microencapsulated with 5 % poly-ε-caprolactone. The microencapsulated and wet P-baits were less preferred than normal P-baits by the <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> either in laboratory or field conditions. Based upon these results, poly-ε-caprolactone coated <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> baits cannot be considered as perfect <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> baits.

40|$|Abstract-Three {{potential}} {{biological control}} organisms, a fungus Beauveria bassiana, a protozoan Thelohania solenopsis and a parasite, Solenopsis dnguerrei are being evaluated {{in the field}} to suppress <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> populations. All of these organisms have some detrimental effect on <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> in the laboratory but little is known what effect they have on field populations. Although B. bassiana gave complete mortality of ants in the laboratory, no mortality was observed when it was mixed with the potting soil and <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> were exposed. This fungus did seem to stimulate colony movement. If the soil was sterilized, then this fungus was more lethal to the ants, especially the brood and queens. The fungus was effective against ants in media with little or no organic matter such as vermiculite or sand. However, for practical control of <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> in potting media, B. bassiana does not work. In the laboratory colonies infected protozoan with this disease Thelohania solenopsis quickly died and it was very effective in the field in reducing the size and number of <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies. However, much more research needs to be done before this disease can be introduced into the United States. Still this organism appears to have great promise as a potential biological control organism of <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> It has been reported in the literature that the parasite Solenopsis dnguerrei will kill the queen, and is very specific for <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> However, it is cyclic and {{does not seem to be}} very lethal to the <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> colonies in Argentina. Although it probably has a draining effect on the host colony...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The response of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) to the presence of red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> (Solenopsis invicta) during the first 6 days post-hatching was examined in a 9 -week-field experiment during spring and summer 1993 in southeastern Texas. Behavior of a focal animal was recorded continuously for 15 min in a 30 M 2 area from which <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> had been removed and in a similar, adjacent area with natural densities of <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Activities of a focal animal were categorized as: response to <b>fire</b> <b>ants,</b> locomotion, inactive, sleeping, and pecking at food. Results suggested red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> can alter the daily activity budgets of northern bobwhite chicks. Time spent responding directly to <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> affected {{the amount of time spent}} performing other behaviors such as locomotion, sleeping, and pecking at food. The degree to which chick behavior was altered depended on season, which affected ant activity levels, and age of the chick, which influenced allotment of time to all activities, including response to <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Shifts in the daily activity budgets of chicks during the first 6 days post-hatching may have cumulative effects that manifest themselves later in life. Ultimately, <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may exert natural selection pressures affecting seasonality of nesting in northern bobwhites and other ground-nesting birds...|$|R
25|$|Mortality {{rates have}} been well {{observed}} in birds; there have been instances where no young have survived to adulthood in areas with high <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> density. Many birds including cliff nesting swallows, ducks, egrets, quail, and terns {{have been affected by}} red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants.</b> Ground nesting birds, particularly the least tern (Sterna antillarum), are vulnerable to <b>fire</b> <b>ant</b> attacks. The impact of red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> on colonial breeding birds is especially severe; waterbirds can experience a mortality rate of 100%, although this factor was lower for early-nesting birds. Brood survival decreases in American cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) if they are exposed to foraging workers. Songbird nest survival decreases in areas with red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> present, but survival rates in white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) nests increase from 10% to 31% and 7% to 13% whenever <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> are not present or when they are unable to attack them. Red imported <b>fire</b> <b>ants</b> may indirectly contribute to low brood survival in the Attwater's prairie chicken. It was first thought that the ants were linked to the decline of overwintering birds such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), but a later study showed that ant eradication efforts using the pesticide Mirex, which was known to have toxic side effects, was largely to blame.|$|R
