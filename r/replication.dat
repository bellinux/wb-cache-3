These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E

40|$|Explanatory {{factors are}} {{theoretically}} interesting classifications or variables manipulated by researchers {{in order to}} determine their influence on an outcome (commonly called the dependent variable). <b>Replications</b> factors are those whose levels are sampled by the researcher as examples of a general class of cases or as vehicles for a manipulation. <b>Replications</b> factors are used in research in communication and social psychology to avoid confounds and to increase generalizability. This dissertation reports two studies designed to assess research practices related to <b>replications.</b> The 1991 and 1992 volumes of 4 social science journals (Human Communication Research, Communication Monographs, Journal of Communication, and Journal of Experimental Social Psychology) were reviewed. Taken together, Study 1 and Study 2 demonstrated the importance of adapting design and analysis strategies to the requirements of experiments with <b>replications</b> factors. Study 1 demonstrated that <b>replications</b> are important in social research: A large number of studies in the literature included <b>replications,</b> and many more should have done so. Researchers often explicitly acknowledged the role of <b>replications</b> in strengthening their claims through increased generality and control of potential confounds. Study 2 showed that including <b>replications</b> {{is only part of the}} solution to problems of generalization. Researchers often chose forms of analysis that failed to account for replications-related variability. Most commonly <b>replications</b> were ignored in analyses, a strategy that results in a loss of control over Type I error rates. Another common choice, treating <b>replications</b> as fixed effects, results in inflated Type I error rates. When <b>replications</b> are treated as a random factor, it is important to remember that both <b>replications</b> and subjects contribute to the power of the study. Two final cautions are given in Chapter 4 : (1) Because <b>replications</b> are understood as samples of possible materials, the problem of how to select materials for study needs to be addressed; and (2) because treating <b>replications</b> as random often creates substantial analytic complexity, more careful consideration needs to be given to the design of experiments with <b>replications...</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{principles}} of an experiment is the repetition of its treatments so that treatments cannot be statistically compared without repetition. Using enough <b>replications</b> has a great impact on scientific validity, but in most cases, not enough attention is paid. Generally, selecting the number of <b>replications</b> is done according to previous experiments at similar conditions, regarding the number of <b>replications</b> is specifically depended on the experiment conditions. In this study effort has been made to investigate the number of treatment <b>replications</b> effect on the validity of experimental results by considering agricultural experiments. The results have shown that by increasing test error fluctuations and reducing the difference between the treatments that must be found to achieve a minimum level of significance and an acceptable test power, a minimum number of <b>replications</b> will be required. And the minimum number of required <b>replications</b> declines by controlling test error fluctuations. Therefore, under the same conditions, fewer <b>replications</b> are required for experiments under controlled conditions such as growth chamber experiments. Fewer <b>replications</b> will reduce test power and only through increasing the number of <b>replications,</b> significance level and test power can be simultaneously maintained at high level...|$|R
5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits {{the progression of}} topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex after it has broken the DNA chain for <b>replication,</b> preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of <b>replication.</b> It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E

40|$|The {{precision}} of evaluation for agronomic traits {{is very important}} in the field experiments to determine the genetic potential of genotypes or effect of treatments. The {{precision of}} the experiment mainly depends on the number of <b>replications.</b> The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of number of <b>replications</b> on the precision of genotype evaluation, estimation of variance components and on the heritability for agronomic traits in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.). In this study, nine genotypes of flax were evaluated for different traits, using a randomized complete block design with 8 <b>replications.</b> The results showed that the reduction of error variance due to increasing the number of <b>replications</b> mainly depended upon the type of the trait. For evaluation and estimation of heritability for number of seedlings /m 2 and plant height, 3 and 2 <b>replications</b> were suitable, respectively. The results also showed that using more than 2 <b>replications</b> had no considerable effect on the prescision of evaluation, nor on the increase of heritability for days to maturity. Based upon the results, for evaluation of the number of capsules per plant, 3 or 4, and for seeds per capsules, 4 <b>replications</b> can be suggested. For seed yield that is the most important economic trait in flax, a relatively constant estimated mean and broad-sense heritability were obtained with 4 to 8 replications;however, using 2 or 3 <b>replications</b> over-estimated the mean of the triat (approximately 11 %) and under-estimated the broad-sense heritability about 27 % and 10 %, respectively. With 2 <b>replications,</b> the estimated mean and broad-sense heritability for seed yield were 2017. 6 kg/ha and 72. 1 %, respectively. Gain from selection for seed yield based on evaluation of genotypes with 2, 3 and 8 <b>replications</b> was estimated as 787, 796 and 798 kg/ha, respectively. Therefore, it seems that 2 <b>replications</b> can also be used for seed yield evaluation of genotypes in breeding programs of flax...|$|R

5|$|Homologous {{recombination}} {{requires the}} presence of an identical or nearly identical sequence {{to be used as a}} template for repair of the break. The enzymatic machinery responsible for this repair process is nearly identical to the machinery responsible for chromosomal crossover during meiosis. This pathway allows a damaged chromosome to be repaired using a sister chromatid (available in G2 after DNA <b>replication)</b> or a homologous chromosome as a template. DSBs caused by the <b>replication</b> machinery attempting to synthesize across a single-strand break or unrepaired lesion cause collapse of the <b>replication</b> fork and are typically repaired by recombination.|$|E
5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA <b>replication,</b> causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in <b>replication.</b> Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and <b>replication,</b> other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E

5|$|RNA viruses: <b>Replication</b> {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm.

All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of eukaryotic genes are stored {{on a set}} of large, linear chromosomes. The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome. DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin. The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones, as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself, regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression. In addition to genes, eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division: <b>replication</b> origins, telomeres and the centromere. <b>Replication</b> origins are the sequence regions where DNA <b>replication</b> is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome. Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA <b>replication.</b> The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process. The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division.|$|E
