5|$|The first rhodocenium-containing {{side-chain}} polymers {{were prepared}} through controlled polymerization {{techniques such as}} reversible addition−fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT) and <b>ring-opening</b> metathesis polymerisation (ROMP).|$|E
25|$|The second {{route is}} <b>ring-opening</b> {{polymerization}} of laurolactam at 260-300˚C. Ring opening {{can be carried}} out by cationic or anionic initiators, although cationic initiators have not been used commercially due to the product being less stable and oxidized relatively quickly in comparison to those produced by activated anionic polymerization (monomer casting). <b>Ring-opening</b> polymerization is the preferred route for commercial production.|$|E
25|$|This {{instability}} {{correlates with}} its high reactivity, explaining {{the ease of}} its <b>ring-opening</b> reactions (see Chemical properties).|$|E
25|$|The {{other method}} {{involves}} the <b>ring-opening</b> reaction of an epoxide with amines, followed by ring closing with the Mitsunobu reaction.|$|E
25|$|Certain N-substituted azirines with {{electron}} withdrawing {{groups on}} both carbons form azomethine ylides in an electrocyclic thermal or photochemical <b>ring-opening</b> reaction. These ylides can be trapped with a suitable dipolarophile in a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition.|$|E
25|$|Aziridines are {{reactive}} substrates in <b>ring-opening</b> reactions {{with many}} nucleophiles {{due to their}} ring strain. Alcoholysis and aminolysis are basically the reverse reactions of the cyclizations. Carbon nucleophiles such as organolithium reagents and organocuprates are also effective.|$|E
25|$|A second Mitsunobu {{reaction}} then {{forms the}} aziridine 14 available for <b>ring-opening</b> reaction with 3-pentanol catalyzed by boron trifluoride to ether 15. In {{the final step}} the BOC group is removed (HCl) and phosphoric acid added to objective 16.|$|E
25|$|The {{toxicology}} of {{a particular}} aziridine compound depends on its structure and activity, although sharing the general characteristics of aziridines. As electrophiles, aziridines are subject to attack and <b>ring-opening</b> by endogenous nucleophiles such as nitrogenous bases in DNA base pairs, resulting in potential mutagenicity.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{conversion}} of precursor polymers {{is a more}} effective method for synthesizing long polyacetylene chains. In the Durham-precursor route, polymers are prepared via <b>ring-opening</b> metathesis polymerization, and a subsequent heat-induced reverse Diels-Alder reaction yields the final polymer, {{as well as a}} volatile side product.|$|E
25|$|To {{synthesize}} dexamethasone, 16β-methylprednisolone acetate is dehydrated to the 9,11-dehydro derivative. This is then {{reacted with}} {{a source of}} hypobromite, such as basic N-bromosuccinimide, to form the 9α-bromo-11β-hydrin derivative, which is then ring-closed to an epoxide. A <b>ring-opening</b> reaction with hydrogen fluoride in tetrahydrofuran gives dexamethasone.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocene reacts readily with {{butyllithium}} to give 1,1′-dilithioferrocene, {{which in}} turn is a versatile nucleophile. But reaction of ferrocene with t-BuLi produces monolithioferrocene only. These approaches are especially useful methods to introduce main group functionality, e.g. using S8, chlorophosphines or chlorosilanes. The strained compounds undergo <b>ring-opening</b> polymerization.|$|E
25|$|The Rosseinsky {{group showed}} that the {{carboxylic}} acids behave as Brønsted acidic catalysts, facilitating (in the copper cases) the <b>ring-opening</b> methanolysis of a small, cavityaccessible epoxide at up to 65% yield. These researchers point out that superior homogeneous catalysts exist, but emphasize that the catalyst formed here is unique to the MOF environment, thus representing an interesting proof of concept.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, ammonia {{can act as}} a {{nucleophile}} in substitution reactions. Amines can {{be formed}} by the reaction of ammonia with alkyl halides, although the resulting -NH2 group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution, and neutralises the hydrogen halide formed. Methylamine is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with chloromethane, and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare racemic alanine in 70% yield. Ethanolamine is prepared by a <b>ring-opening</b> reaction with ethylene oxide: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce diethanolamine and triethanolamine.|$|E
25|$|Polyacetylene can be {{synthesized}} by <b>ring-opening</b> metathesis polymerization (ROMP) from cyclooctatetraene, {{a material}} easier to handle than the acetylene monomer. This synthetic route {{also provides a}} facile method for adding solubilizing groups to the polymer while maintaining the conjugation. Robert Grubbs and coworkers synthesized a variety of polyacetylene derivatives with linear and branched alkyl chains. Polymers with linear groups such as n-octyl had high conductivity but low solubility, while highly branched tert-butyl groups increased solubility but decreased conjugation due to polymer twisting to avoid steric crowding. They obtained soluble and conductive polymers with sec-butyl and neopentyl groups, because the methylene (CH2) unit directly connected to the polymer reduces steric crowding and prevents twisting.|$|E
2500|$|One {{application}} of a <b>ring-opening</b> reaction in asymmetric synthesis is that of trimethylsilylazide [...] with an asymmetric ligand in scheme 2 in an organic synthesis of oseltamivir: ...|$|E
2500|$|One method {{involves}} the <b>ring-opening</b> reaction of an epoxide with sodium azide, followed by organic {{reduction of the}} azide with triphenylphosphine accompanied by expulsion of nitrogen gas: ...|$|E
2500|$|Epoxides undergo <b>ring-opening</b> upon {{treatment}} with LiBHEt3 {{to give the}} alcohol. With unsymmetrical epoxides, the reaction can proceed with high regio- and stereo- selectivity, favoring attack at the least hindered position: ...|$|E
2500|$|The π {{bonds in}} COT react as usual for olefins, {{rather than as}} {{aromatic}} ring systems. Mono- and polyepoxides can be generated by reaction of COT with peroxy acids or with dimethyldioxirane. Various other addition reactions are also known. [...] Furthermore, polyacetylene can be synthesized via the <b>ring-opening</b> polymerization of cyclooctatetraene. COT itself—and also analogs with side-chains—have been used as metal ligands and in sandwich compounds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transformation}} that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 occurs in two steps. First, 7-dehydrocholesterol is photolyzed by ultraviolet {{light in a}} 6-electron conrotatory <b>ring-opening</b> electrocyclic reaction; the product is previtaminD3. Second, previtaminD3 spontaneously isomerizes to vitaminD3 (cholecalciferol) in an antarafacial sigmatropic [...] hydride shift. At room temperature, the transformation of previtaminD3 to vitamin D3 in an organic solvent takes about 12 days to complete. The conversion of previtaminD3 to vitamin D3 in the skin is about 10 times faster than in an organic solvent.|$|E
2500|$|Ethylene oxide, called oxirane by IUPAC, is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula [...] It is a cyclic ether and the simplest epoxide: a three-membered ring consisting of one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms. Ethylene oxide is a colorless and flammable gas with a faintly sweet odor. [...] Because it is a strained ring, ethylene oxide easily participates {{in a number}} of addition reactions that result in <b>ring-opening.</b> Ethylene oxide is isomeric with acetaldehyde and with vinyl alcohol. Ethylene oxide is industrially produced by oxidation of ethylene in the presence of silver catalyst.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{the tobacco}} smoke procarcinogen benzopyrene involves three distinct steps [...] the introduction of an epoxide group in the 7,8-position, its hydration to a vicinal diol {{and the introduction of}} an epoxide in the 9,10-position. [...] In the first step, a cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) catalysed oxidation produces several products including (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-epoxide. [...] The enzyme epoxide hydrolase, then hydrates the epoxide ring to yield the vicinal diol (...) -benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol, which is then oxidised by cytochrome P450 oxidase again forming the mutagen and carcinogen (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide. [...] This diol epoxide covalently binds to DNA by a <b>ring-opening</b> to alkylate the nucleobase forming a distorted structure, as shown at right, with intercalation of a pyrene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moiety between the base pairs favouring π-stacking; these distortions have been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure studies. [...] Aflatoxin has a similar mechanism of action, though its binding is through the N7, rather than the N2, position of guanine. [...] Multiple stereochemical outcomes are possible from these transformations. [...] The anti stereoisomer (shown here) and its enantiomer are the ultimate carcinogens from benzopyrene, but the syn isomers are also produced.|$|E
2500|$|Silane {{pyrolysis}} gives polymeric {{species and}} finally elemental silicon and hydrogen; indeed ultrapure silicon is commercially {{produced by the}} pyrolysis of silane. While the thermal decomposition of alkanes starts by the breaking of a C–H or C–C bond {{and the formation of}} radical intermediates, polysilanes decompose by eliminating silenes :SiH2 or :SiHR, as the activation energy of this process (~210kJ/mol) is much less than the Si–Si and Si–H bond energies. While pure silanes do not react with pure water or dilute acids, traces of alkali catalyse immediate hydrolysis to hydrated silicon dioxide. If the reaction is carried out in methanol, controlled solvolysis results in the products SiH2(OMe)2, SiH(OMe)3, and Si(OMe)4. The Si–H bond also adds to alkenes, a reaction which proceeds slowly and speeds up with increasing substitution of the silane involved. At 450°C, silane participates in an addition reaction with acetone, as well as a <b>ring-opening</b> reaction with ethylene oxide. Direct reaction of the silanes with chlorine or bromine results in explosions at room temperature, but the reaction of silane with bromine at −80°C is controlled and yields bromosilane and dibromosilane. The monohalosilanes may be formed by reacting silane with the appropriate hydrogen halide with an Al2X6 catalyst, or by reacting silane with a solid silver halide in a heated flow reactor: ...|$|E
2500|$|The second {{protective}} {{group in}} 26 (acetal, acid hydrolysis) was reconverted to the ketone in 27. The monooxime 28 (at the more hindered ketone group) was synthesised from the dioxime by selective hydrolysis (nitrous acid / acetic acid [...] ). The new nitrogen atom {{is also the}} second nitrogen atom required for the AD building block. Both the cyclopentene ring and the cyclohexenone ring were oxidized next in an ozonolysis (ozone) forming triketone 29, an aldol condensation of the 1,5-dicarbonyl unit (pyrrolidine acetate) formed cyclohexene 30 with tosylation of the oxime group, a second oxidation with periodic acid cleaves the cyclohexene ring and diazomethane esterifies the resulting carboxylic acid group in 31. A Beckmann rearrangement (methanol, sodium polystyrene sulfonate 2 hrs, 170°C) took place next to lactam 32 (not isolated) which reacted further to the tetracycle 33 called alpha-corrnorsterone in an amine-carbonyl condensation - aldol condensation cascade. This compound resisted [...] <b>ring-opening</b> of the lactam group due to incorrect stereochemistry of the propionic ester side-chain. The alpha compound was therefore converted its epimer 34 by first equilibrating in excess base followed by reacidifiying and diazomethane treatment. This epimer was then converted to the 35 by the simultaneous action of methanol and thiophenol. This ensured the differentiation of what will become the imidazole tail. [...] The [...] Ozonolysis gave aldehyde 36 with ammonia converting the thioester into an amide group and aldehyde reduction (sodium borohydride) followed by mesylation and bromination (lithium bromide) gave the bromide 37 with conversion of the amide group into a nitrile group as the completed AD section.|$|E

50|$|Examples of {{monomers}} that undergo radical ROP include vinyl substituted cyclic monomers, methylene substituted cyclic monomers, bicyclobutanes, spiro monomers (which undergo double <b>ring-opening).</b> Degradable polyester can be synthesized via radical <b>ring-opening</b> homo- and copolymerization.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is a type}} of step-growth, {{condensation}} polymerization whereas the other metathesis polymerization reaction, <b>ring-opening</b> metathesis polymerization is a chain-growth, addition polymerization.
