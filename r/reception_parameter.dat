30|$|Cognitive {{radio is}} a {{paradigm}} for wireless communication in which either a WSP or a wireless node changes its transmission or <b>reception</b> <b>parameters</b> to communicate efficiently avoiding interference with licensed or unlicensed users[1]. The term was initially applied to extending software radios with a self awareness about its characteristics and requirements, {{in order to}} determine an appropriate radio etiquette to be used[2, 3]. This alteration of parameters is based on the active monitoring of several factors in the external and internal radio environment, such as radio frequency spectrum, user behavior and network state. In a network supporting cognitive radio, secondary users (SUs) opportunistically use the spectrum that is normally assigned to primary users (PUs) but not being used at a particular time and geographic location. Thus, a secondary user must leave the channel once detecting the presence of a licensed user. At the same time, the SU will scan all other channels and handoff to another unused one if available; otherwise, its communication is interrupted. Once interrupted, the SU can either leave the system or wait in a queue so that its connection is terminated or suspended. Some concerns on unlicensed spectrum usage and performance analysis of cognitive radio networks are discussed in[4, 5].|$|R

Therefore, a radio signal can be jammed or interfered, which leads to the corruption and loss of the message. In this study, we suggest a new method of detection of that predictable attack by the application of the statistical process control (SPC). The SPC can be the key element of the detection of jamming attack, applied on the packet drop ratio (PDR) which refers as the number of dropped packets to the total of packets sent. The assimilation of this metric shows the nonconforming fraction.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of {{multimedia}} applications over the wireless Internet, the demand for radio spectral resources has increased significantly. Referring to frequency spectrum allocations in Malaysia, major parts of spectrum have been assigned for government and commercial use. Despite the spectrum scarcity in meeting the demands for multimedia services, it was found from previous studies that most of the spectrum is actually not being utilised efficiently. Henceforth, lots of researches have been conducted to exploit this underutilised spectrum opportunistically without affecting the incumbents operations. Through the enabling Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology, Cognitive Radio (CR) has been proposed to solve the inefficient spectrum utilisation problems. CR is an adaptive, intelligent radio and network technology that has the ability to detect available vacant channels in radio frequency spectrum and change its particular transmission or <b>reception</b> <b>parameters</b> for efficient communication link achieved.

Next, Pseudorandom Multiband Frequency Switching is proposed for seamless frequency agility provision. For proof of concept, the proposed system is evaluated on several multimedia signals transmission. The results showed that the minimal time duration for each frequency switching of the system is approximately 1 second which resulted 20 dB for peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) achievement.

40|$|Cognitive {{radio is}} a {{technology}} for wireless communication in which either a network or a wireless node changes its transmission or <b>reception</b> <b>parameters</b> to communicate efficiently avoiding interference with licensed or unlicensed users. The spectrum sharing network {{consists of a}} pair of primary users (PUs) and a pair of cognitive users (CRs). The pair of PUs establishes a wireless link as the PU link. The PU link and CR link utilize spectrum simultaneously with different priorities. The PU link has a higher priority to utilize spectrum with respect to the CR link. The proposed work focusses on different spectrum allocation techniques for the secondary users, based on Genetic Algorithms and an analysis of the performance of these techniques with an assumption that the radio environment has already been sensed and the QoS requirements for the application have been specified either by the sensed radio environment or by the secondary user itself. The proposed work focusses towards the technique that not only work on the QoS of cognitive radio but also covers all the parameters for efficient communication like power and bandwidth. When the PU link utilizes spectrum, a desired quality of service (QoS) is to be assured and the CR utilizes spectrum with an opportunistic power scale under this constraint, assuring the desired QoS on the PU link. To compute an optimal opportunistic power scale for the CR link, a fuzzy-based opportunistic power control strategy is proposed based on the Mamdani fuzzy control model using four input variables: QoS,RSSI, bandwidth as well as noise delay with the opportunistic power management along with bandwidth allocation...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the large}} size of {{wireless}} networks, it is often impractical for nodes to track changes in the complete network state. As a result, nodes have to make distributed decisions about their transmission and <b>reception</b> <b>parameters</b> based on their local view of the network. In this paper, we characterize the impact of distributed decisions on the global network performance in terms of achievable sum-rates. We first formalize the concept of local view by proposing a protocol abstraction using the concept of local message passing. In the proposed protocol, nodes forward information about the network state to other neighboring nodes, thereby allowing network state information to trickle to all the nodes. The protocol proceeds in rounds, where all transmitters send a message followed by a message by all receivers. The number of rounds then provides a natural metric to quantify the extent of local information at each node. We next study three network connectivities, Z-channel, a three-user double Z-channel and a reduced-parametrization $K$-user stacked Z-channel. In each case, we characterize achievable sum-rate with partial message passing leading to three main results. First, in many cases, nodes can make distributed decisions with only local information about the network and can still achieve the same sum-capacity as can be attained with global information irrespective of the actual channel gains. Second, for the case of three-user double Z-channel, we show that universal optimality is not achievable if the per node information is below a threshold. Third, using reduced parametrization $K$-user channel, we show that very few protocol rounds are needed for the case of very weak or very strong interference.
