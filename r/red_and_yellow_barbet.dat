40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze the {{pigments}} {{used in the}} decoration of <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> motifs present in the portable art of the Parpalló Cave (Gandía, Spain), {{one of the most}} important Palaeolithic sites in the Spanish Mediterranean region. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF) and spectrophotometry in the visible region (CIEL*a*b*color coordinates and spectral reflectance curves) were used to perform in situ fast analyses of the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> motifs with portable equipment and to characterize their elemental composition and their colorimetric perception, respectively. According to the elemental composition, the intensity of the fluorescence iron signals in <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> motifs are higher than average values in the rock substrates. As expected, red motifs possess high values of the chromatic coordinate a* <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> motifs possess high values of b*. This characterization was complemented with FT-IR analyses of microsamples detached from the <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> colored zones of a small set of plaquettes. Our results show that the artists used <b>red</b> <b>and</b> <b>yellow</b> pigments in the decoration likely derived from natural iron oxides as hematite and goethite...|$|R
