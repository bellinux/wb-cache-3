Sinne päätyy paljon kierrätettäväksi kelpaavaa materiaalia muun muassa kuitumateriaalia, joka olisi käyttökelpoista uusiomassan raaka-ainetta. Metso Paper Oy on kehittänyt prosessin, jolla voidaan erottaa kuitumateriaali kuiva- tai energiajätteestä. Prosessista on rakennettu siirrettavä koelaitteisto, jonka tarkoituksena on osoittaa, että kuidun talteenotto kuivajätteestä on mahdollista sekä taloudellisesti mielekästä. Työn alkuosassa tarkastellaan uusiokuidun ominaisuuksia ja sen käyttökohteita. Lisäksi tarkastellaan kuivajätteen hyödyntämistä hylsykartongin ja kierrätettävän muovin raaka-aineena. Työn tavoitteena on arvioida erilaisten raaka-aineiden soveltuvuutta prosessiin koeajotulosten pohjalta sekä tarkastella saavutettuja massan laatuarvoja ja niiden soveltuvuutta erilaisiin paperi- ja kartonkituotteisiin. Ominaisuuksiltaan uusiokuitu on aina ensikuitua heikompi. Kuivajätteestä voidaan prosessilla erottaa kuitua, joka laadultaan kelpaa ainakin ruskeisiin pakkausmateriaaleihin.

40|$|The {{nature of}} <b>recycled</b> paper <b>fibres</b> varies widely. Those fibres contain high amounts of heteroxylans and lignin besides cellulose. In order {{to study the}} {{potential}} effect of xylanases {{on the quality of}} <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres,</b> chemithermomechanical <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> (CMTP) are used as model substrates owing to their high content in non-cellulosic components.

Treatments of CTMP fibres with an endoxylanase result in an improved surface area of the fibres by fibrillation, without shortening the fibres. The chemical composition of the surfaces of the fibres changes and an augment in surface hydrophilicity {{as a result of the}} removal of lignin and extractives associated to the xylan backbones is observed. Experimental results are in agreement with the findings when studying the chemical composition of the fibres' surfaces: the xylan backbone is removed by the action of the endoxylanase, resulting in fibre fibrillation; further hydrolysis of released xylan chains proceeds in the bulk down to the monomer xylose...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{decreasing}} limited forest resources, {{the increasing}} paper consumption {{and the pressure}} from the environmental movements, the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> has become increasingly important.

Problems caused by micro organisms that are typically encountered in paper making systems include slime spots and holes, offensive odours, corrosion, paper breaks, brightness loss, additive spoilage, and shower and stock line plugging. These problems are costly because they lead to poor runnability, low production rates, off-quality paper, and even shortened equipment life due to accelerated corrosion rates. Microbiological growth control has therefore become more and more important within the paper industry.

40|$|Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRPs) {{have very}} {{impressive}} properties. particularly {{in terms of}} specific strength and stiffness. and they are widely used in many industries {{such as in the}} production of high-tech sports goods and the aviation industry In addition. the quantity of (,FRPs in use has increased significantly. especially during the past few decades. After Hoeing announced the shift in their aeroplanes from alloy based to composite aircraft. there has been a very large impact on the carbon fibre market. and it is estimated that by 2014. the carbon fibre market will reach £ l. 7 billion. However. the growth of carbon fibre utilisation has resulted in an increased quantity of CFRP waste which still {{has the potential to be}} al high value material and which can be recycled and reused in non-structural applications. The aim of this study is to <b>recycle</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> using a fluidised bed and to investigate the most suitable operating conditions in order to obtain the highest quality of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> in term of fibre length. tensile properties and surface energy. All aerospace grade composite was recycled using a fluidised bed process operating between 525 °C and 550 °C with a fluidising velocity of 0. 8 m/s and 1 m/s and a bed depth of 5 cm and Scm. As the recycling temperature can affect the residence time in the fluidised bed. there were two forms of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> resulted from this process: single fibre filaments elutriated from the bed and bundles of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> remained in the bed. The elutriated single filaments. <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> possessed approximately 46 % normalised tensile strength with 67 % average normalised tensile modulus while the bundles offered higher tensile properties (the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> bundles had roughly 67 % normalised tensile strength and 73 % average normalised tensile modulus). Both <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> type had a clean surface with no visible damage. The efforts to improve the tensile properties of <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> were carried out by controlling the oxygen content. However. it was found that low oxygen content, between 6 and 18 per cent. does not improve tensile strength of a <b>recycled</b> carbon <b>fibre.</b> The main parameter associated with the single filament <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> quality is temperature. An increasing temperature tends to decrease the fibre length degradation and tensile strength for recycled single filaments. both of which are due to faster char oxidation and hence. a lower residence Time before elutriation. For the <b>recycled</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> bundles. it was found that the <b>recycled</b> <b>fibre</b> quality is related to fluidising velocity and bed depth. Regarding surface energy. it has been observed that the surface energy of <b>recycled</b> carbon <b>fibre</b> depends on the quantity of acid based functional groups and these changes are slightly dependent on the recycling conditions. Finally. degradation modelling of the composite has been developed and Shown to be a useful tool in determining the behaviour of the composite in the fluidised bed. The outcomes of this research are not only useful for understanding and optimising the fluidised bed process for recycling carbon fibre. but they are also helpful in developing a better understanding of carbon fibre recycling operations based on thermal processing.

In particular, the use of <b>recycled</b> plastic <b>fibres</b> has become increasingly attractive due to their low cost and sustainability.

The effects of cellulose fibre length on microstructure and on mechanical performance of fibre-cement composites were evaluated before and after accelerated ageing cycles. Hardwood <b>pulp</b> <b>fibres</b> were better dispersed in the cement matrix and provided higher number of fibres per unitary weight or volume, in relation to softwood long <b>fibre</b> <b>pulp.</b> The short reinforcing elements lead to an effective crack bridging of the fragile matrix, which contributes to {{the improvement of the}} mechanical performance of the composite after ageing. These promising results show the potential of eucalyptus short fibres for reducing costs by both the partial replacement of expensive synthetic fibres in air curing process and the energy savings during pulp refining.

The main objective is to increase the use of <b>fibres</b> <b>recycled</b> from coloured paper. One of the main problems of this raw material is the presence of contaminants, such as colourants, which hinder its potential and causes the obtained product to loss part of its value. A big inconvenience of using <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> from the disintegration of coloured paper as raw material is that the type of colourant used is unknown. Therefore, parameters based on measuring the optical properties of the paper sheets where used to determine the efficiency of the colour elimination sequences. The first part consisted in applying different enzymatic stages (laccasemediator system) and a bleaching chemical agent to the red/black <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> for determining the efficiency of eliminating colour in the dough. Afterwards, different biotechnological agents (enzymes) and chemical treatments will be applied to the red <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> using a combination of mediators and doubling the dose of mediator used in the red fibres in order to determine which treatment gives the best results. Later on, we will apply a selected colour elimination sequence to the red and black <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres,</b> with the aim of determining the best biochemical sequence. At the same time, studies with another oxidizing agent (ozone) will be done in order to determine if the enzymatic stages can substitute the ozone stage. Last part of the project consists in doing physical test to determine if the paper has lost any of its properties after the treatments. The enzymatic activity of the effluents will be calculated as well in order to determine which mediator performed better and the possibility of recirculating these effluents will be studied...|$|R

Four recycling cases, including mechanical recycling, semi-mechanical recycling, back-to-oligomer recycling and back-to-monomer recycling were analysed. Three allocation methods are applied for open-loop recycling, i. e. the “cut-off” approach, the “waste valuation” approach and the “system expansion” approach. Nine environmental impact indicators were analysed, i. e. non-renewable energy use (NREU), global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation. The LCA results are compared with virgin PET fibre and other commodity fibre products, i. e. cotton, viscose, PP (polypropylene) and PLA (polylactic acid). The LCA results show that <b>recycled</b> PET <b>fibres</b> offer important environmental benefits over virgin PET fibre. Depending on the allocation methods applied for open-loop-recycling, NREU savings of 40 – 85 % and GWP savings of 25 – 75 % can be achieved. <b>Recycled</b> PET <b>fibres</b> produced by mechanical recycling cause lower environmental impacts than virgin PET in at least eight {{out of a total of}} nine categories. <b>Recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> produced from chemical recycling allow to reduce impacts in six to seven out of a total of nine categories compared to virgin PET fibres.

40|$|The {{processing}} and reuse of end-of-life composite products in an environmentally friendly manner {{is one of}} the most important challenges facing the industry and community. The global annual production of glass reinforced composite materials is rapidly approaching 10 million tons, of which approximately 60 % is thermoset based. A number of processes are available for recycling such GRP composites. Of these possible routes, thermal recycling is probably the most technologically advanced and has been piloted in the UK and Denmark. However, nearly all options deliver <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> which suffer from a lack of cost competitiveness with pristine first-pass materials. A key factor in this equation is that there is a huge drop in the performance of <b>recycled</b> glass <b>fibre</b> (80 - 90 %) in comparison to its original state. Consequently, <b>recycled</b> <b>fibres</b> have a very poor performance to cost ratio, and in most cases are considered unsuitable for re{{processing and}} reuse as a valuable reinforcement of composites. In this presentation we will introduce two recently initiated EPSRC funded projects (ReCoVeR) focussed on the enabling cost-effective regeneration of the mechanical properties of glass fibres obtained from thermal recycling of glass reinforced composites from end-of-life automotive and wind energy applications. A breakthrough in the regeneration of <b>recycled</b> glass <b>fibre</b> performance has the potential to totally transform the economics of recycling such GRP composites which would otherwise most likely be disposed of to landfill.
