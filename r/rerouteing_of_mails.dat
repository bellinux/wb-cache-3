40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} is a syndrome that affects multiple insulin target tissues, each having different biological functions regulated by insulin. A remaining {{question is to}} mechanistically explain how an insulin target cell/tissue can be insulin resistant in one biological function and insulin sensitive in another at the same time. Here, we provide evidence that in pancreatic β cells, knockdown of PI 3 K-C 2 α expression results in <b>rerouting</b> <b>of</b> the insulin signal from insulin receptor (IR) -B/PI 3 K-C 2 α/PKB-mediated metabolic signaling to IR-B/Shc/ERK-mediated mitogenic signaling, which allows the β cell to switch from a highly glucose-responsive, differentiated state to a proliferative state. Our data suggest the existence of IR-cascade-selective insulin resistance, which allows <b>rerouting</b> <b>of</b> the insulin signal within the same target cell. Hence, factors involved in the <b>rerouting</b> <b>of</b> the insulin signal represent tentative therapeutic targets {{in the treatment of}} insulin resistance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} two {{specific problems}} in telecommunication, namely the Terrestrial Flight Telephone System and the <b>rerouting</b> <b>of</b> international telephone calls. Both situations are modelled as coalitional games, and game theoretic techniques {{are used to}} tackle the problems. It is shown that a special class of coalitional games emerges from the situations under consideration and that {{the structure of the}} situations has theoretical implications, including the coincidence of several game theoretic solution concepts. The implications of these theoretical results for the two practical problems are discussed. terrestrial flight telephone system, <b>rerouting</b> <b>of</b> telephone calls, revenue apportionment, coalitional games, solution concepts...|$|R
