5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided <b>recovery</b> <b>information</b> to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a temporary hospital at the Houston Police Academy. The team of 87medical personnel served over 1,000patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster Medical System deployed a temporary hospital to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite the removal process. FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of the removal. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.|$|E

After nearly 50,000cars were flooded and ruined, many people attempted to sell the cars across the country without telling of the car's history. Following the extreme flooding, a mosquito outbreak occurred, though FEMA provided aid to control the problem. By six months after the storm, around 120,000 Texas citizens applied for federal disaster aid, totaling to $1.05billion (2001USD, $1.36billion 2012USD).|$|E

The topological de-noising algorithm allows for the recovery of topological infor-mation that is inaccessible by thresholding methods. We apply the algorithm to synthetically-generated noisy data sets and show the <b>recovery</b> of topological <b>information</b> which is impossible to obtain by thresh-olding.

Public service was the primary reason for being on-air so every break was to have <b>recovery</b> <b>information</b> in it. The remote operations from Atlanta gave WWNO the technical ability to launch a local news department from 400 miles away. Credits go to the generosity of GPB, technical assistance from NPR, financial support from CPB and the dedication of key employees for getting WWNO back on the air after Katrina made the University of New Orleans studios inaccessible and inoperable. Major credits to WWNO chief engineer Robert Carroll and operations director Ron Curtis who accessed the transmitter site on the West Bank and secured the equipment before the floodwaters had receded in New Orleans.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVisual servoing {{is a key}} {{technique}} to automate microassembly tasks since videomicroscope is widely use to <b>recovery</b> <b>informations</b> about the scene. The parts {{as well as the}} gripper should be tracked in the images which do not deliver a complete focused view of the objects because of the weakness of the depth-of-field. The paper investigates the problem of computing the 3 D orientation of a rigid body by analysing the focus data extracted from the images of a videomicroscope. The solution is based on the shape-from-focus approach. But the modelling stage is simplified, instead of performing a 3 D modelling, a 1 D modelling is achieved which enables the estimation of the 3 D orientation of the object. The concept is applied with success to the tips (70 μm width and 1500 μm length) of a gripper imaged by a 10 x videomicroscope...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a distributed storage management issue {{to implement a}} fault tolerant mobile computing system. Considering the mobile hosts vulnerable to the failure, the mobile computing system is desirable to be equipped with a proper recovery mechanism.

Hence, the efficient management of the <b>recovery</b> <b>information</b> becomes an important design issue. This paper presents region-based <b>recovery</b> <b>information</b> management schemes, which consider both of the failure-free operation cost and the failure-recovery cost. In the proposed schemes, a recovery manager assigned for a region manages the <b>recovery</b> <b>information</b> of the mobile hosts within the region, and the <b>recovery</b> <b>information</b> is transferred to a new recovery manager when the mobile host moves out of the region.
