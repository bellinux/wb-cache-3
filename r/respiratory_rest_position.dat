Sixteen subjects were selected according to the Frankfort mandibular plane angle and separated in two groups having a mandibular plane angle > or = 28 degrees.

40|$|Statement of problem. The {{determination}} of a correct vertical dimension of occlusion {{is a critical}} procedure in clinical dentistry. Purpose. The objectives {{of this study were}} to analyze the relation between mandibular <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> and electrical activity of masticatory muscles and to compare clinical and electromyographic <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> in subjects with different vertical facial morphologic features. Material and methods. Clinical <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> and electromyographic <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> were investigated in 40 subjects. Electromyographic <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> ranged from 0. 4 to 12. 7 mm (average 7. 7 +/- 2. 7 mm). Clinical <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> ranged from 0. 1 to 4. 4 mm (average 1. 4 +/- 1. 1 mm). The average difference between electromyographic <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> and clinical <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> nas 6. 3 +/- 2. 5 mm (range 0. 3 to 10. 3 mm). Sixteen subjects were selected according to the Frankfort mandibular plane angle anti separated in two groups with the first group (eight subjects) having a mandibular plane angle {{less than or equal to}} 20 degrees and the second group having a mandibular plane angle 128 degrees.

However, {{there is a lack}} of research on the kinematic characteristics of the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the glenohumeral (GH) joint. The aim of this study was to define the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the GH joint by quantifying the humeral head translation and axial rotational range of motion (ROM). Subjects and Methods The anterior and posterior translation of the humeral head and the rotational ROM of the dominant arm were assessed in the seated position at multiple abduction posi-tions in 15 subjects who were healthy by use of an electromagnetic tracking device. A force of 80 N and a torque of 4 Nm were applied during the measurement procedures for the translation of the humeral head and the rotational ROM, respectively.

40|$|Cerebral palsy {{are found}} {{as a result}} of these disorders, along with {{associated}} neuromuscular functional alterations that affect the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head. In this context, the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head could be responsible for several skeletal and dental occlusal disorders among patients with cerebral palsy. Objective: To assess the presence of malocclusions in patients with cerebral palsy, define the most frequent types of malocclusions, and evaluate how the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head may be implicated in the development of such malocclusions. Study design: Forty-four patients aged between 12 - 55 years (18 males and 26 females) were studied. Occlusal conditions, the Dental Aesthetic Index (DAI), changes in the <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head, and breathing and swallowing functions were assessed. Results: Orthodontic treatment was required by 70. 8 % of the patients, the most frequent malocclusions being molar class II, open bite and high overjet. These individuals showed altered breathing and swallowing functions, as well as habit and postural disorders. The <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> of the head, especially the hyperextended presentation, was significantly correlated to high DAI scores. Conclusions: The results obtained suggest that patients with cerebral palsy are more susceptible to present malocclusions, particularly molar class II malocclusion, increased open bite, and high overjet. Such alterations in turn are more common in patients with a hyperextended position of the head...|$|R

Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The final refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before any other part of the mechanism began to return to the <b>rest</b> <b>position</b> while the clamping jaws retraced the sequence of operation, remaining closed until the handles were fully released.|$|R

30|$|Gestures that {{conveyed}} relevant semantic content {{were coded}} and analyzed. A gesture {{was defined as}} a movement of hand(s) accompanied by speech to express an idea or meaning. A gesture unit was defined as “the period of time between successive rests of the limbs (McNeill, 1992).” Movement of the hand(s) starting from a <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> and returning to a <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> was regarded as one gesture. If the hands did not return to a <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> between two gestures, the boundary was defined by a pause in motion and an obvious change in shape or trajectory. When a participant used both hands simultaneously to describe one object, concept, or part, it was regarded as one gesture. If a participant used both hands and one described an object, a concept, or a part and the other hand a different concept, the gestures were coded as two different gestures. Beats, which serve to advance the discourse, and emblems, which have conventionalized meanings like “OK,” were excluded as were {{a very small number of}} metaphoric gestures expressing abstract ideas.|$|R
40|$|Although resting {{is one of}} the {{dominant}} behaviors of foregut fermenting primates (i. e., colobines), their resting posture has rarely received attention. We hypothesize that colobines are more constrained in their <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> than hindgut fermenting primates and that colobines assume a sitting <b>resting</b> <b>position</b> for specific reasons. To test this hypothesis, we followed two approaches. First, we observed <b>resting</b> <b>positions</b> in two captive individuals each of eight species and tested whether colobines rested in a sitting position more than other primates. Second, we collected literature data on free-ranging specimens of 31 species and again tested whether colobines rested in a sitting position more than other primates. Both approaches indicated that colobines spent more time in a sitting posture than other primates (73. 0 % vs. 23. 2 % in captivity and 83. 0 % vs. 60. 9 % in the wild, respectively). We hypothesize that the position of the digestive chamber and the necessity of frequently having to eructate digestion gases force colobines to take a sitting posture to avoid pressure on the thorax and respiratory organs...|$|R
