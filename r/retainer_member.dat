5000|$|A handcuff {{cover is}} a piece of plastic or metal that can be placed around a pair of handcuffs. The first handcuff cover was invented by J.D. Cullip and K.E. Stefansen and {{patented}} in 1973. It is made from high-strength, high-impact ABS plastic and is still distributed by C & S Security Inc. as [...] "Black Box" [...] handcuff cover. Other companies sell similar devices, e.g. CTS Thompson ("Blue Box" [...] handcuff cover) or Sisco restraints. A handcuff cover consists of a hinged, box-like assembly adapted to be locked over the handcuff chain, wristlets and keyholes. After placing the handcuffs into the box, the box is fixed with a channel-shaped <b>retainer</b> <b>member</b> which is slidably receivable in the continuous groove of the closed box.|$|E
40|$|A {{floating}} nut retention system includes a nut {{with a central}} aperture. An inner retainer plate has an opening which is fixedly aligned with the nut aperture. An outer <b>retainer</b> <b>member</b> is formed of a base plate having an opening and a surface adjacent to a surface of the inner retainer plate. The outer <b>retainer</b> <b>member</b> includes a securing mechanism for retaining the inner retainer plate adjacent to the outer <b>retainer</b> <b>member.</b> The securing mechanism enables the inner retainer plate to float {{with respect to the}} outer retainer number, while simultaneously forming a bearing surface for inner retainer plate...|$|E
40|$|A <b>retainer</b> <b>member</b> {{suitable}} for retaining a gap filler placed in gaps between adjacent tile members is presented. One {{edge of the}} <b>retainer</b> <b>member</b> may {{be attached to the}} gap filler and another edge may be provided with a plurality of tab members which in an intermediate position do not interfere with placement or removal of the gap filler between tile members. The <b>retainer</b> <b>member</b> may be fabricated from a shape memory alloy which when heated to a specified memory temperature will thermally activate the tab members to predetermined memory positions engaging the tile members to retain the gap filler in the gap. This invention has particular application to the thermal tiles on space vehicles such as the Space Shuttle Orbiter...|$|E

50|$|Following {{the end of}} the Boshin War, Tatsumi {{was placed}} in confinement, and changed his given name to Naofumi. Pardoned by the new government, Tatsumi joined the Imperial Japanese Army with the rank of major in June 1877. He served as chief-of-staff of the Shinsenryodan, a unit {{composed}} of former Kuwana <b>retainers</b> and <b>members</b> of the Shinsengumi, in the Satsuma Rebellion. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in February 1884 and to colonel in November 1887.|$|R
40|$|In the {{representative}} {{embodiment of the}} invention disclosed, a load limiting, energy absorbing net is arranged to overlay a normally-covered vent opening in the rear bulkhead of the space orbiter vehicle. Spatially-disposed flexible retainer straps are extended from the net and respectively secured to bulkhead brackets spaced around the vent opening. The intermediate portions of the straps are doubled over and stitched together in a pattern enabling the doubled-over portions to progressively separate at a predicable load designed to be well below the tensile capability of the straps as the stitches are successively torn apart by the forces imposed on the <b>retainer</b> <b>members</b> whenever the cover plate is explosively separated from the bulkhead and propelled into the net. By arranging these stitches to be successively torn away at a load below the strap strength in response to forces acting on the retainers that are less than the combined strength of the retainers, this tearing action serves as a predictable compact energy absorber for safely halting the cover plate as the retainers are extended as the net is deployed. The invention further includes a block of an energy-absorbing material positioned in the net for receiving loose debris produced by the explosive release of the cover plate...|$|R
50|$|Kaede {{returns to}} her {{childhood}} home to find the estate in disrepair, her mother dead, and her father in despair after losing a battle to Arai and not {{having the courage to}} take his own life. She determines, despite her gender, to take over Shirakawa. She attracts the interest of an Imperial noble who lives nearby, Lord Fujiwara, who assists her in return for hearing her secrets. Makoto, a monk from Terayama, visits and accidentally reveals that there was no marriage between Kaede and Shigeru. In disgrace, her father decides their whole family must take their lives, and attacks Kaede. Shizuka and Kondo (a <b>retainer,</b> and <b>member</b> of the tribe) rescue her by killing him. Kaede goes into labour, miscarries her child, and becomes gravely ill.|$|R
40|$|In new tool-and-connector system, {{necessary}} {{to have access to}} only one side of pipe, access offset from centerline. Connections made or broken in confined spaces and with small external forces. Tool turns spur gear on externally threaded <b>retainer</b> on left <b>member</b> of connector. <b>Retainer</b> engages nut on right member of connector. Intended for assembly of pipes in proposed Space Station, tool and fitting used on Earth to make or break plumbing connections in crowded utility runs or other confined spaces where wrenches cannot be turned, where forces exerted by wrenches might cause damage, or where lack of good grip prevents technician from exerting sufficient torque on connector...|$|R
5000|$|A lady's {{companion}} was a {{woman of}} genteel birth who acted as a paid companion for a woman of rank or wealth. The term was in use in the United Kingdom from at least the 18th century to the mid-20th century. It {{was related to the}} position of lady-in-waiting, which by the 19th century was only applied to the female <b>retainers</b> of female <b>members</b> of the royal family. Ladies-in-waiting were usually women from the most privileged backgrounds who took the position for the prestige of associating with royalty, or for the enhanced marriage prospects available to those who spent time at court, but lady's companions usually took up their occupation because they needed to earn a living. A companion is {{not to be confused with}} lady's maid, a female personal attendant roughly equivalent to a [...] "gentleman's gentleman" [...] or valet.|$|R
