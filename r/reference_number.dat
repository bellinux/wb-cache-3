5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a maintenance road number (also {{known as a}} <b>reference</b> <b>number).</b> The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The maintenance road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on auxiliary plates below warning signs approaching intersections.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{requirements}} of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a <b>reference</b> <b>number,</b> so Sabrina became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sabrina, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sabrina and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.|$|E

25|$|A {{lighting}} designer (LD) {{is familiar}} with the various types of lighting instruments and their uses. In consultation with the director, the DSM (deputy stage manager) and the scenic designer, and after observing rehearsals, the LD creates an instrument schedule and a light plot as well as informing the DSM where each LX (lighting) cue is designed to be triggered in the script, which the DSM notes down in his plot book. The schedule is a list of all required lighting equipment, including color gel, gobos, color wheels, barndoors and other accessories. The light plot is typically a plan view of the theatre where the performance will take place, with every luminaire marked. This typically specifies the approximate lighting focus and direction, a <b>reference</b> <b>number,</b> accessories, and the channel number of the dimmer system or lighting control console.|$|E

25|$|Scaramanga was {{severely}} wounded in a dogfight and lost consciousness {{before he took}} down his twelfth and final enemy aircraft on 10 July 1918. He regained consciousness and with his one good arm shot down the attacking Pfalz D.III {{that had been on}} their tail. He died that same day, soon after he and his pilot, Lieutenant John Everard Gurdon, landed, about two weeks short of his twentieth birthday. Scaramanga was interred at Aire Communal Cemetery in Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France. His grave <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> is III. H. 25. He is also commemorated on the Crawley Down War Memorial in Crawley Down, Worth, Sussex. The monument is located at the junction of Vicarage Road and Sandy Lane, down the road from the Church of All Saints.

25|$|New Zealand {{citizens}} can {{study in the}} United Kingdom for up to 6 months as a student visitor without the need {{to apply for a}} visa {{as long as they do}} not work during this period. If attending a course which is longer than 6 months, New Zealand {{citizens can}} apply for a Tier 4 student visa in New Zealand or in the UK merely by completing the application form, quoting the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> issued to them by their UK education provider and presenting evidence of care arrangements (if under the age of 18); they do not need to submit proof of sufficient funds, qualifications or English language ability (which most other foreign nationals need to demonstrate) as long as the UK education provider is recognised as a 'Highly Trusted' sponsor by the UK Border Agency. However, the UK Border Agency reserves the right to request such evidence in particular situations and New Zealand citizens must still present such evidence if applying for a Tier 4 student visa outside New Zealand or the UK. New Zealand citizens who have been issued with a Tier 4 student visa (but not those who are in the UK as student visitors) can work in the UK for up to 20 hours per week during term-time and without time restrictions outside term-time.|$|E
25|$|Published {{after the}} death of Johannes, and with support from King Sobieski, the Prodromus Astronomiae {{consisted}} of three separate parts: a preface (labeled Prodromus), a star catalog (named Catalogus Stellarum), and an atlas of constellations (named Firmamentum Sobiescianum, sive Uranographia).Prodromus outlines the methodology and technology used in creating the star catalogue. It provides examples of the use of the sextant and quadrant by Johannes, in tandem with known positions of the sun, in calculating each stars' longitude and latitude. The written draft of the Catalogus Stellarum consists of 183 leaves, 145, alphabetized according to constellation, containing star positions. Each star had specific information recorded in columns: the <b>reference</b> <b>number</b> and magnitude found by astronomer Tycho Brahe, Johannes' own magnitude calculation, the star's longitude and latitude by both ecliptic coordinates measured by angular distances and meridian altitudes found using Johannes' quadrant, and the star's equatorial coordinates calculated using spherical trigonometry. The printed version was similar to the written draft, except the two columns describing a star's ecliptic coordinates were combined, and only the single best value for the star's latitude and longitude was given. Also, the printed version held more than 600 new stars and 12 new constellations not documented in the written draft, bringing its total to 1564. Although the observations of the catalog used nothing more than the astronomer's naked eye, the measurements were so precise as {{to be used in the}} making of celestial globes into the early 18th Century.Firmamentum Sobiescianum, while technically part of the Prodromus Astronomiae as a well, was likely published separately and in tighter circulation. Housing its own cover page and page-numbering system, the atlas consisted of two hemispheres and 54 double-page plates of 73 constellations. Both the northern and southern hemispheres were centered on an ecliptic pole, and most star locations were all based off Johannes' own observations. Those that were not, the southern polar stars, were based on a catalog and map published in 1679 by Edmond Halley.|$|E
