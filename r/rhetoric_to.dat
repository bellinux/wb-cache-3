5|$|Gorgias, in Plato's homonymous dialogue, uses Pericles as {{an example}} of {{powerful}} oratory. In Menexenus, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would be superior in <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> someone educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.|$|E

25|$|Theophrastus {{seems to}} have carried out still further the {{grammatical}} foundation of logic and rhetoric, since in his book on the elements of speech, he distinguished the main parts of speech from the subordinate parts, and also direct expressions (κυρία λέξις kuria lexis) from metaphorical expressions, and dealt with the emotions (πάθη pathe) of speech. He further distinguished a twofold reference of speech (σχίσις schisis) to things (πράγματα pragmata) and to the hearers, and referred poetry and <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> the latter.|$|E

25|$|After the {{evacuation}} of British and French soldiers from Dunkirk and the French surrender on 22 June 1940, Hitler mainly focused his energies {{on the possibility of}} invading the Soviet Union in the belief that the British, defeated on the continent and without European allies, would quickly come to terms. The Germans were so convinced of an imminent armistice that they began constructing street decorations for the homecoming parades of victorious troops. Although the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, and certain elements of the British public favoured a negotiated peace with an ascendant Germany, Churchill and a majority of his Cabinet refused to consider an armistice. Instead, Churchill used his skilful <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> harden public opinion against capitulation and to prepare the British for a long war.|$|E

He used anti-Semitic <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> his advantage in Algeria, giving speeches claiming that French and African Jews and the British were conspiring to conquer the entire Sahara Desert. With the British {{in a difficult position}} in the Sudan after the death of General Charles George Gordon in the siege of Khartoum, de Morès planned a trip there to meet with the Mahdi, a powerful Muslim leader who was intent on undermining British hegemony in the region. He traveled to North Africa, selected Arabic men in Tunis to escort him, and set out his caravan towards Kebili.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{very little}} was {{returned}} {{except for a}} few ships. Since the Lend-Lease agreement did not provide any practical mechanism for allied nations to make good on any materials or equipment destroyed in the war, the United States government was in fact implicitly conceding that it did not expect the return of every piece of material and equipment that it was loaning to its allies. Any suggestion otherwise in the part of the administration was intended more as political <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> keep public opinion on its side as opposed to serious foreign policy. The intended and actual commitment the United States expected from its allies was to prevent the ravages of the conflict from reaching the North American continent.

500|$|In Jubilate Agno, he {{describes}} his writing as creating [...] "impressions". To accomplish this task, he incorporated puns and onomonpoeia in order to emphasise the theological significance of his poetic language. In addition to these techniques, he relied on repeated language and allusions to traditional works and to scripture for a source of authority in various works, especially in his Hymns.

500|$|Etymologiae (Latin for [...] "The Etymologies"), {{also known}} as the Origines ("Origins") and usually {{abbreviated}} Orig., is an etymological encyclopedia compiled by Isidore of Seville (c.560–636) towards the end of his life. Isidore was encouraged to write the book by his friend Braulio, Bishop of Saragossa. The Etymologies summarized and organized a wealth of knowledge from hundreds of classical sources; three of its books are derived largely from Pliny the Elder's Natural History. Isidore acknowledges Pliny, but not his other principal sources, namely Cassiodorus, Servius and Solinus. The work contains whatever Isidore, an influential Christian bishop, thought worth keeping. Its subject matter is extremely diverse, ranging from grammar and <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> the earth and the cosmos, buildings, metals, war, ships, humans, animals, medicine, law, religions and the hierarchies of angels and saints.|$|E
500|$|In [...] Menexenus, Plato satirizes Aspasia's {{relationship}} with Pericles, and quotes Socrates as claiming ironically {{that she was}} a trainer of many orators and that since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, he would be superior in <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> someone educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles. Kahn maintains that Plato has taken from Aeschines the motif of Aspasia as teacher of rhetoric for Pericles and Socrates. Plato's Aspasia and Aristophanes' Lysistrata are two apparent exceptions to the rule of women's incapacity as orators, though these fictional characters tell us nothing about the actual status of women in Athens. As Martha L. Rose, Professor of History at Truman State University, explains, [...] "only in comedy do dogs litigate, birds govern, or women declaim".|$|E

It was famously attacked by the Catholic and Jansenist philosopher Pascal, during the formulary controversy against the Jesuits, in his Provincial Letters {{as the use of}} <b>rhetorics</b> <b>to</b> justify moral laxity, which became identified by the public with Jesuitism; hence the everyday use of the term to mean complex and sophistic reasoning to justify moral laxity. By the mid-18th century, [...] "casuistry" [...] had become a synonym for moral laxity.|$|R
500|$|In a 2011 {{article for}} the journal Post Script, Andrew Scahill wrote {{about the power of}} {{children}} in <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> create an untenable stance for an opposing viewpoint. According to Scahill, an individual arguing [...] "for the children" [...] makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to hold a [...] "not for the children" [...] position. Cassandra Wilkinson discussed the impact of [...] "think of the children" [...] rhetoric in a 2011 article for IPA Review. Wilkinson cited research by No Fear: Growing Up in a Risk-Averse Society author Tim Gill that hypersensitivity in defending children from potential harm has the adverse effect of contributing to the inability of youth to own their choices and react to dangerous situations. In the New Statesman, Laurie Penny characterized the tactic as a political belief system and called it [...] "think-of-the-children-ism".|$|E
500|$|Hughes argued that, {{unlike a}} {{textbook}} compilation of exemplars, Drexel 4257 shows {{a variety of}} good and mediocre poetry. Most songs deal with love, and range from flowery <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> frank accounts of love-making. [...] A few, however, deal with topical matters. There are two songs related to Christmas: [...] "Beate upp a dromm" [...] depicts feasters in a mock battle with the cold in which the feasters win, and [...] "Christmas is my name ffar have I gone" [...] was a popular ballad which appeared {{in a number of}} 17th-century sources. In this song, the personification of Christmas comes from far away to discover that his friends and other residents have deserted the country in favor of the city. The song concludes with a lament that universal welcome is gone because the Protestants and Puritans disassociate themselves from Christmas. Similarly (with fewer political overtones), the song [...] "Ladies you loose yor time" [...] expresses preference for city life over that of the country.|$|E

500|$|The rebels first {{clashed with}} Ottoman regulars at the Battle of Ivankovac in August 1805, scoring a decisive victory. Belgrade was besieged early on by about 16,000 rebel fighters. The rebel leaders used anti-Muslim <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> {{mobilize}} the peasantry, calling upon them {{to rise up}} and drive the Ottomans [...] "across the blue sea". In order to further galvanize the population, Karađorđe appealed to memories of the Battle of Kosovo of June 1389, which {{paved the way for}} the Ottoman conquest of Serbia and the rest of the western Balkans, declaring that Serbia's defeat in the battle needed to be avenged. He sought to further cement his authority by harkening back to symbols of Medieval Serbia, such as the relics of Stefan the First-Crowned, and placing old heraldic symbols on flags and seals to establish continuity between the Serbian Empire and himself. Portraits of Dušan the Mighty, the founder of the Serbian Empire, are said to have hung from the walls of the rebels' headquarters.

500|$|Another critic, Maria Tatar, {{notes that}} there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a [...] "linguistic virtuoso", a {{creature}} who has mastered the arts of persuasion and <b>rhetoric</b> <b>to</b> acquire power and wealth. [...] "Puss in Boots" [...] has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, [...] "it {{has something to do with}} inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters." ...|$|E
