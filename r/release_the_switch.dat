It came in beautiful colours (red was my favourite) and we simply knew that they would taste fantastic. I see myself feeding the machine with my last coin, quickly turning the switch and then waiting impatiently. The next moment we all fell silent. The coin was jammed. No matter how hard we tried to <b>release</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch,</b> the desirable chewing gum stayed put. If I close my eyes I can still remember that episode with a smile. The situation with the machine was as much a fight to a small boy as it has been to write this thesis many years later. The context and the problems vary between the two situa-tions, but the experiences are rather similar; excitement taking on a thrilling and challenging project as well as a sense of frustration when progress is jammed. I never got the chewing gum, but I would say the coin has finally been released and the struggle has come to an end. This thesis grows out of the support of colleagues and friends. I would lik...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) {{cells have}} been widely used to study virus-host cell {{interactions}} and epithelial polarization. In this cell line ammonium, released into the medium as a result of glutamine metabolism, is known to be an essential inhibitor of cell growth. Although glutamine has been generally considered as a major energy source for mammalian cells, we have recently found that MDCK cells can grow as well in glutamine-free medium if glutamine is substituted by pyruvate. In such a medium the level of ammonia released was significantly reduced. Objectives. In this study the metabolic flux analysis (MFA) of MDCK cells grown in glutamine-containing and glutamine-free media have been performed. MFA is a powerful methodology for the determination of metabolic pathway fluxes, which is applied to calculate intracellular fluxes by using a stoichiometric model for the major intracellular reactions and considering mass balances of metabolites. Based on the results of the MFA, the influence of substitution of glutamine by pyruvate on the metabolism of MDCK cells has been investigated. Results. Analysis of experimental data and flux calculations clearly demonstrated that besides the reduction of ammonia <b>release,</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> from glutamine-containing medium to glutamine-free medium with pyruvate provides a series of other benefits. Glucose consumption and glycolytic fluxes in the medium where glutamine is substituted by pyruvate are lower than those in glutamine-containing medium. On the other hand, the rate of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the glutamine-free medium is higher than in glutamine-containing medium. Most of pyruvate consumed from the medium enters the TCA cycle, whereas glucose is almost completely excreted as lactate. Higher percentage of glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate (GAP) formed during the pentose phosphate pathway in glutamine-free medium implies that in this cultivation condition more NADPH is produced in the central carbon metabolism. As NADPH is an important precursor for biomass formation, cultivation in glutamine-free medium, despite a relatively low glucose consumption flux, provides approximately the same specific growth rate as the cultivation in glutamine-containing medium. Summary and Outlook. Developed here is a comprehensive metabolic model of mammalian cell metabolism. The model facilitates further studies of cell metabolism in different culture media. Furthermore, it can be applied to investigate metabolic changes after virus infection...|$|E
50|$|Possibly one of {{the first}} {{phreaking}} methods was switch-hooking, which allows placing calls from a phone where the rotary dial or keypad has been disabled by a key lock or other means to prevent unauthorized calls from that phone. It is done by rapidly pressing and <b>releasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> hook to open and close the subscriber circuit, simulating the pulses generated by the rotary dial. Even most current telephone exchanges support this method, as they need to be backward compatible with old subscriber hardware.|$|R

2500|$|Ras is a G protein, or a guanosine-nucleotide-binding protein. Specifically, it is a single-subunit small GTPase, {{which is}} related in {{structure}} to the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (large GTPases). G proteins function as binary signaling switches with [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] states. In the [...] "off" [...] state it {{is bound to}} the nucleotide guanosine diphosphate (GDP), while in the [...] "on" [...] state, Ras is bound to guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which has an extra phosphate group as compared to GDP. This extra phosphate holds <b>the</b> two <b>switch</b> regions in a [...] "loaded-spring" [...] configuration (specifically the Thr-35 and Gly-60). When <b>released,</b> <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> regions relax which causes a conformational change into the inactive state. Hence, activation and deactivation of Ras and other small G proteins are controlled by cycling between the active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms.|$|R

30|$|This case {{deals with}} large data {{manipulation}} and maintenance. Consider the following problem in telecomm data management systems. In a typical service provider network several switches control a certain segments of <b>the</b> network. Each <b>switch</b> controls several cell sites. One {{of the functions}} of a switch is to collect performance and radio frequency service measurement data related to the network segment (RFSM) as well as per call management data (PCMD) [33]. RFSM and PCMD Data are <b>released</b> by <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> at a certain time, e.g., {{on top of the}} hour. The amount of data released per hour can be very large depending on the number of cells in the territory of <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> and activity of the network. <b>The</b> data <b>released</b> per unit time can be in the order of giga-bytes per hour. Moreover, <b>the</b> data <b>released</b> by <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> changes in format, type, and structure every time a new switch version is released. This change calls for a change in the code responsible for parsing and loading the data {{as well as in the}} schema of the database which hosts the RFSM and PCMD data. <b>The</b> <b>switch</b> experiences major <b>release</b> changes several times a year; in some cases it can be 4 releases per year. During the transition from one release to another and the subsequent code modification, the data management system could become unavailable for an unidentified time (depending on the success and duration of system upgrade).
