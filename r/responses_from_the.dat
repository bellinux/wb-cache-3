5|$|In {{spite of}} the mixed <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} magic scene, Dan and Dave continued with their cardistry creations. In 2004, {{with the help of}} Kenner, the twins released an instructional DVD on cardistry named The Dan and Dave System. The System is perceived as having officially separated advanced card flourishing from card magic and defined the style of cardistry. Filmed with digital movie cameras at film studios and professional edited, the critically praised $30 DVD inspired thousands of sleight of hand artists {{all over the world to}} embark on cardistry. Four years later, the twins released a three-disc DVD set known as The Trilogy, showcasing some of the most comprehensive and difficult flourishes ever created. Retailing at $85 per copy, The Trilogy is the bestselling cardistry release of all time, having sold more than 25,000 units. Pang wrote that just about every cardist lists either the System or The Trilogy as the reason they got into card flourishing.|$|E
5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> reviewers who {{were impressed by}} its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players. FiringSquad's reviewer's experience was similar {{but he said the}} lag was not enough to hinder his enjoyment of the multiplayer action.|$|E

40|$|We {{observed}} distinct interlayer {{shear mode}} Raman spectra for trilayer graphene with ABA and ABC stacking order. There are two rigid-plane shear-mode phonon branches in trilayer graphene. We found that ABA trilayers exhibit pronounced Raman <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> high-frequency shear branch, without any noticeable <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> low-frequency branch. In contrast, ABC trilayers exhibit no <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> high-frequency shear branch, but significant Raman <b>response</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> low-frequency branch. Such complementary behaviors of Raman shear modes {{can be explained}} by the distinct symmetry of the two trilayer allotropes. The strong stacking-order dependence was not found in the layer-breathing modes, and thus represents a unique characteristic of the shear modes...|$|R

5|$|The {{movement}} {{opens with}} an extensive orchestral sinfonia marked Concerto in the autograph score. Lasting 22 bars, this ritornello establishes the prevailing anguished {{mood of the}} first section. It is heard twice again, but only as the accompanying backdrop for the separate musical material of the chorus, a setting of the first phrase of the Old Testament text. The open motifs are also heard again in the fragmentary accompaniment of the central choral fugato episode between the two reprises of the ritornello. The different motifs in the ritornello thus also serve the purpose of accompanying specific parts of the text. The first predominant motif consist of detached repeated quaver chords, passed antiphonally between the three instrumental groups of recorders, oboes and strings. These are accompanied by similarly detached crotchets, scored as quavers with rests, in the walking bass of the continuo. After thirteen bars there follows a four bar passage of melifluous semiquaver passages in thirds for the recorders with imitative <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> oboes; the upper strings take up the detached crotchets and the continuo the groups of detached repeated quavers. In the four succeeding bars the quaver figure in the continuo line {{is replaced by a}} new motif of rising semiquaver scales, with the detached quavers and crotchets passing into the upper strings and the woodwind playing sustained chords. In the concluding two bars of the sinfonia the semiquaver scale motif passes into the recorders in thirds and is taken up by the other instruments for the sustained final cadence.|$|E

25|$|An {{article in}} Science {{magazine}} by John Bohannon describes {{some of the}} criticisms, {{as well as some}} <b>responses</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Lancet report's lead author Gilbert Burnham. According to Bohannon and Johnson, the Lancet paper indicates that the survey team avoided small back alleys for safety reasons. But this could bias the data because deaths from car bombs, street-market explosions, and shootings from vehicles should be more likely on larger streets. Burnham counters that such streets were included and that the methods section of the published Lancet paper is oversimplified.|$|E

Additionally, NAB customers have moved their money to banks with a lesser financed emissions portfolio.|$|E
