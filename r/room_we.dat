After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} sodium salt and the volume of air in the <b>room,</b> <b>we</b> easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E

It features recurring appearances from Lauren Cohan, Scott Wilson, IronE Singleton, Madison Lintz, Emily Kinney, Jane McNeill, James Allen McCune, and Amber Chaney. Following the initial broadcast of the previous installment, [...] "Secrets", writer Robert Kirkman teased the following episode [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already". He stated: [...] "There's {{a lot of big}} stuff out there that we will be wrapping up to a certain extent. In the writers' <b>room</b> <b>we</b> were fully aware that we were coming up on this hiatus, so we definitely wrote to it. I {{think people are going to}} be a little shocked." ...|$|E

500|$|Russell {{was driven}} by [...] "a {{neurotic}} need to win", as his Celtic teammate Heinsohn observed. He was so tense before every game that he regularly threw up in the locker rooms; {{early in his career}} it happened so frequently that his fellow Celtics were more worried when it did not happen. Later in Russell's career, Havlicek said of his teammate and coach that he threw up less often than early in his career, only doing so [...] "when it's an important game or an important challenge for him—someone like Chamberlain, or someone coming up that everyone's touting.

500|$|In November 1967, Gittings and Kameny worked {{together}} as co-counsel in hearings {{held by the}} Department of Defense to discredit an expert witness named Dr. Charles Socarides, who testified that homosexuals could be converted to heterosexuality, and to call in question the policy held by the Department of Defense that homosexual employees could be fired for being named as homosexuals. [...] "Publicity was the objective", Gittings recalled many years later. Kameny and Gittings dressed conservatively, but wore buttons that said [...] "Gay is Good" [...] and [...] "Pray for Sodomy." [...] "We held press conferences {{for the benefit of}} sharp-eyed reporters. When we first went into a hearing <b>room,</b> <b>we</b> made certain to shake hands with all ... participants so (they) could not avoid reading our buttons. Although neither was an attorney, {{at the end of their}} cross-examination, the Department of Defense removed Socarides from their lists of expert witnesses.|$|E
500|$|On {{existing}} in the MCU, {{specifically in the}} same world as the other Netflix series, Rosenberg said, [...] "Jessica Jones is a very, very different show than Daredevil. We exist in a cinematic universe, [...] the mythology {{of the universe is}} connected, but they look very different, tonally they’re very different… That was my one concern coming in: Am I going to have to fit into Daredevil or what’s come before? And the answer is no." [...] On references or [...] "easter eggs" [...] in the season, Rosenberg explained that [...] "A little is always there and in the writer’s <b>room</b> <b>we</b> have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they’re all geeking out with different stuff....a lot of references are to the [...]" [...] She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season, with each episode having a [...] "little something in it." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish {{was adamant}} that his players would improve {{following}} the defeat: [...] "They've been in two cup finals {{in this season}} – they'll have enjoyed the first one more than the second, the lads {{will benefit from the}} experience. You can't give a team like Chelsea a two-goal head start." [...] When asked about his future as manager of the club Dalglish stated: [...] "We'll assess the season {{at the end of the}} season." [...] Captain Steven Gerrard echoed Dalglish's sentiments: [...] "With the players we have in that dressing <b>room,</b> <b>we</b> could have done better. But we are Liverpool. We will bounce back. We will strengthen in the summer and come back fighting again. That's what Liverpool Football Club does." [...] Striker Andy Carroll, who scored one goal and had another disallowed, thought the ball had crossed the line: [...] "I thought it was over the line and you know better than me but I thought it was. I thought it hit the other side of the bar but I haven't seen it back." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the season}} finale, Bell talked about Coulson losing his arm, saying that [...] "he paid a price—that was {{important}} to us. You don't mess with {{the forces of nature}} without getting bitten, {{and the fact that he}} literally saved everyone on the ship by that crystal not shattering was a wonderful, heroic thing and showed you that at heart, Coulson is a heroic man whose actions back up his words." [...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story... It's easy to kill a character for shock value or whatever, and we did have a number of deaths this season, but ... we prefer to leave you with something to talk about, to walk away with. This is something that came up in the <b>room,</b> <b>we</b> talked about what it meant ... The idea of getting Fitz and Simmons—who had been one person—to become two whole people, come back together, agree to go on a date, and then have this happen, felt beautifully poetic".|$|E

2500|$|Sharon Willis {{focuses on}} the way a {{television}} show (Clutch Cargo) marks the beginning of, and plays on through, the scene between young Butch and his father's comrade-in-arms. The Vietnam War veteran is played by Christopher Walken, whose presence in the role evokes his performance as a traumatized G.I. in the Vietnam War movie The Deer Hunter (1978). Willis writes that [...] "when Captain Koons enters the living <b>room,</b> <b>we</b> see Walken in his function as an image retrieved from a repertoire of 1970s television and movie versions of ruined masculinity in search of rehabilitation... he gray light of the television presiding over the scene seems to inscribe the ghostly paternal gaze." [...] Miklitsch asserts that, for some critics, the film is a [...] "prime example of the pernicious ooze-like influence of mass culture exemplified by their bête noire: TV." [...] Kolker might not disagree, arguing that [...] "Pulp Fiction is a simulacrum of our daily exposure to television; its homophobes, thugs and perverts, sentimental boxers and pimp promoters move {{through a series of}} long-take tableaux: we watch, laugh, and remain with nothing to comprehend." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{day after}} Trump won the election, Fox wrote an {{editorial}} on the International Business Times website where he lamented Trump's victory and explored what Mexico {{could do in}} response.

They also received letters from their families, {{and were able to}} write letters in return. In one letter to his wife, Russell wrote [...] "It's not much of a <b>room</b> <b>we</b> have up here." [...] Russell asked for the previous Saturday's newspaper because he said he would be looking for a new job, after joking about losing his current one for lazing about. One mine official questioned why Russell would want to look for a job, since he already had one. Russell, in a later interview, said that he had replied, [...] "I told him to stick it up his..." [...] They were also sent medical supplies, with which Webb was able to treat the injuries to Russell's leg, with advice from paramedics. It was also on 1 May that the two men asked about Larry Knight, and rescuers told them that he had been found dead.|$|E
2500|$|After much {{criticism}} and numerous delays, RIM officially launched BlackBerry 10 and two new smartphones based off the platform, the BlackBerry Z10 and Q10, on January 30, 2013. The BlackBerry Z10, the first BlackBerry smartphone running BlackBerry 10, debuted worldwide in January 2013, going on sale immediately in the U.K. {{with other countries}} following. A marked departure from previous BlackBerry phones, the Z10 featured a fully touch-based design, a dual-core processor, and a high-definition display. BlackBerry 10 had 70,000 applications available at launch, which the company expected would rise to 100,000 {{by the time the}} device made its debut in the United States. In support of the launch, the company aired its first Super Bowl television advertisement in the U.S. and Canada during Super Bowl XLVII.
