5000|$|Sunset Beach is a beach {{located near}} Cape May Point, in Lower Township along the Delaware Bay, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It {{is a local}} tourist attraction, {{in part due to}} its {{proximity}} to the SS Atlantus (locally known as the [...] "Concrete Ship") and the Cape May Lighthouse. It is known for a flag <b>raising-lowering</b> ceremony which takes places every morning and evening from May through September. All the flags flown in the ceremony are flags from the caskets of veterans. The ceremony has been taking place on Sunset beach since 1973. Other attractions include [...] "Cape May diamonds", clear quartz crystals that can be easily found along the beach's length, and summer fireworks.|$|E
5000|$|... 1985-1988: Cofounder and Vice President of Human Interfaces at Cognition - This was a Massachusetts {{start-up}} that {{attempted to}} do for mechanical engineers what workstations, such as Daisy's and Mentor Graphics, did for electrical engineers. Architecturally, {{it was based on}} Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad; it used constraint-based geometry to portray mechanical devices such as the windshield <b>raising-lowering</b> mechanism in a car. The dimensions, angles, and other measurements in the diagrams were linked to mathematical formulas. When the values in the formulas changed, the diagrams automatically updated to represent the changes. Smith designed a simple interface modeled on an engineer's notebook. It had sketchnotes for the diagrams, math notes for the formulas, text notes for textual descriptions, etc., which could then be pasted into the pages of the notebook. It was a modular design that made it easy to include new note types as users thought of them. The product was finished and sold, but Cognition was never profitable and went out of business largely due to the increasing power of low-cost personal computers using Intel chips. However, the interface was successful and won a General Motors competition; it was recognized for its standardized interface across all workstation software.|$|E
