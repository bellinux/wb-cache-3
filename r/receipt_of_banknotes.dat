50|$|Paper {{money was}} {{introduced}} in Song Dynasty China during the 11th century. The development <b>of</b> the <b>banknote</b> began in the seventh century, with local issues of paper currency. Its roots were in merchant <b>receipts</b> <b>of</b> deposit during the Tang Dynasty (618-907), as merchants and wholesalers desired to avoid the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions. The issue of credit notes is often for a limited duration, and at some discount to the promised amount later. The jiaozi nevertheless did not replace coins during the Song Dynasty; paper money was used alongside the coins. The central government soon observed the economic advantages of printing paper money, issuing a monopoly right {{of several of the}} deposit shops to the issuance of these certificates of deposit. By the early 12th century, the amount <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> issued in a single year amounted to an annual rate of 26 million strings of cash coins.|$|R
