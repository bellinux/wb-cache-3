Eight of these {{finished}} second: Pensive (1944), Tim Tam (1958), Forward Pass (1968), Majestic Prince (1969), Sunday Silence (1989), Silver Charm (1997), <b>Real</b> <b>Quiet</b> (1998), and Smarty Jones (2004). Five finished third: Northern Dancer (1964), Spectacular Bid (1979), Pleasant Colony (1981), Charismatic (1999), and Funny Cide (2003). Four finished fourth: Kauai King (1966), Canonero II (1971), Alysheba (1987), and California Chrome (2014). Carry Back (1961) finished seventh, War Emblem (2002) finished eighth and Big Brown (2008) did not finish. Finally, three Derby/Preakness winners did not race in the Belmont: Burgoo King (1932), Bold Venture (1933) and I'll Have Another (2012).|$|E
500|$|California Chrome {{became the}} only California-bred horse ever to win both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. [...] The press {{considered}} the Preakness to be the horse's strongest victory to date. [...] Baffert, who had won the first two legs of the Triple Crown with Silver Charm (1997), <b>Real</b> <b>Quiet</b> (1998), and War Emblem (2002), sent three different horses against California Chrome, and after Bayern had finished second to last in the Preakness, said, [...] "I'm done chasing him," [...] adding, [...] "he's super the real deal." [...] In post-race interviews, Coburn stated that California Chrome had become [...] "America's Horse".|$|E
500|$|A lack of rapport between veteran shortstop Jimmy Rollins {{and manager}} Ryne Sandberg {{attracted}} attention during the offseason; ESPN's Buster Olney described {{sentiment in the}} Phillies' organization that Rollins should be traded. Amaro and Rollins dispelled the rumors, with Amaro calling them [...] "absolute silliness". Sandberg praised backup shortstop Freddy Galvis' attitude (which many in the media saw as the manager {{sending a message to}} the team that no one – including Rollins – was above team rules), and one column examined the point at which Rollins ceased being the team's unquestioned leader. Rollins (who had a good relationship with former manager Charlie Manuel) said, [...] "He's [...] completely different from Charlie from the very onset, their personalities. He's pretty much a <b>real</b> <b>quiet</b> guy, he really is. Charlie was a get-in-your face with jokes type of guy. We're still learning him, he's still learning us from this side of it. Being a coach and being a manager are completely different things – you deal with so much more being a manager." ...|$|E

The game captures sound and shows the sound wave or the frequency spectrum, integrated with an animated character, to students in <b>real</b> time. The <b>quieter</b> the students are the higher the score. A survey was conducted to teachers from an {{elementary and secondary school}} to determine if they considered that noise, caused by the students, was a problem. Most of the teachers considered that students make too much noise. All the classes where the game was tested became quieter, thus showing that when these students perceived, in a quantitative way, how much their behavior was disruptive they were more inclined to be quiet or, at least, {{to reduce the amount of}} noise...|$|R

60|$|The club, nevertheless, went on its way, {{like other}} clubs, and men dined and smoked and played billiards {{and pretended to}} read. Some few {{energetic}} members still hoped that a good day would come in which their grand ideas might be realised,--but as regarded the members generally, they were content {{to eat and drink}} and play billiards. It was a fairly good club,--with a sprinkling of Liberal lordlings, a couple of dozen of members of Parliament who had been made to believe that they would neglect their party duties unless they paid their money, and the usual assortment of barristers, attorneys, city merchants and idle men. It was good enough at any rate for Ferdinand Lopez, who was particular about his dinner, and had an opinion of his own about wines. He had been heard to assert that, for <b>real</b> <b>quiet</b> comfort, there was not a club in London equal to it; but his hearers were not aware that in past days he had been blackballed at the T---- and the G----. These were accidents which Lopez had a gift of keeping in the background. His present companion, Everett Wharton, had, as well as himself, been an original member;--and Wharton had been one of those who had hoped to find in the club a stepping-stone to high political life, and who now talked often with idle energy of the need of organization.|$|E

They dueled down the home-stretch, with Gary Stevens driving <b>Real</b> <b>Quiet</b> forward and Chris McCarron trying to hold his thin lead aboard Free House.

50|$|Baffert's {{history in}} the American classic races began in 1996, when he trained a three-year-old colt named Cavonnier, who ran second in the Kentucky Derby. In 1997, he trained the gray colt Silver Charm to win the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, {{finishing}} second in the Belmont. Baffert would revisit the Derby the next year sending two top colts, <b>Real</b> <b>Quiet</b> and Indian Charlie to Louisville. <b>Real</b> <b>Quiet</b> won the race that year, but Baffert also finished third with Indian Charlie. <b>Real</b> <b>Quiet</b> {{went on to win}} the Preakness as well, but, like Silver Charm, the horse was denied a Triple Crown win and finished second in the Belmont Stakes by a nose. Baffert, however, became the first trainer in history to win the Derby and Preakness in back-to-back years.|$|E

50|$|Although still lightly {{regarded}} in a {{year with}} many quality three-year-olds competing, in 1998 <b>Real</b> <b>Quiet</b> was ridden to victory by jockey Kent Desormeaux in the Kentucky Derby.
