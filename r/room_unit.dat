5|$|On 16February 1944, the {{day after}} the {{contentious}} destruction of Monte Cassino, Eaton took No.3 Squadron through a break in the bad weather to attack the ruined monastery, the only one of No.239 Wing's units to successfully bomb its target that day. He handed over command of No.3 Squadron later that month, and was transferred to No.1 Mobile Operations <b>Room</b> <b>Unit</b> as forward air controller for the final assault on Monte Cassino. The run of luck that Eaton experienced in his first weeks of air combat in Tunisia continued on the ground in Italy. He survived three months of constant artillery fire, including an occasion when a shell exploded directly above his observation post, striking down a British officer standing next to him. He also came under machine-gun fire when he took a wrong turn one day and drove into the German lines, but again escaped unhurt. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 7April, in recognition of his leadership of No.3 Squadron in North Africa, Malta, Sicily and Italy.|$|E

Based on a limited group of fully exposed buildings 54% of single <b>room</b> <b>units</b> contained a hearth, while only 29% of the multiple <b>room</b> <b>units.</b> The average percentage on base of these building units is 47%: probably a more realistic estimate for the site in total.Hearths do not occur in a courtyard context, and are more represented in single room dwellings than multiple <b>room</b> <b>units.</b> Still: multiple <b>room</b> <b>units</b> do have {{a substantial number of}} hearths. It has been suggested that the [...] "multiroom dwellings may have functioned as “incomplete” houses for new families still heavily dependent on the larger extended group”. The buildings containing the hearths do not show particular characteristics that distinguish them from structures without hearths; neither do they differ in size or special orientation. Even the hearth itself does not follow an apparent norm in terms of size or location. The position varies considerably, but it always has one side to the wall. The positioning of the heart {{does not seem to be}} determined by general macro-ecological factors, such as prevailing wind directions, nor determined by cultural norms regarding spatial features within buildings.|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the lithics found at Rudd Creek Pueblo were flaked stone and unretouched, while formal tools that had been carefully produced into an intentional tool, were rare. There were 698 flaked stone artifacts recovered, of which more than 80% were made of high quality silicates (including chert, chalcedony, petrified wood, and quartzite). [...] The {{majority of}} these flakes {{have been identified as}} simple flakes and are thought {{to be the result of}} percussion reduction, or the product of producing flakes by direct impact. As for formal tools, only a small number were recovered during excavation. Six unifaces, five bifaces, eleven saws/denticulates, and eleven projectile points were found and are similar to the tools documented at other Tularosa phase sites. [...] One <b>room</b> (<b>Unit</b> 6) yielded an unusual cache of stone tools in a closed floor pit. The cache consisted of a biface, three projectile points, and one red stone bead. The purpose of the cache is not known, but it has been interpreted that Rudd Creek Pueblo occupants might have gathered the tools from an adjacent area and kept them for ceremonial uses or out of curiosity. The large number of flaked stone in combination with few formal tools suggests that residents of the pueblo focused primarily on quick tool production and used stone flakes more often that formal tools.|$|E

The studied population consisted of 143 nursesworking in emergency <b>room</b> <b>units</b> which were inserted into institutions of high complexity of health care. Data werecollected from 2005 to 2006 using the Bianchi's Stress Scale, consisting of socio-demographic characteristics and by 51 items, divided into six areas, which include the relationship (A), operation of the unit (B), administration of staff(C), nursing care (D), the coordination unit (E) and working conditions (F). Statistical analysis was descriptive andinferential, using analysis of variance ANOVA. In the analysis of these six areas were obtained, "Working conditions(F) " was the most stressful area for nurses and "Relationship (A) " was the least area, regardless of geographicalregion that belonged to the nurse. As conclusion, the organizational structure of hospital has the responsibility in thelevel of stress of the nurses in emergency room, so we need to encourage the use of coping strategies to minimize theeffects of stress in these professionals...|$|R

40|$|Interruptions are {{a central}} {{characteristic}} {{of work in}} critical environments such as hospitals, airlines, and security agencies.

This research hypothesizes that the way notifications are delivered {{can have an impact}} on how work unfolds over time, which in turn can affect performance. Based on theories of interruption and observations in an actual operating room, a computer-based role-playing game simulating the scheduling of surgeries in an operating <b>room</b> <b>unit</b> was developed.

40|$|A room-cooling {{system of}} 2 kW {{capacity}} fueled by wood pellets was designed, built and tested. The system was demonstrated during {{summer at the}} Yakushima Field Station of Kagoshima University, Japan. It contained a pellet feeder, a pellet burner, a heat exchanger, a lithium bromide. water absorption heat pump and a control unit. The volume of the test room was 36. 9 m 3 and ambient temperature 30 °C. The airflow temperature from the <b>room</b> <b>unit</b> was decreased to 16 °C by the system, and the room temperature could be successfully controlled to 24 °C steady state. Room heating in winter was also demonstrated. Since the air was heat exchanged, the overall energy efficiency of the cooling system was low at about 19 %. However, the calculation based on the heat flow showed that the efficiency could be enhanced to about 75 % by direct heating of the regenerator by the flue gas. ...|$|E
50|$|The Central Government School {{was built}} on Gough Street in 1862 {{and it was the}} first {{government}} primary and secondary school in Hong Kong, which provided western education to the public. In 1889, due to the increasing number of students, the school had to relocate to a new campus on Hollywood Road. Later on the school was renamed 'Victoria College', then Queen’s College in 1894. Many local leaders and talent have been nurtured at this school, including the Father of Modern China, Dr Sun Yat-sen and business tycoons such as Sir Robert Ho Tung. They were all elites at the time and contributed a lot to Hong Kong and China’s development. However, during the Japanese Occupation in 1941, the building was destroyed. In 1948, the remaining building was demolished. In 1951, in order to increase the police recruitment in response to the influx of Chinese immigrants after the Chinese Civil War, PMQ provided 140 single <b>room</b> <b>units</b> and 28 double <b>room</b> <b>units</b> for the rank and file officers serving at the nearby Central Police Station. The current and ex- Chief executive C.Y. Leung and Donald Tsang, respectively, both lived there. In 2000, the building was emptied.

40|$|Abstract. Distributed {{cognition}} as {{an approach}} to collaborative work holds that a work unit is cognitive system in which cognitive activities are carried out jointly by workers {{with the use of}} tools. This approach has several direct implications to the study of collaborative work. In this paper, we analysed staff interactions with a large display board in a Level I trauma centre operating <b>room</b> <b>unit.</b> Coordination needs are exacerbated by the unpredictability of incoming emergency surgery patients admitted to the trauma centre as well as other contingencies (such as changes in scheduled surgery cases or staffing). The public display board has evolved into a key component for supporting collaborative work. The physical and perceptual properties of the board are exploited by the clinicians to support rapid paced, highly dynamic work. The canvas-like appearances of the display board, combined with magnetic objects attached to the board, afford its users to taylor the board as an effective coordinative tool and to invent new ways of representing information. Based on the concept of display-based cognition, our analysis illustrates the role of public displays in facilitating negotiation of scheduling, joint planning, and augmenting inter-personal communication...|$|E
