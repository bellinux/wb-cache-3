In this paper, a region-based multiscale decomposition approach to gel image interpretation is presented. Instead of segmentation of each individual protein spot, the gel image is decomposed into small local regions with a quadtree structure. 2 -D Gaussian functions are used to model local image features. Those local regional features will be used for further statistical analysis to extract discriminant features that distinguish different classes of gels.

40|$|Abstract. Computed {{tomography}} {{has advanced}} very rapidly, {{resulting in a}} rapid {{increase in the number}} of examinations performed, as well as in the range of clinical applications now based on this technique. CT is a procedure generally associated with relatively high dose levels. It constitutes 5 % of worldwide radiological examinations, yet contributes one third of the collective dose associated with medical imaging. Therefore, studies on the issue of dose optimization are welcome. Computer simulation uses theoretical models to predict performance of real systems. This kind of simulation is able, among other tasks, to evaluate the impact of geometric parameters of a tomograph on spatial resolution, for example: detector size; source-detector distance and source-isocentre distance. The development of new pre-process and image reconstruction algorithms and the evaluation of dose in organs and tissues of human body are tasks that have been developed by means of computer simulations. In this work, conventional CT acquisitions were completely simulated. Monte Carlo techniques were applied in radiation transport simulation to obtain projection data and to calculate conversion coefficients for doses in organs and tissues of a female anthropomorphic phantom. The computer simulation of the entire measurement and reconstruction process is a valuable and very effective means to evaluate the effects of individual parameters. A graphical reconstruction algorithm was used to obtain virtual tomographic images, the attenuation values of each projection were added to the <b>related</b> <b>pixel</b> of the reconstruction matrix. Several different geometries were simulated and the effect of geometric parameters on image quality and dose in organs and tissues was evaluated...|$|E

AVIRIS pixels average reflectance produced by complex absorption and scattering interactions between biogeochemical composition, canopy architecture, view and illumination angles, species distributions, and plant cover {{as well as}} other factors.

This paper presents a methodology for bridging between point measurements and pixels using geostatistics. Geostatistics have been extensively used in geological or hydrogeolocial studies but have received little application in ecological studies. The key criteria for kriging estimation is that the phenomena varies in space and that an underlying controlling process produces spatial correlation between the measured data points.

In particular, it has been widely observed that the centre of the urban area tends to be of the order of 4 to 6 oC warmer than its rural surroundings (the urban heat island effect). This paper applied remote sensing data to map UHI phenomenon in Enugu urban. The selected area covered Enugu North; Enugu South; and Enugu East with a total area of 18704. 25 hectares.

40|$|Area-based {{least squares}} {{matching}} has existed since the 1980 s, and its development may therefore be regarded by some photogrammetrists as complete. However, {{this is a}} relatively short time in a rapidly changing discipline, and the method does have scope for further refinement. This paper aims to enhance the fidelity of the fundamental mathematical model, which <b>relates</b> <b>pixel</b> positions in area-based matching. If successful, its benefit is seen to lie within close-range photogrammetry, in which object undulations, convergent camera directions and large image scales can introduce significant levels of perspective distortion. It is hypothesised that a model, which takes into account the surface shape within the match window, would provide a pixel position relationship which is applicable across larger windows than those which are applicable with the conventional matching model, based on an affine transformation. The use of larger windows for the image matching increases the redundancy. Revised co-ordinate transformations, based on mathematical surface models across the windows, are proposed in this paper. When tested on the measurement of real objects, even simple surface models are found to increase the complexity of the matching mathematics, but when compared with the traditional affine transformation solution using three test objects, precision improved noticeably. Generally, accuracy also improved, but the improvements were not as distinct as they were for precision. Quicker convergence with fewer iterations was usually obtained, and this is seen as particularly indicative of a more faithful model. Yet more rigorous surface modelling may be worth developing, but the means of choosing the most appropriate models for different objects also remains a question deserving to be pursued...|$|R
