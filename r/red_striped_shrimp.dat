50|$|The {{ribbon of}} Edward VII's Royal Family Order was (working {{outwards}} in) a <b>red</b> <b>stripe,</b> {{almost half the}} size of the centre stripe, a thin gold stripe, about one-fifth of the <b>red</b> <b>stripe,</b> and a blue stripe, almost double the <b>red</b> <b>stripe.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The ribbon is white, with {{a central}} <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> and two {{flanking}} thin <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> on either side.|$|R
2500|$|The ribbon is [...] wide. It has a {{dark green}} centre stripe flanked by white <b>stripes,</b> with <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> at the edge. The white and <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> are the same width.|$|R
25|$|The {{shield of}} the Great Seal has seven white <b>stripes</b> and six <b>red</b> ones—essentially, a white {{background}} with six <b>red</b> <b>stripes.</b> Hopkinson incorporated this stripe arrangement into the Great Seal from the Flag of the United States {{that he had}} designed. Hopkinson also designed a seal for the Admiralty (Navy), which incorporated a chevron consisting of seven <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> and six white ones. The seven <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> in his Admiralty seal reflected the number of <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> in his Naval flag. When Hopkinson designed these flags, he was running the Navy {{as chairman of the}} Continental Navy Board.|$|R
50|$|The first {{equipment}} {{was made in}} white cloth by a dressmaker, had a single <b>red</b> <b>stripe,</b> horizontal, and white shorts, unlike the current, which shows three white horizontal <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> and blue shorts.|$|R
5000|$|The ribbon is grey {{with a white}} centre stripe flanked {{immediately}} on each side by a <b>red</b> <b>stripe,</b> a thin white <b>stripe,</b> another <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> and finally, a thin white stripe, in that order.|$|R
5000|$|The {{national}} flag was {{changed from the}} original [...] to one where the <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> is a centered cross; however, a flag with the former <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> as a saltire was the version commonly used.|$|R
5000|$|In July 2016 Hornby {{released}} three {{versions of}} the HA /class 71 (all with working pantograph); these being E5001 (green, <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> post-1963 rainstrips and with small warning panel), 71 012 (blue full yellow ends), E5022 (green, <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> and without yellow warning panels or post-1963 rainstrips). A further version was produced exclusively for the NRM, this being E5001 (green, <b>red</b> <b>stripe,</b> post-1963 rainstrips but without yellow warning panels). More versions are expected in 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The medal is {{suspended}} from a 40 mm triangular ribbon (dreicksband) of white with two central <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> 4 mm wide and thin <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> {{at the edges}} as well. Combatants could wear crossed gilt swords on the ribbon.|$|R
50|$|The ribbon has {{two black}} stripes {{on the edges}} with two <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> beside it and two golden stripes on the in side with another bold <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> in the middle, the ribbon bar has the {{campaign}} bar attached to it.|$|R
5000|$|... the Flag of Turkmenistan (2001): green, with a {{vertical}} <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> near the hoist side, a white waxing crescent moon and five white five-pointed stars {{appear in the}} upper corner of the field just to the fly side of the <b>red</b> <b>stripe.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The classic design {{featuring}} green <b>stripe,</b> <b>red</b> <b>stripe,</b> yellow stripe and indigo stripe on a {{white background}} ...|$|R
50|$|The {{badge and}} {{the design of the}} star are {{similar to that of the}} Grand Commander but smaller. The riband has a navy blue {{background}} and on both the edges are <b>red</b> <b>stripes.</b> In the centre are <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> (broad) flanked by narrow ones.|$|R
50|$|The ribbon has {{two black}} stripes on the edges, with two <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> beside it, with two gold stripes {{on the inside}} of the <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> and in the center is a blue stripe. The ribbon bar has the medal clasp {{attached}} to it.|$|R
50|$|The {{main colour}} scheme {{for all the}} trains are black with <b>red</b> <b>stripe,</b> {{excluding}} C651 with the only exterior with white and <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> and C801 with green and <b>red</b> <b>stripes.</b> Future SMRT trains and refurbished trains will bear the new SMRT livery, which consist of white, red, black and yellow pixel livery, unless LTA uses its own livery for newer rolling stocks, similar to C951 and CT251 (also known as T251). Current fleets with the new liveries are the C801A and the C151B trains.|$|R
50|$|Both medals are {{suspended}} from the same broad royal blue ribbon with <b>red</b> outer <b>stripes</b> and, at the centre, double white <b>stripes</b> with a <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> between.|$|R
5000|$|The medal ribbon {{contains}} a broad central stripe of bright yellow surmounted by three thin <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> (representing the Republic of Vietnam). The ribbon {{also has a}} blue stripe to represent the Navy, two <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> for the Army and a light blue stripe for the Air Force.|$|R
50|$|As {{its name}} suggests, this species {{is capable of}} {{capturing}} and consuming small pieces of human skin and teeth. However, Oxylebius pictus (the painted greenling) and Lebbeus grandimanus (candy <b>stripe</b> <b>shrimp)</b> {{have the ability to}} remain among the tentacles without being harmed.|$|R

25|$|Fire fighters' helmets are white, (senior fire fighters have a <b>red</b> <b>stripe),</b> {{with the}} fire fighters surname {{on the back of}} the helmet in reflective, glow in the dark writing. Lieutenants and Captains have yellow helmets (the captain has a <b>red</b> <b>stripe),</b> and Deputy Group Officers and above have red helmets.|$|R
5000|$|The ribbon {{consists}} of a red centre band flanked immediately on each side by a white stripe, followed by a grey stripe with a thin <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> in the centre, then a white band, a thin grey <b>stripe,</b> a thin <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> and finally, a grey band, in that order.|$|R
50|$|The medal is {{secured to}} a {{standard}} Soviet pentagonal mount by a ring through the medal suspension loop. The mount is covered by a 24mm wide blue silk moiré ribbon with three 1mm wide central <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> separated by 2mm, and two largers 4.5mm <b>red</b> <b>stripes</b> situated 1mm from the edges.|$|R
40|$|Inheritance {{study of}} {{groundnut}} {{indicated that a}} single dominant gene governed the flower with <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard. All F 1 plants had <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard. The segregation of F 3 : 2 families (derived from individual F 2 plants) showed 1 : 2 : 1 expected ratio (χ 2 = 0. 659) of 1 non-segregating (plants with <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard) to 2 segregating (plants with <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard and plants with no <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard) to 1 non-segregating (plant with no <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard). When the F 3 groundnut families which had plants with <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard were combined, the segregation ratio was not different from the 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio (χ 2 = 0. 073). The symbols for standard flower trait were designated St for dominant trait and st for recessive trait. For peg's color characteristic, the plants with <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard flower had purple peg. It {{is possible that the}} <b>red</b> <b>stripe</b> on standard flower gene had a pleiotropic effect on peg color or this may indicate linked genes. For characters of pod, the F 1 showed moderately reticulate pods. The segregation of F 3 : 2 families showed also a 1 : 2 : 1 expected ratio (χ 2 = 0. 067) giving 1 non-segregating (plants with reticulate pod) to 2 segregating (plants with reticulate pod and plants with smooth pod) to 1 non-segregating (plants with smooth pod). When the F 3 groundnut families which had plants with reticulate pod were combined, the segregation ratio was not different from the 3 : 1 Mendelian ratio (χ 2 = 0. 065). The results indicated that pod characters were governed by a single gene. The symbols of pod character were designated Re for dominant gene and re for recessive gene. For yield components study, the F 3 generation had lower yield than their parents did but some of them had similar yield with their parents. Yield components were highly correlated with each other. In addition, yield components of F 3 families were also correlated with their leaf characters. The plants with larger leaf had bigger pods, more prolific pods, and heavier seeds...|$|R
