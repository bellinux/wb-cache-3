Results are presented for flows at nominal freestream Mach Numbers of 2, 3 and 4. For studies at the tunnel sidewalls, the shock waves were produced by conical shock generators mounted on the centerline of the wind tunnel at zero angle of attack.

40|$|Of {{particular}} {{importance to the}} development of models for isolated vortex ring dynamics in a real fluid is knowledge of ambient fluid entrainment by the ring. This time-dependent process dictates changes in the volume of fluid that must share impulse delivered by the vortex <b>ring</b> <b>generator.</b> Therefore fluid entrainment is also of immediate significance to the unsteady forces that arise due to the presence of vortex rings in starting flows. Applications ranging from industrial and transportation, to animal locomotion and cardiac flows, are currently being investigated to understand the dynamical role of the observed vortex ring structures. Despite this growing interest, fully empirical measurements of fluid entrainment by isolated vortex rings have remained elusive. The primary difficulties arise in defining the unsteady boundary of the ring, as well as an inability to maintain the vortex ring in the test section sufficiently long to facilitate measurements. We present a new technique for entrainment measurement that utilizes a coaxial counter-flow to retard translation of vortex rings generated from a piston–cylinder apparatus, so that their growth due to fluid entrainment can be observed.

40|$|The vortex wake {{structure}} of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, was investigated using a vortex <b>ring</b> <b>generator.</b> Based on existing kinematic and morphological data, a piston and tube apparatus was constructed to produce circular vortex rings with {{the same size and}} disc loading as a hovering hawkmoth. Results show that the artificial rings were initially laminar, but developed turbulence owing to azimuthal wave instability. The initial impulse and circulation were accurately estimated for laminar rings using particle image velocimetry; after the transition to turbulence, initial circulation was generally underestimated. The underestimate for turbulent rings can be corrected if the transition time and velocity profile are accurately known, but this correction will not be feasible for experiments on real animals. It is therefore crucial that the circulation and impulse be estimated while the wake vortices are still laminar. The scaling of the ring Reynolds number suggests that flying animals of about the size of hawkmoths may be the largest animals whose wakes stay laminar for long enough to perform such measurements during hovering. Thus, at low advance ratios, they may be the largest animals for which wake circulation and impulse can be accurately measured...|$|E
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{behaviour}} of shock-generated compressible vortex rings. A comparison between these {{results and the}} behaviour of incompressible rings is made {{in order to identify}} the effects of compressibility on the flow. Three aspects of the problem are studied: the first is the production of compressible vortex rings. A comparison is made between the equipment used in incompressible and compressible studies. Then, a way to gain some control over the fluid ejection velocity program of compressible ring generators is presented. This method highlights the similarities that exist between the compressible and incompressible studies. The second part looks at the propagation of compressible vortex rings produced by two distinct generators. We find that neither compressibility, nor viscosity effects have any measurable effects on the observations. However, the ejection velocity program that characterizes the <b>ring</b> <b>generator</b> has an influence on both the propagation and the trajectory of the rings. Finally, the formation process of compressible rings is explored by studying the evolution of the ring's circulation as it propagates. By comparison with results regarding incompressible rings, we find that compressibility stretches the formation time of the rings. And again, the ejection velocity program affects the results as the observed ring circulation levels are different for different velocity programs. These results explain the origin of the embedded shock previously observed {{at the center of the}} ring and make it possible to predict its formation...|$|E

40|$|Get Away Special (GAS) payload G- 093, {{also called}} VORTEX (VOrtex Ring Transit EXperiment), is an {{investigation}} of the propagation of a vortex ring through a liquid-gas interface in microgravity. This process results in the formation of one or more liquid droplets similar to earth based liquid atomization systems. In the absence of gravity, surface tension effects dominate the drop formation process. The Shuttle's microgravity environment allows the study of the same fluid atomization processes as using a larger drop size than is possible on Earth. This enables detailed experimental studies of the complex flow processes encountered in liquid atomization systems. With VORTEX, deformations in both the vortex ring and the fluid surface will be measured closely {{for the first time in}} a parameters range that accurately resembles liquid atomization.

It has a large diameter 61. 4 cm and low speed 37. 5 rpm. Three phase one layer concentrated winding design is investigated. The design was carried out {{with the help of}} SmartCAD machine design and Comsol software. Contribution is done to add an optimization loop to the machine design software. Monte-Carlo method is used to optimize the design with the objective of high efficiency and low cost. Cost optimization includes cost of material, cost of production and cost of losses or efficiency. Production cost is added to the SmartCAD design tool as a separate subroutine. Three groups of slot and pole combinations are considered. The slot and pole combinations with Np = Ns &# 177; 2 k where k= 1, 2 are further narrowed down to Np = Ns + 2, with higher fundamental winding factor and lower cogging torque amplitude. The optimal design has 72 slots and 74 poles with 86. 7 % efficiency. Cost of material and production is estimated of 3085 NOK. With assumption of 4000 hours operational time per year and life time of ten years, the cost per kWh for the WEC is estimated. Based on the SmartMotor experience, cost of the mechanical and electrical parts will be roughly as 1 NOK/kWh per year. This is comparable to the cost of Salter duck and higher than IPS OWEC. The further investment and improvement is worthy. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is then used to confirm optimality of the design. The parameters are measured in Comsol and then compared with the Matlab result. The entire machine is simulated as rotor moving across one pole pair. </p...|$|E
