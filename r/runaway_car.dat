2500|$|Scripts for the final, sixth season re-established {{a bit of}} the {{seriousness}} of the show, often with science fiction elements like a Kryptonite-powered robot, atomic explosions, and impregnable metal cubes. In one of the last episodes, [...] "The Perils of Superman" [...] (a takeoff on The Perils of Pauline), there was indeed deadly peril straight out of the movie serials: Lois tied to a set of railroad tracks with a speeding train bearing down on her, Perry White nearly sawed in half while tied to a log, Jimmy in a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> headed for a cliff, and Clark Kent immersed in a vat of acid. This was one of three episodes directed by George Reeves himself. Noel Neill's hair was dyed a bright red for this season, though the color change was not apparent in the initial black-and-white broadcasts. ABC-TV aired episodes in its [...] "Fun At Five" [...] series during the 1957-58 season.|$|E
5000|$|Free Wheeling was {{edited by}} a couple minutes on the {{syndicated}} Little Rascals television packages due to perceived racism toward African Americans in 1971. The film was restored on AMC airing from 2001 to 2003.The [...] "free wheeling" [...] downhill scenes involving the <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> were filmed on Outpost Drive in Hollywood, California.|$|E
5000|$|Duncan bore two {{children}} both {{out of wedlock}} - the first, Deirdre Beatrice (born September 24, 1906), by theatre designer Gordon Craig, and the second, Patrick Augustus (born May 1, 1910), by Paris Singer, {{one of the many}} sons of sewing machine magnate Isaac Singer. Both children drowned while away from their mother in the care of their nanny in 1913 when their <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> went into the Seine.|$|E
50|$|South of Hjuksebø, {{the line}} slopes {{downwards}} towards Holtsås station. The shunter made {{a desperate attempt}} to run and catch up with the <b>runaway</b> <b>cars,</b> hoping to jump on it and engage the emergency brake. The shunter was able at first to clamber onto one of the cars, but was blocked from getting {{to the front of the}} <b>runaway</b> <b>cars</b> where the crucial brake was located, so he was forced to jump off and try to run alongside it to reach the front. The breakaway cars were now speeding up and the shunter failed to make it. The engine which had pushed the cars followed, after the runaway, hooting a warning signal to warn trains ahead of the danger.|$|R
50|$|The <b>runaway</b> <b>cars</b> had {{travelled}} {{for almost}} three kilometres before they ploughed into the incoming express, and the speed was probably around 60 km/h. The express train was moving at 70-75 km/h, {{in spite of its}} emergency brake being pulled in the seconds before the collision.|$|R
50|$|The {{freight train}} had crossed Eccellente station without anyone noticing it lost 28 of its cars and was missing its tail lights, and later stopped at Vibo Pizzo station {{understanding}} something went wrong. The boxcars got {{detached from the}} convoy at kilometer 266+200, when a clamp broke and set the boxcars free. The <b>runaway</b> <b>cars</b> {{came to a stop}} on the tracks.|$|R
50|$|As {{is typical}} in serial films, each episode ends on a cliff-hanger. For example: {{the two girls}} are driving in a car along a road that {{parallels}} the speeding train, when a henchman's revolver shatters the windshield of Betty's car, blinding her and sending her car toward the on-rushing train. Other cliff-hanger endings include a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> sailing off the cliff into a lake and our heroes being trapped by rising water in a dungeon.|$|E
50|$|Robert Davenport and co-worker Fern Farmer {{were killed}} when a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> {{ploughed}} into the shopfront of Robert's catering business. The driver was Dave's recently arrived stepson Jake Walker (Seb Castang) who {{lost control of the}} stolen car during a police chase, following a botched deal by Gabriel Drummond. The biggest casualty of Davis's arrival was the show's only remaining original character to have appeared continuously for the entire run of the series, Roy Farmer, who was killed in a fire in his Internet café business.|$|E
50|$|But {{the steep}} {{slope of the}} Rue de Belleville caused the more {{spectacular}} accidents. The greatest was on 6 January 1906, when a ruptured grip resulted in a <b>runaway</b> <b>car.</b> It continued the whole length of the Rue de Belleville, crossing the Rue des Pyrénées at nearly 120 km/h (according to the press reports) before being derailed and overturning in the Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple. The passengers panicked and ran, causing 17 injuries. In 1907 and 1909, brake failures caused two collisions between the tramcars and Mekarski system cars at the Rue des Pyrénées crossroads.|$|E
50|$|Cars used by éX-Drivers {{are marked}} with an éX-D decal. Typically an éX-Driver car {{would be an}} older {{mechanical}} type car and almost always would be rear-wheel drive {{with the exception of}} an AWD (4WD) Subaru Impreza WRC since éX-Drivers usually employ techniques such as drifting when bringing down <b>runaway</b> <b>cars,</b> which is much more difficult with front wheel drive (FWD) cars and in an all wheel drive (AWD) car.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{accident}} {{occurred in}} 1981, when <b>runaway</b> freight <b>cars</b> belonging to Norwegian State Railways derailed near the bridge over Loenga, only 100 meters from Sjursøya. An incident with <b>runaway</b> CargoNet freight <b>cars</b> also {{occurred in the}} terminal area at Trondheim Central Station on 28 January 2010, but this accident caused only material damage.|$|R
50|$|On 15 November 1950 the Hjuksebø train {{disaster}} killed 14 {{people in}} a collision between an express train and <b>runaway</b> freight <b>cars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Garber {{follows the}} runaway train above ground until {{he realizes that}} the hijackers must have {{defeated}} the dead-man's switch, and returns to where the train stopped. He draws a gun on Blue, ordering him to surrender. Told that New York has no death penalty, Blue electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail. Meanwhile, as the <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> enters the loop at South Ferry Station leading back uptown; the train's excessive speed activates the automatic safeties built into the system to stop cars travelling too fast; and the car grinds to a halt leaving the remaining hostages unharmed.|$|E
5000|$|The true {{emergency}} brake on a cable car {{is known as}} a [...] "slot blade," [...] a steel wedge that can be forced into the slot-rail between the running rails by a strong spring. If a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> is moving fast enough that the slot blade is necessary, the friction has been known to weld the blade to the slot rail, disabling the transit line until the obstruction can be extracted with a cutting torch. The slot blade is controlled by the large red lever near the grip, and is not used except for emergency stops.|$|E
50|$|Frank Ross (Cagney) is a crusading {{reporter}} for a big-city newspaper {{on the trail}} of a crooked district attorney, Jesse Hanley, who is running for election as governor of the state. At the Banton Construction Co., Ross sees Hanley and his accomplice Grayce (Jory) burning books and ledgers to thwart a possible investigation brought about by the paper that Ross works for. His editor Patterson backs Ross in getting Hanley but the D.A. decides to get rid of him, so frames him. Knocked out and covered in whiskey, he is put in a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> which collides with another, killing 3 young people and is thrown in prison for one to twenty years on a charge of automotive manslaughter.|$|E
50|$|On July 29, 2015, 91 {{freight cars}} ran {{away in the}} CN MacMillan Yard after they {{separated}} from a switching locomotive. Nine of those freight cars derailed and two freight cars on an adjacent track were damaged when the <b>runaway</b> <b>cars</b> collided at low speed with other cars that {{were a part of}} an incoming train in the yard. No injuries were reported. The Transportation Safety Board sent two inspectors to the site to investigate the incident.|$|R
50|$|Train 587 driver {{tried to}} brake {{at the last}} moment, but the train was {{traveling}} at 120 km/h and {{could not possibly be}} stopped in less than 1000 meters. Being in a dark night and the <b>runaway</b> <b>cars</b> missing their tail lights (electricity is provided by the engine), the available distance was far too short to stop the passenger train. The passenger train hit the cars and derailed, four of its coaches swerving on the northbound track.|$|R
50|$|In June 2012, Big Grizzly Mountain <b>Runaway</b> Mine <b>Cars</b> began soft openings. On 14 July 2012, {{the ride}} was officially {{opened to the}} public.|$|R
5000|$|James [...] "Jimmy" [...] Donnelly (Tom Guiry) - The {{oldest of}} 4 brothers, Jimmy is a troublemaker and drug user, often {{involved}} in criminal activity, and known for making stupid decisions. He walks {{with a permanent}} limp, incurred when a speeding, <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> crushed his leg, when he was young. (Jimmy does not know who was driving the car; only Joey Ice Cream and Tommy {{know that it was}} actually little Tommy.) Jimmy believes he should be the leader of the Donnelly brothers, but his constant temper flare-ups cause people to believe him incapable of leadership, so they follow Tommy. This constant battle for being in charge causes friction between the two brothers throughout the season.|$|E
5000|$|Mac Gargan {{appears in}} the 2017 film Spider-Man: Homecoming, portrayed by Michael Mando. The film's {{interpretation}} of the character is a criminal rather than a private investigator and has a scorpion tattoo on his neck. He meets with the Vulture's associates at the Staten Island Ferry {{as part of a}} deal to receive alien weapons technology. Spider-Man interrupts the deal and attaches Gargan {{to the back of the}} Ferry with webbing. He is then knocked into the bay by a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> in the ensuing destruction. In a mid-credits scene, Gargan is physically-scarred and meets Adrian Toomes in prison, and says he has friends on the outside who want to join forces to kill Spider-Man. When Mac mentions the rumors that Toomes knows who Spider-Man is, Toomes denies it.|$|E
50|$|Parts of {{the film}} - {{including}} the <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> scene - were shot on location in the Telegraph Hill area of San Francisco. Long shots of {{the exterior of the}} mansion were a combination of matte paintings and studio-made facades that were erected {{in front of the house}} at 1541 Montgomery Street. This was the location of the longtime Telegraph Hill restaurant called Julius' Castle, which closed its doors in 2008 after operating for 84 years. Closer shots of the exterior entrance and driveway were filmed on a studio lot, and scenes for the garden and backyard were filmed on the lawn of Coit Tower. The corner market seen in the film was Speedy's New Union Grocery at 301 Union at the corner of Montgomery, which also closed in 2008 after 93 years in business. Marc Bennett's office building was the Crocker flatiron building located at One Post Street, which in 1969 was demolished and replaced by the skyscraper now known as McKesson Plaza.|$|E
50|$|The line also {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being dangerous. Although the company had built a counterweight system to slow cars on a Harrison Street hill between 2nd and 3rd, no such system was added to another hill on Chenery Street, which became the site of a number of <b>runaway</b> <b>cars.</b> Even an injury to a boy there on opening day did not spur the company to action. After a few such accidents, the company finally relaid the track and purchased cars with better brakes.|$|R

50|$|Six years later, a now 16-year-old Peter Parkette (Austin O'Brien) is a {{computer}} hacker and living in the subways of a cyberpunk Los Angeles {{with a group of}} other runaway teens. While hooked into cyberspace, Jobe reconnects with Peter and asks him to find Dr. Trace for him. Peter locates Trace living out in a desert and brings him to his hideout to speak with Jobe. Online, Jobe shows Trace his newly constructed cyber world and asks for info on Egypt, a hidden Nano routine in the chip's design. Trace refuses to tell him, noting Jobe to be insane and that he wouldn't understand its power. Enraged, Jobe hacks into the subway's system computer to send another train crashing into the one Trace and the teenagers are in, but Trace causes the <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> to crash into a construction site instead. However, the group is forced to flee after the entire tunnel is blown out.|$|E

5000|$|Bale Pandiya (Sivaji Ganesan) is a {{young man}} who leads a troubled life. He is {{continuously}} being chased by Marudhu (also Sivaji Ganesan) - a look-alike of him and Marudhu's boss Kabali (M. R. Radha), who would be given a lot of money if they killed Pandiya. While being chased by them once, he gets into a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> being driven by an insane young girl(Vasanthi). The car crashes, but the girl gets cured from her insanity. Her father allows Pandiya, who is homeless, to stay with them. Parallelly, Pandiya falls for Geetha (Devika) and her father Amritha Lingam (also M. R. Radha) accepts the romance. But Marudhu and Kabali's pursuit for Pandiya still continues, and they successfully toss him into the sea. However Pandiya's elder brother Shankar (also Sivaji Ganesan), a scientist finds out about everything and agrees to help. He pretends to be Pandiya after faking his own death and confronts Marudhu and Kabali, making them shocked to see [...] "Pandiya" [...] alive. Just then, the real Pandiya steps in, revealing that two fisherman saved him from drowning and hell breaks loose. The two brothers battle the criminals and in the process, Kabali accidentally shoots Marudhu dead. Saddened by the death of his friend, he commits suicide. So Pandiya and Geetha are re-united.|$|E
50|$|The {{station master}} at Hjuksebø {{realised}} the impending danger and called down to Holtsås hoping {{to stop the}} incoming passenger train no. 72. The call was too late, and the <b>runaway</b> freight <b>cars</b> and the train no. 72 collided at 10:50.|$|R

50|$|John Turner, {{who never}} learned to read or write but became a wealthy landowner, left land and money to the {{community}} to build a school {{when he died in}} 1844 at the age of 83. It was called Squirrel Hill School and was located on Bigelow Street at Hazelwood Avenue in the Greenfield neighborhood. Its successor closed in 1915 and was replaced by Roosevelt School, named for then-president Theodore Roosevelt. It closed in 1957. It was replaced by John Minadeo Elementary School, named for a ninth-grade school crossing guard who gave his life to save a group of young students in the path of a <b>runaway</b> <b>car</b> near Gladstone School.After Peebles Township was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1868, Squirrel Hill became the Colfax School District, named for Schuyler Colfax, who was Vice President of the United States under President Ulysses S. Grant. The district had five numbered schools. Colfax No. 1 was located at Phillips Avenue and Beechwood Boulevard. Today, it is Pittsburgh Colfax K-8. Colfax No. 2 was on Beechwood Boulevard near the intersection of Saline Street and Hazelwood Avenue near Browns Hill Road. It closed in 1907 but was reopened in 1916 as the Roosevelt School Annex when Roosevelt became overcrowded. The annex closed in 1939. Colfax No. 3, on Forward Avenue, became Forward Avenue School and was named after Walter Forward, who was appointed U.S. Secretary of the Treasury by President John Tyler. The school was torn down in 1923, but its retaining wall still exists under the Parkway East bridge over Saline Street. Colfax No. 4, at Whipple and Commercial streets, became Swisshelm School and was named for Jane Swisshelm, a writer and abolitionist. Colfax No. 5, at Solway and Wightman streets, became Wightman School and was named for Thomas Wightman, owner of the Thomas Wightman Glass Company. Wightman operated as a school from 1897 to 1980 and since then {{has been used as a}} community center building and the home of House Children's Center. The building underwent extensive restoration and remodeling to make it one of only two older buildings in Western Pennsylvania to have LEED Gold certification.Two other public elementary schools existed in Squirrel Hill. Brown School was built near the Monongahela River in 1888 on land donated by the Brown family. It closed in 1932. H.B. Davis School, named for a principal of the Frick Training School for Teachers, was located on Phillips Avenue. It opened in 1931 and closed in 1980.|$|E
50|$|Catch points {{originate}} {{from the days}} of the 'unfitted' goods train. As these trains tended to consist of either completely unbraked wagons (relying entirely on the locomotive's own brakes), or ones with unlinked, manually applied brakes (necessitating a stop at the top of steep downgrades for the guard to walk along the train and set the brakes on each wagon in turn), they also lacked any mechanism to automatically brake <b>runaway</b> <b>cars.</b> Catch points were therefore required to stop the rear portion of a poorly coupled train that might break away whilst climbing a steep grade - although they would also stop vehicles that ran away for any other reason. Now that trains are all 'fitted' (and broken couplings are far less common), catch points are mostly obsolete.|$|R
50|$|Big Grizzly Mountain <b>Runaway</b> Mine <b>Cars</b> (Traditional Chinese: 灰熊山極速礦車) is a steel {{roller coaster}} in the Grizzly Gulch section of Hong Kong Disneyland. The {{attraction}} features Audio-Animatronic bears {{as well as}} a backwards section. Big Grizzly Mountain is the second mountain and third roller coaster attraction at Hong Kong Disneyland.|$|R
50|$|The Hjuksebø train {{disaster}} was a rail {{accident on}} the Sørlandet Line on 15 November 1950 between the stations of Hjuksebø and Holtsås in the Sauherad municipality in Telemark, Norway. With fourteen deaths {{resulting from the}} crash, this was Norway's worst railway accident in peacetime until the Tretten train disaster in 1975. The accident was caused by <b>runaway</b> freight <b>cars</b> running into an express passenger train.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 1958, {{a string}} of {{a dozen or more}} cement cars and a caboose broke loose from Port Morris Wye, {{beginning}} what was likely among the longest runaways in North American railroading history. The crew of the East End Drill was awaiting orders to move the cars when they began to drift westbound down the grade. Engineless, the cars ran through a switch and onto the eastbound track of the Cut-Off, beginning a [...] journey that reached a top speed of perhaps [...] or more. A chase locomotive was dispatched from Port Morris in a futile attempt to try to catch the cars. [...] Within a half-hour the string had derailed at the sharp (...) curve at Point of Gap in the Delaware Water Gap, falling into the Delaware River at approximately the same location as the 1948 accident. [...] No one was injured, although an eastbound freight quickly took Greendell siding just ahead of the <b>runaway</b> <b>cars,</b> narrowly avoiding a catastrophic collision. [...] The runaway was blamed on a worker who had not properly set the brakes.|$|R
2500|$|Boston's MBTA {{says its}} [...] "Cab Signal with Positive Stop" [...] system can stop a train that passes a stop signal or when another train {{is in its}} path; the system averted {{disaster}} in March 2008 when it stopped a train heading for a <b>runaway</b> freight <b>car.</b> The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority had Automatic Train Control on 80% of its system, and was planning to install it in the other 20% by 2014.|$|R
