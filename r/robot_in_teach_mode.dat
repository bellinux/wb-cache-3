The Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS) was used to measure facilitator teaching mode; the Adapted Principles of Adult Learning Scale (APALS) was used to measure learner perception of facilitator teaching mode; and the Teaching Perspectives Inventory (TPI) was used to measure facilitator teaching perspective. The sample was 34 facilitators in colleges/universities and public/corporate training organizations and their 286 learners. Facilitator variables examined were age, gender, race, occupational field, professional preparation, years teaching experience, and program taught. Facilitators were designated as non-collaborative, but were found to be slightly more collaborative than other groups of instructors and teachers from past studies. There was moderate agreement between facilitator espoused and learner perceived <b>teaching</b> <b>mode,</b> yet learners rated facilitators lower on collaborative <b>teaching</b> <b>mode</b> than facilitators rated themselves.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, as {{software}} development {{has moved from}} a platform specific, desktop based software approach to a web focused environment, the ability to develop courses for wider delivery has increased.

This is brought about by the need to select programming environments that are readily available to online students, along with detailed learning materials that allow online students to work at the same level of detail as on campus students. The integration of freely available and easily configurable development environments and teaching/assessment items based on those environments provide the opportunity for international teaching partners to support both their staff and students.

40|$|This {{paper will}} explore the {{opportunities}} {{and strategies for}} encouraging student interaction {{in the area of}} online learning. It is my observation, both as a teacher and a learner, that encouraging teachers and students to see online learning {{as an integral part of}} the learning journey cannot be separated from the more specific topic of encouraging students to participate in communicating and interacting in an eLearning environment. A Computer Moderated Conference (CMC) with Masters students undertaking a class in flexible, online and distance education, has lead me to explore a number of facets of this issue. The role of the teacher leads into issues of student motivation to interact, in many cases. The tutor also has a role to play in building confidence and ensuring that students don't suffer information overload. Underpinning the teacher's role and their own motivation to participate online, is a basic questioning about why they should use eLearning and what is driving the shift <b>in</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>mode.</b> It could be argued that students are motivated primarily by their desire to learn, then by many other more complex factors. Their participation in online learning, particularly CMC can also be seen as a product of factors such as individual learning styles, gender, personality and cultural background, among other attributes. While student attributes certainly play a part in their interaction online, the role of the teacher as facilitator needs to be considered as a primary motivator for student interaction in an eLearning environment...|$|R
