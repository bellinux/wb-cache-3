5000|$|<b>Reticulated</b> <b>foam</b> {{is a very}} porous, low density solid foam. 'Reticulated' means like a net. Reticulated foams are {{extremely}} open foams i.e. there are few, if any, intact bubbles or cell windows. In contrast, the foam formed by soap bubbles is composed solely of intact (fully enclosed) bubbles. In a <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam</b> only the lineal boundaries where the bubbles meet ( [...] Plateau borders [...] ) remain. The solid component of a <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam</b> may be an organic polymer like polyurethane, a ceramic or a metal. These materials are used {{in a wide range}} of applications where the high porosity and large surface area are needed, including filters, catalyst supports, fuel tank inserts, and loudspeaker covers.|$|E

Integrated component systems include transportation seating, motion mechanism systems, and bed builds.|$|E
50|$|A {{description}} {{of the structure of}} reticulated foams is still being developed. While Plateau's laws, the rules governing the shape of soap films in foams were developed in the 19th century, a mathematical {{description of}} the structure is still debated. The computer-generated Weaire-Phelan structure is the most recent. In a <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam</b> only the edges of the polyhedra remain; the faces are missing. In commercial <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam,</b> up to 98% of the faces are removed. The dodecahedron is sometimes given as the basic unit for these foams, but the most representative shape is a polyhedron with 13 faces. Cell size and cell size distribution are critical parameters for most applications. Porosity is typically 95%, but can be as high as 98%. Reticulation affects many of the physical properties of a foam. Typically resistance to compression is decreased while tensile properties like elongation and resistance to tearing are increased.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reticulated</b> ceramic <b>foams</b> {{are made}} by coating a <b>reticulated</b> {{polyurethane}} <b>foam</b> with an aqueous suspension of a ceramic powder then heating the material to first evaporate the water then fuse the ceramic particles and finally to burn off the organic polymer.|$|R
5000|$|Solid foams are a {{class of}} {{lightweight}} cellular engineering materials. These foams are typically classified into two types based on their pore structure: open-cell-structured foams (also known as <b>reticulated</b> <b>foams)</b> and closed-cell foams. At high enough cell resolutions, any type can be treated as continuous or [...] "continuum" [...] materials and {{are referred to as}} cellular solids, with predictable mechanical properties.|$|R
50|$|The {{other major}} layer {{structure}} is coating, where melt spraying is very important, but chemical and {{physical vapour deposition}} and chemical (e.g., sol-gel and polymer pyrolysis) methods are all seeing increased use. Besides open structures from formed tape, extruded structures, such as honeycomb catalyst supports, and highly porous structures, including various foams, for example, <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam,</b> are of increasing use.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century it was {{discovered}} that melamine foam is an effective abrasive cleaner. The open-cell foam is microporous and its polymeric substance is very hard, so that when used for cleaning it works like extremely fine sandpaper, getting into tiny grooves and pits in the object being cleaned. On a larger scale the material feels soft. Because the <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam</b> bubbles interconnect, its structure is a 3D network of very hard strands, when compared to the array of separate bubbles in a material such as styrofoam.|$|E

In this work, the compression strength and specific surface area of <b>reticulated</b> <b>foams</b> have been improved, {{while at the same}} time maintaining a high level of permeability in the final foam structure. In particular, a vacuum infiltration step by using a suitable slurry, followed by a pre-sintering cycle was adopted for filling up the hollow struts, generated due to the burnout of the PU foam. Furthermore, various mixtures of fine and coarse-grained alumina as well as in combination with zirconia, were utilised with the aim of controlling the foam properties such as compression strength, specific surface area and permeability. The compression strength was improved by a factor of two for alumina foams by infiltrating the hollow struts, and by a factor of four when infiltrating the struts of ZTA foams, with the composition 70 mol% Al 2 O 3 and 30 mol% ZrO 2. The weight gain resulting from the vacuum infiltration process was in the order of 10 wt%...|$|R

5000|$|Robert A. Volz is {{credited}} with discovering the first process for making <b>reticulated</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> in 1956 while working for the Scott Paper Company. Producing <b>reticulated</b> polyurethane <b>foam</b> is a two step procedure: a conventional closed-cell polyurethane foam is produced, then the faces (or [...] "windows") of the cells are removed. The high surface area and lower mass of the cells' faces compared with the cells' struts (or edges) makes them much more susceptible to both combustion and chemical degradation; either filling the closed-cell foam with a combustible gas like hydrogen and igniting it under controlled conditions, or exposing the foam to a sodium hydroxide solution will remove the faces and leave the edges.|$|R

5000|$|Memory foam is {{affected}} by temperature. In a cool bedroom, a memory foam mattress will feel firmer than it does in a warm bedroom. Memory softens and conforms to the sleeper in response to body temperature and body weight. Traditional memory foam molds to the body creating a depression the sleeper must roll out of when changing sleep positions. Mattress manufacturers have responded to this issue by using [...] "faster response" [...] memory foams. They spring back more quickly when the sleeper moves. Foam mattresses are also known to generally [...] "sleep warmer" [...] than innerspring mattresses. Mattress makers have addressed the issue with [...] "open-cell" [...] memory foams, pinhole cored memory foam, gel-infused memory foams, channel-cut foam cores, <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam</b> support layers and other technologies to improve air circulation through all-foam beds.|$|E

40|$|Experiments with vortex rings {{impinging}} permeable {{and solid}} boundaries {{are presented in}} order to investigate the influence of permeability. Utilizing Particle Image Velocimetry, we compared the behaviour of a vortex ring impinging four different <b>reticulated</b> <b>foams</b> (with permeability k ~ 26 - 85 × 10 - 8 m 2) and a solid boundary. Results show how permeability affects the stretching phenomena of the vortex ring and the formation and evolution of the secondary vortex ring with opposite sign. Moreover, permeability also affects the macroscopic no-slip boundary condition found on the solid boundary, turning it into an apparent slip boundary condition for the most permeable boundary. The apparent slip-boundary condition and the flux exchange between the ambient fluid and the foam are jointly responsible for both the modified formation of the secondary vortex and changes on the vortex ring diameter increase.

40|$|In {{this work}} the thermoacoustic {{performance}} of a stack realized with open-cell foam is analysed. Starting from the elementary cell and its strut parameters the pore structure has been investigated to improve the power conversion inside a standing-wave thermoacoustic engine. The so called “Johnson-Champoux-Allard” model is used for this scope. Results are compared with those provided by ordinary stack realized with straight pores whose cross-sections have regular shapes (i. e. circular, parallel plate). Since thermoacoustic performance is strongly affected by stack properties (such as its length, its porosity, the geometry, the shape of its pores, the operating frequency {{as well as the}} type of material), an optimization procedure has been used to optimize the thermoacoustic engine performance for the same working conditions (thermal power provided by the heat exchangers and the related temperatures). This study reveals that, for the investigated working conditions, partially <b>reticulated</b> open-cell <b>foams</b> have the best performance with respect to fully <b>reticulated</b> open-cell <b>foams</b> and the traditional stacks...|$|R
5000|$|A couch {{consists}} of the frame, the padding and the covering. The frame is usually made of wood but can also be made of steel, plastic or laminated boards. The wood used under the upholstery is made from kiln-dried maple wood that is free of knots, bark or defects. The show wood of the legs, arms and back can be maple, mahogany, walnut or fruitwoods. Sofa padding is made from foam, down, feathers, fabric or a combination thereof. Sofa coverings are usually made out of soft leather, corduroy or linen fabric coverings. Some outdoor sofas are made from specialist <b>reticulated</b> <b>foam.</b> Due to its highly advanced open cellular structure, water freely passes through it making it highly resistant to soaking.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{have been made in}} a wind tunnel to investigate the ventilation of snow by shear. We argue that the zero-plane displacement {{can be used as a}} convenient indicator of ventilation, and that this can be obtained from measurements of mean velocity profiles in conditions of zero pressure gradient. Measurements made over a natural snow surface show a zero-plane displacement depth of less than 5 mm, but practical considerations preclude extensive use of snow for these measurements. Instead, the influence of permeability is investigated using <b>reticulated</b> <b>foams</b> in place of snow. We demonstrate that the foam and snow have similar structure and flow-relevant properties. Although the surface of the foam is flat, the roughness lengths increase by two orders of magnitude as the permeability increases from 6 × 10 ? 9 to 160 × 10 ? 9 m 2. The zero-plane displacement for the least permeable foams is effectively zero, but more than 15 mm for the most permeable foams. Our data compare well to the few studies available in the literature. By analogy to conditions over snow surfaces, we suggest that shear-driven ventilation of snow is therefore limited to the upper few millimetres of snow surfaces...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe use {{specific}} surface {{area as a}} metric to assess the performances of photocatalytic media, where {{specific surface}} area is calculated as irradiated catalytic surface developed per unit of photoreactor volume. The photocatalytic media compared were selected to cover {{a wide range of}} specific surface areas from within a panel of various formats proposed in the literature, i. e. powder suspensions (nanometer-scale and micrometer-scale), 2 D media (tissue, glass rods), macroporous media including reticular foams and bulk solids including fiber stacks. The overarching approach, where we define the configurations that deliver the best photocatalytic performances possible, is split into a two-stage phases. Stage 1 aims to correlate the media’s structural properties to its transmittance. Stage 2 aims to study and rank the media in terms of their photocatalytic performances. This two-stage process, based on a panel of media, make it possible to define the configurations of photocatalytic media that make the best use of all available incident light in a given photoreactor geometry, and to adapt the media format to in-use constraints (depth, volume, light flux density).

The deposition of an active catalyst can be conventionally done by coating the ceramic foam support by slurry of catalytic material containing a binder to ensure adhesion of the layer [18, 19, 20]. Most of the ceramic catalyst supports possess very low surface area which is below 1  m 2 /g. The specific surface area of both honeycomb and <b>reticulated</b> <b>foams</b> can be increased up to 40  m 2 /g by washcoating with the catalyst [18]. It was generally observed that the selectivity of coke increases {{with the increase in}} pore size [21]. It has been supported by the previous literature [22] that, among the other zeolites, H-ZSM- 5 shows very slow rate of coking due to its low acid site density and this property dominates over the criterion of its average pore size. Literature related to the work on H-ZSM- 5 proves the application of H-ZSM- 5 as alkylation catalyst which emphasizes towards the para selective products [15, 23]. It has been observed that H-ZSM- 5 possesses better washcoat stability compared to mordenite and ferrite [24].|$|R
