500|$|Her career {{took off}} {{while she was}} writing theatre {{criticism}} for Vanity Fair, which she began to do in 1918 as a stand-in for the vacationing P. G. Wodehouse. At the magazine, she met Robert Benchley, who became a close friend, and Robert E. Sherwood. The trio began lunching at the Algonquin Hotel on a near-daily basis and became founding members of the Algonquin Round Table. The Round Table numbered among its members the newspaper columnists Franklin Pierce Adams and Alexander Woollcott. Through their <b>re-printing</b> of her lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams' column [...] "The Conning Tower", Dorothy began developing a national reputation as a wit. One of her most famous comments was made when the group was informed that famously taciturn former president Calvin Coolidge had died; Parker remarked, [...] "How could they tell?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Porter {{delivered}} {{this address}} on July 4, 1835. He began his address with a philosophical overtone, describing the rational faculties of man. Porter stated {{that man is}} only able to conceive of rational thought from existing rational thought; {{the same holds true}} for perceptions of objects. Porter then expressed his discontent towards the mental ability of man, stating, [...] "...without the aid of divine revelation, how utterly incapable is the mind of man, much we boast of its powers..." [...] Although Porter was skeptical of the mental capability of man, he did acknowledge the intellectual prowess of a select few individuals in the earlier time period of mankind. Moving on to the subject of religion, Porter stated that religion has actually aided learning throughout even the earliest of monastic systems. He stated that the <b>re-printing</b> of the Bible aided in the expansion of intellectual curiosity and ideas, and that the German people benefitted the most from this <b>re-printing</b> of the Bible.|$|E

2500|$|Investigations in the {{aftermath}} of the executions continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The publication of the men's letters, containing eloquent professions of innocence, intensified belief in their wrongful execution. Additional ballistics tests and incriminating statements by the men's acquaintances have clouded the case. On August 23, 1977—the 50th anniversary of the executions—Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation that Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried and convicted and that [...] "any disgrace should be forever removed from their names". Writer Bruce Watson, in his introduction to the 2007 <b>re-printing</b> of The Letters of Sacco and Vanzetti, noted [...] "Sacco and Vanzetti are still on trial and probably always will be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cortina’s {{language}} business proved rather successful. His {{method of}} teaching was awarded corporate prizes; the school – since 1899 named Cortina Academy of Languages - made arrangements with prestigious New York colleges {{and had to}} rent bigger and bigger premises at prestigious downtown locations; other teaching institutions advertised themselves as adhering to his methodology; the publishing house he set up kept <b>re-printing</b> textbooks and manuals in endless editions while audio materials were published jointly with Columbia Records. Correspondence courses of English proved successful in South America and Mexico. Cortina business developed also in Spain, as the owner was granted official governmental recommendation and remained on good terms with education officials. His teaching method enjoyed largely positive reception among academics of that time; also contemporary scholars note that it [...] "marks a great advance in language teaching". The language school he created was later renamed to Cortina Institute of Languages and is operational until today.|$|E
2500|$|He {{resigned}} from the advertising industry in 1964, moved into a modest apartment near the Queens-Midtown Tunnel ("It wasn’t Paris in the 1920s, but I was happy" [...] DeLillo has said of this time), and began work on his first novel. Reflecting on {{the early days of}} his writing career, he remarked: [...] "I lived in a very minimal kind of way. My telephone would be $4.20 every month. I was paying a rent of sixty dollars a month. And I was becoming a writer. So in one sense, I was ignoring the movements of the time." [...] His first novel, Americana, was written over the course of four years and finally published in 1971, to modest critical praise. Americana concerned [...] "a television network programmer who hits the road in search of the big picture". DeLillo revised the novel in 1989 for paperback <b>re-printing.</b> Reflecting on the novel later in his career, he admitted, [...] "I don't think my first novel would have been published today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published." [...] Later still, DeLillo still felt a degree of surprise at Americana being published, noting [...] "I was working on my first novel, Americana, for two years before I ever realized that I could be a writer [...] I had absolutely no assurance that this book would be published because I knew that there were elements that I simply didn't know how to improve at that point. So I wrote for another two years and finished the novel. It wasn’t all that difficult to find a publisher, to my astonishment. I didn't have a representative. I didn’t know anything about publishing. But an editor at Houghton Mifflin read the manuscript and decided that this was worth pursuing." ...|$|E
