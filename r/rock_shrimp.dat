40|$|SummarySignals {{transmit}} {{information to}} receivers about sender attributes, increase the fitness of both parties, and are selected for in cooperative interactions between species to reduce conflict [1, 2]. Marine cleaning interactions {{are known for}} stereotyped behaviors [3 – 6] that likely serve as signals. For example, “dancing” and “tactile dancing” in cleaner fish may serve to advertise cleaning services to client fish [7] and manipulate client behavior [8], respectively. Cleaner shrimp clean fish [9], yet are cryptic in comparison to cleaner fish. Signals, therefore, are likely essential for cleaner shrimp to attract clients. Here, we show that the yellow-beaked cleaner shrimp [10] Urocaridella sp. c [11] uses a stereotypical side-to-side movement, or “rocking dance,” while approaching potential client fish in the water column. This dance {{was followed by a}} cleaning interaction with the client 100 % of the time. Hungry cleaner shrimp, which are more willing to clean than satiated ones [12], spent more time rocking and in closer proximity to clients Cephalopholis cyanostigma than satiated ones, and when given a choice, clients preferred hungry, <b>rocking</b> <b>shrimp.</b> The <b>rocking</b> dance therefore influenced client behavior and, thus, appears to function as a signal to advertise the presence of cleaner shrimp to potential clients...|$|R

Both units were significantly affected by a Permian igneous event, leading to underplating of the Mafic Complex in the deep-crustal IVZ and intrusion of granitic bodies in the upper-crustal SdL, which is in turn capped by volcanic, predominantly rhyolitic <b>rocks.</b> <b>SHRIMP</b> U-Pb zircon ages of volcanic rocks (288 ± 2 to 282 ± 3 Ma), formation of granitic plutons in the SdL (289 ± 3 to 275 ± 5 Ma), and gabbro in the IVZ (289 ± 3 to 286 ± 6 Ma) indicate that the onset of bimodal volcanism and granitic plutonism was coincident with and probably triggered by intrusion of mantle-derived mafic melt in the deep crust, and that volcanic activity and presence of granitic melt at depth persisted after underplating had ceased.

40|$|The {{rocks of}} Sierra de Maz and Sierra del Espinal (Western Sierras Pampeanas) {{represent}} pre-Famatinian (Ordovician) basement. Isotope compositions (Nd and Pb) of metasedimentary <b>rocks</b> and <b>SHRIMP</b> U–Pb dating of detrital zircons, {{combined with other}} geological evidence, show that three parallel N–S domains can be recognized. The central Maz Domain contains pre-Grenvillian metasedimentary rocks deposited between 1. 2 and 1. 6 Ga, that underwent Grenvillian granulite facies metamorphism and were intruded by mafic igneous rocks and massif-type anorthosites. Metasedimentary rocks have high Nd TDM ages (1. 7 – 2. 7 Ga) and very radiogenic Pb (␣= 9. 8 – 10. 2), suggesting provenance from reworked early Proterozoic or Archean continental crust. The domains {{to the east and}} west of the Maz Domain consist of three metasedimentary sequences with Nd TDM ages between 1. 2 and 1. 6 Ga and variably radiogenic Pb (␣= 9. 6 – 10. 0). U–Pb SHRIMP dating of detrital zircons, Nd TDM model ages and comparison with other data suggest that these sequences are post-Grenvillian, i. e., Neoproterozoic and/or early Paleozoic. The Maz Domain is interpreted as a suspect terrane similar to the northern Arequipa–Antofalla craton that forms the basement of the Central Andes; both underwent Grenville-age orogeny and were probably once continuous along the western margin of Amazonia (West Gondwana). © 2007 International Association for Gondwana Research.

40|$|The Paleo-Mesoproterozoic Xiong'er {{volcanic}} rocks {{along the}} southern margin of the North China Craton are lithologically and geochemically similar to those formed in subduction-related, continental margin volcanic arcs. The volcanic rocks are primarily composed of basaltic andesites and andesites, with minor dacites and dacitic rhyolites. Traditionally, the Xiong'er volcanic rocks have been divided from lower to upper into the Xushan, Jidanping and Majiahe Formations, but the ages of volcanic rocks in these formations have not been well constrained, which has hindered further understanding the tectonic significance of the Xiong'er volcanic belt at the southern margin of the North China Craton. SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon analyses, combined with cathodeluminescence (CL) images, have enabled resolution of xenocrystic and magmatic zircons that can be directed toward determination of {{the ages of the}} Xiong'er volcanic <b>rocks.</b> <b>SHRIMP</b> and LA-ICP-MS U-Pb analyses on magmatic zircons from two basaltic andesite samples, one dacite sample and one rhyolite sample of the Xushan Formation, known as the lowest sequence of the Xiong'er volcanic rocks, indicate that the volcanic eruption of this Formation occurred at ∼ 1. 78 Ga, but most xenocrystic/inherited zircons in these samples yielded 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ages ranging from 2. 55 Ga to 1. 91 Ga. Of three samples collected from the Jidanping Formation, two rhyolite samples (05 XE 015 and 05 XE 100) yielded weighted mean 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ages of 1778 ± 5. 5 Ma and 1751 ± 14 Ma, respectively, similar to the ages of the volcanic rocks in the Xushan Formation, whereas one dacite sample (05 XE 066) gave a weighted mean 207 Pb/ 206 Pb age of 1450 ± 31 Ma, which is the youngest age obtained from the Xiong'er volcanic rocks. One andesite sample (06 XS 012) collected from the Majiahe Formation yielded two major age populations, with the older one at 1850 ± 5. 9 Ma, interpreted as the age of the xenocrystic/inherited zircons, and the younger one at 1778 ± 6. 1 Ma, interpreted as the age of the volcanic eruption to form the Majiahe andesite, coeval with the formation of most volcanic rocks from the Xushan and Jidanping Formations. These new SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon data indicate that the traditional stratigraphic subdivision of the lower, middle and upper sequences of the Xiong'er volcanic rocks is not viable and that most of the Xiong'er volcanic rocks formed at 1. 78 - 1. 75 Ga, with minor felsic volcanic rocks erupting at ∼ 1. 45 Ga. Similar-aged arc-related volcanic belts have also been found in the southern margin of North America, Greenland and Baltica, the western margin of the Amazonia Craton, the southern and eastern margins of the North Australia Craton, and the eastern margin of the Gawler Craton, which are considered to represent long-lived (1. 8 - 1. 3 Ga), subduction-related growth via accretion at key continental margins of the Paleo-Mesoproterzoic Columbia (Nuna) supercontinent. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{have studied}} zircon xenocrysts from Mesozoic kimberlites from the Kuoika and Ary–Mastakh fields in Northern Yakutia. Zircon xenocrysts {{are assumed to}} {{originate}} from crustal <b>rocks.</b> Our <b>SHRIMP</b> (Sensitive High mass Resolution Ion MicroProbe) analyses yielded predominantly concordant U–Th–Pb ages (up to ~ 3570 Ma; Paleoarchean) that clearly predate kimberlite formation. The general U–Th–Pb concordance observed excludes notable disturbance of the zircon xenocrysts U–Th–Pb isotope system during kimberlite ascent and emplacement. In addition, zircon xenocrysts {{were found to be}} significantly more radiation-damaged than would correspond to damage accumulation only since the time of kimberlite formation. This observation first indicates that zircon crystals were sampled by the kimberlite magma at comparably shallow depths not exceeding 10 – 12 km. If, in contrast, zircon crystals originated from deeper levels of the Earth's crust, they would have been exposed to temperatures of 250 – 300 °C or more. This in turn would have caused long-term thermal annealing of the radiation damage, which was however not observed in our study. Second, our observation contradicts the hypothesis that high temperatures experienced by zircon xenocrysts during kimberlite ascent will cause notable structural reconstitution by short-term thermal annealing. Consequently, zircon crystals cannot have spent more than a few hours at temperatures exceeding ca. 700 – 800 °C, or {{more than a few days}} at temperatures exceeding ca. 500 – 600 °C. This in turn suggests that (i) temperatures of the ascending kimberlite magmas were rather moderate, and (ii) kimberlite ascent is a comparably short process followed by rapid cooling...|$|R
40|$|The Fuping Complex is {{situated}} in {{the central part of}} the North China Craton and consists of four major lithological assemblages: Fuping tonalitic-trondhjemitic-granodioritic gneisses, Longquanguan augen gneisses, Wanzi supracrustal assemblage and Nanying granitic gneisses. SHRIMP U-Pb geochronology combined with U-Th and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging of zircon enables resolution of magmatic and metamorphic events that can be directed towards understanding the late Archean to Paleoproterozoic history of the Fuping Complex. CL images reveal the coexistence of magmatic and metamorphic zircons in nearly all rock types of the Fuping Complex. The metamorphic zircons occur as either single grains or overgrowth (or recrystallization) rims surrounding and truncating oscillatory-zoned magmatic zircon cores, and are all characterized by nebulous zoning or being structureless, with extremely high luminescence and very low Th contents. These features make them distinct from magmatic zircons that are characterized by concentric oscillatory zoning, comparatively low luminescence and high Th and U contents. SHRIMP U-Pb analyses on magmatic zircons reveal that the tonalitic, trondhjemitic and granodioritic plutons of the Fuping gneisses were emplaced at 2523 ± 14 Ma, 2499 ± 10 Ma and 2486 ± 8 Ma, respectively; whereas the monzogranitic and granitic plutons of the Longquanguan augen gneisses were intruded, respectively, at 2510 ± 22 Ma and 2507 ± 11 Ma. Prismatic and oscillatory-zoned zircons dominate in the pelitic rocks of the Wanzi supracrustal assemblage and are interpreted as detritus from igneous source rocks. The concordant and discordant U-Pb ages of 2502 ± 5 Ma and 2507 ± 14 Ma obtained from two pelitic rock samples indicate these rocks must have been deposited no earlier than ∼ 2507 Ma ago. In addition, a zoned zircon grain in one pelitic rock sample has a near concordant age of 2109 ± 5 (1 σ) Ma, which may provide a maximum depositional age for the Wanzi supracrustal <b>rocks.</b> <b>SHRIMP</b> results also reveal that granitic magmatism assigned to the Nanying granitic gneisses occured over a protected interval from ∼ 2077 ± 13 Ma to ∼ 2024 ± 21 Ma. The nebulously-zoned zircon grains and overgrowth/recrystallization zircon rims from different rocks yielded similar concordant 207 Pb/ 206 Pb ages in the range 1875 to 1802 Ma, interpreted as approximating the age of regional metamorphism of the Fuping Complex. Timing of primary zircon crystallization and regional metamorphism of the Fuping Complex is in general agreement with recent U-Pb zircon ion probe results for the Wutai and Hengshan Complexes that bound the Fuping Complex to the northwest. These areas are characterized by the emplacement of major granitoid bodies at around 2. 50 Ga to 2. 48 Ga ago, deposition of supracrustal rocks in the Paleoproterozoic, intrusion of Paleoproterozoic granitic bodies at 2. 1 to 2. 0 Ga, and regional metamorphism at 1. 875 to 1. 802 Ga. These data indicate that the Fuping and Hengshan Complexes do not represent an older crystalline basement to the Wutai Complex, as suggested in previous tectonic models but, together with the Wutai Complex, represent elements of a single late Archean to Paleoproterozoic magmatic arc system that has been subsequently tectonically disrupted and juxtaposed during the collision of the eastern and western North China blocks at ∼ 1. 85 Ga, which resulted in the final assembly of the North China Craton. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

We sampled the nets after 4  months (January-May 2007) and recovered 35 - 50 % of the shrimp from the different treatments. The nets with 10 initial shrimp had a lower cover of the bryozoan B. neritina and lower densities of the ascidians C. intestinalis and Pyura chilensis, {{which resulted in a}} 50 % decrease in biomass of fouling on nets. Low scallop mortality and slightly higher (yet not significant) growth in treatments with high shrimp densities suggest a positive interaction between the shrimp and scallops.

The Yingpanliangzi granitic pluton within the city of Panzhihua intrudes Sinian (~ 600 Ma) marbles and is unlike the mantle-derived or hybrid granitic <b>rocks.</b> The <b>SHRIMP</b> zircon U-Pb ages of the Yingpanliangzi pluton range from 259 ± 8 Ma to 882 ± 22 Ma. Younger ages are found on the zircon rims whereas older ages are found within the cores. Field relationships and petrography indicate that the Yingpanliangzi pluton must be < 600 Ma, therefore the older zircons are interpreted to represent the protolith age whereas the younger analyses represent zircon re-crystallization during emplacement. The Yingpanliangzi granites are metaluminous and have negative Ta-Nb PM anomalies, low εNd (260 Ma) values (- 3. 9 to - 4. 4), and high I Sr (0. 71074 to 0. 71507) consistent with a crustal origin. The recognition of a crustally-derived pluton along with mantle-derived and mantle-crust hybrid plutons within the Panxi {{region of the}} ELIP is evidence for a complete spectrum of sources.

40|$|The Gubaoquan {{eclogite}} {{occurs in}} the Paleozoic Beishan Orogen of NW China.

Contrary to this, we demonstrate that the Gubaoquan eclogite protolith was a Neoproterozoic basic dyke/sill which intruded into Proterozoic continental <b>rocks.</b> The <b>SHRIMP</b> U–Pb zircon dating of the metamorphic rims of the Gubaoquan eclogite yields an age 466 ± 27 Ma. Subdued {{heavy rare earth element}} abundances and lack of negative Eu anomalies of the metamorphic zircon domains confirm that this age represents eclogite facies metamorphism. The host augen orthogneiss has a U–Pb zircon age of 920 ± 14 Ma, representing the timing of crystallization of the granitic protolith. A leucogranitic vein which intrudes the eclogite has a U–Pb zircon age of 424 ± 8. 6 Ma. This granitic vein marks the end of high-grade metamorphism in this area. The overcomplication of tectonic history of the Beishan Orogen is partially caused by inconsistent classifications and nomenclature of the same rock units and arbitrary subdivisions of Precambrian blocks as individual microcontinents. In an attempt to resolve this, we propose a simpler model that involves the partial subduction of the northern passive margin of the Dunhuang Block beneath the active continental margin developing on the Mazongshan-Hanshan Block to the north. Ocean closure and continental collision during the Late Ordovician resulted in continental thickening and eclogite facies metamorphism recorded by the mafic dykes/sills (now the Gubaoquan eclogite).

40|$|Natural {{products}} play {{an invaluable}} {{role as a}} starting point in the drug discovery process, and plants and animals use many interesting biologically active natural products as a chemical defense mechanism against predators. Among marine organisms, many nudibranch gastropods are known to derive defensive metabolites from the sponges they eat. Here we investigated the putative sequestration of the toxic compound latrunculin A [...] a 16 -membered macrolide that prevents actin polymerization within cellular processes [...] which has been identified from sponge sources, by five closely related nudibranch molluscs of the genus Chromodoris. Only latrunculin A was present in the rim of the mantle of these species, where storage reservoirs containing secondary metabolites are located, whilst a variety of secondary metabolites were found in their viscera. The species studied thus selectively accumulate latrunculin A in the part of the mantle that is more exposed to potential predators. This study also demonstrates that latrunculin-containing sponges are not their sole food source. Latrunculin A was found to be several times more potent than other compounds present in these species of nudibranchs when tested by in vitro and in vivo toxicity assays. Anti-feedant assays also indicated that latrunculin A was unpalatable to <b>rock</b> pool <b>shrimps,</b> in a dose-dependent manner. These findings led us to propose that this group of nudibranchs has evolved means both to protect themselves from the toxicity of latrunculin A, and to accumulate this compound in the mantle rim for defensive purposes. The precise mechanism by which the nudibranchs sequester such a potent compound from sponges without disrupting their own key physiological processes is unclear, but this work paves the way for future studies in this direction. Finally, the possible occurrence of both visual and chemosensory Müllerian mimicry in the studied species is discussed...|$|R
