5|$|Chrono Cross employs story arcs, characters, {{and themes}} from , a Satellaview side story to Chrono Trigger {{released}} in Japan. An illustrated text adventure, <b>Radical</b> Dreamers {{was created to}} wrap up an unresolved plot line of Chrono Trigger. Though it borrows from <b>Radical</b> Dreamers in its exposition, Chrono Cross is not a remake of <b>Radical</b> Dreamers, but a larger effort to fulfill that game's purpose; the plots of the games are irreconcilable. To resolve continuity issues and acknowledge <b>Radical</b> Dreamers, the developers of Chrono Cross suggested the game happened in a parallel dimension. A notable {{difference between the two}} games is that Magus—present in <b>Radical</b> Dreamers as Gil—is absent from Chrono Cross. Director Masato Kato originally planned for Magus to appear in disguise as Guile, but scrapped the idea due to plot difficulties. In the DS version of Chrono Trigger, Kato teases the possibility of an amnesiac Magus.|$|E

5|$|In general, any three {{distinct}} circles {{have a unique}} circle—the <b>radical</b> circle—that intersects all of them perpendicularly; {{the center of that}} circle is the <b>radical</b> center of the three circles.

Under the same inversion, the corresponding points of tangency of the two solution circles are transformed into one another; for illustration, in Figure6, the two blue points lying on each green line are transformed into one another. Hence, the lines connecting these conjugate tangent points are invariant under the inversion; therefore, they must pass through the center of inversion, which is the <b>radical</b> center (green lines intersecting at the orange dot in Figure 6).|$|E

40|$|AbstractPeroxyl <b>radicals,</b> as {{model for}} peroxyl <b>radicals</b> formed during {{autoxidation}} of lipids, have been generated in three solvent systems (cyclohexane, tetrahydrofuran and tert-butanol/water) by steady-state and laser flash photolysis, and their reaction with β-carotene studied. Steady-state photolysis experiments showed that alkyl, alkoxyl and alkylperoxyl <b>radicals</b> all react with β-carotene. However, laser flash photolysis experiments {{indicated that the}} reaction with peroxyl <b>radicals</b> (second-order rate constant estimated {{to be less than}} 106 M− 1 s− 1) is slower than with alkyl and alkoxyl <b>radicals,</b> and that β-carotene is hence a poor direct scavenger of peroxyl <b>radicals.</b> Scavenging of peroxyl <b>radicals</b> by β-carotene is suggested not to proceed via electron transfer but rather by adduct formation and/or hydrogen abstraction. For different phenoxyl <b>radicals,</b> differences in reactivity towards β-carotene seem to be correlated with standard reduction potential...|$|R
40|$|Free <b>radicals</b> attack proteins, lipids, enzymes and DNA causing {{pathological}} {{changes in}} organism.

When <b>radicals</b> are dissolved in water suspensions of erythrocytes and low density lipoproteins (LDL), ascorbic acid catches and eliminates free <b>radicals</b> before they arrive to the membrane and LDL molecules. Even though ascorbic acid is not capable of eliminating free <b>radicals</b> out of fluid medium, it acts as synergist to alpha-tocopherol in lipid section, contributes to the lessening of lipid tocoperoxil <b>radicals,</b> and above all, regenerates alpha-tocopherol. Ascorbic acid may act as pro-oxidant under in vitro conditions in the presence of metals; however, this effect is probably not important under in vivo conditions where metal ions, being sequestered, become second reducers...|$|R
