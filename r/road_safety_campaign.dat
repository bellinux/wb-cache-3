After {{performing}} a solo music recital in February 1990, he renewed his contract with Divertis, and toured the country with them. Later that year, Divertis performed {{for the first time}} in a series of comedy shows airing on Romanian Television channels. The group worked with filmmaker and Traffic Police officer Virgil Vochină, adding comedy bits to his serialized <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>campaign,</b> Reflecţii rutiere ("Roadside Reflections").

In 2008, Schumacher was the figurehead of an advertising campaign by Bacardi to raise awareness about responsible drinking, with a focus on communicating an international message 'drinking and driving don't mix'. He featured in an advertising campaign for television, cinema and online media, supported by consumer engagements, public relations and digital media across the World.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, NETS has {{delivered}} its signature <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>campaign,</b> Drive Safely Work Week (DSWW), through member companies and state partners. DSWW typically has an overarching theme, with specific topics or learning points delivered each {{day during the}} course of a week in October. As technology has evolved, the mode of delivery for DSWW materials has shifted from printed materials to electronic materials that may be downloaded from the Internet. Over the years, prevention of distracted driving has been a common theme for DSWW. In 2010 and 2011, NETS worked in partnership with the U.S. DOT to offer DSWW campaign materials on distracted driving free of charge, an arrangement that resulted in over 6,000 organizations downloading materials during 2010. One of NETS’s member services is the “Safety in Numbers” fleet safety benchmarking program, which provides international benchmarking services, with both qualitative and quantitative data from large companies representing various industry sectors. As a group, NETS member companies participating in the benchmarking program operate nearly half a million vehicles worldwide, with more than nine billion miles driven annually (Network of Employers for Traffic Safety, unpublished data).|$|E

40|$|Risk taking {{behaviour}} {{is synonymous}} with adolescence. Moreover, epidemiological statistics associated with early driver deaths in Australia paint a disturbing picture. There is considerable debate {{about the effectiveness of}} advertising and marketing as a prophylactic to unsafe driving behaviours. This paper discusses the search for innovative approaches to <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>campaigns</b> by accessing the perceptions of the novice driver group. A case scenario was developed by reviewing current literature on adolescent health behaviour, risk awareness, <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> and marketing communication. Findings from an ongoing study with members of the early driving group, imply that they, as members of the target audience for <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>campaigns,</b> do provide a fresh perspective on tone, content and style for campaign design...|$|R

In an experimental study, the researchers investigated {{the effectiveness of this}} message on risky driving attitude and also explored the effect of an alternative strategy, fear of prosecution. Findings from this study suggest that fear appeals, fear of prosecution and combination of these two strategies do not have an effect on risky driving attitudes. These findings are used to make conclusions about the design of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>campaigns</b> incorporating such scare tactics...|$|R

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>safety</b> {{communication}} <b>campaigns</b> {{are considered}} as an efficient strategy {{to approach the}} wide audience and influence road users towards a safe behavior, with main aim {{to lead to the}} reduction of the number and the severity of road accidents. When designing the implementation of a campaign, it is important to plan at the same time its evaluation, so that to enable the assessment of its effectiveness. For the achievement of high reliability and the development of "clear" conclusions, the campaign evaluation should be carefully organized, following a feasible scientific design. Towards this direction, three <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>campaigns,</b> two local campaigns addressing drink driving and seat belt usage, and one national campaign addressing driving fatigue, were implemented and evaluated. Presenting the design components of the three campaigns and the evaluation results, this paper aims at revealing the similarities and differences of the effectiveness of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> communication <b>campaigns</b> on driving behavior...|$|R
40|$|Mass media campaigns {{can play}} an {{important}} role in promoting <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> issues to a large proportion of the population. In order to understand what elements make a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> mass media <b>campaign</b> effective and how we might enhance future campaigns, a review of the literature published during the last decade was conducted. Any general principles concerning effective mass media campaign design and development were identified within the literature. Following this, recent evaluations of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> mass media <b>campaigns</b> were examined to determine whether campaigns were adopting these best practice principles and the quality of these evaluations was reviewed. A number of broad principles that can enhance the effectiveness of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> mass media <b>campaigns</b> were identified. While campaign designers appear to be increasingly adhering to these principles, there is still much room for improvement. Closer examination of the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>campaigns</b> revealed that few were subject to thorough scientific evaluation. It is suggested that evaluations may need to be based on 'before and after' comparison of behaviours or variables that can be objectively observed and are closely linked to safety.
