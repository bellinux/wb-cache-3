40|$|Abstract Autologous {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (ASCT) to treat autoimmune diseases (AID) {{is thought to}} reset immunological memory directed against autoantigens. This hypothesis can only be studied indirectly because {{the exact nature of}} the pathogenetic autoantigens is unknown in most AID. Therefore, 19 children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE) and 10 adults with multiple sclerosis (MS) were vaccinated with the T-cell-dependent neoantigen rabies and the <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> tetanus toxoid after, respectively before, bone marrow harvest. Both vaccinations were repeated after ASCT. All except two of the responders mounted a primary antibody response to rabies after revaccination, and 44 % of the responders mounted a primary antibody response to tetanus boost after ASCT. These data show that immunological memory to a neoantigen is lost in most patients with AID after immunoablative pretreatment; however, memory to a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> boosted before bone marrow harvest i...|$|E
40|$|Lymphocyte {{multiplication}} can {{be induced}} in vitro by mitogens or specific antigens, {{and is usually}} measured using isotopic methods involving tritiated thymidine. Cellular proliferation can also be analyzed by flow cytometry techniques based on cell cycle analysis through the measurement of DNA content. We applied this method to lymphocytes from 113 individuals, to evaluate lymphocyte proliferation after stimulation in vitro by a mitogen (phytohaemagglutinin, PHA) or a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> (tetanus toxoid), using a kinetic approach with four points sequential measurements of the S and G 2 phases over six days of culture. The proportion of cells in S phase after PHA stimulation {{was significantly higher than}} in controls overall and as early as on day three of the culture. Activation with a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> significantly induced increasing S phase cell proportions up to day six. These data suggest that flow cytometric assessment of the S phase could be a useful alternative to isotopic methods measuring lymphocyte reactivity in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Using {{limiting}} dilution analysis, {{we investigated}} proliferative responses of UCHL 1 + and UCHL 1 - T cell populations {{to compare the}} precursor cell frequencies following recall and alloantigen stimulation, and the complexity of cellular interactions within UCHL 1 + and UCHL 1 - populations. We find high frequencies of <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> responses among UCHL 1 +, but not UCHL 1 - T cells. In contrast, both populations contain similar frequencies of alloantigen responsive cells. Our {{results are consistent with}} single-hit kinetics in recall as well as alloantigen responses and show no complex cellular interactions within the responding populations. In conclusion, the difference between the <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> response of UCHL 1 + and UCHL 1 - cells observed in conventional proliferation assays is most probably due to a high frequency of recall antigen-responsive UCHL 1 + cells and not to suppressive phenomena in the UCHL 1 - population. These data suggest that memory T cells are largely of the UCHL 1 + phenotype. The relation of post-thymic T cell maturation and differential CD 45 expression is briefly discussed...|$|E

40|$|Maternal {{tolerance}} of the fetal hemiallograft suggests that immunomodulation occurs during gestation. Therefore, recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) {{may represent a}} failure of the immune changes that maintain pregnancy. We hypothesized that fertile women but not women with RSA may lose their immune responses to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> when pregnant. This phenomenon has been seen in immunosuppressed transplant recipients and is associated with graft survival. Therefore, we evaluated proliferative responses to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> in four groups of women: group 1, nonpregnant fertile women with no history of pregnancy loss and at least one prior healthy pregnancy, n = 13; group 2, nonpregnant women with a history of three or more spontaneous abortions, n = 28; group 3, healthy pregnant women between 6 and 9 wk of gestation without a history of prior pregnancy loss, n = 15; and group 4, pregnant women between 6 and 9 wk of gestation, with a history of RSA, n = 22. Proliferative responses of peripheral blood leukocytes to the <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> influenza and tetanus, alloantigens, and phytohemagglutinin were determined prospectively. Positive responses (stimulation index > 3) to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> (a response to either influenza or tetanus was considered positive) were as follows: group 1 (nonpregnant fertile women), 11 / 13 (85 %); group 2 (nonpregnant RSA women), 24 / 28 (86 %); group 3 (pregnant fertile women), 4 / 15 (27 %) (P </= 0. 007); and group 4 (pregnant RSA women), 13 / 22 (59 %) (P = 0. 032) [corrected]. In group 4, there was 100 % fetal survival in the nine women who lost responsiveness to recall antigens; however, in the 13 / 22 patients who responded to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> 9 / 13 (69 %) had a repeat spontaneous abortion. These findings suggest that immunosuppression, indirectly measured by proliferation to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> is necessary for early pregnancy maintenance. Furthermore, this approach may be useful for predicting pregnancy outcome for women with RSA and may provide a useful means for designing and monitoring therapies...|$|R

40|$|Helminthic parasites cause widespread, {{persistent}} {{infections in}} humans. The immigration of Ethiopians to Israel (a group denoted here by “Eth. ”), {{many of them}} infested with helminths and in a chronic immune-activation state, enabled us to investigate the effects of such immune activation on immune responses. We studied the immune profile and immune functions of 190 Eth. and Israeli non-Eth. (Isr.) highly, partially, or non–immune-activated individuals. Immune cells from highly immune-activated individuals were defective in several signaling responses, {{all of which were}} restored gradually following anti-helminthic treatment. These cells showed poor transmembrane signaling, as seen by the phosphorylation of various tyrosine kinases and of the MAPK kinases, ERK 1 / 2 and p 38; deficient degradation of phosphorylated IκBα; increased expression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA- 4), which appears to block proliferative responses in these cells; decreased β-chemokine secretion by CD 8 + cells after stimulation; and reduced proliferation to <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> stimulation. Highly immune-activated individuals also showed decreased delayed-type skin hypersensitivity responses to <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> before deworming. These findings support the notion that chronic helminthic infections cause persistent immune activation that results in hyporesponsiveness and anergy. Such impaired immune functions may diminish the capacity of these individuals to cope with infections and to generate cellular protective immunity after vaccination...|$|E
40|$|CVID is {{a primary}} {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome comprising a heterogeneous group of patients with hypogammaglobulinaemia and defective formation of specific antibodies. Previous studies demonstrated defective T cell responsiveness to antigen in a major subgroup of patients. In the present study we investigated the capacity of peripheral blood monocytes and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) -transformed B cell lines from seven patients with CVID, including two patients expressing an extended MHC haplotype described {{to be associated with}} CVID, to present antigen (Tet. Tox.) to CD 4 + antigen-specific T cell lines from healthy controls. The results presented show an unimpaired capacity of peripheral blood monocytes to present antigen in all patients studied. In addition, the present study demonstrates {{for the first time that}} CVID B cells function normally as antigen-presenting cells (APC). These findings indicate that expression of a certain MHC phenotype in CVID is not associated with a defect in the presentation of <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> by monocytes and B cells. Based on these studies, uptake, processing and re-expression of <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> in association with MHC class II molecules on the APC surface are functional and there is no indication for structural abnormalities of the MHC class II molecules expressed by the patients studied that could be essential for their function in antigen binding and presentation...|$|E
40|$|Several {{monoclonal}} antibodies (mAbs) demonstrate further {{heterogeneity of}} CD 4 and CD 8. Within CD 4, two major subsets {{can be identified}} with helper/inducer and suppressor/inducer functions. It is argued that suppressor/inducers, identified by CD 45 R mAbs, are immature or virgin T cells and therefore respond poorly to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> Helper/inducers are CD 45 R negative but express the UCHL 1 antigen, {{which appears to be}} part of CD 45. These cells respond well to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> and are therefore mature or memory T cells. Several antigens not related to CD 45, such as 4 B 4, Leu 8, TQ 1 and 9. 3, identify functionally distinct subsets rather than stages of T cell maturation...|$|R
40|$|Although all T {{lymphocytes}} express antigen-specific receptors, {{there is}} increasing evidence that a population of blood T cells are "naive " in that they respond poorly to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> while other blood T lymphocytes are "memory " cells in that they proliferate readily in response to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> function efficiently as immune effector cells, and express surface molecules involved in antigen presentation and adhesion to endothelial cells and extracellular matrix components (1 - 5). The populations of "naive " and "memory " T cells are defined by {{the expression of the}} family of CD 45 leukocyte common antigens coded by a single 130 kb, 33 exon gene (6).

40|$|The {{properties}} of human CD 45 RA and CD 45 R 0 T cells are described. CD 45 R 0 cells respond to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> and provide help for B lymphocytes.

The phenotype of CD 45 R 0 cells suggests that they may be in cycle and in vivo data shows that they have a short lifespan while CD 45 RA cells are long lived. The lineage relationship of the two subsets is not clear but in vivo and in vitro evidence suggests bidirectional conversion between CD 45 RA and CD 45 R 0 phenotypes...|$|R
40|$|Torque Teno virus (TTV) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be present persistently {{in the blood of}} healthy individuals without evidence that it causes any disease process. The levels of TTV vary in patients co-infected with other viruses and there has been considerable speculation as to whether TTV contributes to pathogenesis by other viruses or if the varying levels might be related to immune activation in the host. In the present study, the load of TTV was examined in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following immunization of subjects with either influenza (a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen)</b> or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (a new antigenic exposure). The results overall did not indicate a significant change in TTV titers over a 90 day observation period; however, when TTV genogroup was taken into consideration there was an increase in viral load in plasma at some time points for subjects persistently infected with genogroup 3. While this was observed in both influenza and HBV immunized subjects, the effect was more profound in HBV vaccination. Thus, it appears that exposure to a new antigen rather than a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> may stimulate TTV replication more effectively. The data further suggest that investigating the interactions between TTV and its host might require to examine specifically each TTV genogroup separately in order to determine if certain TTV types have any role in disease pathogenesis.

40|$|Dendritic cells (DCs) are {{considered}} to be promising adjuvants for inducing immunity to cancer. We used mature, monocyte-derived DCs to elicit resistance to malignant melanoma. The DCs were pulsed with Mage- 3 A 1 tumor peptide and a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen,</b> tetanus toxoid or tuberculin. 11 far advanced stage IV melanoma patients, who were progressive despite standard chemotherapy, received five DC vaccinations at 14 -d intervals. The first three vaccinations were administered into the skin, 3 � 106 DCs each subcutaneously and intradermally, followed by two intravenous injections of 6 � 106 and 12 � 106 DCs, respectively. Only minor (less than or equal to grade II) side effects were observed. Immunity to the <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> was boosted. Significant expansions of Mage- 3 A 1 –specific CD 8 � cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors were induced in 8 / 11 patients. Curiously, these immune responses often declined after the intravenous vaccinations. Regressions of individual metastases (skin, lymph node, lung, and liver) were evident in 6 / 11 patients. Resolution of skin metastases in two of the patients was accompanied by erythema and CD 8 � T cell infiltration, whereas nonregressing lesions lacked CD 8 � T cells as well as Mage- 3 mRNA expression. This study proves the principle that DC “vaccines” can frequently expand tumor-specific CTLs and elicit regressions even in advanced cancer and, in addition, provides evidence for an active CD 8 � CTL–tumor cell interaction in sit...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of human T-lymphocyte activation by the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus neoformans {{has not been}} established. Previous investigations have suggested that C. neoformans contains a mitogen for T lymphocytes, while other investigators have attributed lymphocyte proliferation in vitro to a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen.</b> Because of the potential importance of the {{mechanism of}} T-cell activation for {{our understanding of the}} immune response to C. neoformans, the present studies were performed to determine whether C. neoformans contains a mitogen for T lymphocytes. C. neoformans stimulates fetal blood lymphocytes to proliferate and stimulates proliferation of CD 45 RA+ cells from adults, indicating that it stimulates naive T cells. The T-cell response to C. neoformans was dependent upon the presence of accessory cells. However, allogeneic cells were sufficient for accessory cell function, indicating that the response was not major histocompatibility complex restricted. The percentage of T cells in the cell cycle was higher than that with the <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> tetanus toxoid but lower than that with the mitogenic lectin phytohemagglutinin A or the superantigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B. Precursor frequency analysis established that 1 in 7, 750 ± 2, 270 T cells proliferated in response to the cryptococcal cell wall and membrane. Compared to the case for most mitogens or superantigens, the proliferative response is late and the number of T cells that enter the cell cycle and the precursor frequency are low, indicating that the mitogenic effect is modest. However, the mitogenic effect of C. neoformans should be considered when interpreting the immune response to C. neoformans, since even weak mitogens can have profound effects on host defense...|$|E
40|$|T {{lymphocyte}}s, T lymphocyte subpopulations {{and delayed}} hypersensitivity reactions to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> were studied in 20 aged subjects clinically unaffected by disorders {{of the immune}} system. T-cells evaluated by the sheep rosette test and absolute T-cell number were within normal range. T-cell subsets were studied by the high affinity rosetting test and by the sheep rosette test after pre-incubation with theophylline; such methods have been shown by others to discriminate between T-cells with helper or suppressor activity. We did not observe an imbalance of such subpopulations. Skin reactivity to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> (Candida and SK-SD) was depressed in several cases. Since a decline in serum levels of thymic hormones {{has been reported in}} the ageing and it is suggested that this could account for the T-dependent immunity defect, we treated these patients with a bovine thymic extract (thymostimulin, TP- 1) 1 mg/kg/day for three consecutive days. Immunological tests were performed again after this therapy but no modifications were observed. We may conclude that the aged subjects studied in this paper present normal relative and absolute number of T-cells and T subpopulations, whereas the function of T-cells, as assessed by skin reactivity to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> is often depressed. Short term therapy with TP- 1 at the above-mentioned dosage was ineffective in modifying the parameters analysed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractT-cell {{immunity}} {{was investigated}} in eight patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease, to see whether impaired immune function might be the explanation for their infection. Cellular immune function was evaluated in vitro by measuring the proliferation of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} in response to both non-specific mitogens (phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen) and specific <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> (streptokinase-streptodornase and purified protein derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and in vivo, by measuring the skin test response to a panel of <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> Functionally relevant T-lymphocyte sub-populations (CD 4, CD 8, activated CD 3 and γδ T-cells) were enumerated by two-colour flow cytometry. The results were compared with those for a group of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, with groups of controls matched for age and smoking habit, and with a patient group receiving steroid treatment. The patients with non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease had poor or absent skin test responses; in vitro, their response to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> was depressed, although their response to mitogens was normal. The patients had significantly raised levels of CD 8 lymphocytes and activated T-cells, but lacked any circulating γδ T-cells. There were also differences between the various control groups. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a deficiency in the cellular immune system of these patients, which is most readily detectable by skin testing, or by measuring lymphocyte proliferative responses to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> However, the study also shows changes in cellular immune responses in controls matched for age and smoking and in patients on steroid treatment, and underscores the need for matched controls. Further work {{needs to be done to}} ascertain whether the cellular immune deficiency is a cause of, or is caused by, the mycobacterial infections, and also to investigate the pathological significance of the alterations in T-cell sub-populations...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{immunity}} in cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was {{studied in}} eighteen patients with CMV {{infection in the}} acute stage and thereafter. Peripheral blood lymphocyte reactivity (LR) to mitogens, bacterial <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> and CMV was tested sequentially in fourteen out of eighteen patients and once in four patients and sex and age-matched healthy controls. LR to a cocktail of bacterial <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> was impaired (P 250 days) it still remained markedly impaired as opposed to LR of the controls (P< 0 · 01 and P< 0 · 02 respectively). In ten out of eighteen patients twelve superinfections were suspected clinically and two viral and eight bacterial infections documented during the observation period of 1 year after onset of CMV infection. In vitro LR to Con A and PWM appeared grossly disturbed as opposed to PHA-LR which was decreased only slightly in the acute phase. Although a gradual improvement of mitogenic LR was seen after the acute phase, PWM-LR remained decreased during the follow-up period as opposed {{to that of the}} controls (P< 0 · 05). CMV-specific LR to heat-inactivated AD 169 strain virion antigens was generally negative or lowgrade initially but a positive CMV-LR test was obtained in all patients studied sequentially during or after the acute phase. To a certain extent, the appearance of positive CMV-LR was associated with improvement of LR to bacterial <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> and mitogens. In individual cases CMV-LR development apparently preceded the restoration of the generalized immunosuppression as reflected by LR tests with mitogens and bacterial <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> It is concluded that CMV infection of adults causes a (relatively) longlasting cellular immunosuppression. Possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed. A relationship with increased sensitivity to infections of an opportune nature after CMV infection is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the T-cell immune {{response}} following primary antigenic challenge with a neoantigen {{is a critical}} aspect of assessment of the cellular {{immune response}}. While many antigens {{can be used to}} accurately assess in vitro T-cell proliferation to a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen,</b> only a few neoantigens have been tested for their capacities to measure T-cell responses in vitro to a primary immunization. Rabies vaccination is an excellent candidate for the testing of T-cell proliferation responses to a primary immunization because few individuals have been exposed to rabies virus antigens. In the present study 14 rabies vaccine-naïve, healthy adult volunteers were immunized against rabies virus, and T-cell proliferation and antibody responses were measured before and after vaccination. Optimal lymphocyte proliferation to soluble rabies virus antigen occurred after 8 days in culture. The average level of uptake of tritiated thymidine postimmunization was 29, 620 ± 4, 448 cpm, whereas preimmunization levels were 12, 660 ± 3, 448 cpm (P = 0. 002). All individuals showed increases in rabies virus antibody titers from < 0. 05 to 5. 59 ± 1. 64 IU/ml. The degree of proliferation to tetanus toxoid as a <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> was similar to the response to rabies virus antigen among the cohort. Due to high levels of preimmunization proliferation, four subjects failed to demonstrate a twofold increase in response to rabies virus antigen. The high levels of T-cell responses may be due to a viral superantigen effect in some individuals. Rabies vaccination offers a safe and effective means for measurement of both T- and B-cell immune responses to a neoantigen in healthy and immune suppressed individuals...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Alcohol affects both innate and {{acquired}} immune responses. Chronic alcoholics have reduced {{delayed-type hypersensitivity response}} and increased susceptibility to infections. In contrast, recent studies suggest that acute, moderate alcohol consumption has protective effects on mortality. Monocytes and dendritic cells (DC) {{play a central role}} in coordination of innate and adaptive immune responses and are pivotal in activation of T lymphocytes in an antigen-specific manner. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute, moderate alcohol consumption on antigen presenting cell function of blood monocytes and monocyte-derived myeloid dendritic cells. METHODS: Accessory cell function of human blood monocytes was tested before and after acute alcohol intake (2 ml vodka/kg body weight) by measuring T cell activation with alloantigen (mixed lymphocyte reaction, MLR), superantigen (staphylococcal enterotoxin B) and <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> (tetanus toxoid). Myeloid DCs were generated in vitro from monocytes obtained from these individuals using IL- 4 and GM-CSF and their allostimulatory function was tested in an MLR. RESULTS: We found significantly reduced T cell proliferation in the presence of monocytes obtained 2 or 18 hr after alcohol consumption whether alloantigen, superantigen, or <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> was the stimuli (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). The reduced T cell proliferation was due to the effects of acute alcohol on monocytes rather than on T cells as we found decreased proliferation only in the presence of alcohol-exposed accessory cells but not when T cells were exposed to alcohol. In addition, monocyte-derived dendritic cells showed significantly reduced allostimulatory capacity after alcohol consumption (p 3 ̆c 0. 005). CONCLUSION: Acute alcohol consumption inhibits accessory cell function of both monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. Impaired function of these key antigen-presenting cells may contribute to reduced adaptive immune responses and increased susceptibility to infections when acute alcohol intake coincides with exposure to pathogens...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPotential antigens {{inducing}} sarcoid inflammation include mycobacterial and auto-antigens. Paradoxically, peripheral anergy {{to common}} <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> also occurs, possibly due to impaired dendritic cell or regulatory T-cell responses, or impaired T-cell co-stimulation. The {{purpose of this}} study was to compare peripheral blood responses of patients with sarcoidosis to candidate antigens, and examine CD 28 T-cell co-stimulation. MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses were examined from patients with sarcoidosis (n= 16) and healthy control subjects (n= 22) following PBMC stimulation with: anti-CD 3 /CD 28 coated beads; Mycobacterium tuberculosis ESAT- 6 and KatG peptides; vimentin and lysyl tRNA peptides; and common <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> including cytomegalovirus (CMV) cell lysate as well as CMV, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza virus (CEF) peptides. ResultsESAT- 6 /KatG peptide stimulation induced greater numbers of IFN-γ producing T-cells, and elevated IL- 2, IL- 6 and TNF-α production in sarcoidosis compared to purified protein derivative (PPD) -negative healthy control subjects. PBMCs from patients with sarcoidosis showed reduced IFN-γ producing T-cells following stimulation with CMV lysate, CEF peptides and CD 3 /CD 28 beads; and reduced IL- 4 and TNF-α production following CD 3 /CD 28 activation. ConclusionsPatients with sarcoidosis exhibit greater PBMC responses to M. tuberculosis antigens compared to PPD-negative controls, but reduced T-cell responses to common <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> One contributing mechanism may be impairment of T-cell CD 28 co-stimulation...|$|R

In cross-sectional and longitudinal studies involving {{a total of}} 103 pigs, this lymphocyte population was found to increase gradually in proportion with age, comprising < 2 % of the total peripheral blood lymphocyte pool in 1 -week-old swine and reaching 30 - 55 % by 3 years of age. CD 4 /CD 8 DP lymphocytes were able to proliferate in response to stimulation with recall viral antigen. Furthermore, these cells mostly expressed high levels of the surface antigen recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4 B 4 (4 B 4 hi), which is specific for the human beta 1 integrin. The CD 4 + 4 B 4 hi lymphocytes from pseudorabies virus-immune swine, proliferated in response to stimulation with the homologous virus, while CD 4 + 4 B 4 lo lymphocytes did not. Stimulation of CD 4 single-positive (SP) cells with recall viral antigen, but not with mitogen, resulted in the generation of lymphoblasts which were predominantly of CD 4 /CD 8 DP phenotype, suggesting a role for <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> in the generation of this lymphocyte subset. More {{than half of the}} CD 4 + lymphocytes from palatine tonsils of 6 -month-old swine were CD 4 /CD 8 DP, while in the lymph nodes CD 4 /CD 8 DP cells accounted for only one-third or less of CD 4 + cells. In contrast, CD 4 /CD 8 DP lymphocytes were absent from the palatine tonsils of 3 -day-old swine, which only contained CD 4 SP cells. Together, these results indicate that porcine CD 4 /CD 8 DP lymphocytes, exhibit properties of mature antigen-experienced cells, and are inducible by stimulation with <b>recall</b> <b>antigen.</b> These data are consistent with the hypothesis that this population in swine includes memory/effector T cells...|$|E

This B-cell depletion leads neither to a decrease in immunoglobulin levels nor {{an increase in the}} number of infectious complications. However, the effect of rituximab treatment on the immune responsiveness is unknown. In 11 patients with relapsed, low-grade lymphoma, we investigated the effect of rituximab treatment on the humoral immune response to primary <b>antigens</b> and 2 <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> After rituximab treatment, the humoral immune response to the <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> was significantly decreased when compared with the response before treatment. Already before rituximab treatment, none of these patients was able to mount a response to the primary antigens. These findings are relevant regarding the feasibility of rituximab in maintenance treatment and may also offer a rationale for the treatment of antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases with rituxima...|$|R
40|$|The loss of immune {{function}} following infection with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) may result from altered production of immunoregulatory cytokines such as interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and IL- 12. In this study, we analyzed IL- 10 and IL- 12 production by mitogen-stimulated {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) from HIV+ individuals and correlated their levels with proliferative responses to the <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> HIV p 25 and influenza virus. We report two distinct groups of HIV+ patients. One group produced small amounts of IL- 10, had PBMC that proliferated in response to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> and demonstrated enhanced recall antigen-induced proliferation upon addition of anti-IL- 10 antibodies and/or IL- 12. Conversely, the second group produced high levels of IL- 10, had PBMC that failed to proliferate to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> and did not demonstrate enhanced proliferation upon addition of anti-IL- 10 antibodies and/or IL- 12. Mitogen-stimulated PBMC from both groups produced significantly lower levels of IL- 12 than did those from HIV- controls. Analysis of the source of the IL- 10 -producing cell subset in PBMC demonstrated that in HIV+ individuals, IL- 10 is produced by monocytes, while in HIV- controls, it is produced by both T cells and monocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that monocytes from HIV+ individuals secrete decreased amounts of IL- 12, a Th 1 -type cytokine, which may lead to the development of Th 2 -type responses characterized by high IL- 10 secretion and immune dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Immunization of AIDS/ARC {{patients}} with autologous cells expressing HIV antigens, although providing clinical and biological benefits, fails to restore cellular immunity. The latter result is due partly to the antiproliferative effect of HIV- 1 on activated T-cells (immune suppression), {{which leads to}} blockade of specific immune reactions. To overcome immune suppression, a new vaccine strategy was designed consisting of an immunization against HIV- 1 combined with components of the T-cell-suppressive (antiproliferative) network. This new vaccine treatment proved to be innocuous in mice, monkeys, and two non-HIV-infected humans. A Phase I clinical trial was performed in six patients previously under cellular immunotherapy and still presenting a cellular immune defect. Preliminary results confirmed, after a 1 -year follow-up of the patients, {{the safety of the}} new vaccine, which also partially restored the cellular immune response, including anti-HIV HLA-restricted cell-mediated cytotoxicity, delayed hypersensitivity to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens,</b> and proliferation of T-cells specifically activated by <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> © 1992 Raven Press, New York.

40|$|T {{cells from}} HIV- 1 + {{individuals}} have a defect in mounting an antigen specific response. HIV- 1 Tat has been implicated as the causative agent of this immunosuppression. We have previously shown that HIV- 1 Tat inhibits antigen specific proliferation of normal T cells in vitro by binding to the accessory molecule CD 26, a dipeptidase expressed {{on the surface}} of activated T cells. We now demonstrate that the defective in vitro <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> response in HIV- 1 infected individuals can be restored by the addition of soluble CD 26, probably by serving as a decoy receptor for HIV- 1 Tat. The restored response is comparable to that of an HIV- 1 - individual, suggesting that early in HIV infection there is a block in the memory cell response, rather than deletion of these cells...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{immunity}} {{has been}} investigated in patients with various kinds of sero-negative arthritis. The incidence of cutaneous response to <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> streptokinase-streptodornase (SK-SD), {{and the ability to}} mount a primary cutaneous response to dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) have been examined in patients with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. The results were not significantly different from normal. In vitro lymphocyte transformation in the presence of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and pokeweed mitogen (PWM) has been measured using peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and Reiter's disease. In comparison with a control group, significantly reduced responses were found to a low dose of PHA in the ankylosing spondylitis and Reiter disease patients. Significant increase in response occurred to a high dose of PHA, in patients with psoriatic arthritis and Reiter's disease, and to PWM in Reiter's disease patients. The in vitro results in the ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and Reiter's disease patients suggest some abnormality in the T-cell population in sero-negative arthritis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether phagocytosis of necrotic or apoptotic cells affects antigen presentation by murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. After uptake of necrotic neutrophils, macrophages were able to stimulate significantly higher T cell proliferation in vitro against both the <b>recall</b> <b>antigen</b> albumin and the mitogen concanavalin A. No such effect was seen following phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils. Flow cytometry revealed that, within 4 h of ingestion, macrophages that had taken up the necrotic cells expressed higher levels of CD 40 than those that had phagocytosed apoptotic cells. Macrophage cultures pulsed with apoptotic, but not necrotic, neutrophils contained higher levels of transforming growth factor β 1, but lower concentrations of tumour necrosis factor α, compared to untreated controls. Our interpretation of these results is that macrophages that have taken up necrotic neutrophils co-stimulate T cells with greater efficiency due to rapid CD 40 up-regulation, whereas those that have ingested apoptotic cells are not only ineffective in co-stimulation, but also secrete inhibitory cytokine...|$|E
40|$|Chlamydia pneumoniae {{infection}} {{is associated with}} atherosclerosis and the organism has been identified in arterial lesions. To determine whether T lymphocyte-mediated immune responses to Chlamydia antigens within plaque could contribute to pathogenesis, we have derived T cell lines from atherosclerotic plaques of 32 patients. Culture with IL- 2 alone proved insufficient for cellular activation and expansion, but additional stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> allowed consistent establishment of T cell lines. Furthermore, in cultures of approx. 500 tissue fragments, Chlamydia organisms proved as effective as other <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> in producing outgrowth of arterial T cells (20 – 25 % wells produced T cell lines). Testing the antigen responsiveness of T cell lines showed that those derived using Chlamydia organisms {{were more likely to}} respond to Chlamydia (5 / 29 +) than those isolated using other stimuli (6 / 69 + for PHA; 5 / 57 + for PPD and tetanus toxoid (TT)). However, lines responsive to each of the <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> were observed. Using recombinant Chlamydia antigens, some Chlamydia-specific T cell lines were shown to respond to OMP 2 and/or hsp 60. Those recognizing Chlamydia hsp 60 did not cross-react with human hsp 60, but human hsp 60 -responsive lines were also observed. Thus, atherosclerotic plaque tissue contains a variety of memory T lymphocytes, and amongst these are cells capable of recognizing Chlamydia antigens. In a C. pneumoniae-infected plaque, such T cells may be activated by local antigen and could contribute to the inflammatory process in the arterial wall through CD 40 ligand expression and cytokine secretion...|$|R
40|$|Human bronchoalveolar macrophages {{from normal}} {{individuals}} function poorly as accessory cells for {{the presentation of}} common <b>recall</b> <b>antigens.</b> In sarcoidosis, alveolar macrophages (AM) are reported to be effective accessory cells for the presentation of such antigens. In this study normal and sarcoid AM were compared with blood monocytes {{for their ability to}} act as accessory cells in presenting tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) and streptokinase-streptodornase (SKSD) to autologous T lymphocytes, or to form spontaneous, antigen- or mitogen-induced clusters with the T cells. When compared to autologous monocytes, normal AM failed to present the two <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> effectively. Likewise normal AM formed very few clusters with T lymphocytes when compared to monocytes, even in the presence of antigens or the mitogen phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). In contrast, sarcoid AM presented both antigens as effectively, and were equally effective as monocytes in forming clusters with T lymphocytes, spontaneously and in further response to antigen or mitogen. The results suggest that in sarcoidosis enhanced accessory cell function and enhanced cluster formation may be related features of bronchoalveolar macrophage populations...|$|R
40|$|The cell-mediated {{immunity}} {{of patients who}} had basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) removed was studied by measuring cuntaneous delayed hypersensitivity reactions to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> (Multitest CMI, Pasteur-Merieux), and by measuring lymphocyte counts and subsets. One group of patients had multiple BCCs (3 or more) removed and were considered {{to have a high}} risk of new BCC formation. The other group consisted of patients who had one BCC and had not developed another within 5 years; these were considered to have a low risk of new BCC formation. The low-risk patients had significantly larger cutaneous reactions to <b>recall</b> <b>antigens</b> (p < 0. 05) and significantly fewer were anergic (p < 0. 01). There was a correlation between smaller cutaneous reactions and increasing numbers of BCCs (p < 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups in lymphocyte counts or subsets, but the low-risk patients had a significantly higher CD 4 :CD 8 ratio (p < 0. 05) than the high-risk group. The Multitest CMI test can be used to determine which patients are at risk of developing many BCCs...|$|R
