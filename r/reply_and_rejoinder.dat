60|$|The {{first thing}} I came upon {{consisted}} of piles and heaps of Battersea tram tickets. There {{were enough to}} equip a paper chase. They shook down in showers like confetti. Primarily, of course, they touched my patriotic emotions, and brought tears to my eyes; also they provided me with the printed matter I required, for I found {{on the back of}} them some short but striking little scientific essays about some kind of pill. Comparatively speaking, in my then destitution, those tickets might be regarded as a small but well-chosen scientific library. Should my railway journey continue (which seemed likely at the time) for a few months longer, I could imagine myself throwing myself into the controversial aspects of the pill, composing <b>replies</b> <b>and</b> <b>rejoinders</b> pro <b>and</b> con upon the data furnished to me. But after all it was the symbolic quality of the tickets that moved me most. For as certainly as the cross of St. George means English patriotism, those scraps of paper meant all that municipal patriotism which is now, perhaps, the greatest hope of England.|$|R
40|$|The present article {{offers an}} {{approach}} to scientific debate called ad-versarial collaboration. The approach requires both parties to agree on empirical tests for resolving a dispute and to conduct these tests {{with the help of}} an arbiter. In dispute were Hertwig’s claims that fre-quency formats eliminate conjunction effects and that the conjunction effects previously reported by Kahneman and Tversky occurred be-cause some participants interpreted the word “and ” in “bank tellers and feminists ” as a union operator. Hertwig proposed two new con-junction phrases, “and are ” and “who are, ” that would eliminate the ambiguity. Kahneman disagreed with Hertwig’s predictions for “and are, ” but agreed with his predictions for “who are. ” Mellers served as arbiter. Frequency formats by themselves did not eliminate conjunction effects with any of the phrases, but when filler items were removed, conjunction effects disappeared with Hertwig’s phrases. Kahneman and Hertwig offer different interpretations of the findings. We discuss the benefits of adversarial collaboration over <b>replies</b> <b>and</b> <b>rejoinders,</b> <b>and</b> present a suggested protocol for adversarial collaboration. This article presents a new method for resolving scientific debate, which we call adversarial collaboration. The authors did not agree when they began the collaboration, nor do they agree now. But theoretical agreement is not necessary for a successful adversarial collaboration. Success should be gauged by the ex-tent to which joint efforts yield surprising results, insightful discussions, and testable hypotheses about outstanding issues. In Table 1, we provide suggestions for conducting an adversar-ial collaboration based on a protocol originally developed by Kahneman, but adapted in light of our experiences. For another project in a similar spirit, see Gilovich, Medvec, and Kahne-man (1998). Our starting point is a controversy about biases in probabi-listic reasoning in general and conjunction effects in particula...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} four decades, top {{economics}} journals have virtually eliminated critical commentary (comments, <b>replies,</b> <b>rejoinders,</b> <b>and</b> the like). This article shows the data and discusses these steep declines in critical commentary. To the extent that critical commentary is beneficial to scientific inquiry, editorial opposition to critical commentary is detrimental {{to the advancement of}} economic knowledge.

40|$|We {{quantify}} the {{increasing use of}} complex mathematics and show that the increase is unique to economics in the social sciences. Over half a century ago Donald F. Gordon hypothesized that mathematics was most likely to be useful in manipulating long chains of relationships, but these were the cases where the theory was least likely to valid. Time particularly bedevils the long chains because the ceteris paribus assumption requires the stability of all links. We find that the rate of hypothesis testing in articles citing mathematically complex articles is less than two percent, and summarize a variety of tests and other evidence supporting the Gordon hypothesis. We suggest that {{a major factor in the}} rise in mathematical complexity may be the decline in comments, <b>replies,</b> <b>and</b> <b>rejoinders</b> debating earlier publications; the decline has been rapid as editors have become increasingly “hostile” toward perspectives other than the ones they had previously published. We conclude by emphasizing that: 1) prominent journals in economics are devoting more space to mathematically complex articles despite their inconsequential operational harvest; 2) both the “appropriate” balance between mathematical complexity and operationalism, and the relative merits of “stylized facts” versus observational reality should be considered as a factor in editorial decision-making; finally 3) the vital importance of academic debate that addresses empirical verification, the appropriateness of model formulation, and the crucial matters of history and circumstance which are the measures of all research in the social sciences. ...|$|R
40|$|Following the {{financial}} crisis of 2008, the Treasury Committee of the UK House of Commons undertook an inquiry into the lessons that might {{be learned from the}} banking crisis. Paul Moore, head of group regulatory risk at Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) during 2002 – 2005, provided evidence of his experience of questioning HBOS policies which resulted in his dismissal from HBOS. The problems that surfaced at HBOS during {{the financial}} crisis were so serious that it was forced to merge with Lloyds TSB, another UK bank, to form the Lloyds Banking Group in which the government took a significant stake. Moore’s evidence to the Treasury Committee revealed that long before {{the financial crisis}}, he had raised major concerns with the management of HBOS and with the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the UK financial services regulator. Moore’s evidence led to the submission of further disclosures, <b>replies</b> <b>and</b> <b>rejoinders</b> as evidence to the Treasury Committee. Moore’s case is therefore of considerable interest to researchers of whistleblowing because it is a rare instance of high-level whistleblowing, the details of which subsequently entered the public domain. The information revealed in evidence to the Treasury Committee sheds light on the process of whistleblowing {{in the context of the}} governance and regulation of a major UK bank that subsequently had to be rescued by government intervention during the financial crisis. The paper makes a contribution to the wider literature on whistleblowing, and to a greater understanding of aspects of the financial crisis...|$|R
50|$|Blake's 1823 {{pamphlet}} {{on government}} expenditure, Observations on the Effects Produced by Government Expenditure during the Restriction of Cash Payments, caused a stir, however.

David Ricardo wrote a <b>reply,</b> <b>and</b> Blake a <b>rejoinder.</b> Ricardowrote notes on Blake that remained unpublished until 1951. Matters of definition still plagued discussion: Ricardo's idea of depreciation clouded, in Blake's view, the issues. In common with many contemporaries, Blake used balance of trade inconsistently or unclearly as a term.|$|R

40|$|In {{their recent}} Human Relations article <b>and</b> {{subsequent}} <b>rejoinder</b> to three commentators, Alvesson and Kärreman make {{a number of}} assertions concerning the development of organizational discourse analysis and {{the current state of}} research in this area.

We discuss a number of reasons why we believe that readers should be wary of what they read about organizational discourse analysis in Alvesson and Kärreman’s work. Drawing on our critique of their article <b>and</b> <b>rejoinder,</b> we propose some ideas that we believe will be more useful in developing studies of organizational discourse than those put forward by these authors.
