40|$|Simulations that {{sample from}} the {{canonical}} ensemble {{can be generated}} {{by the addition of}} a single degree of freedom, provided that the system is ergodic, as described by Nosé with subsequent modifications by Hoover to allow sampling in real time. Nosé–Hoover dynamics is not ergodic for small or stiff systems and the addition of auxiliary thermostats is needed to overcome this deficiency. Nosé–Hoover dynamics, like its derivatives, does not have a Hamiltonian structure, precluding the use of symplectic integrators which are noted for their long term stability and structure preservation. As an alternative to Nosé–Hoover, the Hamiltonian Nosé–Poincaré method was proposed by Bond, Laird, and Leimkuhler [J. Comput.
