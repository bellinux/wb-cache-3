In order to avoid heat losses according to stricter regulations, building envelope thicknesses are increasing continually when applying traditional thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>materials.</b> Vacuum <b>insulation</b> panels (VIPs) allow the combination of high thermal insulation and thin building envelopes, but unfortunately VIPs are suffering from ageing effects and lack of flexibility and robustness.

Inorganic fibrous materials - stone and glass wool and organic foamy materials- expanded and extruded polystyrene are dominant on the European market. However, the EU priorities of creating products with improved ecological footprint have led towards research for developing new <b>insulation</b> <b>materials.</b> Evaluation {{of the performance of}} <b>insulation</b> <b>materials</b> is a multi-criteria problem, which has to be carried out with respect to: physical properties, health and environmental protection, applicability as building elements and their cost. Recycled textile waste has already found commercial application as <b>insulation</b> <b>material</b> but so far only waste that is easy to open down to fibers has been used. This paper proposes an alternative solution of a new textile structure that will be used for thermal insulation of buildingsâ€™ internal walls in order to prevent the loss of a valuable resource, pre-consumer apparel cutting waste. The designed textile structure is composed of polyester fabric apparel cutting waste which is shredded, rather than opened. Thermal conductivity - Î»(W/mK) of the textile structure was measured with the Heat flow meter FOX 600 instrument. The main goal was to determine the thermal insulation of the structure compared to the standard insulation structures, as well as textile insulating structures in form of fibers.
