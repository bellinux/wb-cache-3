5|$|Between {{the mid-1980s}} {{and the first}} decade of the 2000s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like <b>rasps,</b> processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like Edmontosaurus lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar scratches though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of scratches on Edmontosaurus teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.|$|E

40|$|A spring-mounted <b>rasp</b> bar sheller for com is {{described}} herein. The sheller comprises {{a plurality of}} spaced apart <b>rasp</b> bars mounted on a combine or sheller cylinder. Each of the <b>rasp</b> bars has studs secured thereto which extend therefrom through the cylinder backing plates. Springs are mounted on the studs behind the backing plates for yieldably urging the <b>rasp</b> bar inwardly towards the backing plate. Centrifugal force causes the <b>rasp</b> bar to move out radially towards the concave as the cylinder is rotated. During shelling, impact forces on the <b>rasp</b> bars deflect them radially inwardly. Filler plates are also disclosed for preventing the com from becoming lodged between the backing plate and the <b>rasp</b> bars...|$|R

The nasal hump is bone (red) above the scalloped grey line, and cartilage (blue) below the scalloped grey line. The surgeon cuts the cartilage {{portion of the}} hump with a scalpel, and chisels the bone portion with an osteotome (bone chisel). After chiselling away the main mass of the nasal hump with an osteotome, the surgeon then sculpts, refines, and smoothens the cut nasal bones with <b>rasps</b> (files).|$|E
25|$|Taz is {{generally}} {{portrayed as a}} ferocious, albeit dim-witted, omnivore with a notoriously short temper and little patience. Though he can be very devious, he is also sweet at times. His enormous appetite seems to know no bounds, as he will eat anything in his path. He {{is best known for}} his speech consisting mostly of grunts, growls, and <b>rasps</b> (in his earlier appearances, he does speak English with primitive grammar) as well as his ability to spin like a vortex and bite through nearly anything. Taz does have one weakness: he can be calmed by almost any music. While in this calm state, he can be easily dealt with.|$|E

5000|$|When a RAM {{is acting}} as a <b>RASP,</b> {{something}} new has been gained: unlike the RAM, the <b>RASP</b> has the capacity for self-modification of its program-instructions (the state-machine instructions are frozen, unmodifiable by the machine).

25|$|Native American {{music in}} North America {{is almost entirely}} monophonic, but there are notable exceptions. Traditional Native American music often centers around drumming. Rattles, clappersticks, and <b>rasps</b> were also popular percussive instruments. Flutes were made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The tuning of these flutes is not precise and depends {{on the length of}} the wood used and the hand span of the {{intended}} player, but the finger holes are most often around a whole step apart and, at least in Northern California, a flute was not used if it turned out to have an interval close to a half step. The Apache fiddle is a single stringed instrument.|$|E
25|$|Shells are carved {{soon after}} the tree is felled, while the wood still retains some {{moisture}} and is softer. This makes the wood easier to carve and avoids radial splits that tend to develop in logs that are allowed to dry naturally. Carvers use simple hand tools, such as axes, adzes, spoke shaves, and <b>rasps</b> to shape the shell. A well-carved djembe {{does not have a}} smooth interior but a texture of scallops or shallow grooves that influence the sound of the instrument. (Djembes with smooth interiors have tones and slaps with too much sustain.) Often, interior grooves form a spiral pattern, which indicates a carver taking pride in his work.|$|E
500|$|The diverse {{range of}} music styles and {{instruments}} is matched {{by a variety of}} vocal styles in the genre. From the [...] "spine-chilling death shrieks" [...] in Finntroll to the black metal <b>rasps</b> of Skyforger or Moonsorrow, {{there is no shortage of}} extreme vocals in folk metal. Other bands to feature extreme vocals include Cadacross, Ensiferum, Ithilien and Equilibrium. In contrast, bands like Mägo de Oz and Metsatöll are known to feature [...] "clean" [...] singing in line with their more traditional metal approach. Numerous other bands in the genre are known to feature both extreme vocals and clean singing. This includes Primordial, Turisas, Windir and Wintersun.|$|E

Any officer or NCO who leaves the Regiment for professional timeline, and wishes to return at a higher rank, must also complete the <b>RASP,</b> again. This change has resulted in an extreme professionalization across all ranks, where every Commander, {{all the way to}} the Regimental Commander, and every senior NCO to the Regimental CSM, has completed the <b>RASP</b> multiple times in their career.|$|R
500|$|Pinnipeds {{can produce}} a number of vocalizations such as barks, grunts, <b>rasps,</b> rattles, growls, creaks, warbles, trills, chirps, chugs, clicks and whistles. Vocals are {{produced}} both in air and underwater. Otariids are more vocal on land, while phocids are more vocal in water. Antarctic seals are more vocal on land or ice than Arctic seals {{due to a lack}} of terrestrial and pagophliic predators like the polar bear. Male vocals are usually of lower frequencies than those of the females. Vocalizations are particularly important during the breeding seasons. Dominant male elephant seals advertise their status and threaten rivals with [...] "clap-threats" [...] and loud drum-like calls that may be modified by the proboscis. Male otariids have strong barks, growls, roars and [...] "whickers". Male walruses are known to produce distinctive gong-like calls when attempting to attract females. They can also create somewhat musical sounds with their inflated throats.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{records of}} A'a date to 1821, when the statue {{was presented to}} the missionaries of the LMS on Ra'iatea, the second largest of the Society Islands in French Polynesia. [...] It had been brought there from Rurutu, where it was made. [...] The sculpture itself could be much older: radiocarbon dating carried out in 2015 suggests that A'a was created between 1591 and 1647. [...] According to Rurutuan tradition, A'a is made from the wood of the pua keni keni (Fagraea berteriana) that is native to islands in the eastern Pacific, though tests conducted in 2015 suggested that the figure is in fact made from sandalwood, possibly Santalum insulare. [...] A'a was probably made using stone-bladed tools, though if it was made after the arrival of Europeans to Polynesia in the 1760s iron tools may also have been used in its construction. [...] Ray or shark skin <b>rasps,</b> breadfruit leaves, cowrie shells and coconut oil would have been used to finish and polish the statue.|$|E
500|$|Velociraptor plays a {{major role}} in the film. The creature's {{depiction}} is not based on the actual dinosaur genus in question, which itself was significantly smaller. Shortly before Jurassic Park's theatre release, the similar Utahraptor was discovered, though was proven bigger in appearance than the film's raptors; this prompted Stan Winston to joke, [...] "We made it, then they discovered it." [...] For the attack on character Robert Muldoon and some parts of the kitchen scene, the raptors were played by men in suits. Dolphin screams, walruses bellowing, geese hissing, an African crane's mating call, tortoises mating, and human <b>rasps</b> were mixed to formulate various raptor sounds. Following discoveries made after the film's release, most paleontologists theorize that dromaeosaurs like Velociraptor and Deinonychus were fully covered with feathers like modern birds. This feature is only included in Jurassic Park III for the male raptors, who are shown with a row of small quills on their heads.|$|E
5000|$|As of January 2010, the 4-week Ranger Indoctrination Program (RIP) {{has become}} <b>RASP</b> (Ranger Assessment and Selection Program) {{and is now}} 8 weeks long. There are two {{separate}} phases in the <b>RASP</b> program.|$|R

[...] Cultural theorist Jan Jagodzinski also reads the song as the narrative of a groupie and representing a [...] "desublimated ugly aesthetic of the abjected mother." [...] In The Rough Guide to Rock, the song is noted as [...] "coercing the listener into Love's anguish" [...] as well as representing the band's early stylistic choices and aesthetic, characterized by [...] "drone" [...] and featuring [...] "poetic turns of phrase." ...|$|E

2500|$|The papers: The papers {{begin with}} Wang (1957) and his {{dramatic}} simplification of the Turing machine. [...] Turing (1936), Kleene (1952), Davis (1958) {{and in particular}} Post (1936) are cited in Wang (1957); in turn, Wang is referenced by Melzak (1961), Minsky (1961) and Shepherdson-Sturgis (1961-3) as they independently reduce the Turing tapes to [...] "counters". Melzak (1961) provides his pebble-in-holes counter machine model with indirection but doesn't carry the treatment further. The work of Elgot-Robinson (1964) define the RASP—the computer-like random access stored program machines—and {{appear to be the}} first to investigate the failure of the bounded counter machine to calculate the mu-recursive functions. This failure—except with the draconian use of Gödel numbers in the manner of Minsky (1961))—leads to their definition of [...] "indexed" [...] instructions (i.e. indirect addressing) for their RASP model. Elgot-Robinson (1964) and more so Hartmanis (1971) investigate <b>RASPs</b> with self-modifying programs. Hartmanis (1971) specifies an instruction set with indirection, citing lecture notes of Cook (1970). For use in investigations of computational complexity Cook and his graduate student Reckhow (1973) provide the definition of a RAM (their model and mnemonic convention are similar to Melzak's, but offer him no reference in the paper). The pointer machines are an offshoot of Knuth (1968, 1973) and independently Schönhage (1980).|$|E
60|$|Stridulating organs.—Beetles {{belonging}} to many and widely distinct families possess these organs. The sound {{can sometimes be}} heard at the distance of several feet or even yards,[494] but is not comparable with that produced by the Orthoptera. The part which may be called the <b>rasp</b> generally consists of a narrow slightly-raised surface, crossed by very fine, parallel ribs, sometimes so fine as to cause iridescent colours, and having a very elegant appearance under the microscope. In some cases, for instance, with Typhæus, it could be plainly seen that extremely minute, bristly, scale-like prominences, which cover the whole surrounding surface in approximately parallel lines, give rise to the ribs of the <b>rasp</b> by becoming confluent and straight, {{and at the same}} time more prominent and smooth. A hard ridge on any adjoining part of the body, which in some cases is specially modified for the purpose, serves as the scraper for the <b>rasp.</b> The scraper is rapidly moved across the <b>rasp,</b> or conversely the <b>rasp</b> across the scraper.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Inappropriate {{prescribing}} is {{prevalent in}} older people. One of the interventions is to optimize geriatric pharmacotherapy with a screening tool to detect potentially inappropriate prescribing. The {{aim of this}} study was to develop a novel instrument, the <b>RASP</b> list, which was adapted from The Screening Tool of Older Persons’ potentially inappropriate Prescriptions criteria. Methods Face validity, usability and time investment were determined. Content validity was verified with the Content Validity Index (CVI) and the modified kappa index (κ*). Cohen's kappa (κ) was used to determine the inter-rater reliability. Content and reproducibility validation were to be repeated if consensus (κ* ≥ 0. 74) could not be reached in the first round or if new compelling evidence was published. Results Ten experts validated the content of <b>RASP</b> 1. 0. The scale-CVI/Average (S-CVI/Ave) was 0. 936, Three items did not reach κ* ≥ 0. 74. Median time to complete a patient case with <b>RASP</b> 1. 0 was 316 seconds. Inter-rater reliability was determined by 9 pharmacists (κ = 0. 71) and 10 geriatricians (κ = 0. 63). In a second validation round, 15 items were added to and 3 items deleted from <b>RASP</b> 1. 0. Nine experts validated the new content of <b>RASP</b> 2. 0. All new items but one reached a κ* ≥ 0. 74. The S-CVI/Ave was 0. 923. Inter-rater reliability of <b>RASP</b> 2. 0 was performed by 14 pharmacists (κ = 0. 77). The final version of the <b>RASP</b> list contained 76 items. Conclusions The <b>RASP</b> list is a reliable (κ = 0. 77) and valid (S-CVI/Ave = 0. 92) screening tool to identify polypharmacy in older persons. Further research concerning clinical relevancy is warranted. status: publishe...|$|R
