500|$|Five C-47s of the 375th Troop Carrier Group {{carrying}} the gunners of the 2/4th Field Regiment {{took off from}} Ward's Airfield after the main force and landed at Tsili Tsili. After {{an hour on the}} ground, they set out for Nadzab. Most jumped from the first two aircraft. The next three aircraft dropped equipment, including the dismantled guns. The [...] "pushers out" [...] followed when the aircraft made a second pass over the drop. One Australian injured his shoulder in the drop. The gunners then had to locate and assemble their guns in the tall grass. Enough parts were found to assemble one gun and have it ready for firing within {{two and a half hours}} of dropping, although to maintain surprise they did not carry out <b>registration</b> <b>fire</b> until morning. It took three days to find the missing parts and assemble the other gun. At 1515, two B-17s dropped 192 boxes of ammunition. Their dropping was accurate, but some boxes of ammunition tore away from their parachutes.|$|E
5000|$|Surprise was {{essential}} for creating maximum disruption, so Bruchmüller adopted the Pulkowski Method, for bombardments without the customary <b>registration</b> <b>fire.</b> The position of each gun was surveyed. Knowing the muzzle {{velocity of the}} gun and taking into account variables like air temperature, wind velocity and direction and using tables provided by mathematicians, {{it was possible to}} fire fairly accurately at targets on the gunnery maps. The Germans concealed their attack preparations but their initial target data had to be precise. (The British had fired from the map in their assault at Cambrai on 20 November 1917.) ...|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{valuable}} pieces of work carried out during the last three days of October was the photographing of the army artillery objectives at Montmedy, Longuyon, Spincourt, Dommary-Baroncourt and Conflans. The enemy had protected these points by intense antiaircraft barrages, and high patrols of pursuit planes, but in spite of these obstacles, the objectives were photographed both before and after <b>registration</b> <b>fire,</b> allowing the artillery to fire effectively during the attack. The missions assigned varied in character; from verifying reports as to the location of the front lines, to the seeking out of enemy reserves at points where counter-attacks were expected. This work was carried out by single planes flying at extremely low altitudes. The command planes sometimes penetrated hostile territory to a depth of 15 kilometers, and were constantly exposed to heavy machine gun and anti-aircraft artillery fire. They were especially liable to attack by pursuit planes which had every advantage of speed, maneuverability, and position. The strain of flying under these conditions coupled with the necessarily close confinement while awaiting orders, made it necessary that the teams be changed every ten days, and personnel from each of the squadrons in the groupwere sent out on this work successfully.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{troops and}} skilled commanders, like von Hutier, were {{shifted from the}} east, Army Group von Gallwitz was formed in the west on 1 February. One quarter of the western {{divisions}} were designated for attack; to counter the elastic defense during the winter each of them attended a four-week course on infiltration tactics. Storm troops would slip through weak points in the front line and slice through the battle zone, bypassing strong points that would be mopped up by the mortars, flamethrowers and manhandled field guns of the next wave. As always surprise was essential, so the artillery was slipped into attack positions at night, relying on camouflage for concealment; the British aerial photographers were allowed free rein before D-day. There would be no preliminary <b>registration</b> <b>fire,</b> the gunners were trained for map firing in schools established by Bruchmüller. In the short, intense bombardment each gun fired in a precise sequence, shifting {{back and forth between}} different targets, using many gas shells to keep defenders immersed in a toxic cloud. On D-day, the air force would establish air supremacy and machine gun enemy strong points, also updating commanders on how far the attackers had penetrated. Signal lamps were used for messaging on the ground. Headquarters moved close to the front and as soon as possible would advance to pre-selected positions in newly occupied ground. OHL moved to Spa, Belgium while Hindenburg and Ludendorff were closer to the attack at Avesnes, France, which re-awoke his memories of occupied France 41 years before.|$|E
40|$|Retinal image {{registration}} {{is important to}} assist diagnosis and monitor retinal diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. However, registering retinal images for various registration applications requires the detection and distribution of feature points on the low-quality region that consists of vessels of varying contrast and sizes. A recent feature detector known as Saddle detects feature points on vessels that are poorly distributed and densely positioned on strong contrast vessels. Therefore, we propose a multiresolution difference of Gaussian pyramid with Saddle detector (D-Saddle) to detect feature points on the low-quality region that consists of vessels with varying contrast and sizes. D-Saddle is tested on Fundus Image <b>Registration</b> (<b>FIRE)</b> Dataset that consists of 134 retinal image pairs. Experimental results show that D-Saddle successfully registered 43 % of retinal image pairs with average registration accuracy of 2. 329 pixels while a lower success rate is observed in other four state-of-the-art retinal {{image registration}} methods GDB-ICP (28 %), Harris-PIIFD (4 %), H-M (16 %), and Saddle (16 %). Furthermore, the registration accuracy of D-Saddle has the weakest correlation (Spearman) with the intensity uniformity metric among all methods. Finally, the paired t-test shows that D-Saddle significantly improved the overall registration accuracy of the original Saddle...|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Cambrai {{began with}} a secret {{deployment}} of British reinforcements for the attack. Instead of {{a long period of}} artillery <b>registration</b> (<b>firing</b> ranging shots before the attack) and wire-cutting, which would have warned the German defence that an assault was being prepared, massed artillery-fire did not begin until the infantry–tank advance began on 20 November, using unregistered (predicted) fire. The British sent [...] to roll through the [...] (Hindenburg Line) barbed-wire fields, as a substitute for a long wire-cutting bombardment and the ground assault was accompanied by a large number of ground-attack aircraft. The British attack broke through the [...] but was contained in the rear battlezone (...) by the , which had been built {{on the east side of}} the St Quentin canal on this part of the front. Preparations for a further advance were hampered by the obstacles of the Hindenburg defences, which had been crossed but which limited the routes by which the most advanced British forces could be supplied. The German defence quickly recovered and on 30 November began a counter-offensive, using a similar short bombardment, air attacks and storm troop infantry tactics, which was contained by the British, in some parts of the battlefield using the Hindenburg Line defences captured earlier.|$|R

The Policy Division deals mainly with {{the formulation of}} guidelines on fire protection matters, prosecutions, research and approval of portable fire-fighting equipment and gas cylinders. The Dangerous Goods Division {{is responsible for the}} licensing of dangerous goods stores and vehicles, and timber stores. The Fire Service Installations Division and Ventilation Division are responsible for inspecting fire service installations and ventilating systems in buildings respectively. The two regional offices － the Hong Kong and Kowloon West and the New Territories and Kowloon East － are responsible for advising other government authorities on the fire safety measures for the purposes of licensing/registering various types of premises. Officers of the Command are seconded to the Home Affairs Department to inspect hotels, guesthouses, private clubs and bedspace apartments, and formulate fire safety requirements on these premises; whereas some are seconded to the Social Welfare Department to advise on fire protection measures in residential care homes for the elderly.|$|R

5000|$|Bruchmüller {{commanded}} the artillery of the 8th Army (General Oskar von Hutier) during the Victory at Riga in September 1917. The 8th Army moved west soon thereafter, {{where in the}} first months of 1918, Bruchmüller's techniques were taught to gunners at a special school in Belgium, before the German Spring Offensive of 1918. Infantry officers were also taught his methods and there were joint infantry-artillery exercises with live ammunition, with advances shielded by the creeping barrage. The first attack, Operation Michael, began with a barrage of 3.5 million shells in five hours, almost 200 shells a second. Defying instructions, Bruchmüller eliminated preliminary <b>registration</b> by <b>firing</b> from the map and then directed the artillery during the next attack at the Battle of the Lys on Flanders, where the artillery had not yet been trained in the Pulkowski method. The guns were registered by observation during {{the first phase of the}} bombardment. Still only a retired Lieutenant-Colonel on temporary recall, he {{commanded the}} artillery in Heeresgruppe Deutscher Kronprinz in the Third Battle of the Aisne and the Second Battle of the Marne.

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} the methodologies that predict the trajectory {{and accuracy of}} an unguided, indirect-fire launched projectile in predicted fire. The trajectory is the path that a projectile travels to the impact point, while the accuracy is the measurement of the deviation of the impact point from the target. In addition, this thesis describes, the methodology for calculating the {{various factors such as}} drag and drift in the trajectory calculation. A three degree of freedom model will be compared to a five degree of freedom model. With an accurate trajectory prediction, it is possible to calculate the delivery accuracy in a predicted fire, which does not have cumulative error corrections associated with the <b>registration</b> or adjusted <b>fire.</b> The delivery accuracies that are considered in this thesis are; 1) Mean Point of Impact (MPI) that are related to aiming errors and 2) Precision errors that are related to the dispersion caused by ballistics effect. Finally, the trajectory and accuracy estimates are compared with NATO Armament Ballistics Kernel (NATO) and Joint Weapons Accuracy Model (JWAM) respectively, and the differences are of the order of 4 percent...|$|R
