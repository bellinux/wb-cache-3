5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat {{at the heart of}} a densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research found them to be particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to <b>rent</b> <b>a</b> vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E
5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s.

They rented the stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes around the island.|$|E

5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} <b>rent</b> <b>a</b> home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox did. Then, Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E
5|$|Now {{an escape}} seemed like Berkman's only option. The {{plan was to}} <b>rent</b> <b>a</b> {{house across the street}} from the prison and dig an {{underground}} tunnel from the house to the prison. Berkman had been given access to a large portion of the prison and had grown familiar with its layout. In April 1900, a house was leased. The tunnel would be dug from the cellar of the house to the stable inside the prison yard. When the digging was complete, Berkman would sneak into the stable, tear open the wooden flooring, and crawl through the tunnel to the house.|$|E

5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs to a social {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in professional, service, and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or <b>rent</b> <b>a</b> house for their members to use; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the Lawn and the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn, and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student self-governance, the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the Dean of Students.|$|E

5|$|After Cage {{finished}} {{teaching at}} the New School {{in the summer of}} 1960, Ono was determined to <b>rent</b> <b>a</b> place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found a cheap loft in downtown Manhattan at 112 Chambers Street that she used as a studio and living space. Supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society, Ono allowed composer La Monte Young to organize concerts in the loft. Both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961, with people such as Marcel Duchamp and Peggy Guggenheim attending, and both Ono and Young claimed to have been the primary curator of these events, with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young. The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including Painting to Be Stepped On, which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Edgar Poe {{first met}} his cousin Virginia in August 1829, {{four months after}} his {{discharge}} from the Army. She was seven at the time.

Poe's older brother William Henry Leonard Poe, who had been living with the family, had recently died on August 1, 1831. Poe joined the household in 1833 and was soon smitten by a neighbor named Mary Devereaux. The young Virginia served as a messenger between the two, at one point retrieving a lock of Devereaux's hair to give to Poe. Elizabeth Cairnes Poe died on July 7, 1835, effectively ending the family's income and making their financial situation even more difficult. Henry died around this time, sometime before 1836, leaving Virginia as Maria Clemm's only surviving child.|$|E

Denise feels awkward and confesses the truth to Ian, but doesn't mention Fatboy's name.
