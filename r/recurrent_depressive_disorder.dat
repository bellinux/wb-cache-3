40|$|Background: Depression {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{psychological}} disorders. Most depressed patients experience multiple recurrences despite the pharmacologic therapy. Many studies have reported that countries with high rates of fish consumption have low rates of <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder.</b> The aim of present study is to evaluate the effect of omega- 3 as a complementary treatment on the patients with <b>recurrent</b> unipolar <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> who were receiving maintenant antidepressant therapy. Materials and Methods: In a clinical trial, eighty patients with a diagnosis of <b>recurrent</b> major <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> were divided into two groups of forty. One group received standard anti-depressive therapy (with SSRIs) and the other received omega- 3 in addition to standard therapy. Results: Findings of the study showed that adding omega- 3, significantly reduced depression score and increased patients’ function.

40|$|Background: Only {{some women}} with <b>recurrent</b> major <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> {{experience}} postnatal episodes. Personality and/or cognitive styles might {{increase the likelihood}} of experiencing postnatal depression. Aims: To establish whether personality and cognitive style predicts vulnerability to postnatal episodes over and above their known relationship to depression in general. Method: We compared personality and cognitive style in women with <b>recurrent</b> major <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> who had experienced one or more postnatal episodes (postnatal depression (PND) group, n= 143) with healthy female controls (control group, n= 173). We also examined parous women with <b>recurrent</b> major <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> who experienced no perinatal episodes (non-postnatal depression (NPND) group, n= 131). Results: The PND group had higher levels of neuroticism and dysfunctional beliefs, and lower self-esteem than the control group. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the PND and NPND groups. Conclusions: Established personality and cognitive vulnerabilities for depression were reported by women with a history of postnatal depression, but there was no evidence that any of these traits or styles confer a specific risk for the postnatal onset of episodes. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cognitive {{deficits in}} the course of <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> affect mainly memory, {{attention}} and the frontal functions. They are associated with both an earlier onset of symptoms and prolonged episodes. The main aim {{of the study was to}} verify the hypothesis of differences in the effectiveness of cognitive processes between patients with a first episode of depression (ED-I) and <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> (rDD). Subjects and methods: The study comprised 210 subjects: patients with ED-I (n= 60) and patients with rDD (n= 150). The assessment of cognitive functions was based on performance of the Trail Making Test, the Stroop Test, the Verbal Fluency Test, the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the digit span from WAIS-R. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the analysed groups in the severity of depressive symptoms. The negative impact of depressive symptoms on the effectiveness of cognitive functions was observed. The ED-I group recorded better results compared to the rDD group in terms of the speed of information processing, visual-spatial and auditory-verbal memory and executive functions, auditory-verbal immediate and delayed memory, ability to learn and verbal fluency. The same differences were observed with respect to the patients from the ED-I group and the patients with the second episode of depression (ED-II) {{in the course}} of rDD. Conclusions: There are significant differences in cognitive functioning of patients with a <b>depressive</b> episode and <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders.</b> These differences are already visible from the second episode of a major <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder.</b> Memory, verbal fluency and frontal functions are reduced...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{depression}} is a cross-cultural condition {{that occurs in}} all cultures and within all nations with certain specificities, {{even though there are}} some differences in its manifestation. The hereditary load is of major importance, but also the individual personality factors, in the form of risk factors, are associated with the occurrence of depression. Personality characteristics {{have a significant impact on}} the occurrence of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> and the outcome of the treatment as well. AIM: To identify the specific personality traits in people with the <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> and the impact of the affective state on them. METHODS: Three questionnaires were used: a general questionnaire, Beck's scale of depressive symptoms, and TCI-R (inventory for temperament and character). RESULTS: The most indicative differences in the dimensions are found in the Harm avoidance and the Self-direction dimensions, and most variable dimensions dependent on effective state are Novelty seeking and Reward dependence. CONCLUSION: The people with the <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> have a different profile of personality traits (temperament and character) compared with the control group, and their characteristics depend on their current affective state...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the comorbidity of <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> {{in patients with}} refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Method: We evaluated 25 consecutive patients with refractory TLE (16 women and 9 men), using semi-structured psychiatric interviews, according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 10), and the Beck Depression Inventory. Results: Seventeen of 25 patients (68 %) had depressive disorder: 6 with dysthymia, three with major depressive episodes and 8 with <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders.</b> Two (8 %) were diagnosed with mixed anxiety and depression. Only 5 of 17 patients (29. 4 %) were previously diagnosed with <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> and received prior antidepressant treatment. Duration of epilepsy was significantly higher in patients with <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> (p= 0. 016), {{but there was no}} relationship between depression and seizure frequency. Conclusion: This study confirmed that <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> are common and underdiagnosed in patients with TLE refractory to AEDs.

40|$|Background: The high {{prevalence}} of metabolic syndrome {{in patients with}} psychiatric disorders, almost double the prevalence reported for the general population, is worrying. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the presence of metabolic syndrome and inflammatory marker levels in patients with schizophrenia and <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> in a Croatian psychiatric sample. Subjects and methods: This study included 62 inpatients with schizophrenia and 62 with <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> treated at the Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Centre Split, enrolled from November 2011 until May 2012. The cases were compared to 124 healthy subjects from the general population. Results: The presence of metabolic syndrome was found in 56. 5 % of the patients with schizophrenia and 53. 2 % of the patients with depression, which was significantly more prevalent than in the control group (32. 3 %). The levels of inflammation markers (i. e., C-reactive protein and PAI- 1) were significantly higher among patients with metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: Patients with schizophrenia and <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> demonstrate a high {{prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome that is also related to inflammation processes.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{literature}} suggests persistent and selective structural changes in the cortico-limbic-thalamic-striatal system in patients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> (DD). Oxidative stress is thought to {{play a key role}} in these processes. So far, the main scientific focus has been on antioxidant enzymes in this context. For the first time, this proof of concept study examines the activity of the free radicals producing the enzyme, xanthine oxidase (XO), directly in the cortico-limbic-thalamic-striatal system of patients with recurrent depression. The activity of XO was ascertained in the cortico-limbic-thalamic-striatal regions in post-mortem brain tissue of patients with recurrent depressive episodes and individuals without any neurological or psychiatric history (7 / 7). We measured the XO activity in following brain areas: hippocampus, regio entorhinalis, thalamus, putamen and caudate nucleus. In this study, we report a significant increase of XO activity in the thalamus and the putamen of patients with depression.

40|$|Volumetric {{changes in}} mood-relevant {{distributed}} limbic/paralimbic structures {{have been reported}} in the recent literature on the course of mood disorders. Patients with unipolar and bipolar disorders have been found to have smaller hippocampal and anterior cingulate volumes. We examined hippocampal, amygdalar and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volumes in female patients with <b>recurrent</b> familial pure <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> (rFPDD). We used semi-automated software for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, ACC and subgenual prefrontal cortex (SGPFC) in 15 female patients with familial recurrent major depression (MD) and 15 healthy female subjects. Analysis of covariance, with whole brain volume as covariate, was used to compare volumetric measurements in the two groups. Volumes of the right hippocampal body and tail were significantly smaller in female patients with familial <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> than in healthy subjects. Our data provide evidence of structural lateralized hippocampal body and tail abnormalities in women with familial history and recurrent episodes of depression. Although global reduction of hippocampal volume has been widely reported, data on lateralized regional reductions in familial recurrent depression had not been previously reported. Reduced volume of the right posterior hippocampus could be a structural endophenotype for <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> in women...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is no data on {{depression}} prevalence in Croatia. The {{aim of this}} study was to establish the prevalence and psychosocial risk factors of depression in the adult population of the Croatian capital Zagreb, particularly in patients suffering from Depressive episode (F 32) and <b>Recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> (F 33). Subjects and methods: A cross-sectional study was preformed on a representative sample for city of Zagreb drawn from 10 family physicians’ offices with 17290 patients. From standardized medical files, the family physicians sorted out data of patients with depression, both Depressive episodes (F 32) and <b>Recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> (F 33), classified according to ICD 10. Psychosocial parameters were assessed according to the core questions for the management of psychosocial risk factors recommended by the European Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice. Results: The prevalence of depression was 2. 2 %. Recognized socioeconomical parameters were: female sex (74. 7 %), middle age 45 - 65 years (40. 7 %), married (55. 3 %), high school education (59. 2 %), retired (54. 5 %), and average economical status (73. 6 %). As regards social isolation: depressive patients were not living alone (71. 5 %), they had help in case of illness (80. 9 %), and had no problems with their partner (36. 8 %). Work stress parameters were estimated between 5 and 6. Life satisfaction was estimated mean ± SD= 4. 57 ± 1. 72. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant association between higher education and physicians’ perception as “more depressed and more difficult” patients with <b>Recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> (F 33). Family physicians were unfamiliar with the genealogical disease burden for 45 % of depressive patients, whether they had closed confident for 21. 93 % and problems with partner for 30. 80 %. Conclusion: Depression had a prevalence of 2. 2 %. It was poorly recognized, as were some psychosocial factors especially genealogical disease burden. This suggests the need for implementation of special intervention methods of developing the family physicians‘skills in adopting the psychosocial approach to depressive patients with a focus on recognized psychosocial risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Recurrent {{depression}} is a psychiatric disorder of which etiology and pathogenesis might {{be related to}} immune response. Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and its components are also strongly associated with elevated inflammatory indicators, as so as the body mass index (BMI) and total cholesterol levels. Objective. Objective {{of this study was to}} investigate if there was any difference in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in patients with <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder,</b> treated with antidepressants, compared to a healthy control group of subjects and if there was an association between increased CRP levels and the presence of MetS in these two groups. Methods. Sixty subjects entered the study; of these 35 patients with the diagnosis of <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder,</b> while the healthy control group included 25 subjects. MetS was defined according to the NCEP ATP III criteria. The cut-off point for CRP was set at > 5 mg /L. Results. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of MetS and CRP values between the studied groups. Waist circumference and total cholesterol levels were significantly higher in the experimental group. Patients that fulfilled the criteria for MetS showed significantly higher values of central obesity and arterial hypertension in the experimental group as well. The elevated CRP levels were associated with increased frequency of MetS in depressed patients. Conclusion. Both CRP levels and metabolic risk profile screening, according to the international criteria, may be beneficial in order to obtain better assessment for depressive long term medicated patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{are major}} health care {{implications}} of Quality of Life and Disability in long-standing {{disorders such as}} bipolar affective disorder and <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder.</b> Objectives: To compare the inter episode Quality of life (QOL) and Disability in patients with the diagnosis of Bipolar affective disorder or <b>Recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> in remission. Methods: The two groups were assessed cross-sectionally. Euthymic bipolar or recurrent depressive disor-der subjects {{were included in the}} study. QOL assessment was done using the World Health Organisation (WHO) QOL – Bref Kannada version. Disability was assessed using the Schedule for assessment of psychiatric disability (SAPD), which is an Indian modification of the WHO Disability assessment schedule-II. Results: There were 80 patients enrolled into the study. The mean QOL scores did not differ significantly in the two groups except for the RDD subjects experiencing higher environmental domain QOL (p=. 05). The mean disability scores in the BAD group was significantly more in ‘social role ’ (p<. 0001) and ‘overall behavior ’ (p=. 001) and in the RDD group it was more in ‘ home atmosphere’(p<. 0001) and ‘assets and/or liabilities’(p=. 001). There were more frequent inter-correlations between the illness variables {{and to a lesser extent}} between the illness variables and the QOL / DAS variables in the bipolar group.

40|$|A <b>depressive</b> <b>disorder</b> is {{a disease}} {{characterized}} by a heterogenous background. The important processes observed and diagnosed in depressed patients indicate that the etiology of depression may include disturbances in thyroid hormone (TH) levels and the occurrence of immune‑inflammatory activation. Type 1 (DIO 1) and type 3 (DIO 3) iodothyronine deiodinases are the enzymes which determine the peripheral and tissue levels of TH, but also interfere with immunological cells and inflammatory processes. We aimed to investigate the levels of DIO 1 and DIO 3 in the patients suffering from <b>recurrent</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>disorders</b> (rDD). Data collected from 91 rDD patients and 105 healthy controls were analyzed. The diagnoses were made based on the ICD‑ 10 criteria (F 33. 0 –F 33. 8). The expression levels of DIO 1 and DIO 3 were estimated using the polymerase chain reaction method and the enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of DIO 1 on mRNA/protein levels in the rDD patients was reduced {{in comparison to the}} control subjects, while the expression of DIO 3 was higher in the patients suffering from depression. No significant relationship was found between the investigated DIOs and other clinical parameters.
