5|$|In 1993, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs {{became the}} first film to be entirely scanned to digital files, manipulated, and {{recorded}} back to film. The restoration project was carried out entirely at 4K <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> 10-bit color depth using the Cineon system to digitally remove dirt and scratches and restore faded colors.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an {{unofficial}} patch was released to keep C working on both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows XP and higher. The patch fixes several bugs in the game, and adds upgrades like higher <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> support for language packs.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like other}} moons of Uranus, {{the surface of}} Umbriel is cut by a system of canyons {{trending}} northeast–southwest. They are not, however, officially recognized due to the poor imaging <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> generally bland appearance of this moon, which hinders geological mapping.|$|E
5|$|Several {{versions}} of HDMI {{have been developed}} and deployed since initial release of the technology but all use the same cable and connector.

5|$|A {{controversial}} {{aspect of}} McKinley's presidency is territorial expansion {{and the question}} of imperialism—with the exception of the Philippines, granted independence in 1946, the United States retains the territories taken under McKinley. The territorial expansion of 1898 is often seen by historians as the beginning of American empire. Morgan sees that historical discussion as a subset of the debate over the rise of America as a world power; he expects the debate over McKinley's actions to continue indefinitely without <b>resolution,</b> <b>and</b> notes that however one judges McKinley's actions in American expansion, one of his motivations was to change the lives of Filipinos and Cubans for the better.|$|E
5|$|After {{his tenure}} in Congress, Rowan {{was elected to}} {{represent}} Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. In 1817, the House debated a resolution instructing Governor Gabriel Slaughter {{to negotiate with the}} governors of Indiana and Ohio to secure passage of legislation requiring citizens of those states to return fugitive slaves. Representative James G. Birney vigorously opposed the <b>resolution,</b> <b>and</b> it was defeated. The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership to pass a substitute resolution which softened the most objectionable language but retained the call for fugitive slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E

5|$|Cerium-doped {{lanthanum}} bromide and {{lanthanum chloride}} are the recent inorganic scintillators, {{which have a}} combination of high light yield, best energy <b>resolution,</b> <b>and</b> fast response. Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa {{retired from}} {{political}} life after his resignation. The scandal over the labor flexibility law was renewed in 2003 when a former Senate worker, Mario Pontaquarto, {{claimed to be}} a witness of the case who delivered $5,000,000 to the legislators. De la Rúa was indicted alongside seven politicians from both the UCR and the PJ. In 2013, they were all cleared of charges by a unanimous <b>resolution,</b> <b>and</b> Pontaquarto was removed from the witness protection program.|$|E
5|$|Dishonored 2 {{received}} generally favorable reviews {{according to}} Metacritic. On its release, PC players reported issues with performance such as loss of frame rate and display <b>resolution,</b> <b>and</b> system crashes. Three patches for the PC version were released {{to remedy the}} problem. The levels Clockwork Mansion and A Crack in the Slab were singled out to considerable praise. The game has been the recipient of over one hundred Best of 2016 awards.|$|E

5|$|Five {{days after}} the British surrendered, Congress passed a {{resolution}} agreeing to erect a structure dedicated to commemorating {{those who participated in}} the battle. Construction of the monument was delayed, however, as the federal government had several other financial obligations that were considered to be of a more urgent nature. The battle's centennial sparked renewed enthusiasm in the <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> prompted the government to begin building the monument in 1881 amid national support. The structure was formally erected in 1884 and currently resides within Colonial National Historical Park.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy and his students in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E

CS Forester's novel Brown on <b>Resolution,</b> <b>and</b> two subsequent movies, were inspired by the Dresdens escape and subsequent destruction.|$|E

5|$|In May 2014, Night Trap {{designer}} James Riley {{announced that}} he was in talks to re-release the game with improved <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> gameplay. That August, a Kickstarter campaign appeared for the game's original creators, who formed a company titled Night Trap LLC. The developers said that if the campaign were successful, they would be looking into re-releasing other Digital Pictures titles. Furthermore, the company was also considering making a sequel to the original game. The Kickstarter failed, only gaining $39,843 of its $330,000 goal.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. This method is used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial <b>resolution</b> <b>and</b> high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E
