5|$|The Scottish Parliament {{voted to}} scrap tolls {{on the bridge}} from February 2008. The bridge was {{nearing the end of}} its life in the 2010s, and a {{parallel}} replacement was built. On 5September 2017 the bridge carried its final private cars, as the vast majority of traffic was transferred to the new Queensferry Crossing. Following a few weeks closure for repairs, the new role of the Forth <b>Road</b> <b>Bridge</b> will be as a public transport corridor, open only to buses, taxis, cyclists and pedestrians. At its peak, the Forth <b>Road</b> <b>Bridge</b> carried 65,000 vehicles per day (vpd), which is now expected to drop to only a few hundred following the opening of the Queensferry Crossing.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} cross border {{railways}} expanded {{with the passing}} of the 1922 Border Railways Act, with the Benalla â€“ Yarrawonga branch line extended to Oaklands in 1938, both lines meeting standard gauge lines that were subsequently closed. Victorian Railways commenced construction of a railway from Robinvale to Koorakee and Lette in New South Wales in 1924 (the Lette railway line), but this railway was never completed. The Murray River bridge between Robinvale and Euston was instead converted to a <b>road</b> <b>bridge,</b> which will be demolished when the new <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> currently under construction is completed. The Stony Crossing railway line was built from Kerang to Murrabit in 1924 and Stony Crossing (originally called Poonboon) in 1928 under an agreement with New South Wales. No passenger services were carried on the section beyond Murrabit after 1932 and it was closed about 1943.|$|E

5|$|At midnight the 2nd OBLI were {{attacked}} by a force of tanks and infantry. One of the battalion positions at {{the eastern side of}} the <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> was overrun, and had to be recaptured with a counter-attack. Another attack two hours later was in danger of capturing the bridge, so Brigadier Bellamy ordered it blown up. German infantry attempted to infiltrate the brigade's positions throughout the night. At 05:30 German armour was detected approaching and the brigade called in close air support from RAF Typhoon fighter bombers, which destroyed several tanks. The main <b>road</b> <b>bridge,</b> held by 1st RUR, was attacked at 07:00 by infantry and two tanks. The attack failed when the tanks were destroyed by the division's anti-tank guns. Later that day infantry from the 15th Scottish Infantry Division, supported by tanks, had advanced to the divisional area and took over the brigade's position. At the same time the division was ordered to prepare to advance eastwards from dawn on 26 March.|$|E

5|$|Datchet Bridge, {{also known}} as The Divided Bridge, was a <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> which crossed the River Thames at Datchet from 1706 until it was {{demolished}} in 1848.

5|$|During the {{construction}} of the second <b>road</b> <b>bridge,</b> {{the construction}} of a railway through Perth's southern suburbs to Rockingham and Mandurah became a political issue. The incumbent Liberal State Government proposed building a railway from Kenwick to connect to the Kwinana Freeway, running in the centre of the freeway for only part of its journey. The Labor opposition instead wanted to build the railway across the Narrows Bridge and down most of the length of the freeway.|$|E
5|$|Except for Tower Bridge, {{built in}} 1894, the Albert Bridge {{is the only}} Thames <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> in central London never to have been replaced. Intended as a {{temporary}} measure to be removed in 1978, the concrete central piers remain in place, and although in 1974 its lifespan was estimated at a maximum of 30 years, the bridge is still standing and operational. The Albert Bridge was protected as a Grade II* listed structure in 1975, granting it protection against significant alteration without consultation. It continues to deteriorate. Although proposals have been drawn up by Kensington and Chelsea London Borough Council to repair and rescue it, by March 2008 funds for the repairs were unavailable. As well as structural damage caused by traffic, the timbers underpinning the deck are being seriously rotted by the urine of dogs crossing to and from nearby Battersea Park. With multiple measures in place to reduce traffic flow and prolong {{the life of the}} bridge, in 2009 it carried approximately 19,000 vehicles per day, the lowest usage of any Thames <b>road</b> <b>bridge</b> in London other than the little-used Southwark Bridge.|$|E
