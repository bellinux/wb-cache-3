2500|$|In January 2014, {{scientists}} from Northwest Normal University in Lanzhou, China, published {{the results of}} recordings made in July 2012 of the optical spectrum of what {{was thought to be}} natural ball lightning made by chance during the study of ordinary cloud–ground lightning on the Tibetan Plateau. At a distance of , a total of 1.64 seconds of digital video of the ball lightning and its spectrum was made, from the formation of the ball lightning after the ordinary lightning struck the ground, up to the optical decay of the phenomenon. [...] Additional video was recorded by a high-speed (3000 frames/sec) camera, which captured only the last 0.78 seconds of the event, due to its limited <b>recording</b> <b>capacity.</b> [...] Both cameras were equipped with slitless spectrographs. [...] The researchers detected emission lines of neutral atomic silicon, calcium, iron, nitrogen and oxygen—in contrast with mainly ionized nitrogen emission lines in the spectrum of the parent lightning. The ball lightning traveled horizontally across the video frame at an average speed equivalent of [...] It had a diameter of [...] and covered a distance of about [...] within those 1.64 s.|$|E
