5000|$|Civil {{registration}} {{is the system}} by which a government records the vital events (births, marriages, and deaths) of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a civil registry , civil register (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a vital event), vital records, and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a bureau of vital statistics, registry of vital records and statistics, registrar, registry, <b>register,</b> <b>registry</b> office (officially register office [...] ), or population registry. The primary purpose of civil {{registration is}} to create a legal document {{that can be used to}} establish and protect the rights of individuals. A secondary purpose {{is to create a}} data source for the compilation of vital statistics. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was France in 1539, using the Catholic Church registers, Sweden followed in 1631, which was organized by the Church of Sweden on the demand of the Swedish king.|$|E
40|$|Background The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of darapladib, a {{selective}} oral investigational lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 inhibitor, on both plasma and plaque lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 activity. Methods Patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy were randomized to darapladib 40 mg (n?=? 34), 80 mg (n?=? 34), or placebo (n?=? 34) for 14 days, followed by carotid endarterectomy 24 hours after the last dose of study medication. Results Darapladib 40 mg and 80 mg reduced plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 activity by 52 % and 81 %, respectively, versus placebo (both P< 0. 001). Significant reductions in plaque lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 activity were also observed compared with placebo (P< 0. 0001), which equated to a 52 % and 80 % decrease compared with placebo. No significant differences were observed between groups in plaque lysophosphatidylcholine content or other biomarkers, although a dose-dependent decrease in plaque matrix metalloproteinase- 9 mRNA expression was observed with darapladib 80 mg (P?=? 0. 053 vs placebo). In a post-hoc analysis, plaque caspase- 3 (P< 0. 001) and caspase- 8 (P< 0. 05) activity were found to be significantly lower in the darapladib 80 -mg group versus placebo. No major safety concerns were identified in the study. Conclusions Short-term treatment (14 ± 4 days) with darapladib produced a robust, dose-dependent reduction in plasma lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 activity. More importantly, darapladib demonstrated placebo-corrected reductions in carotid plaque lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A 2 activity of similar magnitude. Darapladib was generally well tolerated and no safety concerns were identified. Additional studies of longer duration are needed to explore whether these pharmacodynamic effects are associated with improved clinical outcomes, as might be hypothesized.

40|$|A proper {{utilization}} of historical documents for {{reconstruction of the}} past population development still produces serious methodological problems for a researcher. The elaboration exemplifies a proper solution of these problems. From 1699 to 1822 nine censuses of the Martinique population were carried out. The author aims at expressing an opinion of their quality by comparing them with population movement. It was derived from a specification made by drawing every twentieth person from parish <b>registers</b> and <b>registry</b> records. These <b>registers</b> are almost without gaps since the year 1763. The white population {{is characterized by a}} great number of illegitimate birth. Age of contraction of marriages is rather advanced. Marriages give often opportunity to own children. Children's deaths are irregularly registered. Deaths of adults permite to appraise migration significance from Europe. Magnitudes for the coloured are much more uncertain, because persons with light skin were taken as white population in censuses, while their children were reckoned among the colored. For ethnic categories were revealed quiet frequently in parish <b>registers</b> and <b>registry</b> records, a judgement can be formed on significance of races blending during seven of ten examined decades.

50|$|In {{order to}} produce SRECs, a solar system must first be {{certified}} by state regulatory agencies, usually public service commissions or public utility commissions, and then <b>registered</b> with the <b>registry</b> authorized {{by the state to}} create and track SRECs.

In some cases, smaller installations may be able to use estimates, while actual meter readings are required for large installations. Solar installations may be registered in states other than the state in which they are physically located and many SREC aggregators will navigate the certification process on behalf of their customers to ensure that systems are certified in the states with the highest SREC values so as to ensure long-term price stability.|$|R
30|$|One notable {{feature of}} KOPSS is its data mart. A KOPSS data mart {{contains}} detailed, linked spatial data for a target region.

Attributes and statistics of real world {{objects in the}} data mart are aggregated {{in the form of}} administrative or statistical boundaries. Transportation networks are mostly in the structure of node-links for efficient calibration of accessibility indicators. From an analysis viewpoint, the KOPSS data mart is beneficial since land parcels, buildings, populations, and related register documents are spatially linked with parcels as unit locational references.|$|R

Crossbred and purebred animals are eligible for registration, as are animals <b>registered</b> with other <b>registries</b> that meet the entry requirements. In 1975, the National Quarter Pony Association was begun to preserve the smaller, stockier type Quarter Horse when breeding trends were leaning towards taller, leaner animals. The AQPA now registers horses in several foreign countries, {{as well as all}} US states and Canadian provinces. The International Quarter Pony Association, begun in the 1970s, also registers Quarter Ponies, and is a worldwide association for ponies of Quarter Horse type. The Quarter Pony Association is an association affiliated with the International Quarter Pony Association, with the goal of promoting the Quarter Pony. In 2005, the IQPA and the QPA became one organization, with the IQPA acting as the registry and the QPA as the membership branch. As of 2005, there were an estimated 3,000 Quarter Ponies registered with all <b>registering</b> organizations. <b>Registries</b> say that registrations of adult animals outnumber those for foals every year, as many owners wait until the pony is old enough to be shown under saddle before registering them.|$|R
