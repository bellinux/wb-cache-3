We gained distance restraints on a modular interaction network of protein complexes affinity-purified from human cells by applying an adapted XL-MS protocol. Systematic analysis of human protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) complexes identified 176 interprotein and 570 intraprotein cross-links that link specific trimeric PP 2 A complexes to {{a multitude of}} adaptor proteins that control their cellular functions. Spatial <b>restraints</b> <b>guided</b> molecular modeling of the binding interface between immunoglobulin binding protein 1 (IGBP 1) and PP 2 A and revealed the topology of TCP 1 ring complex (TRiC) chaperonin interacting with the PP 2 A regulatory subunit 2 ABG.

Although many data-mining methodologies and systems have been developed in recent years, we contend that by and large, present mining models lack human involvement, particularly {{in the form of}} guidance and user control. We believe that data mining is most effective when the computer does what it does best— like searching large databases or counting—and users do what they do best, like specifying the current mining session’s focus.

40|$|SummaryProteins often {{assemble}} in multimeric complexes {{to perform}} a specific biologic function. However, trapping these high-order conformations is difficult experimentally. Therefore, predicting how proteins assemble using in silico techniques can be of great help. The size of the associated conformational space {{and the fact that}} proteins are intrinsically flexible structures make this optimization problem extremely challenging. Nonetheless, known experimental spatial <b>restraints</b> can <b>guide</b> the search process, contributing to model biologically relevant states. We present here a swarm intelligence optimization protocol able to predict the arrangement of protein symmetric assemblies by exploiting a limited amount of experimental restraints and steric interactions. Importantly, within this scheme the native flexibility of each protein subunit is taken into account as extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that this is a key ingredient for the prediction of biologically functional assemblies when, upon oligomerization, subunits explore activated states undergoing significant conformational changes...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} child <b>restraints</b> is <b>guided</b> {{in part by}} data on {{the size and shape}} of child occupants. This study {{presents}} for the first time statistical body shape models for children weighing 9 to 27 kg (20 to 60 lb) in a seated posture relevant to child restraint design. A laboratory study was conducted with 47 child participants, ages 12 to 48 months. Standard anthropometric dimensions were taken and whole-body surface scans were conducted in a range of postures. A three- dimensional coordinate measurement system was used to record body landmarks. The body surface data were analyzed using novel template fitting methods to obtain homologous meshes for each participant in a standardized seated posture. Data from the current study were combined with data from a preceding study to obtain body scans from 68 children. Principal component analysis and regression were used to develop a statistical body shape model (SBSM). The SBSM was exercised to create 18 manikins representing children with long and short torsos at body weights ranging from 20 to 60 lb. These manikins will be useful for assessing child accommodation in restraints. The SBSM can provide guidance for the development of anthropomorphic test devices and computational models of child occupants...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{introduce}} {{a simple and}} fast approach for predicting RNA chemical shifts from interatomic distances that performs with an accuracy similar to existing predictors and enables the first chemical shift-restrained simulations of RNA to be carried out. Our analysis demonstrates that the applied <b>restraints</b> can effectively <b>guide</b> conformational sampling toward regions of space that are more consistent with chemical shifts than the initial coordinates used for the simulations. As such, our approach should be widely applicable in mapping the conformational landscape of RNAs via chemical shift-guided molecular dynamics simulations. The simplicity and demonstrated sensitivity to three-dimensional structure should also allow our method {{to be used in}} chemical shift-based RNA structure prediction, validation, and refinement. The recent realization of the important role played by ribonucleic acids (RNAs) in regulating cellular processes 1, 2 has resulted in significant interest in characterizing the structur...|$|R
40|$|A survey {{has been}} {{conducted}} of child restraint use (infant capsules, child safety seats and booster seats) in motor vehicles in the Adelaide metropolitan area. Driver knowledge concerning child restraint use was also studied. A random sample of 31 pre-schools and primary schools was selected. Researchers visited sites on mornings in August 2004, and surveyed 357 drivers who were transporting children aged 0 - 10 years. Based on common age recommendations, 82 % of children were using an appropriate restraint, but based on {{the weight of the}} child (a better metric of correct restraint choice), we estimate that the rate of appropriate restraint selection was between 64 % and 72 %. The rate of inappropriate restraint selection was due largely to children progressing prematurely to an adult seat belt. Children were rarely unrestrained. We conclude that guidelines on child restraint selection need to be clarified. Higher rates of appropriate restraint use may be achieved by carefully reconsidering the weight ranges for each kind of restraint, specified in the AZealand Standard, so that age may be successfully used to <b>guide</b> <b>restraint</b> choice.

40|$|Rhodopsin is {{the best}} {{characterized}} member of the large, pharmaceutically important, family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), {{and serves as a}} prototype for understanding GPCR activation. In this thesis, we aim at understanding the activation mechanism of rhodopsin. To this aim, we first performed an in-depth analysis of the conformational motions of rhodopsin predicted by two elastic network models, Gaussian Network Model (GNM) and Anisotropic Network Model (ANM). We compared these motions with the extensive amount of experimental data, and developed a model for rhodopsin activation. We tested the model with Meta II fluorescence decay rates measured to characterize the deactivation of rhodopsin mutants. We find that our results correctly predict 93 % of the experimentally observed effects in 119 rhodopsin mutants for which the decay rates and misfolding data were measured, including a systematic analysis of Cys->Ser replacements. Next, in order to incorporate atomic details and the effects of membrane and water molecules into our model, we developed a new protocol named ANM-restrained molecular dynamics (MD). In this protocol, we used multiple ANM modes as <b>restraints</b> to <b>guide</b> MD simulations. By using this protocol, we were able to sample biologically relevant, large scale motions of the protein that are otherwise not accessible to the conventional timescales MD simulations. Furthermore, we explored the evolution of the multiple ANM global modes with realistic deformations favored by a detailed atomic force field {{in the presence of the}} explicit environment. Remarkably, with this method, we identify a highly hinge site, which does not change with several rounds of applying normal modes as restraints. This hinge site includes residues that are directly affected by the isomerization of retinal, as well as those stabilizing the resulting all-trans conformation of the chromophore. The CP ends of the helices H 3, H 4, H 5, and H 6 and the connecting loops are found to enjoy an enhanced mobility facilitated by this hinge site. Several new interactions are observed to contribute to the mechanism of signal propagation from the retinal binding pocket to the G-protein binding sites in the CP domain...|$|R
40|$|Self-monitoring {{and public}} self-consciousness are two {{variables}} {{that contribute to}} self-presentation. Self-monitoring refers to self-observation and <b>restraint</b> that is <b>guided</b> by situational cues to social appropriateness (Snyder, 1974). Public self-consciousness is the consistent tendency of a person to direct attention outward, {{as well as the}} awareness a person has of being a social object (Nystedt & Ljungberg, 2002). To assess the relationship degree of self-monitoring and public self-consciousness has on the type of information Facebook users display on their own profiles and their perceptions of other Facebook profiles, 134 undergraduates (¬¬ 108 female, 26 male; 18 years or older) viewed two fictitious Facebook pages and their own Facebook pages. Facebook Page 1 was not very detailed and was cautious in the information it presented. In contrast, Facebook Page 2 was very detailed and generous in the information it presented. Participants answered a questionnaire comparing the two pages (e. g. type of information displayed, page preference, etc.), a questionnaire pertaining to their own Facebook page (type of information displayed, concern of audience, etc.), and completed the Self-Monitoring Scale (Snyder, 1974) and the Public Self-Consciousness Scale (Fenigstein, A., Sheier, M. F., & Buss, 1975). Overall, participants preferred mock Facebook Page 1; however, those who were high self-monitors preferred mock Facebook page 2. Additionally, participants agreed more with using Facebook in a limited way rather than using Facebook as a means of self-expression. Further research is needed to explore questions such as the possible implications of Facebook on communication, impression formation, and expressive behavior...|$|R
40|$|Fast and {{accurate}} protein structure prediction {{is one of}} the major challenges in structural biology, biotechnology and molecular biomedicine. These fields re-quire 3 D protein structures for rational design of proteins with improved or novel properties. X-ray crystallography is the most common approach even with its low success rate, but lately NMR based approaches have gained popularity. The general approach involves a set of distance <b>restraints</b> used to <b>guide</b> a structure prediction, but simple NMR triple-resonance experiments often provide enough structural information to predict the structure of small proteins. Previous pro-tein folding simulations that have utilised experimental data have weighted the experimental data and physical force field terms more or less arbitrarily, and the method is thus not generally applicable to new proteins. Furthermore a com-plete and near error-free assignment of chemical shifts obtained by the NMR experiments is needed, due to the static, or deterministic, assignment. In this thesis I present Chemshift, a module for handling chemical shift assign-ments, implemented in the protein structure determination program Phaistos. This module treats both the assignment of experimental data, as well as the weighing compared to physical terms, in a probabilistic framework where no data is discarded. Provided a partial assignment of NMR peaks, the module is able to improve the assignment with the intension to utilise this in the protein folding with little bias.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the frequency of child restraint choices in a sample consisting of 357 drivers in the Adelaide metropolitan area, who were transporting to school 586 children aged up to 10 years. The main survey result was {{that the rate of}} appropriate restraint was between 64 % and 72 % on such trips, (according to weight criteria in the Australian and New Zealand Standard on child restraints for motor vehicles). Only 1 % are completely unrestrained. Most of those who were not restrained appropriately had prematurely progressed to an adult seatbelt. Appropriate child restraint use is lowest for children in the age range 5 - < 7. Inappropriate restraint choice is strongly related to the child’s age, their seating location (children seated in the rear being more likely to be restrained appropriately), and possibly the child’s entry into primary school. Female drivers were more likely than male drivers to know what restraints were suitable for children in their carriage. However, it {{did not appear to be}} the case than good knowledge of child restraints is predictive of appropriate restraint use. Barriers to booster seat use included the child’s attitudes to using a booster seat. This effect may be lessened if the child’s age were able to used to <b>guide</b> <b>restraint</b> selection, as peer cues (for child and parent) would be more consistent. Drivers almost never mentioned cost as a barrier to child restraint use. Encouraging parents to become better informed may also help, but recommendations should be reviewed. Further developemnt of the Australian and New Zealand Standard for child restraints may enable age to be used as a criterion, thus simplifying advice to parents. S. A. Edwards, R. W. G.

40|$|Molecular {{interaction}} among proteins drives the cellular processes through {{the formation of}} complexes that perform the requisite biochemical function. While some of the complexes are obligate (i. e., they fold together while complexation) others are non-obligate, and are formed through macromolecular recognition. Macromolecular recognition in proteins is highly specific, yet it can be both permanent and non permanent in nature. Hallmarks of permanent recognition complexes include large surface of interaction, stabilization by hydrophobic interaction and other noncovalent forces. Several amino acids which contribute critically to the free energy of binding at these interfaces are called as “hot spot” residues. The non permanent recognition complexes, on the other hand, usually show small interface of interaction, with limited stabilization from non covalent forces. For both the permanent and non permanent complexes, the specificity of molecular interaction is governed by the geometric compatibility of the interaction surface, and the noncovalent forces that anchor them. A great deal of studies has already been performed in understanding the basis of protein macromolecular recognition. 1; 2 Based on these studies efforts {{have been made to}} develop protein-protein docking algorithms that can predict the geometric orientation of the interacting molecules from their individual unbound states. Despite advances in docking methodologies, several significant difficulties remain. 1 Therefore, in this thesis, we start with literature review to understand the individual merits and demerits of the existing approaches (Chapter 1), 3 and then, we attempt to address some of the problems by developing methods to infer protein quaternary structure from the crystalline state, and improve structural and chemical understanding of protein-protein interactions through biological complex prediction. The understanding of the interaction geometry {{is the first step in}} a protein-protein interaction study. Yet, no consistent method exists to assess the geometric compatibility of the interacting interface because of its highly rugged nature. This suggested that new sensitive measures and methods are needed to tackle the problem. We, therefore, developed two new and conceptually different measures using the Delaunay tessellation and interface slice selection to compute the surface complementarity and atom packing at the protein-protein interface (Chapter 2). 4 We called these Normalized Surface Complementarity (NSc) and Normalized Interface Packing (NIP). We rigorously benchmarked the measures on the non redundant protein complexes available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and found that they efficiently segregate the biological protein-protein contacts from the non biological ones, especially those derived from X-ray crystallography. Sensitive surface packing/complementarity recognition algorithms are usually computationally expensive and thus limited in application to high-throughput screening. Therefore, special emphasis was given to make our measure compute-efficient as well. Our final evaluation showed that NSc, and NIP have very strong correlation among themselves, and with the interface area normalized values available from the Surface Complementarity program (CCP 4 Suite:); but at a fraction of the computing cost. After building the geometry based surface complementarity and packing assessment methods to assess the rugged protein surface, we advanced our goal to determine the stabilities of the geometrically compatible interfaces formed. For doing so, we needed to survey the quaternary structure of proteins with various affinities. The emphasis on affinity arose due to its strong relationship with the permanent and non permanent life-time of the complex. We, therefore, set up data mining studies on two databases named PQS (Protein Quaternary structure database: [URL] and PISA (Protein Interfaces, Surfaces and Assemblies: www. ebi. ac. uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart. html) that offered downloads on quaternary structure data on protein complexes derived from X-ray crystallographic methods. To our surprise, we found that above mentioned databases provided the valid quaternary structure mostly for moderate to strong affinity complexes. The limitation could be ascertained by browsing annotations from another curated database of protein quaternary structure (PiQSi: 5 supfam. mrc-lmb. cam. ac. uk/elevy/piqsi/piqsi_home. cgi) and literature surveys. This necessitated that we at first develop a more robust method to infer quaternary structures of all affinity available from the PDB. We, therefore, developed a new scheme focused on covering all affinity category complexes, especially the weak/very weak ones, and heteromeric quaternary structures (Chapter 3). 6 Our scheme combined the naïve Bayes classifier and point-group symmetry under a Boolean framework to detect all categories of protein quaternary structures in crystal lattice. We tested it on a standard benchmark consisting of 112 recognition heteromeric complexes, and obtained a correct recall in 95 % cases, which are significantly better than 53 % achieved by the PISA, 7 a state-of-art quaternary structure detection method hosted at the European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK. A few cases that failed correct detection through our scheme, offered interesting insights into the intriguing nature of protein contacts in the lattice. The findings have implications for accurate inference of quaternary states of proteins, especially weak affinity complexes, where biological protein contacts tend to be sacrificed for the energetically optimal ones that favor the formation/stabilization of the crystal lattice. We expect our method to be used widely by all researchers interested in protein quaternary structure and interaction. Having developed a method that allows us to sample all categories of quaternary structures in PDB, we set our goal in addressing the next problem that of accurately determining stabilities of the geometrically compatible protein surfaces involved in interaction. Reformulating the question in terms of protein-protein docking, we sought to ask how we could reliably infer the stabilities of any arbitrary interface that is formed when two protein molecules are brought sterically closer. In a real protein docking exercise this question is asked innumerable times during energy-based screening of thousands of decoys geometrically sampled (through rotation+translation) from the unbound subunits. The current docking methods face problems in two counts: (i), the number of interfaces from decoys to evaluate energies is rather large (64320 for a 9 º rotation and translation for a dimeric complex), and (ii) the energy based screening is not quite efficient such that the decoys with native-like quaternary structure are rarely selected at high ranks. We addressed both the problems with interesting results. Intricate decoy filtering approaches have been developed, which are either applied during the search stage or the sampling stage, or both. For filtering, usually statistical information, such as 3 D conservation information of the interfacial residues, or similar facts is used; more expensive approaches screen for orientation, shape complementarity and electrostatics. We developed an interface area based decoy filter for the sampling stage, exploiting an assumption that native-like decoys must have the largest, or close to the largest, interface (Chapter 4). 8 Implementation of this assumption and standard benchmarking showed that in 91 % of the cases, we could recover native-like decoys of bound and unbound binary docking-targets of both strong and weak affinity. This allowed us to propose that “native-like decoys must have the largest, or close to the largest, interface” can be used as a rule to exclude non native decoys efficiently during docking sampling. This rule can dramatically clip the needle-in-a-haystack problem faced in a docking study by reducing > 95 % of the decoy set available from sampling search. We incorporated the rule as a central part of our protein docking strategy. While addressing the question of energy based screening to rank the native-like decoys at high rank during docking, we came across a large volume of work already published. The mainstay of most of the energy based screenings that avoid statistical potential, involve some form of the Coulomb’s potential, Lennard Jones potential and solvation energy. Different flavors of the energy functions are used with diverse preferences and weights for individual terms. Interestingly, in all cases the energy functions were of the unnormalized form. Individual energy terms were simply added to arrive at a final score that was to be used for ranking. Proteins being large molecules, offer limited scope of applying semi-empirical or quantum mechanical methods for large scale evaluation of energy. We, therefore, developed a de novo empirical scoring function in the normalized form. As already stated, we found NSc and NIP to be highly discriminatory for segregating biological and non biological interface. We, therefore, incorporated them as parameters for our scoring function. Our data mining study revealed that there is a reasonable correlation of - 0. 73 between normalized solvation energy and normalized nonbonding energy (Coulombs + van der Waals) at the interface. Using the information, we extended our scoring function by combining the geometric measures and the normalized interaction energies. Tests on 30 unbound binary protein-protein complexes showed that in 16 cases we could identify at least one decoy in top three ranks with ≤ 10 Å backbone root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) from true binding geometry. The scoring results were compared with other state-of-art methods, which returned inferior results. The salient feature of our scoring function was exclusion of any experiment <b>guided</b> <b>restraints,</b> evolutionary information, statistical propensities or modified interaction energy equations, commonly used by others. Tests on 118 less difficult bound binary protein-protein complexes with ≤ 35 % sequence redundancy at the interface gave first rank in 77 % cases, where the native like decoy was chosen among 1 in 10, 000 and had ≤ 5 Å backbone RMSD from true geometry. The details about the scoring function, results and comparison with the other methods are extensively discussed in Chapter 5. 9 The method has been implemented and made available for public use as a web server - PROBE ([URL] The development and use of PROBE has been elaborated in Chapter 7. 10 On course of this work, we generated huge amounts of data, which is useful information that could be used by others, especially “protein dockers”. We, therefore, developed dockYard ([URL] - a repository for protein-protein docking decoys (Chapter 6). 11 dockYard offers four categories of docking decoys derived from: Bound (native dimer co-crystallized), Unbound (individual subunits as well as the target are crystallized), Variants (match the previous two categories in at least one subunit with 100 % sequence identity), and Interlogs (match the previous categories in at least one subunit with ≥ 90 % or ≥ 50 % sequence identity). There is facility for full or selective download based on search parameters. The portal also serves as a repository to modelers who may want to share their decoy sets with the community. In conclusion, although we made several contributions in development of algorithms for improved protein-protein docking and quaternary structure inference, a lot of challenges remain (Chapter 8). The principal challenge arises by considering proteins as flexible bodies, whose conformational states may change on quaternary structure formation. In addition, solvent plays a major role in the free energy of binding, but its exact contribution is not straightforward to estimate. Undoubtedly, the cost of computation is one of the limiting factors apart from good energy functions to evaluate the docking decoys. Therefore, the next generation of algorithms must focus on improved docking studies that realistically incorporate flexibility and solvent environment in all their evaluations...|$|R
