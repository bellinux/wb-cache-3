The surface hardness and the resistance ability of repeated {{impact of the}} layers were measured using Knoop hardness test and <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> respectively. The {{results show that the}} surface hardness of the modified samples was significantly improved due to the deposited layer containing Cr 1. 93 Ti 1. 07, Cr 2 Ti, FeCrMo, and Cr 2 Ti 4 O 11 compounds. However, it was found that heavy peeling occurred on the Cr-Mo alloying modified layers after <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> due to these brittle phases formed in plasma alloying process. Brittle phases appeared in the surface modified layer, such as intermetallic compounds, contribute to hardness enhancement and wear properties, but may be detrimental to impact resistance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> is an {{appropriate}} way to evaluate coating properties of metal cutting tools since the cyclic impact loading applied in the test simulates the interrupted cutting process. For hard CVD coatings with multi-layered structure, the alumina is usually of the lowest toughness and adhesion, and relatively easy to fail in the metal cutting. In the present paper, multilayered coatings consisting medium temperature TiCN, Al 2 O 3 and TiN were deposited by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on the tungsten carbide/cobalt substrate and evaluated using scratch adhesion test and repeated impacted test. The phase structure of alumina layers are α or κ as usually applied in cutting tools, and the grain size for the α phase one is varied from one micron to four microns. The scratch and indentation test {{results show that the}} alumina layer of κ phase is easy to remove under the quasi-static loading, implying brittleness and low adhesion. The <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> results reveal lower impact resistance for the κ phase alumina, and only adhesive failure can be found, which differs to that of the α phase one. The coarse grained α-Al 2 O 3 layer shows similar adhesion compared to the fine grained α- Al 2 O 3 in scratch test. The failure mode of the coating with coarse grained α-Al 2 O 3 layer in the <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> is primarily impact wear. No cohesive failure can be found at all load levels, and this leads to higher impact life than that of the fine grain one. It was shown that the relatively low adhesion of bottom TiCN layer may not affect the impact resistance...|$|E
40|$|Repeated plate {{impact testing}} with impact stress {{well below the}} {{threshold}} spall-stress (2. 6 GPa) on medium carbon steel was carried out to the identical target plate by impacting the flyer plate. Occurrence of spall damage under low-velocity repeated impact was evaluated nondestructively with a low frequency scanning acoustic microscope. We observed the spall damage distribution by the B- and C-scan images. In order to initiate the spall damage (voids in a ductile material or cracks in a brittle one) the particular value of threshold spall-stress should be exceeded what already belongs to a commonly accepted knowledge. Generally, the spall damage development {{is dependent on the}} amplitude and the duration of the stress pulse. If the stress is high and duration is long enough to create tensile failure of material, the voids or cracks nucleate along the spall plane, and consequently, they form macrocracks. Therefore, the spall damage does not create when the first impact stress is less than the threshold spall-stress. However, after the fifth low-velocity <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test,</b> the generation of the spall damage was detected, even if the impact stress (1. 1 – 1. 7 GPa) was lower than the threshold spall-stress (2. 6 [*]GPa) ...|$|E
40|$|In the paper, data of <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> {{performed}} on seven laminates of different lay-up and thickness {{are used to}} illustrate how the damage index (DI), a damage variable recently introduced by the authors to monitor {{the range of the}} penetration process in thick laminates, can be applied in case of <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> to get information on the rate of initial steady damage accumulation {{as well as on the}} onset of severe damage modes. Curves of the rate of growth of the DI in the steady phase (ΔDI/ΔN) vs. the normalised impact energy (ratio of the impact energy Ei and the laminate penetration threshold Pn) show no significant damage accumulation besides initial specimen indentation for impact energies below 0. 2 Pn. For intermediate levels of <b>impact</b> energy, <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> are characterised by an initial region of steady damage accumulation followed by an abrupt change in the rate of damage growth a few impacts before laminate perforation. For higher impact energies (Ei/Pn > 0. 4 - 0. 45), no phase of steady damage accumulation is present, suggesting that severe damage mechanisms take place from the very first impacts. Values of the DI at the end of the steady phase (DIunsteady) are shown to be rather peculiar to each laminate regardless of the impact energy used in the tests and therefore may be used to get a first indication of the laminate performance to <b>repeated</b> <b>impacts.</b> The extent of the steady phase may also be used to compute the total energy absorbed by the laminate in the steady damage accumulation phase (EaTOT_steady...|$|R

40|$|In Japan, many {{concrete}} bridges {{along the}} coastline have suffered corrosion {{due to the}} chloride attack from seawater and airborne salt. Therefore, now, several researches on corroded RC structures have been ongoing around the world. Especially, as a basic research, many researchers have studied on the numerical and experimental method to evaluate static load resistant capacity of RC beams with corroded reinforcements. However, there has been almost no research to evaluate impact load resistant capacity. Of course, {{it is important that}} impact load resistant capacity is clarified, if the possibility of acting of impact load including in natural disaster on corroded RC structures is dealt with. With a background like this, this paper describes an experimental investigation of the structural behavior of corroded RC beams. To be precise, in this study, RC beams with corroded reinforcement by using electrolytic corrosion method were made, and both of static loading test and <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> for those RC beams were conducted in order to clarify the static and impact load resistant capacity of them. As a result, we could get some findings. At first, through repeated impact tests (which has 1. 0 m/s impact velocity and a 100 kg steel weight), the number of impacts to the failure of corroded RC beams were less than half of healthy RC beams. It was also found that fracture pattern was completely different due to some axial cracks by corrosion. In addition, even though the corrosion rate is same level, the impact load resistant capacity reduce greatly compared to the static load resistant capacity because of the existence and pattern of cracks due to corrosion...|$|E
40|$|Rotational {{moulding}} {{is a low}} pressure, {{high temperature}} manufacturing method and {{is considered to be}} the best for making large hollow shape plastic parts. Due to its long heating cycle, mould rotation during heating and slow cooling rate, it is completely different from injection or other moulding processes. The mechanical properties of rotationally moulded plastics are totally dependent on unique heating or cooling cycles. With the growing demand for rotationally moulded plastics in load bearing and other applications, {{a better understanding of the}}ir fracture properties is essential. In the rotational moulding process, multilayer plastic products such as skin-foam-skin three layered sandwich structures can be manufactured in a single manufacturing step without any joints. It exhibits relatively high stiffness, strength-to-weight ratios and is used increasingly in various applications such as automotive and marine. During the lifetime of the sandwich material, it may face multiple or repeated impact events. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a better understanding of the fracture behaviour of rotationally moulded plastics in order to use them in skin-foam-skin sandwich structure and reduce in-service failures due to impact. Here, rotationally moulded two different commercially available Polyethylene (PE) and Polypropylene (PP) plastics are tested. Microstructural details of the plastics are investigated here. Fracture properties, particularly fracture toughness properties are studied using J-integral elastic-plastic fracture mechanics approach to identify the fracture initiation point. Impact properties are also investigated at a wide range of temperatures. PE materials are found to have better fracture properties. It is observed that with the fracture toughness plastic’s microstructure particularly crystal and amorphous region thickness are related. The understanding from these works is followed by the manufacture of rotationally moulded skin-foam–skin sandwich structure and testing of low velocity impact properties of this structure from 20 J to 100 J energy level with a drop weight impact testing machine. PE is used for both in skin and core layer and sandwich samples are manufactured at four different skin-core thickness combinations. Impact force resistance and bending stiffness are found to be increased with an increase of both skin and core layer thickness. Low velocity repeated impact properties of the rotationally moulded sandwich samples are also investigated from 20 J to 50 J energy level at the end of this project to understand the effect of repeated impact on the sandwich structure. The samples are subjected to single impact event repeatedly up-to penetration at each energy level.

The investigation, led by running quasi-static perforation <b>tests</b> and <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> outlined the better performance of [03 / 903]n laminates. Experimental results were analyzed through a macroscopic damage variable (damage index DI) and by microscopic observation and digitalized profiles of impacted specimens. The higher damage tolerance of [03 / 903]n laminates was found {{to depend on the}} capability of spreading the damage over a more extended area and of tolerating a higher permanent deflection.

40|$|A damage {{variable}} (damage degree DD) {{representing the}} ratio between the absorbed {{energy and the}} impact energy was introduced in 1998 by Belingardi and Vadori to assess damage accumulation caused by low velocity <b>impacts.</b> More recently, <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> carried out on thick laminates pointed out the significance and extent of the penetration process in thick laminates, which the DD is unable to monitor as, by definition, it reaches the value of one at penetration to remain unchanged over the entire penetration process. In the present paper, a new damage variable (damage index DI) is proposed to overcome shortcomings of the DD with respect to thick laminates. By introducing the displacement of the impactor into {{the definition of the}} DI, the depth of the penetration process is taken into account. Normalization by the displacement of the quasi-static perforation test allows for a non-dimensional damage variable which is shown to reach the value of one at perforation. Validity of the approach is proven against impact data obtained for different fibre-matrix architectures and laminate thickness. Results show that the DI can effectively differentiate between penetration and perforation thresholds, increasing monotonically within the range of the penetration process. In particular, the DI is shown to increase linearly with the impact energy up to penetration and to rise quite abruptly within the range of the penetration process. Results for <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> prove that at first the DI increases quite linearly impact after impact, owing to a steady accumulation of damage. A few impacts before penetration a sudden rise in the DI value points out a change in the rate of damage accumulation...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{laminated}} composites {{are spreading}} in engineering applications, respect to heavier metallic materials, {{thanks to their}} excellent advantages of weight/strength and weight/stiffness ratio. Even if up to now the attention was focused on fibers reinforced with thermosetting matrix, {{in the last years}} composites made with thermoplastic matrix have gained consideration. This is mainly due to their advantages in terms of low density and, more important, recyclability. The use of thermoplastics composites are of interest not only for the replace of the non structural parts, but also for the structural components located in areas potentially subjected to impacts. Depending on the design geometry and the field of application, some composite components may be subjected to <b>repeated</b> <b>impacts</b> at localised sites either during fabrication, routine maintenance activities or during service conditions. Even though the impact damage associated to the single impact event maybe slight, the accumulation of the damage over time may seriously impair the mechanical performance of the structure. In this paper, experimental data of <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> performed on fully thermoplastic thick laminates are presented. <b>Repeated</b> <b>impacts</b> at different energy levels are considered. The experimental data are analyzed evaluting the damage index (DI). This parameter has been previously defined and used for thermosetting composites in order to overcome shortcomings of the damage degree (DD) in case of thick composite laminates. The rate of initial steady damage accumulation as well as the onset of severe damage modes are analyzed and discussed in the paper. When applied to <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> the DI allows to distinguish between an initial steady phase of damage progression and the onset of severe damage mechanisms. For the initial damage, the damage index increases linearly with the impact number whereas the severe damage mechanisms lead to laminate performation in few impacts. In this work, the values of the DI at different stages are discussed: at first impact, in the steady phase and {{at the onset of the}} unsteady phase. Moreover, the total energy absorbed by the laminate in the steady phase is also computed for all the performed tests and compared with the results of other thermosetting composites previously tested by other researchers...|$|R

The laminate is intended for a nautical application and the manufacturing technique is vacuum infusion. In a first part of the work, four impact velocities (1. 566 m/s, 2. 215 m/s, 3. 132 m/s and 3. 836 m/s) were considered, and a minimum of four specimens for any given velocity were subjected to forty <b>repeated</b> <b>impacts</b> or up to perforation. The impact response was evaluated in terms of damage progression by visual observation of the impacted specimens, evolution of the peak force and of the bending stiffness with the number of impacts and by calculating the damage degree (ratio between the absorbed energy and the impact energy). In a second part of the work, additional single <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> were performed at 4. 429 m/s and 6. 264 m/s to investigate the laminate strain-rate sensitivity. <b>Repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> pointed out that the delamination area grows very rapidly in the first few impacts to then level off, following closely the behaviour of the bending stiffness against the number of impacts. The value of the peak force increases in the first few impacts due to compaction and strain-hardening of the resin with a related decrease of the damage degree.

40|$|Installed as the {{crosstie}} {{beam support}} in railway track systems, the prestressed concrete sleepers (or railroad ties) are designed {{in order to}} carry and transfer the wheel loads from the rails to the ground. It is nowadays best known that railway tracks {{are subject to the}} impact loading conditions, which are attributable to the train operations with either wheel or rail abnormalities such as flat wheels, dipped rails, etc. These loads are of very high magnitude but short duration, as well as there exists the potential of repeated load experience during the design life of the prestressed concrete sleepers. These have led to two main limit states for the design consideration: ultimate limit states under extreme impact and fatigue limit states under <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> loads. Prestressed concrete has played a significant role as to maintain the high endurance of the sleepers under low to moderate <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> loads. In spite of the most common use of the prestressed concrete sleepers in railway tracks, their impact responses and behaviours under the repetitions of severe impact loads are not deeply appreciated nor taken into the design consideration.

40|$|Pre-stressed {{concrete}} sleepers are {{the main}} components of railway track systems. To carry and transfer the dynamic wheel loads from the rails to the ground, their current design and construction are limited by allowable flexural stress constraints under service conditions. In current design practice for such a component, the dynamic load effects due to wheel/rail interactions are treated as a quasi-static load using a dynamic impact factor. Then, the allowable stresses eliminate a crack initiation. In reality, the impact events are frequently recorded because of the uncertainties of wheel or rail irregularities such as flat wheels and dipped rails. These effects cause cracking in the concrete sleepers, resulting in excessive maintenance. Limit states design philosophy for the pre-stressed concrete sleepers, containing ultimate and fatigue limit states, has been recently proposed based on structural reliability concept to rationalise the design method and minimise the maintenance. On the basis of probabilistic approach, the high-magnitude low-cycle fatigue limit states, which are more significant in terms of damage evolution, have been addressed in this article.

The maximum load bearing capacity is higher in case of monolithic aluminium but damage spread throughout the specimen, which contribute to the energy-absorbing capacity of these Al plates. In the case of GEAML and CEAML the damage is concentrated only at impact area hence lower energy-absorbing capacit...|$|R

The test program consisted of (i) falling weight <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> for {{the determination of the}} penetration energy and the influence of laminate construction on damage development and (ii) re-peated falling weight <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> for the determination of the impact fatigue lifetime and damage development under <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> conditions at sub-penetration energy levels. The objective of this work is to compare the impact behaviour of cross-ply laminates based on a brittle unsaturated polyester resin and a more ductile vinyl ester resin system and two types of glass reinforcement, i. e. woven- and multiaxial non-crimp fabric. The penetration energy of the various composite laminates appeared to be mainly influenced by the type of reinforcement, whereas damage development during (<b>repeated)</b> <b>impact</b> is strongly influenced by both fibre architecture and resin. No significant effect of the different material parameters investigated on the number of impacts to penetration (impact fatigue lifetime) is observed. Especially when the <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> energy is normalised with respect to the penetration energy, all laminates showed similar behaviour.

The present work is a comparison, at reduced scale in the centrifuge, of the response of two simplified pile groups: a 1 × 2 vertical piles and 1 × 2 pile group with one inclined pile. Two configurations are considered: end-bearing and floating pile group, both with pile heads rigidly fixed with a massive cap. First, repeatability tests under horizontal cyclic loading were performed on both floating pile groups. Secondly, <b>repeated</b> horizontal <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> were performed on both end-bearing pile groups. These <b>impact</b> <b>tests,</b> which highlight the influence of inclined piles on the inertial response of a group, are a first step for the more complex analysis of the performance of such groups under seismic loads where inertial and kinematic interactions are combined. The first part of this work revealed the influence of sand structure around the inclined pile tip on the repeatability of the tests performed on floating pile groups. The second part highlighted differences in the dynamic response between the two end-bearing pile groups through measurements of the pile cap acceleration, the bending moment profile and the axial load in the piles...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of new threats in recent conflicts, such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), requires the {{development of}} improved protection for US soldiers. The development of improved materials for helmets, in particular, is motivated by {{the social and economic}} costs of head injury. A versatile liner, adaptable to different types of helmets, with different constraints, would be useful. In this thesis, we first review the statistics related to head injuries from motor vehicle and recreational accidents and then describe {{the state of the art}} of current helmet design. An experimental study of the response of a widely used helmet liner material (polystyrene foam) and a new potential liner material (low-density, reticulated, elastomeric foam impregnated with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids) under impact shows some complementarities and leads to the concept of a composite material that would take advantage of the properties of the two materials. To conduct an extensive design analysis, comprehensive models are developed to model the behavior of each material under a wide range of impact energies. A complete model for the composite bilayer of the two materials is then compared to experimental data; the model gives a good description of the data. Using these results, three case studies are developed for a motorcycle helmet, a football helmet and a military helmet. The three case studies show a variety of constraints in term of thickness of the liner and impacting energies. Simulations are conducted using the models developed to indentify potential designs that would meet the requirement in term of peak linear acceleration (PLA) and in term of the specific constraints of each type of helmet. Finally, in an experimental study, some of the proposed designs are tested for repeated loading. The proposed designs enhance the level of protection in term of peak linear acceleration and show promising behavior under <b>repeated</b> <b>impact</b> <b>testing.</b> by Yves Matton. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Low-velocity (1. 2 - 2. 4 m/s) <b>repeated</b> drop weight <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> {{were carried}} out on {{advanced}} composites (glass, carbon, kevlar in epoxy matrix - LY 556, HT 972) using an instrumented <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> machine (DYNATUP 8250). The incident energies ranged from 3. 5 to 15 J (constant impactor mass 5. 42 kg). Number of drops to failure (Nf) data were obtained for the above with simultaneous recording of the load-time and energy-time traces. The extent of impact damage for glass and kevlar composites was interpreted using final delamination area maps (tracings). Results for all the three composites showed that {{with an increase in}} drop numbers, the peak load (PL) steadily decreased while the total energy (Et) increased, until failure. Also, as the incident energy (Ein) was varied in arithmetic progression, the number of drops to failure (Nf) varied in harmonic progression. Finally it was concluded that repeated drop tests with final delamination area maps assist in understanding the impact damage tolerance of polymer composite...|$|R

Research {{on the effect of}} an acute bout of soccer heading on brain function is not conclusive. Objective: To identify the effect of an acute bout of soccer heading on neuropsychological function and balance in athletes with a history of multiple concussions. Participants: Twenty-four NCAA Division I and III, and intramural athletes with a minimum of 4 years of competitive soccer experience composing 4 groups: subjects with a self-reported history of 1 - 2 concussions (EXP 1), subjects with a self-reported history of 3 or more concussions (EXP 2), and subjects with a self-reported history of 0 concussions randomly assigned to a control group (CON) and experimental group (EXP 0). Intervention(s) : During baseline testing, participants completed the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test,</b> the Balance Error Score System (BESS), and the concussion symptom checklist (CSC). During session two, subjects repeated the baseline testing, and then completed 20 purposeful headers in 20 minutes. Immediately, participants <b>repeated</b> the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test,</b> BESS test, and the CSC. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Neuropsychological function as measured by the (ImPACT), balance deficiencies (BESS test), and self-reported symptom score (CSC). Results: On BESS test 1 (dual stance, firm surface) EXP 2 had significantly (p=. 046) greater errors post-heading than the other groups. For BESS test 2 (single leg stance, firm surface) EXP 1 and EXP 2 had significantly (p=. 008) elevated scores both pre- and post-heading. On BESS test 3 (tandem stance, firm surface), test 4 (dual stance, foam surface), test 5 (single-leg stance, foam surface), and test 6 (tandem stance, foam surface) EXP 2 had significantly (p=. 001) more errors both pre- and post-heading than the other groups. No significant results were found on ImPACT scores. All groups had significantly (p=. 025) higher CSC post-heading scores. Conclusions: This study found no significance between pre- and post-heading in any groups on the BESS <b>test,</b> <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test,</b> and the CSC. The EXP 2 group performed worse overall on the more challenging BESS tests, but their scores did not significantly worsen as was hypothesized.

40|$|In many industries, {{handling}} or {{processing of}} relatively fragile particles takes place and predictions are required whether {{a significant proportion}} of the particles will be damaged. These processes have been designed and controlled {{solely on the basis of}} particle size and shape. Another parameter that needs to be introduced is particle strength. The stringent environmental laws demand improved particle mechanical quality, which has given rise to the need for a more accurate and fundamental particle strength measurement and its application in modelling and control of particulate processes. Particles need to show good resistance against static and dynamic loads. The present paper deals with the study of breakage behaviour of different enzyme granules subjected to <b>repeated</b> <b>impacts</b> using a new instrument developed at the Delft University of Technology. The <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> involves bombarding the particles against a flat target repeatedly. The main feature of this new test is its ability to impact a large number of particles against a flat target repeatedly, and generate extremely reproducible results. Testing a large number of particles has the advantage of producing statistically correct results. The <b>repeated</b> <b>impacts</b> provide information on the breakage behaviour of the particles based on their history. In the new <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> enzyme granules can undergo very low impact velocities of the order of 5 m s 1. These low impact velocities lead to attrition and chipping of the granules. The current paper presents preliminary results on the breakage behaviour of the new <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> and its basic advantages over already existing tests. Furthermore, experiments were performed on enzyme granules, and the breakage mechanisms determined, depending on the change in size and shape of the particles...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} {{external}} hip protectors {{are available on}} the market but no standards for their performance exist and it is unknown if their properties change after <b>repeated</b> fall <b>impacts.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if protective properties change in different types of new (unused) hip protectors after repeated, simulated falls. Five hip protector brands were chosen to represent different products available on the market and the two mechanisms employed in reducing the force of an impact (shunting or absorbing). Ten pairs of each type (20 pads for each brand) were tested using a 1. 8 -m Instron Dynatup 9250 HV vertical <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> tower. The <b>impact</b> <b>testing</b> system was specifically designed for this study by creating a simulated trochanter to provide more accurately a impact area similar to that of a real hip bone. The hip protectors were impacted once a day for 3 consecutive days. <b>Repeated</b> <b>impacts</b> demonstrated the pads’ decreased ability to either absorb or shunt force in all types of hip protectors. However, the mean forces were still in the protective range (force below fracture threshold of 3100 N) for 3 of the 5 brands <b>tested</b> after 3 <b>impacts.</b> The protective properties of external hip protectors do degrade after <b>repeated</b> <b>impacts.</b> The degree of degradation differs from brand to brand. Regardless of type, most pads were still able to bring the force of impact below the fracture threshold of 3100 N. Future studies need to address the issue of durability of different types/brands of hip protectors after repeated laundering and fall impacts to determine when should they be replaced. Additionally, a national or international standard needs to be developed against which the performance of different brands of hip protectors can be compared...|$|R
