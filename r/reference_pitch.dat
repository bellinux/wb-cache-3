2500|$|In {{classical}} music, {{there is}} a longstanding tradition to tune [...] "by ear", by adjusting the pitch of instruments to a <b>reference</b> <b>pitch.</b> In an orchestra, the oboe player gives a 440Hz [...] "A", and the different instrument sections tune to this note. In chamber music, either one of the woodwind players gives an [...] "A", or if none is present, one of the string players, usually the first violinist, bows his or her open [...] "A" [...] string. If an orchestra is accompanying a piano concerto, the first oboist takes the [...] "A" [...] from the piano and then plays this pitch {{for the rest of}} the orchestra (a somewhat unscientific procedure, but consecrated by longstanding usage).|$|E

This paper describes new techniques for generating speaker-dependent pitch contours for particular short sentences.

The proposed algorithms starts with pitch tracking for both reference and target speakers. And then modifies <b>reference</b> speaker’s <b>pitch</b> according to target speaker’s pitch by using different techniques proposed in the algorithms. In both the algorithms, statistics are used to form a mapping function from a <b>reference</b> speaker’s <b>pitch</b> frequency to the appropriate value for a second speaker...|$|R

50|$|Tuning is {{the process}} of {{adjusting}} the pitch of one or many tones from musical instruments to establish typical intervals between these tones. Tuning is usually based on a fixed reference, such as A = 440 Hz. Out of tune refers to a pitch/tone that is either too high (sharp) or too low (flat) in relation to a given <b>reference</b> <b>pitch.</b> While an instrument might be in tune relative to its own range of notes, it may not be considered 'in tune' if it does not match A = 440 Hz (or whatever <b>reference</b> <b>pitch</b> one might be using). Some instruments become 'out of tune' with damage or time and must be readjusted or repaired.|$|E
5000|$|Tremolo harmonicas are {{a type of}} harmonica, {{distinct}} {{by having}} two reeds per note. In a tremolo harmonica the two reeds are tuned slightly off a <b>reference</b> <b>pitch,</b> one slightly sharp and the other slightly flat. This gives a unique wavering or warbling sound created by the two reeds being not exactly in tune {{with each other and}} difference in their subsequent waveforms acting against one another. The degree of beating can be varied depending on the desired effect. Instruments where the beating is faster due to the reeds being farther apart from the <b>reference</b> <b>pitch</b> are called [...] "wet", whereas those where the beating is slower and less noticeable due to the reeds being more closely in tune are called [...] "dry".|$|E
50|$|Functional pitch {{recognition}} {{has several}} strengths. Since {{a large body}} of music is tonal, the technique is widely applicable. Since <b>reference</b> <b>pitches</b> are not required, music may be broken up by complex and difficult to analyze pitch clusters, for example, a percussion sequence, and pitch analysis may resume immediately once an easier to identify pitch is played, for example, by a trumpet—no need {{to keep track of the}} last note of the previous line or solo nor any need to keep track of a series of intervals going back all the way to the start of a piece. Since the function of pitch classes is a key element, the problem of compound intervals with interval recognition is not an issue—whether the notes in a melody are played within a single octave or over many octaves is irrelevant.|$|R

25|$|Electric {{guitar and}} {{electric}} bass players who perform concerts may use electronic tuners built into an effects pedal, often called a stomp box. These tuners have a rugged metal or heavy-duty plastic housing and a foot-operated switch to toggle between the tuner and a bypass mode. Professional guitarists may use {{a more expensive}} version of the LED tuner mounted in a rack-mount case with a larger range of LEDs for more accurate pitch display. Many models let the user select <b>reference</b> <b>pitches</b> other than A440. On many electronic tuners, the user can select a different note—useful for, for example, dropping a guitar's tuning to a lower pitch (e.g., Dropped tuning). Some models are adjustable standards other than A=440. This is useful to some Baroque musicians who play period instruments at lower reference pitches—such as A=435. Some higher-priced electronic tuners support tuning {{to a range of}} different temperaments—a feature useful to some guitarists and harpsichord players.|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a study of melodic {{expectancy}} in North Sami yoiks, a style of music quite distinct from Western tonal music. Three different approaches were taken. The ®rst approach was a statistical style analysis of tones in a representative corpus of 18 yoiks. The analysis determined the relative frequencies of tone onsets and two- and three-tone transitions. It also identi®ed style characteristics, such as pentatonic orientation, the presence of two <b>reference</b> <b>pitches,</b> the frequency of large consonant intervals, and a relatively large set of possible melodic continuations. The second approach was a behavioral experiment in which listeners made judgments about melodic continuations. Three groups of listeners participated. One group was from the Sami culture, the second group consisted of Finnish music students who had learned some yoiks, and the third group consisted of Western musicians unfamiliar with yoiks. Expertise was associated with stronger veridical expectations (for the correct next tone) than schematic expectations (based on general style characteristics). Familiarity with the particular yoiks was found to compensate for lack of experience with the musical culture. The third approach simulated melodic expectancy with neural network models of the self...|$|R

40|$|Absolute Pitch (AP) is {{the ability}} to {{identify}} or produce isolated tones in the absence of contextual cues or <b>reference</b> <b>pitches.</b> While AP is thought to differ from other human abilities in its bimodal distribution (Takeuchi & Hulse, 1993) – either you have it or you do not – recent evidence suggests that memory for absolute pitch in a melody is actually widespread (Schellenberg & Trehub, 2003). In the current project the Dutch collection of historic audio recordings, Onder de Groene Linde (Grijp, 2008), is used as a source to explore the potential role of AP in the memory of songs transmitted in oral traditions. Since the melodies in this database are grouped by tune family and are available as sound files, they can serve as empirical support for the Absolute Pitch Memory (APM) hypothesis, predicting that these tunes are memorized and transmitted over time and geographical location based on their absolute pitch height. To this end, between- and within-tune family analyses were performed. In the between-tune family analysis, two tune families showed significant inter-recording tonic pitch consistency. The within-tune family analysis further substantialized that effect, while controlling for possible factors of variance such as gender, geographical origin, and lyrics. Together, the results are taken as empirical support that APM plays {{a significant role in the}} oral transmission of folksongs...|$|R
