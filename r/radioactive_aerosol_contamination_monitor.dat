40|$|Removal of charged {{aerosols}} {{from the}} atmosphere and indoor environments is investigated numerically. Calculations are performed on charged aerosol deposition assuming realistic charge distributions. Effects of ion asymmetry and number concentration of aerosols are investigated using numerical models and the ion asymmetry is {{found to have a}} significant effect on aerosol deposition. Deposition calculations are extended to charged distributions typical of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols.</b> Electrical effects on deposition of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> are found to depend principally on the <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol's</b> decay rate and number concentration. Scavenging is a mechanism for aerosol removal near clouds. Numerical methods are developed to quantify the scavenging removal of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> when their charging is significant. Electrical image forces are found to be important. Charging of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> is found to have significant effects on their collision efficiency. The collision efficiency depends on their charge, and therefore the aerosol's decay rate and number concentration, but it does not depend on the charge carried by water drops. Scavenging coefficients are calculated for <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols,</b> which are known to carry appreciable charges. The collision efficiency calculations are extended to collection of contact ice nuclei by supercooled droplets in clouds. It is found that the sensitivity of collision efficiency to modest charges on aerosol particles is sufficient to increase freezing rates of droplets by contact nucleation, and is shown to be comparable with temperature-dependent changes in freezing properties typically found in the atmosphere.

40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} {{the necessity of}} using sterile water in humidifiers for avoiding respiratory tract infections during nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) therapy. Methods:Water in a convection-type humidifier (Sirius; Heinen and Löwenstein GmbH; Bad Ems, Germany) was labeled with 99 mTc-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid. Low-flow (2 L/min, 4 L/min, or 6 L/min) and high-flow (31 to 46 L/min) rates were applied, rates typical for nCPAP. Heat and moisture exchange filters were placed behind {{the start of the}} tube to measure any <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol.</b> Results: We demonstrated that no <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> were produced, either with low or high flows. Conclusions: The convection-type humidifier produces water vapor but does not aerosolize the water. We conclude that bacteria, other microorganisms, or even solutes that may be contained in the water cannot be transported into the air and thus will not be deposited in the lung. In order to avoid respiratory tract infections, sterile water is not required, at least in this particular humidifier. We suggest that nonsterile tap water is probably a safe alternative.

40|$|The work {{carried out}} over a 2 1 / 2 -yr period on the {{scavenging}} of radioactive particles which might be released by the reactor system of a nuclear- powered ship is summarized. Two types of dispersions were considered: <b>aerosols</b> and hydrosols. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> were scavenged by heterogeneous coagulation with solid and liquid aerosols produced within the <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol</b> cloud. Liquid or highly hygroscopic particles, which can be classified as solid particles with liquld films on their surfaces, {{were found to be}} the most effective scavengers. A system of fine water spray and hydrolysis products of silicon tetrafluoride was found to be suitable for field application. Scavenging of radioactive cations, anions, and colloids of corrosion and fission products was studied in substitute ocean water, natural ocean water, and natural harbor water. A scavenging system composed of KMnO/sub 4 / and ferrous salts successfully removed most of the radioisotopes.

40|$|The {{determination}} of the shape and rising velocity of gas bubbles in a liquid pool is of great importance in analyzing the <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol</b> emissions from nuclear power plant accidents {{in terms of the}} fission product release rate and the pool scrubbing efficiency of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols.</b> This article suggests a simple parameterization for the gas bubble rising velocity {{as a function of the}} volume-equivalent bubble diameter; this parameterization does not require prior knowledge of bubble shape. This is more convenient than previously suggested parameterizations because it is given as a single explicit formula. It is also shown that a bubble shape diagram, which is very similar to the Grace's diagram, can be easily generated using the parameterization suggested in this article. Furthermore, the boundaries among the three bubble shape regimes in the Eo–Re plane and the condition for the bypass of the spheroidal regime can be delineated directly from the parameterization formula. Therefore, the parameterization suggested in this article appears to be useful not only in easily determining the bubble rising velocity (e. g., in postulated severe accident analysis codes) but also in understanding the trend of bubble shape change due to bubble growth...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} DOE facilities, {{such as the}} Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), use alpha-particle {{environmental}} continuous air monitors (ECAMs) to monitor air for unwanted releases of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> containing such materials as plutonium and uranium. High sensitivity, ease of operation, and lack of false alarms are all important for ECAMs. The object {{of the project was}} to conduct investigations to improve operation of ECAMs, particularly under conditions where a lot of nonradioactive dust may be deposited on the filters (conditions of high dust loading). The presence of such dust may increase the frequency with which filters must be changed and can lead to an increased incidence of false alarms due to deteriorated energy resolution and response specificity to the radionuclides of interest. A major finding of the investigation, not previously documented, was that under many conditions thick layers of underlying nonradioactive dust do not decrease energy resolution and specificity for target radionuclides if the <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosol</b> arrives as a sudden thin burst deposit, as commonly occurs in the early-warning alarm mode. As a result, operators of ECAMs may not need to change filters as often as previously thought and have data upon which to base more reliable operating procedures...|$|R

In this paper, modeling results of radiation doses during {{the dismantling of the}} pressurized tank from the emergency core cooling system (ECCS PT) of RBMK- 1500 reactor are presented. The radiological surveys indicate that the inner surface of the ECCS PT is contaminated with radioactive products of corrosion and sediments due to the radioactive water. The effective doses to the workers have been modeled for different strategies of ECCS PT dismantling. In order to select the optimal personnel radiation safety, the modeling has been performed by the means of computer code “VISIPLAN 3 D ALARA Planning tool” developed by SCK CEN (Belgium). The impacts of dismantling tools, shielding types, and extract ventilation flow rate on effective doses during the dismantling of ECCS PT have been analyzed. The total effective personnel doses have been obtained by summarizing the effective personnel doses from various sources of exposure, that is, direct radiation from radioactive equipment, internal radiation due to inhalation of <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols,</b> and direct radiation from <b>radioactive</b> <b>aerosols</b> arising during hot cutting in premises.

40|$|Dental {{healthcare}} workers (DHCWs) are at {{high risk}} of occupational exposure to droplets and aerosol particles emitted from patients' mouths during treatment. We evaluated the effectiveness of an air cleaner in reducing droplet and <b>aerosol</b> <b>contamination</b> by positioning the device in four different locations in an actual dental clinic. We applied computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to solve the governing equations of airflow, energy and dispersion of different-sized airborne droplets/aerosol particles. In a dental clinic, we measured the supply air velocity and temperature of the ventilation system, the airflow rate and the particle removal efficiency of the air cleaner to determine the boundary conditions for the CFD simulations. Our results indicate that use of an air cleaner in a dental clinic may be an effective method for reducing DHCWs' exposure to airborne droplets and aerosol particles. Further, we found that the probability of droplet/aerosol particle removal and the direction of airflow from the cleaner are both important control measures for droplet and <b>aerosol</b> <b>contamination</b> in a dental clinic. Thus, the distance between the air cleaner and droplet/aerosol particle source as well as the relative location of the air cleaner to both the source and the DHCW are important considerations for reducing DHCWs' exposure to droplets/aerosol particles emitted from the patient's mouth during treatments...|$|R
