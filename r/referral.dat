30|$|Inadequate <b>referrals</b> {{and failing}} to {{communicate}} sufficient information may also {{explain some of the}} differences [13 – 15]. The quality of <b>referrals</b> varies, and several studies have shown that <b>referrals</b> do not adhere to guidelines [16]. Often, they do not include sufficient clinical information for the radiologist and radiographer to assess the degree of justification [13]. This also might explain some the difference in estimated proportion of <b>referrals</b> most unlikely to affect treatment and reasons for such <b>referrals.</b> Inadequate <b>referrals</b> make it more demanding and time-consuming for the radiologist to prioritise <b>referrals</b> as well as to interpret and report. Hence, the quality of the radiologist’s work may suffer from inadequate <b>referrals.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background—Direct {{access to}} the {{coronary}} care unit (CCU) for general practitioner (GP) referred cases of suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (fast track admission) substantially reduces the time to thrombolysis. Until now, this policy has been confined to GP <b>referrals.</b>  Objectives—To determine the time taken to admission to CCU under the fast track policy (ambulance <b>referrals</b> and GP <b>referrals)</b> and the time taken to start administration of thrombolytics (ambulance <b>referrals,</b> GP <b>referrals,</b> and accident and emergency <b>referrals).</b>  Methods—Fast track admission policy was extended to include <b>referrals</b> from ambulance personnel who respond to emergency service calls. Ambulance personnel referred cases were also examined {{to see if they}} were referred appropriately to the CCU.  Results— 100 ambulance personnel <b>referrals</b> and 260  GP <b>referrals</b> to CCU with chest pain were studied. Forty accident and emergency <b>referrals</b> who had AMI requiring thrombolysis were also studied. In the ambulance referred group the time to admission from phone call was a median of 10  minutes (range 2  to 45), a saving of 30  minutes compared with GP <b>referrals</b> (median 40  minutes, range 2  to 217). The median diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) to thrombolysis time was longer in the accident and emergency <b>referrals</b> with AMI than either ambulance <b>referrals</b> or GP <b>referrals</b> admitted under the fast track policy. Diagnostic ECG to thrombolysis time: accident and emergency 50  minutes (range 15  to 385); ambulance <b>referrals</b> median 33  minutes (range 6  to 69); GP <b>referrals</b> median 29. 5  minutes (range 5  to 110  minutes); (p =  0. 056 accident and emergency compared with ambulance <b>referrals,</b> p <  0. 002 accident and emergency compared with GP <b>referrals).</b> Of 100  ambulance <b>referrals</b> 52  patients exhibited symptoms suggestive of ischaemic heart disease (confirmed AMI, unstable angina, and angina) and a further 18  patients were required to stay in CCU for other cardiac problems. Thus a total of 70  (70 %) were considered appropriate compared with 155  of 260  (55. 8 %) GP referred cases.  Conclusions—Extending the fast track admission policy to ambulance personnel reduces delay to admission for patients with suspected MI without adversely affecting the appropriateness of admissions.    Keywords: direct admission to coronary care;  time to thrombolysis;  ambulance personne...|$|R
5|$|Hospices: While late <b>referral</b> to hospice is a {{much more}} {{prevalent}} problem than early <b>referral,</b> some hospice providers will hesitate to admit patients to hospice (or they may de-certify them from hospice too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on hospice too long. After a patient has been on hospice for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the hospice for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{child and adolescent}} <b>referrals</b> to psychiatric child and youth clinics are associated with ethnicity and neighbourhood of residence. Four sources of <b>referrals</b> are examined: family <b>referrals,</b> social/legal agency <b>referrals,</b> school <b>referrals</b> and health/mental health <b>referrals.</b> <b>Referrals</b> of 2054 children aged 11 - 19 from the Stockholm Child-Psychiatric Database were studied using multilevel logistic regression. Results indicate the importance of ethnicity for child and adolescent <b>referrals</b> to psychiatric child and youth clinics. Family <b>referrals</b> were more common among children and adolescents of Swedish background than among those of immigrant background. <b>Referrals</b> by social/legal agencies were more common among children and adolescents of African and Asian background, while children of Asian or South American background {{were more likely to}} have been referred by schools or by the health/mental health care sector. A significant neighbourhood effect was found only in relation to family <b>referrals</b> (i. e. it was more likely to be referred to psychiatric child and youth clinics by the family in some neighbourhoods than in other neighbourhoods). These 45 findings have significant implications for the design and evaluation of community mental health outreach programs and should be considered when developing strategies intended to help children and adolescents with mental health problems.

40|$|Large, urban {{tertiary}} care hospitals often acquire outlying community hospitals.

We compare changes in <b>referrals</b> of patients from target market areas to changes in a matched set of control markets. We find that roughly 30 percent of the vertical acquisitions resulted in a significant increase in <b>referrals</b> to the acquirer. Very few acquisitions were followed by decreases in <b>referrals.</b> When acquisitions did lead to increased <b>referrals,</b> the effect was usually largest for patients with more remunerative insurance and patients undergoing more profitable procedures.

When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's <b>referral</b> for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical <b>referral</b> and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of a proactive school-wide discipline plan on office discipline <b>referrals,</b> and as a predictor of incidents of chronic disciplinary <b>referrals.</b> The study examined two consecutive school years, 2007 - 2008 and 2008 - 2009, with 2007 - 2008 being the control group without a school-wide discipline plan, and 2008 - 2009 the treatment group with a school-wide discipline plan in place for a full academic year. The purpose was to determine if there would be a statistically significant decrease in the number of office discipline <b>referrals</b> and the number of office discipline <b>referrals</b> which resulted in In-School or Out of School suspension. The study also demonstrated through Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s product-moment correlation coefficient regression if academic achievement was a predictor of incidents of chronic office disciplinary <b>referrals</b> which may contribute to future behavioral issues and the need for secondary intervention. The hypotheses stated there would not be a significant difference in the number of office <b>referrals</b> and the number of office discipline <b>referrals</b> which result in In-School Suspension and/or Out-of-School Suspension, and students with two or more office discipline <b>referrals</b> would not be significantly different than other students in terms of academic achievement. A dependent t-test showed there were significantly more office discipline <b>referrals</b> and office discipline <b>referrals</b> which resulted in In-School or Out of School suspensions in 2008 - 2009 than in 2007 - 2008. Using Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation, a negative correlation was found between academic achievement and number of office discipline <b>referrals.</b> As academic achievement decreased the number of office discipline <b>referrals</b> increased.

40|$|Discipline {{and drug}} abuses {{were rated as}} the number one and two top {{problems}} facing schools {{in the last two}} decades and must be improved. There is serious doubt cognitive experiences alone will solve or decrease the rate at which these are causing the increased dropout rates. Interscholastic athletic programs perceived in many instances as costly frills could be, in fact, a large part of the solution to many of the problems that are invading schools today (Smith, 1994). Wes-Del High School is a rural, central Indiana school of 302 students in grades 9 - 12. The school was selected for the study of the effect of athletic participation on high school discipline for the 1998 - 99 school year. The goal of this study is to investigate if there is statistical data to support if athletic participation has an effect on high school discipline. Discipline <b>referrals</b> were coded and broken down according to non-athlete <b>referrals</b> compared to athlete <b>referrals.</b> The number of male athlete <b>referrals</b> and female athlete <b>referrals</b> was also evaluated. Records were kept of when most athletes' <b>referrals</b> occurred and by what sport or specific teams. Based on data collected from this study, athletes were less likely to have received discipline <b>referrals</b> by a two to one ratio compared to non-athletes. The study also concluded that female athletes received significantly less of the total discipline <b>referrals</b> than male athletes. Females received 25 % of the total discipline <b>referrals</b> compared to 75 % of the total discipline <b>referrals</b> received by male athletes. In this study, there was evidence that supported female athletes received less discipline <b>referrals</b> in-season than out-of-season but, male athletes received more discipline <b>referrals</b> in-season than out-of-season. The results of the study provide evidence that schools should be encouraged to evaluate the benefits of athletic participation on school discipline. School of Physical EducationThesis (M. A. ...|$|R
5|$|On 24 April 1999, Kouao and Victoria Climbié left France and {{travelled}} to the United Kingdom, {{where they}} settled in Ealing, west London. They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she {{paid no attention to}} them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of habitual residence. Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the <b>referral</b> across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton <b>referral</b> and assessment team.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the appropriateness of}} <b>referrals</b> of high-risk pregnancies in the basic healthcare network of Sobral, in Ceará, Brazil. Methods: A descriptive quantitative study. The medical files of 173 pregnant patients referred to the high-risk outpatient clinic of Centro de Especialidades Médicas of Sobral, {{during the period from}} July 2006 to April 2007, were analyzed. Variables analyzed were correctness of the <b>referrals,</b> professionals who made them, causes and origins of the <b>referrals,</b> and age bracket of the patients referred. The <b>referrals</b> were divided into “appropriate” and “inappropriate”, according to the classification of risk established by the technical manual of the Ministry of Health. Rresults: Of the 173 cases, 102 (59 %) were considered appropriate/correct, and 71 (41 %) <b>referrals</b> were considered inappropriate/incorrect. The <b>referrals</b> were divided according to the professional class of the referring individuals: physicians or nurses. Of the 173 <b>referrals,</b> 49 (28. 3 %) were made by physicians, and 124 (71. 7 %) by nurses. Of the 49 patients referred by physicians, 39 (79. 6 %) were considered correct.
