25|$|The Brikken had a Farman style fixed undercarriage, {{with two}} wheels {{on each side}} on short axles {{attached}} {{at right angles to}} skids, upturned at the front. The front end of each skid was mounted on a single <b>raked</b> <b>strut</b> to the wing and the rear by a transverse V-pair with its upper ends below the aft inner and second interplane struts, further braced with wires, resulting in a wide track.|$|R
50|$|A Class E viaduct 29 ft {{high and}} 114 ft long on two dwarf piers. The fans {{consisted}} of two <b>raking</b> <b>struts</b> {{on either side of}} the track, tied beneath the track by cross braces, and a central pair of struts which were joined at the top as an inverted V; from the side this gave a \|/ fan. It was demolished after the line was diverted to a more inland alignment on 19 May 1908.|$|R
50|$|Both gables have <b>raking</b> <b>struts,</b> and collars; {{both have}} wavy bargeboards and finials {{probably}} of 1885; left gable has ex situ datestone lettered ER , right has 1654. similar datestone lettered TR Large modern casements at ground C 1885. floor of centre and of right wing, otherwise one replacement sliding sash on each floor (all 3 lights except centre which is 4); close to front corner of left return wall of left wing is a 1st floor 3-light window with diamond-section wooden mullions.|$|R
50|$|The older single-depth portion has two bays on {{the ground}} floor and a front corridor, a plain doorway and two-light {{casement}} window. Its first floor has square-panelled timber-framing which may originally have been jettied over the ground floor which is now rebuilt in brick. The upper storey has three wooden mullion windows with leaded glazing. Over the central window is a jettied gable with a king post and <b>raked</b> <b>struts</b> and on the ridge is a bellcote. The wing has a gabled stair-turret and there is a large sandstone chimney stack with a brick top on the gable wall.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was a low-wing monoplane of mainly wooden construction. The wire-braced wings were {{of an unusual}} elliptical layout, with the maximum chord and thickness at mid-span on each side, tapering in towards the root. The two box-spars and the spruce ribs were of [...] spruce, covered with thin mahogany sheet overlaid with silk. The rear of the elliptical section fuselage was also wooden, being a monocoque construction with two layers of mahogany veneer applied over a frame of spruce formers and stringers. The forward section was built from steel tubing, covered with duralumin panels. The exposed cylinders were covered by streamlined helmets to minimise drag while admitting enough air to cool the engine, the helmet of the uppermost cylinder being continued back as a fairing which incorporated the windscreen and pilot's headrest. The twin floats, made of duralumin, were each carried {{on a pair of}} streamline section <b>raked</b> <b>struts,</b> braced by wires.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{aircraft}} were two-bay tractor biplanes with low-dihedral parallel-chord unstaggered wings with rounded ends, using wing warping for roll control. The fuselage was {{a rectangular}} section fabric-covered [...] wire-braced structure, {{within which the}} pilot occupied the aft cockpit behind the wings and the observer the forward cockpit, this arrangement being adopted so that the aircraft could be flown without a passenger without affecting the aircraft's centre of gravity. Behind the pilot a curved top decking extended aft to the tail. The tail surfaces consisted of a half-oval horizontal stabiliser with a split elevator mounted above the upper longerons and an ovoid rudder hinged to the sternpost. There was no fixed vertical fin. The main undercarriage consisted {{of a pair of}} skids each carried on an inverted V-strut at their rear and a single <b>raked</b> <b>strut</b> at the front: an axle carrying the wheels was bound to the skids by bungee cords and restrained by radius rods. A sprung tailskid was fitted and the wings were protected by semicircular skids beneath the lower wings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first two}} B.E. {{aircraft}} were flown {{within a month}} {{of each other and}} had the same basic design, the work of Geoffrey de Havilland, who was at the time both the chief designer and the test pilot at the Balloon Factory. The layout of these aircraft has come {{to be seen as a}} conventional design, but when it first appeared this was not the case. Rather, with the contemporary Avro 500, it was one of the designs which established the tractor biplane as the dominant aircraft layout for a considerable time. On its first public appearance Flight wrote that [...] "everything one could see of the machine was of singular interest".

40|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} drag of three surface-piercing uirtapered struts at approximately 0 Â° angle of yaw was determined at depths up to 6 chords for {{speeds up to}} 80 fps at various angles of <b>rake.</b> Tvo <b>struts</b> had NACA 66 ^- 012 airfoil sections, one with a 4 -inch chord {{and the other with}} an 8 -inch chord. The third strut had an NACA 66 ^- 021 airfoil section and a 4 -inch chord. The section drag coefficient was determined from plots of drag u. gy. -Liisi, uc^iol Uvci one jail range of Reynolds number where wind-tunnel data were available for comparison, the tank data, at subcavitation speeds, were in good agreement with wind-tunnel results. Raking the struts changed the section drag coefficient as expected because of the change in effective thickness ratio that resulted from raking. The drag coefficient due to the drag at the surface intersection was approximately constant at Froude numbers above 8. 0 and at subcavitation speeds. Within the speed range investigated, no surface ventilation was observed for any of the struts. The inception of cavxtation was noted at a speed higher than that predicted from two-dimensional-flow theory. This difference was probably due to the influence of the free-water surface on the pressure distribution...|$|R
