5000|$|<b>Rate</b> <b>distortion</b> {{theory has}} been applied to {{choosing}} k called the [...] "jump" [...] method, which determines the number of clusters that maximizes efficiency while minimizing error by information-theoretic standards. The strategy of the algorithm is to generate a distortion curve for the input data by running a standard clustering algorithm such as k-means for all values of k between 1 and n, and computing the distortion (described below) of the resulting clustering. The distortion curve is then transformed by a negative power chosen based on the dimensionality of the data. Jumps in the resulting values then signify reasonable choices for k, with the largest jump representing the best choice.|$|E

In this paper, a general model-based solution is proposed as an attempt to solve this problem.

Additionally, the forger may compress the forgery for stor-age or transmission, which introduces a tradeoff between data <b>rate</b> and <b>distortion.</b> In this paper, we define a measure of an anti-forensic technique’s effectiveness which we call concealability and examine the tradeoff between concealability, <b>rate,</b> and <b>distortion.</b> We then characterize the concealability-rate-distortion (C-R-D) surface for double JPEG compression anti-forensics.
