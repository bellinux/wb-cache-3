25|$|Avalanches and {{avalanche}} paths {{share common}} elements: a start zone where the avalanche originates, a track along which the avalanche flows, and a <b>runout</b> zone where the avalanche comes to rest. The debris deposit is the accumulated {{mass of the}} avalanched snow once {{it has come to}} rest in the <b>runout</b> zone. For the image at left, many small avalanches form in this avalanche path every year, but most of these avalanches do not run the full vertical or horizontal length of the path. The frequency with which avalanches form in a given area is known as the return period.|$|E

40|$|In 1995, catastrophic {{avalanches}} inundated {{the northwestern}} Iceland towns of Flateyri and Súðavík killing 34 people. To reduce {{the possibility of}} another trag-edy, the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) has since increased involvement in avalanche forecasting, evacuations, and hazard zoning for avalanche prone communities around Iceland. A GIS database is currently in development that catalogues both recent and historical avalanche events. As shown in the 1995 accidents, historical avalanches are not sufficient to determine the boundaries of hazardous areas. While past avalanches can concretely delimit hazardous areas, a lack of recorded avalanche activity does not render an area “safe”. Terrain analy-sis in conjunction with math models can predict possible avalanche <b>runouts</b> that extend beyond historical limits. By determining extreme <b>runouts,</b> boundaries of hazard areas can be defined even when records of past avalanches are limited or nonexistent. At the IMO, GIS is used to record avalanche events, analyze ava-lanche paths, show results from model calculations, and ultimately to plot hazard zones...|$|R
40|$|Steepland valleys {{are prone}} to episodic debris flows, which are flowing {{mixtures}} of rock and water. Debate continues about whether debris flow valley incision is adequately represented by modified fluvial incision laws (e. g., stream power law) that predict power laws of drainage area against valley slope. Using {{a wide range of}} topography from debris flow-prone temperate steeplands in the U. S and around the world, I find that inverse fluvial power laws (straight lines on log-log plots) rarely extend to valley slopes greater than ~ 0. 03 to 0. 10, values below which debris flows rarely travel. Instead, with decreasing drainage area the rate of increase in slope declines, leading to a curved relationship on a log-log plot of slope against drainage area. This curved relation is found along recent debris flow <b>runouts</b> in the U.

This equalled the second highest score off a single over in Test matches. Harbhajan had some small measure of revenge however, taking the catch that dismissed Afridi for 103. Wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal also scored a century, the fastest ever by a wicketkeeper, and Pakistan declared immediately thereafter with a mammoth total of 679 for 7.|$|E
25|$|As an {{avalanche}} moves down a slope it follows a certain pathway that {{is dependent on}} the slope's degree of steepness and the volume of snow/ice involved in the mass movement. The origin of {{an avalanche}} is called the Starting Point and typically occurs on a 30–45 degree slope. The body of the pathway is called the Track of the avalanche and usually occurs on a 20–30 degree slope. When the avalanche loses its momentum and eventually stops it reaches the <b>Runout</b> Zone. This usually occurs when the slope has reached a steepness that is less than 20 degrees. These degrees are not consistently true {{due to the fact that}} each avalanche is unique depending on the stability of the snowpack that it was derived from as well as the environmental or human influences that triggered the mass movement.|$|E

25|$|Shane Bond {{took three}} wickets {{in his first}} six overs in his first Test match for a year, and Sri Lanka were bowled out for 154 with only Tharanga and Chamara Kapugedera passing 20. In reply, New Zealand trailed by 41 with six wickets in hand, but Daniel Vettori's half-century helped score 206 against a Muttiah Muralitharan-led bowling attack. Murali took four for 65 from 34 overs, while Chaminda Vaas took two wickets in an over and ended with three for 49. The second time around, Kumar Sangakkara made an unbeaten century from number three, {{out of a total}} of 170. After {{completing}} an easy single to complete Sangakkara's century Muralitharan walked down the pitch to celebrate while the ball was being returned to the wicketkeeper. McCullum then appealed for a <b>runout</b> and Muralitharan was dismissed, ending Sri Lanka's second innings. After the match Jayawardene expressed the Sri Lankan team's disappointment about the incident, saying it was contrary to the spirit of the game, but Fleming and McCullum were unrepentant. New Zealand managed to reach the modest target of 118 to win the game, despite a mini-collapse.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{elected to}} field on a wet wicket in the Fourth Test at Headingley. Miller {{dismissed}} Edrich and Graveney {{and ended with}} 2/39 from 28overs as England were bowled out for 167. However, it was his relationship with umpire Chester that garnered more attention. After a series of declined appeals and a barrage of short-pitched bowling at the English batsmen, Miller broke the stumps and appealed for a <b>runout</b> with the batsman more than a metre out of his ground, but Chester said not out. Angered, Miller appealed four more times for the wicket. Miller made only five in the first innings, to leave Australia at 3/84. However, Australia recovered to reach 266 and take a 99-run lead. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall launched a short-pitched barrage and Miller dismissed Watson and Reg Simpson in consecutive balls to be 5/171. England were 5/177 a stumps on day four, leading by 78. The pacemen were booed from the field. Miller reacted to one heckler by challenging him to a fight, which was declined. The next day, Miller dismissed Godfrey Evans early to leave England at 6/182, just 83 runs ahead with four wickets in hand, before Trevor Bailey began his resistance. Miller and Bailey were rivals; both were all rounders, but while Miller was attacking, Bailey was stubborn and defensive. Bailey attempted to save the match by time-wasting and causing stoppages by appealing against the light, holding discussions with his partner and withdrawing when the bowler was running in. At one point, Miller lost his cool and aimed a beamerin an illegal delivery straight at Bailey's head, further angering the crowd. Miller later took the wicket of Tony Lock to end with 4/63 from a long spell of 47overs and confronted another heckler {{on his way back}} to the dressing room, this time an elderly man. England held on for another draw after Bailey deliberately bowled wide down the leg side to prevent the Australian batsmen from reaching the target and used an uncharacteristically long run-up to slow down the proceedings. The teams would enter the Fifth Test at The Oval tied 00.|$|E

Consisting of a tower reaching [...] in height and a horizontal braking <b>runout,</b> Sky Screamer had an L-shaped appearance. It featured eight uniquely designed gondolas, each holding four riders. The gondolas used one set of wheels to go up the lift and down the drop (4 large wheels at each back corner), but used a different set in the transfer and loading and unloading area of the ride (smaller rollers located {{on the bottom of}} the gondola). Gondolas were lifted upward through a shaft in the tower's center by a lift chain. Once at the top, the gondola was disengaged from the lift chain and pushed forward into the drop position. The gondola was released into freefall following the sounding of a loud klaxon (which was audible throughout sections of the park and often lured visitors to the ride). A pair of guide rails ran downward along the outside of the tower before curving into the horizontal braking <b>runout.</b> The freefall drop into the horizontal curve applied a g-force of 4.5 on the riders. In late 1983, 50% more anti-rollback devices were installed. The additional anti-rollbacks were staggered on each side of the lift. These modifications were intended to improve stopping ability in wet conditions and were a response to a non-fatal accident on a similar ride at another park. In 1986, the ride's [...] "G-Block" [...] was moved farther down the horizontal braking <b>runout.</b> The end of [...] "H-Block" [...] was extended to the beginning of the station conveyors in 1994.

40|$|The {{morphological}} characterisation of {{the western}} submarine island flanks of El Hierro and La Palma differentiates four type-zones that may give {{new insights into the}} evolution of oceanic island slopes. The different type-zones result from the interplay between constructive volcanic processes, hemipelagic settling and volcano collapses. The latter results in massive debris avalanche deposits, which form large volcaniclastic aprons. In most cases, the headwall scarps are clearly exposed on the emerged part of the islands.
