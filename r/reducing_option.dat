40|$|Options {{are a major}} {{component}} of corporate compensation and accounting methods signif-icantly affect allocations, yet valuation remains a challenge. We develop the first empirical model of employee exercise suitable for valuation, and estimate the exercise rate as a func-tion of option, stock, firm and employee characteristics in a large sample of all employee exercises at over 100 firms. These characteristics significantly affect exercise behavior and cost, in ways that Black-Scholes approximations used in practice fail to capture, and previ-ous studies have failed to quantify. For example, vesting-date notifications trigger exercises, so vesting structure has a very important impact on option value: Increasing vesting date frequency from annually to monthly reduces option value by 20 %. Men exercise faster than women, <b>reducing</b> <b>option</b> value by 2 – 3 %. Top employees exercise faster than lower-ranked em-ployees, <b>reducing</b> <b>option</b> value by 3 – 4 %. Consistent with employee option theory, wealthier employees exercise later, whereas employees with more option risk exercise earlier. Finally, we develop an analytic approximation to our valuation method that is much more accurat...|$|E
40|$|Background: Over {{half the}} cancer deaths in HNPCC {{families}} {{are due to}} extra-colonic malignancies that include endometrial and ovarian cancers. The benefits of surveillance for gynecological cancers are not yet proven {{and there is no}} consensus on the optimal surveillance recommendations for women with MMR mutations. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature and evaluated gynecological cancer risk in a series of 631 Polish HNPCC families classified into either Lynch Syndrome (LS, MMR mutations detected) or HNPCC (fulfillment of the Amsterdam or modified Amsterdam criteria). Results: Published data clearly indicates no benefit for ovarian cancer screening in contrast to risk reducing surgery. We confirmed a significantly increased risk of OC in Polish LS families (OR[*]=[*] 4, 6, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and an especially high risk of OC was found for women under 50 years of age: OR[*]=[*] 32, 6, p[*]<[*] 0. 0001 (95 % CI 12, 96 - 81, 87). The cumulative OC risk to 50 year of life was calculated to be 10 %. Six out of 19 (32 %) early-onset patients from LS families died from OC within 2 years of diagnosis. We confirmed a significantly increased risk of EC (OR[*]=[*] 26, 95 % CI 11, 36 - 58, 8; p[*]<[*] 0, 001). The cumulative risk for EC in Polish LS families was calculated to be 67 %. Conclusions: Due to the increased risk of OC and absence of any benefit from gynecological screening reported in the literature it is recommended that prophylactic oophorectomy for female carriers of MMR mutations after 35 year of age should be considered as a risk <b>reducing</b> <b>option.</b> Annual transvaginal ultrasound supported by CA 125 or HE 4 marker testing should be performed after prophylactic surgery in these women. Due to the high risk of EC it is reasonable to offer, after the age of 35 years, annual clinical gynecologic examinations with transvaginal ultrasound supported by routine aspiration sampling of the endometrium for women from either LS or HNPCC families. An alternative option, which could be taken into consideration for women preferring surgical prevention, is risk reducing total hysterectomy (with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) for carriers after childbearing is complete...|$|E

Results indicate the presence of ARGs related to clinically relevant antibiotics. Data analysis showed that antibiotic classes exhibit different removal efficiencies in the biological treatment processes (i. e. SRT); therefore, operating conditions at each WWTP can be optimized for highest efficiency removal. SRT of 19 days and higher indicated a high removal efficiency for all six ARGs of concern. Ultimately, identifying a critical value to optimize SRTs, where antibiotic degradation is maximized and AR is minimized, will provide information to WWTP operators, allowing treatment optimization to decrease harmful loading of Trace Organic Contaminants (TOrCs) in the environment...|$|R

30|$|It {{is clear}} that {{what is needed is}} better climate {{adaptation}} – at all timescales, from weather, to interannual variability, to decadal variability, to trends associated with manmade climate change. For example, the numbers cited above for economic losses during El Niño events are consistent with losses incurred in all years, El Niño or not; however, there is greater ability to predict and prepare for the regional climate impacts during El Niño events (Goddard & Dilley 2005). That society has been negatively impacted by climate variability is clear from historical records (e.g. (Davis 2001;Egan 2005)). As human population numbers increase, in some cases <b>reducing</b> <b>options</b> for geographic mobility in the face of adverse climate events, and in others just demanding more of the environmental resources, societies will be increasingly vulnerable to climate variability. Additionally, as climate change trends continue their slow monotonic progression, they can exacerbate the adverse impacts of climate and weather variability such as heat waves and drought severity, but also precipitation intensity and thus risk of flooding.|$|R

We evaluated whether a woman's negative attitude toward her pregnancy increased the risk of perinatal mortality, in a large, prospective cohort study. METHODS. The association between attitude toward the pregnancy and perinatal mortality was evaluated in a longitudinal cohort study of 8823 married, pregnant patients enrolled from 1959 to 1966 in the Child Health and Development Studies. RESULTS. Women who reported during the first trimester of prenatal care that the pregnancy was unwanted were more than two times more likely to deliver infants who died within the first 28 days of life than were women reporting accepted pregnancies. A positive attitude toward pregnancy was not associated with fetal death or post-neonatal death. CONCLUSIONS. These data, collected when induced abortions were illegal, may have important implications for the 1990 s. If maternal attitude toward the pregnancy is associated with neonatal mortality and abortion laws change such that access is restricted, infant mortality may increase because a greater proportion of births will be unwanted...|$|R
