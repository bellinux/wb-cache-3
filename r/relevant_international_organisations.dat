[...] The Austrian Pledge was a major development in the run up to the 2015 Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which reviews the implementation of the treaty in a five-yearly cycle. Before the conference, 66 states had endorsed the Pledge. During the conference, the perceived intransigence of nuclear weapon states and uncertain prospects for a consensus outcome pushed a growing number of states to endorse the Pledge. Austria reacted by [...] "internationalising" [...] the Pledge, renaming it Humanitarian Pledge. By the end of the conference, 107 states had endorsed it, which was hailed by civil society as [...] "the real outcome" [...] of the NPT review.

The main conclusions drawn from this study are that there is confusion in relation to the grounds on which conduct can be attributed to an IO and that DARIO is not currently interpreted in a manner reflective of practice. This often results in conduct being attributed to the wrong entity, or else to only one entity where in fact there should be concurrent attribution.
