5000|$|Writer Thomas Low Nichols {{supported}} {{parts of}} the story in an 1864 book of social history.

The black dancer would have debuted in the spring of 1841. Nichols never identified the dancer as Juba, but later writers concluded that the boy was that performer. Historian Eric Lott has identified the irony of this arrangement: a black man imitating a white man imitating a black man.|$|R

40|$|This essay has {{traced a}} {{fleeting}} trajectory of representations of Aborigines and automobiles {{in the past}} 100 years. From the 'smoking buggy' scenes of pandemonium, to the nonchalant magical skills of the Bush Mechanics, a constantly shifting kaleidoscope of images reflects the contemporary state of relations between white Australians and Aboriginal Australians. Today, non-Aboriginal Australians seem less anxious for reassurance that the Indigenous owners of the land are suitably awed by 'our' modern technology, while the grudging inclusiveness extended to Namatjira as a fellow carowner {{during the height of}} the assimilation era has been <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a <b>genuine</b> acceptance of the fact that indeed, Aboriginal people have made cars their own. Yet even in this 'postmodern' age, embedded in the counter-representations remains the frisson evoked in the white onlooker at seeing the 'unexpected' juxtaposition of two such deeply powerful symbols of the primitive and the modern. This 'annoying irony', as Deloria put it, that even in the most assertive counter-stories of peoples' active engagement with technology, the actors appear as 'funny curiosities' and thus affirm ideologies of race,is an indication that indeed, there is still a long road to travel...|$|R

Understand that the Rose reviewʼsnarrow remit prevented it from addressing {{some of the problems}} of the primary curriculum which aremost in need of attention, especially the counterproductive sacrificing of curriculum entitlement to aneedlessly restricted notion of ʻstandardsʼ, the corrosive split between the ʻbasicsʼ and the rest, themuddled posturing on subjects, knowledge and skills, and the vital matter of the relationship betweencurriculum quality, expertise and staffing; and that the curriculum debate therefore remains wide open.But donʼt think that the minimalism of the 1950s (or 1870s) is an adequate alternative. Look instead atthe Cambridge model: an aims-driven entitlement curriculum of breadth, richness and contemporaryrelevance, which secures the basics and much more besides, and combines a national frameworkwith a strong local component.|$|R
40|$|If a {{specimen}} of literary art {{is seen as}} a fine tapestry of words made by the skilled seamstress—the poet, then the lexis and structure of a language are the raw materials—the fabric and the thread—by weaving which into specific patterns the finished product is achieved. The choice of materials and their arrangement into unique patterns always bear an image of their creator, or the artist; thus, a close view of them reveals the artist’s identity and brings out the meaningful message that underlies the ornate running threads. Mostly, the students of literary studies cannot appreciate the beauty of the literary classics on their own. Consequently, they simply mimic the ideas, and sometimes even the words, of famous professional critics when asked to give their own critical judgment on the aesthetic merit or the thematic quality of a literary work {{in the shape of a}} home assignment, classroom presentation or an annual assessment test. Now, the researcher has got the inspiration for carrying out this study from an idea expounded in Widdowson (1975) that this mimicry can be <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> <b>genuine</b> individual opinion if the students, or even those people who have non-academic concerns with literature, are brought to a standpoint from where they can have a closer view of the raw materials, the language resources, which are involved in the making of a literary product. And, if the product in its finished form cannot elicit a desired response from them then making them sensitive to the process of its making can be quite effective in this regard. Through the present study, an attempt has been made to show an easy access to the outlandish world of verse by means of the linguistic route which is laid with the familiar flagstones of grammar and vocabulary. Meaning thereby that in this study the elusiveness of poetry will be dealt with the precision of a social scientist, the linguist. The approach which serves as the basis of this study is not an invention of the researcher; rather, it is a well-known twentieth century approach known as stylistics (Jeffries & McIntyre, 2010, p. 30). Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s famous ballad, “The Rime of the Ancient Mariner”, being a widely read poem and bearing various stylistics features, offered itself as an ideal object for this study. The poet’s aesthetic message is explored by analyzing the finest details of his linguistic expression. And, careful considerations have been made throughout the study to prevent the overlooking of any instance of deviant linguistic units or recurring patterns for interpretation because such elements contribute largely to the meaning of any literary product. The study is descriptive in its nature therefore qualitative data has been integrated with and substantiated by the quantitative one...|$|R
