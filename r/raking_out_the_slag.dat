50|$|In 1933, {{after the}} Nazi rise to power, Toller was exiled from Germany {{because of his}} work; the Nazis did not like modernist arts of any form. His {{citizenship}} was nullified by the Nazi government later that year. He traveled to London. In 1935, he participated as co-director in the Manchester production of his play <b>Rake</b> <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> Fires (Feuer aus den Kesseln).|$|R
60|$|He {{set himself}} to <b>rake</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fire, {{leaving only a}} few red embers and tiny morsels of coal to flame up fitfully {{from time to time}} in the bottom of the grate. Having done this, he stood and warmed himself for a little while, and tried to whistle a {{favorite}} tune. The attempt was a total failure. He broke down at the third bar, and ended lamentably in another sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where? Why, where you'll never follow them--gone up {{to heaven}} in the fire. Thinking {{we might be}} robbed, I hid them behind a secret panel in her chamber, purposing to return for them later. Go, <b>rake</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ashes; you might find a cracked diamond or two, but not the pearls; they fly in fire. There, that's the truth at last, and much good may it do to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{continued}} the housekeeper, [...] "the arranging {{of this room}} will be your last piece of work at night. You'll just come in, <b>rake</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> grate, carry off the ashes, lay the noo fire, put the matches handy on the chimney-piece, look round to see that all's right, and then turn off the gas. The master is a early riser, and lights the fire his-self of a mornin'." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have not}} yet {{explained}} yourself," [...] she reminded him. [...] "Of all people in world, you have chosen us for your presumptive friends. Why? You hate us both. You know that you do. Is it part of a scheme? Lumley is investing money on your advice, I am allowing myself to be seen about with you more than is prudent--considering all things.

50|$|The cupola tender {{observes the}} furnace through the sight glass or peep sight in <b>the</b> tuyeres. <b>Slag</b> {{will rise to}} the top of the pool of iron being formed. A slag hole, located higher up on the {{cylinder}} of the furnace, and usually to the rear or side of the tap hole, is opened to let <b>the</b> <b>slag</b> flow <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> viscosity is low (with proper fluxing) and the red hot molten slag will flow easily. Sometimes <b>the</b> <b>slag</b> which runs <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>slag</b> hole is collected in a small cup shaped tool, allowed to cool and harden. It is fractured and visually examined.

60|$|The King {{gave the}} shrill whistle, and <b>the</b> well-trained hawk <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> to <b>the</b> right {{and to the}} left to make sure which quarry she was to follow. Then, spying the heron, she shot up in a swift {{ascending}} curve to meet him.|$|R
60|$|He was {{too deeply}} engaged to notice {{more than that}} {{somebody}} had entered the cabin. They stood at his shoulder and looked on. He imparted to the pan a deft circular motion, pausing once or twice to <b>rake</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> larger particles of gravel with his fingers. The water was muddy, and, with the pan buried in it, they could see nothing of its contents. Suddenly he lifted the pan clear and sent <b>the</b> water <b>out</b> of it with a flirt. A mass of yellow, like butter in a churn, showed across the bottom.|$|R
60|$|She {{would not}} turn again to <b>the</b> little looking-glass, <b>out</b> of {{humanity}} to herself, knowing what a deflowered visage would {{look back at}} her, and almost break her heart; she dreaded {{it as much as}} did her own ancestral goddess Sif the reflection in the pool after the rape of her locks by Loke the malicious. She steadily stuck to business, wrapped the hair in a parcel, and sealed it up, after which she <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fire and went to bed, having first set up an alarum made of a candle and piece of thread, with a stone attached.|$|R
60|$|There was a dance {{after the}} song books and quail bones had been <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> Hall.

50|$|An undocked Welsh Terrier tail {{is only an}} inch or so {{longer than}} a docked tail and does not make a great deal of {{difference}} to the overall appearance. The coat does not moult out but old hairs will eventually be stripped out through play and movement if the coat is not regularly raked. Ungroomed coats can also fade and thin <b>out</b> as <b>the</b> old hair loses colour and texture. to keep a moult free house and a good coat on your Welsh Terrier it is necessary to <b>rake</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> coat on a regular basis. Welsh terriers need some grooming. Their fur grows a little long.|$|R

60|$|Nine {{years after}} her death, when it was fully {{understood}} that no story on her side or that of her friends was to be forthcoming, then her calumniators <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> from <b>the</b> ashes of her husband's sepulchre all his bitter charges, to state them over in even stronger and more indecent forms.|$|R
6000|$|Most modern {{calendars}} mar {{the sweet}} simplicity {{of our lives}} by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event. Their compilers display a degraded passion for chronicling small beer, and <b>rake</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> dust-heap of history in an ardent search after rubbish. Mr. Walter Scott, however, has made a new departure and has published a calendar in which {{every day of the}} year is made beautiful for us by means of an elegant extract from the poems of Mr. Alfred Austin.

60|$|How {{she wished}} his {{acknowledgments}} and faithful promises were over! He did hint something about refreshment, bread-and-cheese and beer, fare {{which he used}} to despise as 'decidedly low,' but Charlotte was obdurate here, and at last he took his leave. There stood the poor, foolish, generous little thing, <b>raking</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> last embers of the kitchen fire, conscious that she had probably done the silliest action of her life, very much ashamed, and afraid of any one knowing it; and yet strangely light of heart, {{as if she had}} done something to atone for the past permission that she had granted him to play with her vanity.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he breathed}} upon the bones, shook {{them up in}} his thin hands and with a quick turn of the wrist, threw them into the air. After this he studied them carefully, where they lay among the ashes which he had <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> fire, those that he had used for the making of his map.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike modern {{household}} gas {{or electric}} ovens {{that provide a}} nearly constant cooking temperature, a black oven is typically heated only once during the firing stage (the combustion of wood inside the chamber). After <b>the</b> coals are <b>raked</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> oven gradually cools {{over a period of}} hours or even days (in the case of a well-insulated oven). Oven temperatures may exceed 1000 degrees Fahrenheit (538 degrees Celsius). The mass of the oven acts as a 'thermal battery', which slowly releases heat over time. The retained heat in the oven may be used to bake multiple batches. Alternatively, foods requiring different temperatures can be cooked in succession as the temperature of the oven drops.|$|R
60|$|He {{crossed the}} stream below the pool, {{stepping}} agilely from stone to stone. Where the side-hill touched the water he dug up a shovelful {{of dirt and}} put it into the gold-pan. He squatted down, holding the pan in his two hands, and partly immersing it in the stream. Then he imparted to the pan a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and <b>out</b> through <b>the</b> dirt and gravel. The larger and the lighter particles worked to the surface, and these, by a skilful dipping movement of the pan, he spilled <b>out</b> and over <b>the</b> edge. Occasionally, to expedite matters, he rested the pan and with his fingers <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> large pebbles and pieces of rock.|$|R
60|$|Fitzpiers went up-stairs again, and {{the little}} drawing-room, now lighted by a solitary candle, was not {{rendered}} more cheerful by the entrance of Grammer Oliver with an apronful of wood, which she threw on the hearth while she <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> grate and rattled about the fire-irons, {{with a view to}} making things comfortable. Fitzpiers considered that Grace ought to have let him know her plans more accurately before leaving home in a freak like this. He went desultorily to the window, the blind of which had not been pulled down, and looked <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> thin, fast-sinking moon, and at the tall stalk of smoke rising from the top of Suke Damson's chimney, signifying that the young woman had just lit her fire to prepare supper.|$|R
60|$|They {{moved forward}} in a little phalanx, {{carrying}} staves and iron bars, though Austin knew that a word would bring <b>out</b> <b>the</b> twinkling steel; and, somewhat to his astonishment, the negroes fell back before them, and as they approached it <b>the</b> headman scuttled <b>out</b> of his house. Jefferson stopped outside it and taking a stick of yellow substance from his pocket, inserted it in a cranny he <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> in <b>the</b> wall. Then he lighted the strip of fuse and touched Austin's shoulder.|$|R

60|$|First, In {{that the}} {{foundations}} are all {{and every one}} of them precious stones, it signifieth that all the doctrines of the New Jerusalem will be only the precious doctrine of the twelve apostles, not common stuff, not <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> dunghills and muck-heaps of this world, and from among the toys of antichrist, but spiritual, heavenly, and glorious.

6000|$|It is {{probable}} that the last man addressed did not understand what was said, but {{he knew how to}} clean a fire, and stood, half crouching, before the furnace, with face averted, while he plied the bar. There was a rattling beneath the grate-bars and an overpowering wave of heat, in the midst of which the man stood bowed, with thin garments scorching and his hair frizzling visibly. Austin could hear his gasping breath, and became possessed by a sense of futile indignation. Toil of that kind was, he felt, more than could be expected of anything made in the image of a man. Then the Canario let the bar fall clanging, and seized another, while the heat grew more intense when he <b>raked</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> ash and glowing clinker from the flaming tunnel. Austin shrank back with a hand upon his eyes and singlet singeing, and his voice broke through Tom's cry of [...] "Damp her down!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well! Before I run away, I used {{to sleep}} in the kitchen--where we played cards, you know. Miss Sally used to keep the key of the kitchen door in her pocket, and she always come down at night to take away <b>the</b> candle and <b>rake</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fire. When she had done that, she left me to go to bed in the dark, locked the door on the outside, put the key in her pocket again, and kept me locked up till she come down in the morning--very early I can tell you--and let me out. I was terrible afraid of being kept like this, because if there was a fire, I thought they might forget me and only take care of {{themselves}} you know. So, whenever I see an old rusty key anywhere, I picked it up and tried if it would fit the door, and at last I found in the dust cellar a key that did fit it.' ...|$|R
50|$|Sweitzer {{altered the}} Willing to suit {{technological}} advances. He {{was the first}} to use an automobile engine instead of the then-common one-cylinder Hettinger engines to operate the dredge gear.

5000|$|Before the {{technique}} of injecting air into molten iron was re-discovered by Kelly and by Bessemer, iron was available as cast iron, a strong but brittle metal made in a blast furnace by treating iron ore with coke derived from coal, and wrought iron, a more malleable and flexible metal made by heating iron ore in a low oxygen environment in a bloomery heated by charcoal and producing [...] "blooms", which were 100 to 200 pound lumps of very low carbon iron mixed with <b>slag.</b> <b>The</b> blooms then had to be worked repeatedly by hammering with a helve hammer or later a steam hammer and folding it to work <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>slag.</b> This could in turn be converted to steel by heating it for prolonged periods sealed in stone boxes with charcoal, to add back carbon. The resulting steel could then be formed into larger shapes by heating it to welding temperature and hammering it together into a mass. Other laborious and expensive methods made small amounts of steel from special ores.|$|R
