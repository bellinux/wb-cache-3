40|$|A set of {{reactive}} {{chemical transport}} calculations {{was conducted with}} the Subsurface Transport Over Reactive Multiphases (STORM) code to evaluate the long-term performance of a representative low-activity waste glass in a shallow subsurface disposal system located on the Hanford Site. Two-dimensional simulations were run until the waste form release rates reached a quasi-stationary-state, usually after 2, 000 to 4, 000 yr. The primary difference between the waste form release simulations for the 2001 ILAW PA, and the simulations described herein, {{is the number of}} different materials considered. Whereas the previous PA considered only LAWABP 1 glass, the current PA also describes radionuclide release from three different WTP glasses (LAWA 44, LAWB 45 and LAWC 22), two different bulk vitrification glasses (6 -tank composite and S- 109), and three different grout waste forms (containing Silver Iodide, Barium Iodide and Barium Iodate). All WTP and bulk vitrification glasses perform well. However, the radionuclide release from the salt in the cast <b>refractory</b> <b>surrounding</b> the bulk vitrification waste packages is 2 to 170 times higher than the glass release rate, depending on the water recharge rate. Iodine- 129 release from grouted waste forms is highly sensitive to the solubility of the iodine compound contained in the grout. The normalized iodine release rate from grout containing barium iodate is a factor of 10 higher than what the normalized release rate would be if the iodine were contained in LAWA 44 glass...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new homogenization-based {{finite element}} model to compute masonry {{structures}} with compressible joints is proposed. It {{is an extension of}} the model proposed by De Felice et al. (Int. J. Numer. Anal. Meth. Geomech. 2010; 34 (3) : 221 - 247) for dry block structures where strain hardening was neglected. The proposed strain hardening incremental elasto-plastic model is obtained by means of a new step-by-step homogenization method for a running bond masonry structure made of elastic bricks jointed by an elasto-plastic ram. The numerical implicit integration of the model is carried out following an iterative implicit procedure in which the elastic trial stress state is corrected through a return mapping algorithm. The procedure has been implemented in the ABAQUS finite element software and applied to the computation of thermal stresses for the hearths made of small carbon <b>refractory</b> bricks <b>surrounded</b> by very compressible joints. Indeed, during its working, the hearth of the blast furnace is submitted to a high thermal gradient in the radial direction because of the inner heating and the outer cooling imposed to the wall. In our application we evaluate the effect of the joints on the thermal stress distribution within the hearth...|$|R
40|$|A solar-powered {{fluidized}} bed gasification system for gasifying carbonaceous material is presented. The system includes a solar gasifier which is heated by fluidizing gas and steam. Energy {{to heat the}} gas and steam is supplied by a high heat capacity <b>refractory</b> honeycomb which <b>surrounds</b> the fluid bed reactor zone. The high heat capacity refractory honeycomb is heated by solar energy focused on the honeycomb by solar concentrator through solar window. The fluid bed reaction zone is also heated directly and uniformly by thermal contact of the high heat capacity ceramic honeycomb with {{the walls of the}} {{fluidized bed}} reactor. Provisions are also made for recovering and recycling catalysts used in the gasification process. Back-up furnace is provided for start-up procedures and for supplying heat to the fluid bed reaction zone when adequate supplies of solar energy are not available...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} of spent refiactory materials {{has become a}} major problem for metals producers. The main issue <b>surrounding</b> <b>refractory</b> disposal is the elimination of the hazardous components of refractories, most commonly chrome-bearing materials and fluoride and cyanide in spent pot-liners. The various approaches to pollution prevention involve re-design to eliminate or significant reduction in wastes, recycling or reuse of the materials, and the least valuable approach, abatement. In the present work, the cunent status of spent As disposal costs escalate and hazardous waste regulations become increasingly stringent for a wide array of industrial wastes, industry is beginning to recognize the potential returns of investing in a pollution prevention policy. The most effective approach to prevent pollution, which often results in the greatest savings, is to design for zero waste; that is, develop a process which does not create (or significantly reduces) the wast...|$|R
40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are associated}} with significant morbidity, impaired quality of life, mortality and substantial healthcare costs. Treatment with anti-epileptic drugs is the mainstay of therapy, with pharmacotherapy aiming to achieve seizure freedom or seizure reduction. Given that approximately 30 % of patients are not controlled with monotherapy regimens, adjunctive therapy with multiple anti-epileptic drugs can be envisaged. This article aims to review economic evaluations of anti-epileptic drugs as adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy in adult patients. Studies were included if they examined the costs and consequences of different pharmacotherapeutic adjunctive therapies for <b>refractory</b> epilepsy. Uncertainty <b>surrounds</b> the cost-effectiveness of anti-epileptic drugs as adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy owing to methodological limitations and design differences between studies. Although cost-effectiveness estimates vary between studies, adjunctive therapy of refractory epilepsy appears to be cost effective, depending on the cost-effectiveness threshold used by pricing/reimbursement agencies. However, {{there is a need}} for more, better-designed and comprehensive economic evaluations of adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy with anti-epileptic drugs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{laboratory}} study uses a novel furnace to resolve nitrogen evolution {{during the three}} stages of pulverized coal combustion: primary devolatilization, secondary pyrolysis, and combustion. The behavior of six coals depicts continuous rank variations, as well as suppressed nitrogen evolution from low volatility coals. During primary devolatilization of any coal, aromatic compounds in tar and oils are virtually the only shuttles for nitrogen out of the coal matrix. The small amounts of HCN observed while primary devolatilization winds down probably come from the char, because char particles are significantly hotter than tar in these experiments. Secondary pyrolysis promotes additional HCN evolution from both char and tar. Moreover, substantial fractions of the volatile-nitrogen from primary devolatilization is reincorporated into a carbonaceous soot matrix for all coal types. The fraction of coal nitrogen incorporated into soot remains constant, even while soot yields dramatically increase. Incorporation of nitrogen into soot {{has the potential to}} substantially reduce the amount of coal nitrogen amenable to aerodynamic NOx abatement strategies for coals with large tar yields. This potential limitation is compounded by another limitation for low volatility coals. Whereas one-half to two-thirds of the coal-nitrogen is expelled by thermal decomposition from other coal types, only 30 to 40 % is expelled from low volatility samples. This tendency suggests that nitrogen functionalities become much more <b>refractory</b> as their <b>surrounding</b> aromatic domains become more extensive, either in high rank coals or soot. For such systems, our measurements indicate {{that the only way to}} expel the nitrogen is to burn it away...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{reconciliation}} of mantle chemistry with {{the structure of}} the mantle inferred from geophysics and dynam-ical modelling has been a long-standing problem. This paper reviews three main aspects. First, extensions and refinements of dynamical modelling and theory of mantle processing over the past decade. Second, a recent reconsideration of the im-plications of mantle heterogeneity for melting, melt migra-tion, mantle differentiation and mantle segregation. Third, a recent proposed shift in the primitive chemical baseline of the mantle inferred from observations of non-chondritic 142 Nd in the Earth. It seems most issues can now be resolved, except the level of heating required to maintain the mantle’s thermal evolution. A {{reconciliation of}} refractory trace elements and their iso-topes with the dynamical mantle, proposed and given pre-liminary quantification by Hofmann, White and Christensen, has been strengthened by work over the past decade. The ap-parent age of lead isotopes and the broad refractory-element differences among and between ocean island basalts (OIBs) and mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) can now be quantita-tively accounted for with some assurance. The association of the least radiogenic helium with rel-atively depleted sources and their location in the mantle have been enigmatic. The least radiogenic helium samples have recently been recognised as matching the proposed non-chondritic primitive mantle.

40|$|Despite {{progress}} in reconciling refractory trace elements and isotopes with {{the structure and}} dynamics of the mantle inferred from geophysical constraints and dynamical modelling, mass balances of key elements and observations of noble gases in the mantle have remained enigmatic. This paper reviews arguments that most issues can be resolved if the full implications of the major-element heterogeneity of the mantle are taken into account. A reconciliation of refractory trace elements and their isotopes with the dynamical mantle, proposed and quantified by Hofmann, White and Christensen, has been strengthened by work over the past decade. The apparent age of lead isotopes and the broad refractory-element differences among and between ocean island basalts (OIBs) and mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) can now be quantitatively accounted for with some assurance. It has been proposed recently that noble gases reside in a so-called hybrid pyroxenite assemblage that {{is the result of}} melt from fusible pods reacting with <b>surrounding</b> <b>refractory</b> peridotite and refreezing. Hybrid pyroxenite that is off-axis may not remelt and erupt at MORs, so its volatile constituents would recirculate within the mantle. Hybrid pyroxenite is likely to be denser than average mantle, and thus some would tend to settle in the D" zone {{at the base of the}} mantle, along with some old subducted oceanic crust. Residence times in D" are longer, so the hybrid pyroxenite there would be less degassed. Plumes would sample both the degassed, enriched old oceanic crust and the gassy, less enriched hybrid pyroxenite and deliver them to OIBs. This model can account quantitatively for the main He, Ne and Ar isotopic observations, and for the poor correlation of unradiogenic gases with refractory-element enrichment in OIBs. The difficulty with mass balances can be traced to the common inference that the MORB source is strongly depleted of incompatible elements, which leaves a deficit of key elements and seems to require a hidden reservoir that is enriched and undegassed. However it has recently been argued that conventional estimates of the MORB source composition fail to take full account of mantle heterogeneity, and in particular focus on an ill-defined "depleted" mantle component while neglecting less common enriched components. Recent estimates have also been tied to the composition of peridotites, but these probably do not reflect the full complement of incompatible elements in the heterogeneous mantle. New estimates that account for enriched mantle components are capable of satisfying mass balance requirements, although some additional uncertainties apply to argon. The result is that the MORB source is depleted by only about a factor of 2, relative to the primitive Earth...|$|R

New estimates that account for enriched mantle components suggest the MORB source complement of incompatibles could be as much as 50 – 100 % larger than previous estimates. A major difficulty has been the inference that mass balances of incompatible trace elements could only be satisfied if there is a deep enriched layer in the mantle, but the Earth's topography precludes such a layer. The difficulty might be resolved if either the Earth is depleted relative to chondritic or the MORB source is less depleted than previous estimates. Together these factors can certainly resolve the mass balance difficulties...|$|R
