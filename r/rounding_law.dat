50|$|The Swedish <b>rounding</b> <b>law</b> in Finland {{was issued}} in January 2002 and thus before the coins {{were put into}} circulation. The Netherlands {{followed}} suit in September 2004, with Belgium making moves to follow in 2005. The Netherlands did so under pressure from retail businesses, which claimed that dealing with 1- and 2-cent coins was too expensive. After a successful experiment {{in the town of}} Woerden in May 2004, retailers in the whole of the Netherlands have been permitted to round cash transactions to the nearest five-cent since September 2004. Belgium passed a <b>rounding</b> <b>law</b> in February 2014, but it is generally ignored. Ireland did so in 2015 after trialling rounding in Wexford in 2013. In May 2017, the Italian parliament has passed a resolution to stop minting €0.01 and €0.02 coins starting 1 January 2018 as well as introducing Swedish rounding.|$|E

500|$|Copper-jacketed, lead-based bullets {{are more}} {{economical}} {{to produce and}} use than lead or any other material. [...] Alternative materials are available such as steel, copper, and tungsten, but alternatives are universally less effective and/or more expensive. However, the biggest impediment to using {{the vast majority of}} alternatives relates to current laws in the United States pertaining to armor-piercing <b>rounds.</b> <b>Laws</b> and regulations relating to armor-piercing ammunition expressly prohibit the use of brass, bronze, steel, tungsten, and nearly every metallic alternative in any bullet that can be shot by a handgun, which at this time is nearly every caliber smaller than 50BMG (including the popular [...]223 Remington, [...]308 Winchester and [...]30-06 to name just a few). Some lead-based bullets are resistant to fragmentation, offering hunters the ability to clean game animals with negligible risk of including lead fragments in prepared meat. Other bullets are prone to fragmentation and exacerbate the risk of lead ingestion from prepared meat. In practice, use of a non-fragmenting bullet and proper cleaning of the game animal's wound can eliminate the risk of lead ingestion from eating game; however, isolating such practice to experimentally determine its association with blood lead levels in study is difficult. Bismuth is an element used as a lead-replacement for shotgun pellets used in waterfowl hunting although shotshells made from bismuth are nearly ten times the cost of lead.|$|R

60|$|Cockburn, {{the chief}} justice of the Queen’s bench, opened fire on Mr. Gladstone (Nov. 10) in a long letter of rather over-heroic eloquence, protesting that a colourable {{appointment}} to a judgeship for the purpose of getting <b>round</b> the <b>law</b> seriously compromised the dignity of the judicial office, and denouncing the grievous impropriety of the proceeding as a mere subterfuge and evasion of the statute. Mr. Gladstone could be extremely summary when he chose, and he replied in three or four lines, informing {{the chief justice}} that as the transaction was a joint one, and as “the completed part of it to which you have taken objection, was the official act of the lord chancellor,” he had transmitted the letter for his consideration. That was all he said. The chancellor for his part contented himself with half a dozen sentences, that his appointment of Collier to the puisne judgeship had been made with a full knowledge of Mr. Gladstone’s intention to recommend him for the judicial committee; that he thus “acted advisedly and with the conviction that the arrangement was justified as regards both its fitness and its legality”; and that he took upon himself the responsibility of thus concurring with Mr. Gladstone, and was prepared to vindicate the course pursued. This curt treatment of his Junius-like composition mortified Cockburn’s literary vanity, and no vanity is so easily stung as that of the amateur.|$|R
30|$|A fixed-point {{conversion}} {{method has}} been developed for software implementation in [1] and for hardware implementation in [2]. This method {{is based on an}} analytical approach to evaluate the fixed-point accuracy. The implementation cost is optimized under an accuracy constraint. In this paper, an approach to determine this accuracy constraint from the application performance requirements is proposed. This module for accuracy constraint determination allows the achieving of a complete fixed-point design flow for which the user only specifies the application performance requirements and not an intermediate metric. The approach proposed in this paper is based on an iterative process to adjust the accuracy constraint. The first value of the accuracy constraint is determined through simulations and depends on the application performance requirements. The fixed-point system behavior is modeled with an infinite precision version of the system and a single noise source located at the system output. The accuracy constraint is thus determined as the maximal value of the noise source power which maintains the desired application quality. Our noise model is valid for <b>rounding</b> quantization <b>law</b> and for systems based on arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). This includes LTI and non-LTI systems with or without feedbacks. In summary, the contributions of this paper are (i) a technique to determine the accuracy constraint according to the application performance requirements, (ii) a noise model to estimate the application performances according to the quantization noise level, (iii) an iterative process to adjust the accuracy constraint.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} the development and validation of a three dimensional thermomechanically coupled finite element model for gun drilling AISI 4150 quenched and tempered steel. The Lagrangian formulation proposed in the FE code DEFORM 3 DTM and the constitutive Johnson-Cook material model were utilized to simulate the chip formation and to predict the cutting reaction forces as well as the temperature in gun drilling process using carbide gun drills with two different diameters. During gun drilling simulation, modified gun drill cutting edge <b>rounding</b> and friction <b>law</b> are performed to investigate the effect of tool wear and lubrication on feed force and torque respectively. Experimental gun drilling tests were carried out in steel AISI 4150 for the validation of the developed 3 D FE model. The developed and validated 3 D FE model can be used for optimizing the cutting process in gun drilling (good surface finish and straightness) taking into account the complex gun drill geometry, cutting conditions, heat transfer and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of the workpiece material...|$|R
