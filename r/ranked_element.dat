The {{starting point}} of this work is the element rank problem: the server holds a database of n integers, and the user an integer q; the user wishes {{to find out how}} many database records are smaller than q, without revealing q; nothing else about the database should be disclosed. We show a non-interactive communication-efficient solution to this problem. We then use it to solve more complex private database queries: range queries, range queries in plane and higher-dimensional generalizations of element rank. We also show an improved solution to the k th <b>ranked</b> <b>element</b> problem [1], and a solution to private keyword search [11] using weaker assumptions than those of [11]. All our solutions assume semi-honest adversarial behaviour. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an online survey and interviews with National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) professionals on their opinion on the essential and most important components of agency NEPA programs. A list of NEPA program components was developed based on a review of books, articles, and papers on {{ways to improve the}} NEPA process. Results of the online survey indicate that all of the listed elements are considered important for an agency NEPA program to be successful. No program element received an average score as high as 3 (somewhat important) and only 2 of the elements received an average score higher than 2 (very important). The highest <b>ranked</b> <b>element</b> (1. critically important) was senior management support for the NEPA process. Interviews with senior NEPA specialists confirmed that senior management support for the NEPA process was critical, and that other critical components flowed from that support. “Senior managers ” were interpreted as being the agency’s senior NEPA manager or the senior manager at each facility, installation, or command. Education was most frequently identified as how agency NEPA staff could develop and maintain consistent senior management support for the NEPA process. The interview sample size was small, an...|$|E

When λ(t) = λ and pi(t) = pi are constant, they simplify to an elementary form. The methods used for the Poisson replacement process apply with some modifications to the case where replacement times are distributed according to an Erlang distribution.

40|$|AbstractWe are {{concerned}} with the definition of means or averaging operators, i. e., aggregators M(x 1,…,xi,…,xm) where xi ϵ R represent measures on the reals corresponding to a given type of scale (ordinal, interval or ratio scale). The adequate mean which varies between min(x 1,…,xm) and max(x 1,…,xm) should correspond to some comparison meaningfulness property or some functional equation that induces invariance or stability. We characterize the averaging operators which present some “natural” properties (continuity, monotonicity, neutrality, unanimity, etc.) and comparison meaningfulness or invariance and we show that operators like order statistics and ordered weighted averaging operators can be used to <b>rank</b> <b>elements</b> defined by vectors (x 1,…,xm) in a meaningful way in the spirit of measurement theory...|$|R

40|$|Integration of {{data from}} {{multiple}} omics platforms {{has become a major}} challenge in studying complex systems and traits. For integrating data from multiple platforms, the underlying spaces from which the top <b>ranked</b> <b>elements</b> come from are likely to be different. Thus, taking the underlying spaces into consideration explicitly is important, as failure to do so would lead to inefficient use of data and might render biases and/or sub-optimal results. We propose two space oriented classes of heuristic algorithms for integrating ranked lists from omic scale data. These algorithms are either Borda inspired or Markov chain based that take the underlying spaces of the individual ranked lists into account explicitly. We applied this set of algorithms to a number of problems, including one that aims at aggregating results from three cDNA and two Affymetrix gene expression studies in which the underlying spaces between Affymetrix and cDNA platforms are clearly different. ...|$|R

This loss is inadequate for tasks like information retrieval where we prefer ranked lists with high precision {{on the top of the}} list.

This conjecture is proved to be true only for all posets of rank 2 [W: 05], some posets of rank 3 [HLS: 09,ENSST: 11], and the very special cases for higher ranks. For general cases, it is still widely open. In this paper, we provide some sufficient conditions on the rank numbers of posets of rank 3 to satisfies the Griggs's conjecuture.

40|$|Top-k queries {{based on}} <b>ranking</b> <b>elements</b> of multidimensional {{datasets}} are a fundamental building block for {{many kinds of}} information discovery. The best known general-purpose algorithm for evaluating top-k queries is Fagin’s threshold algorithm (TA). Since the user’s goal behind top-k queries is to identify {{one or a few}} relevant and novel data items, it is intriguing to use approximate variants of TA to reduce run-time costs. This paper introduces a family of approximate top-k algorithms based on probabilistic arguments. When scanning index lists of the underlying multidimensional data space in descending order of local scores, various forms of convolution and derived bounds are employed to predict when it is safe, with high probability, to drop candidate items and to prune the index scans.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an efficient {{reduction of the}} learning problem of ranking to binary classification. As with a recent result of Balcan et al. [6], the reduction guarantees an average pairwise misranking regret of at most 2 r using a binary classifier with regret r. However, our reduction applies to a broader class of ranking loss functions, admits a simpler proof, and the expected running time complexity of our algorithm in terms of number of calls to a classifier or preference function is improved from Ω(n 2) to O(nlog n). Furthermore, when the top k <b>ranked</b> <b>elements</b> only are required (k ≪ n), as in many applications in information extraction or search engines, the time complexity of our algorithm can be further reduced to O(k log k + n). Our reduction and algorithm are thus practical for realistic applications where the number of points to rank exceeds several thousands. Much of our results also extend beyond the bipartite case previously studied. ...|$|R

40|$|In the {{classical}} theory of operators on a Banach space a beautiful interplay exists between Riesz and Fredholm theory, {{and the theory}} of traces and de¬terminants for operator ideals. In this thesis we obtain a complete Riesz de¬composition theorem for Riesz elements in a semi prime Banach algebra {{and on the other}} hand extend the existing theory of traces and determinants to a more general setting of Banach algebras. In order to obtain some of these results we use the notion of finite multiplicity of spectral points to give a characterization of the essential spec¬trum for elements in a Banach algebra. As an immediate corollary we obtain the well-known characterization of Riesz elements namely that their non-zero spectral points are isolated and of finite multiplicities.

One of the main results in this paper shows that if the feasible set of the problem has a minimum <b>rank</b> <b>element</b> with the least Frobenius norm, then any accumulation point of solutions to the approximation problem, as the approximation parameter tends to zero, is a minimum rank solution of the original problem. The tractability under certain conditions and convex relaxation of the approximation problem are also discussed. An immediate application of this theory to the system of quadratic equations is presented in this paper. It turns out that the condition for such a system without a nonzero solution can be characterized by a rank minimization problem, and thus the proposed approximation theory can be used to establish some sufficient conditions for the system to possess only zero solution...|$|R
