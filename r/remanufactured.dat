Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be <b>remanufactured</b> for the USMC was delivered.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{biomimetic}} design {{method is}} applied to a speci®c problem in design for <b>remanufacture.</b> First summarized is <b>remanufacture</b> as an option to disposal at product end of life, and how products may be designed for ease of <b>remanufacture.</b> Next identi®ed is a contradiction between a design-for-remanufacture strategy and design-for-assembly preferences. Speci®cally, making failure-prone features into separate parts facilitates <b>remanufacture</b> but results in additional parts to assemble. An example involving snap ®ts {{as a method of}} fastening and joining is used to illustrate the contradiction. To obtain ideas on how to address this contradiction, a biomimetic search method was used to ®nd biological phenomena that are analogous to <b>remanufacture.</b> One such phenomenon is described and used to develop a concept that satis®es both design-for-remanufacture and design-for-assembly preferences...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} e!orts towards {{product design}} that facilitates <b>remanufacture.</b> Insights {{on how to}} design products for ease of <b>remanufacture</b> were obtained from literature and collaboration with remanufacturers. The most essential aspect of design for <b>remanufacture</b> was found to con#ict with other design-for-x methodologies, such as design for assembly and design for recycling. Design for <b>remanufacture</b> was therefore viewed {{in the context of}} other life-cycle domains, speci"cally manufacture and assembly, maintenance, and scrap-material recycling. Since fastening and joining issues are common to all these domains, a framework that evaluates the e!ect of joint design on each of these life-cycle stages was developed. This framework estimates the cost of <b>remanufacture</b> relative to other life-cycle costs determined by the joint design, and was applied to case studies of joints that did not facilitat...|$|R

25|$|In early 1996, {{the first}} OH-1 {{prototype}} was rolled out. On 6 August 1996, {{the first of}} four OH-1 prototypes (designated XOH-1) performed the type's maiden flight. All four prototypes were flying by March 1997. The four prototypes were delivered to the Japanese Defence Agency for service testing from June to August 1997. By April 1998, flight testing of the prototypes was reportedly around half way complete, having accumulated a combined 400 flight hours during testing, further tests focused on flight validation, operational evaluation, and mission equipment functionality.

In 1998, the prototypes were <b>remanufactured</b> with this engine, and assigned new serial numbers. Certification was now expected by the fourth quarter of that year, but this date slipped to July 1999, and it was eventually December before Italian RAI certification was awarded.

Boeing said the deal required it to <b>remanufacture</b> two EAV-8Bs, with an option for another seven aircraft; other sources say the total was 11 aircraft. The <b>remanufacture</b> allowed the aircraft to carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMs, enhanced the pilot's situational awareness through the installation of new radar and avionics, and provided a new engine.
