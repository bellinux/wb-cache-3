40|$|OBJECTIVE:: To {{describe}} {{the characteristics of}} patients undergoing multiple groin hernia <b>repairs</b> and to identify strategies that prevent further recurrence. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA:: Although relatively infrequent, recurrent groin hernias where several <b>repairs</b> have previously been undertaken constitutes {{a major problem in}} hernia surgery. Low numbers and heterogeneity have made it difficult to perform large prospective studies on this group. METHODS:: The study was designed as an observational population-based register study. All <b>repairs</b> for recurrent hernia recorded in the Swedish Hernia Register (SHR) 1992 - 2006 were identified. Risk for reoperation by number of previous <b>repairs,</b> with adjustment for gender and age, and risk for reoperation by unit responsible for previous <b>repair</b> were determined using Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS:: There were 12, 104 cases of hernia <b>repaired</b> once, 2 <b>repairs</b> in 4199 cases, 3 <b>repairs</b> in 310 cases, 4 <b>repairs</b> in 32 cases, and 5 <b>repairs</b> in 3 cases. The risk for further reoperation increased with the number of previous <b>repairs</b> (P < 0. 001). The hazard ratios for reoperation following open preperitoneal mesh <b>repair</b> and laparoscopic <b>repair</b> decreased; whereas, the hazard ratio for sutured <b>repair</b> increased with the number of previous <b>repairs.</b> The difference between Lichtenstein <b>repair</b> and laparoscopic <b>repair</b> was significant for the first 2 <b>repairs</b> (P < 0. 05).

Both low stiffness <b>repair</b> materials of elastic modulus, E-rm, less than the substrate E-sub, and high stiffness <b>repair</b> materials (E-rm > E-sub) were used. The <b>repairs</b> were applied in the tensile zone of the beams.

Such <b>repairs</b> ave less plane to restrained shrinkage cracking and show a capacity for load redistribution into the <b>repair</b> patch. Low stiffness <b>repairs</b> (E-rm < E-sub), on the other hand, are prone to restrained shrinkage cracking and are ineffective in load-sharing with the substrate. <b>Repairs</b> to propped flexural members developed erratic and non-uniform load distribution in the different phases upon reapplication of load.

5|$|Although the {{structures}} of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are very different, at least some functions are interrelated. The proteins made by both genes are essential for <b>repairing</b> damaged DNA (see Figure of recombinational repair steps). BRCA2 binds the single strand DNA and directly interacts with the recombinase RAD51 to stimulate strand invasion a vital step of homologous recombination. The localization of RAD51 to the DNA double-strand break requires the formation of BRCA1-PALB2-BRCA2 complex. PALB2 (Partner and localizer of BRCA2) can function synergistically with a BRCA2 chimera (termed piccolo, or piBRCA2) to further promote strand invasion. These breaks {{can be caused by}} natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, but also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material during a special type of cell division that creates sperm and eggs (meiosis). Double strand breaks are also generated during repair of DNA cross links. By <b>repairing</b> DNA, these proteins play a role in maintaining the stability of the human genome and prevent dangerous gene rearrangements that can lead to hematologic and other cancers.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{replication}} is for {{the most}} part extremely accurate, however errors (mutations) do occur. The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10−8 per nucleotide per replication, whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10−3. This means that each generation, each human genome accumulates 1–2 new mutations. Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and frameshift mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted. Either of these mutations can change the gene by missense (change a codon to encode a different amino acid) or nonsense (a premature stop codon). Larger mutations can be caused by errors in recombination to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the duplication, deletion, rearrangement or inversion of large sections of a chromosome. Additionally, DNA repair mechanisms can introduce mutational errors when <b>repairing</b> physical damage to the molecule. The repair, even with mutation, is more important to survival than restoring an exact copy, for example when <b>repairing</b> double-strand breaks.|$|E
