It {{is an example of}} a {{structure}} built for nobility, half containing a defensive character, and the other half being <b>residential.</b> The original <b>nucleus</b> is a medieval square tower, built in the 14th century, which forms part of the current palace. In the 15 century, a cubic structure was added to the tower. Its present aspect was completed during the early years of the 16th century, centered on the palace section.|$|R
40|$|ENG: The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{contribute}} with new topics to {{the knowledge of the}} suburban sprawl that took place in Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area between 1910 and 1940. In the context of a broad process of modernization – including territorial transformation along with the expansion of the highway network and tourism-, we pretend to analyze the construction of <b>residential</b> suburban <b>nuclei</b> inhabited by middle and high income population. We will focus in the relation between two processes: on the one hand, the material development going on in these nuclei and on the other a growing interest showed by the media which contribute to the diffusion of this phenomenon. Apparently, high income suburbs only comprehended a small portion in the metropolitan scenario, in spite of what; they acquired a broader cultural relevance facilitating the erection of an urban imaginary among broader portions of society. Finally, this tour will provide us with the opportunity to set the dimension of private enterprise and individual development {{in the construction of the}} territory...|$|R

50|$|The United States Census Bureau {{defines a}} place as a {{concentration}} of population which has a name, is locally recognized, and {{is not part of}} any other place. A place typically has a <b>residential</b> <b>nucleus</b> and a closely spaced street pattern, and it frequently includes commercial property and other urban land uses. A place may be an incorporated place (a self-governing city, town, or village) or it may be a census-designated place (CDP). Incorporated places are defined by the laws of the states in which they are contained. The Census Bureau delineates CDPs. A small settlement in the open countryside or the densely settled fringe of a large city may not be {{a place as}} defined by the Census Bureau. As of the 1990 Census, only 26% {{of the people in the}} United States lived outside of places.|$|E

C., located outdoors and indoors of ritual buildings, as well as in some storage-pits, often with animal offerings, human skulls pierced by nails and jaws. &# 13; The association with cutheads shows that the closest cultural parallels are in the celtic world, specially between southern gal communities {{from the end of the}} Iron Age, although possible connections with greek spoils are also pointed out in this paper. El estudio arqueometalúrgico de algunas espadas de tipo céltico y de un puñal celtibérico férricos localizados en núcleos residenciales ibéricos catalanes constata que fueron amortizados intencionalmente para exhibirlos clavados sobre un soporte. &# 13; Han aparecido en el interior y exterior de edificios de uso ritual, así como en silos, en niveles de los s. 111 y 11 a. c., a menudo junto a ofrendas faunísticas, cráneos humanos atravesados por clavos o mandíbulas sueltas. Su asociación con el ritual de las cabezas cortadas indica que los paralelos culturales más próximos se hallan en el mundo céltico, especialmente entre las comunidades galas del Golfo de León de finales de la edad del hierro, pero se analizan también sus posibles conexiones con los trofeos griegos...|$|E
