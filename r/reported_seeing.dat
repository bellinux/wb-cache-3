5|$|People on {{the ground}} <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> a —a {{brilliant}} flash of light—followed by a —a loud booming sound. Some 70,000–80,000 people, or around 30% {{of the population of}} Hiroshima, were killed by the blast and resultant firestorm, and another 70,000 injured. Perhaps as many as 20,000 Japanese military personnel were killed.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> a {{parachute}} drifting {{away from the}} falling F-100F, leading to the hope that a pilot had ejected, but when the parachute was located it {{was determined to be}} a drag parachute that is meant to be deployed on landing to help slow the fighter down.|$|E
5|$|At 01:00 on 25 April the British ships {{stopped at}} sea, and thirty-six rowing boats towed by twelve steamers {{embarked}} {{the first six}} companies, two each from the 9th, 10th and 11th Battalions. At 02:00 a Turkish sentry <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> ships moving at sea, and at 02:30 the report was sent to 9th Division's headquarters. At 02:53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03:30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards (46m) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars.|$|E

5|$|In August 2009, after {{dozens of}} people <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> a mermaid leaping out of Haifa Bay waters and doing aerial tricks, the Israeli coastal town of Kiryat Yam offered a $1 million award for proof of its existence. In February 2012, work on two {{reservoirs}} near Gokwe and Mutare in Zimbabwe stopped when workers refused to continue, stating that mermaids had hounded {{them away from the}} sites. It was reported by Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, the water resources minister.|$|E
5|$|One notable amateur {{observation}} was {{by students}} from schools in Hawaii, working with US and UK scientists, who during {{the press conference}} took live images using the Faulkes Automatic Telescope in Hawaii (the students operated the telescope over the Internet) and {{were one of the}} first groups to get images of the impact. One amateur astronomer <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> a structureless bright cloud around the comet, and an estimated 2magnitude increase in brightness after the impact. Another amateur published a map of the crash area from NASA images.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury threw open his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E

5|$|Bales burned {{some of the}} victims' bodies, an act {{considered}} desecration under Islamic law. Witnesses {{said that}} the eleven corpses from one family were shot in the head, stabbed, then gathered into one room and set on fire. A pile of ashes {{was found on the}} floor of one victims' house; at least one child's body was found partially charred. A reporter for The New York Times inspected the children's bodies taken to a nearby American military base and <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> burns on some of the legs and heads.|$|E
5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} {{within range of}} German surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed to provide an escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E
5|$|Leutnants Rüdenberg and Bellen had {{returned}} to base, as had {{the rest of the}} Jasta 10 pilots. The only one with news was Heldmann, who reported Voss headed toward British lines while pursued by a British SE.5. Timm and Rueser waited anxiously for his return as the sun set. The fact that Voss was missing in action was communicated to wing headquarters; telephone queries were made of all friendly airfields within range. Late that night, a German frontline unit <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> six British machines shoot down a lone German aircraft that fell within the British trenches. Heldmann refused to believe Voss was killed in aerial combat; he claimed Voss had to have been shot after crawling from the wreckage.|$|E

5|$|On August 9, 1898, American {{troops that}} were {{pursuing}} units retreating from Coamo encountered heavy resistance in Aibonito and retreated after six of their soldiers were injured. They returned three days later, reinforced with artillery units and attempted a surprise attack. In the subsequent crossfire, confused soldiers <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> Spanish reinforcements nearby and five American officers were gravely injured, which prompted a retreat order. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting {{on behalf of}} the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.|$|E
5|$|Stokes {{explicitly}} {{stated the}} tammar wallaby to be absent from North Island in 1840, {{and it was}} not recorded by the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition in 1913. It was apparently introduced to the island in the 1920s, as early fishermen <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> it between 1928 and 1930. This introduction failed, possibly due to overgrazing. The species was not found by Serventy during his 1945 visit, nor by Storr in 1959, but the latter found plenty of remains, mostly mandibles. Storr interpreted these remains as predating the 1920s introduction, suggesting that a native population of tammars became extinct on the island before 1840. Albert Russell Main agreed, but the theory has not been accepted by later researchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reports from}} the crash site speculated that the Amana was already on fire when it struck the tops of trees because those trees, and pieces of the aircraft's left wing torn off in the impact with them, showed signs of scorching. Several eyewitnesses <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> flames in the sky before the aircraft struck the ground. Department of Civil Aviation investigators discounted this speculation because {{only one of the}} Amana's push-button engine fire extinguishers had activated and this had most likely occurred during the crash or the fire.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} 7:00p.m. local time {{in what was}} initially {{believed to be a}} room where sugar was bagged by workers. Witnesses from across the Savannah River in South Carolina <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> flames shoot up several stories high. There were 112 employees on-site at the time. The explosion occurred {{in the center of the}} refinery, where bagging and storage facilities were fed completed product by a network of elevators and conveyor belts. Many of the buildings here were six to eight stories high with narrow gaps in between.|$|E
5|$|The lobby guard {{returned}} {{a call to}} the alarm monitoring service, which had called when the alarm initially went off to confirm that there was a fire, but never called the Philadelphia Fire Department. The first call came from someone on the street who saw smoke coming from the building. During the first 911 call, at about 8:27 PM, the alarm company alerted the fire department to the fire. Engine 43 was the first firefighting unit to arrive at the scene and <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> heavy smoke and flames in one of the windows. As firefighters started fighting the fire it had grown with flames breaking through windows and lapping {{up the side of the}} building.|$|E
5|$|The unusual {{behaviour}} of {{the bombers}} concerned Kapitän zur See Mecke. At 00:00 on 28 March, {{he issued a}} warning {{that there might be}} a parachute landing in progress. At 01:00 on 28 March, he followed up by ordering all guns to cease firing and searchlights to be extinguished in case the bombers were using them to locate the port. Everyone was placed on a heightened state of alert. The harbour defence companies and ships' crews were ordered out of the air raid shelters. During all this a lookout <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> some activity out at sea, so Mecke began suspecting some type of landing and ordered extra attention to be paid to the approaches to the harbour.|$|E

5|$|Weidling {{had given}} the order for the {{survivors}} to break out to the north-west; the plan got underway at around 23:00. The first group from the Reich Chancellery, led by Mohnke, tried but could not break through the Soviet rings and was captured the next day. Like others from the Führerbunker who were captured, he was interrogated by SMERSH. On the third break-out attempt from the Reich Chancellery, made around 01:00 (2 May), Bormann managed to cross the Spree. Arthur Axmann, who followed the same route, <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> Bormann's body {{a short distance from}} the Weidendammer bridge.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a very loud, high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents <b>reported</b> <b>seeing</b> Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
