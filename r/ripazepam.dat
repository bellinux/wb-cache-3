50|$|<b>Ripazepam</b> is a pyrazolodiazepinone {{derivative}} structurally {{related to}} certain benzodiazepine drugs, especially zolazepam. It has anxiolytic effects.|$|E
40|$|The {{carcinogenesis}} {{potential of}} <b>ripazepam,</b> a benzodiazepine derivative, was studied in {{mice and rats}} for 78 and 104 weeks, respectively. Groups of 50 male and 50 female CD 1 mice and CD rats each were given doses of 15 and 150 mg/kg of <b>ripazepam</b> in the diet. Survival rates were adequate for statistical analysis. Significant suppression of body weight gains occurred in rats but not in mice given 150 mg/kg/day. The compound failed to increase tumor rates or alter the average latency of neoplasms in the rat. In mice, the number of male animals with tumors was increased at 150 mg/kg and this was related to {{a significant increase in}} the number of animals with hepatocellular tumors. Hepatocellular tumors were increased also in female mice but the increase was not statistically significant. All but one of these hepatic neoplasms were hepatocellular adenomas and the one carcinoma had not metastasized. Other tumor types were not increased...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{isomeric}} title compds. I (R = H, halo, Me, NO 2, Ph, MeO) were prepd. by {{reaction of the}} appropriate Î±-aminophenyl ketone with 2, 7 -dimethyl- 3, 8 -dinitrodipyrazolo[1, 5 -a: 1 ', 5 '-d]pyrazine- 4, 9 -dione [80030 - 73 - 5] and tested {{for their ability to}} bind to benzodiazepine receptors of rat cerebral cortex synaptic membranes. All I displayed affinities for the benzodiazepine receptors in the micromolar range; in particular I (R = H) [94993 - 75 - 6] displayed an affinity for the receptors which was practically comparable to its structural isomer <b>ripazepam,</b> and to that of chlordiazepoxide, although the potency of binding was 2 orders of magnitude less than that of diazepam...|$|E
40|$|This sixty-sixth {{volume of}} lARC MOl 1 ographs {{comprises}} evaluations {{on a number}} of pharmaceutical drugs. Pharmaceutical drugs were considered previously in Volumes 13, 24 and 50 and Supplement 7 of the MOl 1 ographs series (IARC, 1977, 1980, 1987, 1990). Several of the compounds- diazepam, oxazepam, clofibrate and phenytoin- have been evaluated by previous working groups. Ail available relevant data including mechanistic data on these compounds are included in the new evaluations. The primary objective of the evaluation process in IARC MOl 1 ographs is hazard or risk identification, although protective effects on cancer occurrence, where pertinent, have been mentioned in the monographs. Several of the pharmaceuticals considered in this volume are benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine analogues. This class of drugs has been extensively prescribed since the late 1950 s for the treatment of anxiety and as sedatives or anticonvulsants, and for other conditions. The specific drugs of this type considered in this volume are diazepam, doxefazepam, estazolam, oxazepam, prazepam, <b>ripazepam</b> and temazepam. ln addition, a diphenylhydantoin, phel 1 ytoil 1, which is another anticonvulsant, was evaluated in thi...|$|E
