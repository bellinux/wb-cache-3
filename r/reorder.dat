5|$|The {{drive to}} use housing to {{transform}} and <b>reorder</b> society subsided in the 1970s. The 1980s saw {{the growth of}} speculative house building by developers. These introduced English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland, which had been largely unknown before this period. Many were small and built to minimum standards with little regard to energy or environmental issues. Sales of council houses were popular in Scotland and until the mid-1990s, unlike in England, local authorities could use the whole of their capital receipts for development, including the building of new houses. Under the Scottish Assembly, Scottish Homes was abolished and replaced by Communities Scotland in 2001, which had a responsibility to provide affordable housing and environmental improvement. In 2011 it was in turn replaced by the Scottish Housing Regulator, whose remit includes Scottish local authority landlords.|$|E
5|$|With the {{infantry}} heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked {{its way across}} the Nebel. After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, Prince Maximilian of Hanover, were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the Nebel in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and <b>reorder</b> their ranks. However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the Nebel. Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We have {{analyzed}} the {{measurements of the}} end-to-end packet <b>reordering</b> by tracing UDP packets between 12 testboxes of RIPE NCC. We showed that <b>reordering</b> quite often happens in Internet. For bursts of 50 100 -byte UDP packets, there were about 56 % of all the streams arrived at the destinations out-of-order. We studied {{the extent of the}} <b>reordering</b> in these streams, and observed that most <b>reordered</b> streams have a relative small number of <b>reordered</b> packets: about 14 % of all the streams have more than 2 <b>reordered</b> packets in a bursts of 50 UDP packets. In addition, we showed that packet <b>reordering</b> has a significant impact on UDP performance since <b>reordering</b> adds a high cost of recovering from the <b>reordering</b> on the end host. On the other hand, packet <b>reordering</b> does not {{have a significant impact on}} the UDP delay.

40|$|Word <b>reordering</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} aspects of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), and an important factor of its quality and efficiency. While short and medium-range <b>reordering</b> is reasonably handled by the phrase-based approach (PSMT), long-range <b>reordering</b> still represents a challenge for state-of-the-art PSMT systems. As a major cause of this problem, we point out the inadequacy of existing <b>reordering</b> constraints and models to cope with the <b>reordering</b> phenomena occurring between distant languages. On one hand, the <b>reordering</b> constraints used to control translation complexity appear to be too coarse-grained. On the other hand, the <b>reordering</b> models used to score different <b>reordering</b> decisions during translation are not discriminative enough to effectively guide the search over very large sets of hypotheses. In this thesis we propose several techniques to improve the definition of the <b>reordering</b> search space in PSMT by exploiting prior linguistic knowledge, so that long-range <b>reordering</b> may be adequately handled without sacrificing efficiency. In particular, we focus on Arabic-English and German-English: two language pairs characterized by uneven distributions of <b>reordering</b> phenomena, with long-range movements concentrating on few patterns. All our techniques aim at improving the definition of the <b>reordering</b> search space by exploiting prior linguistic knowledge, but they do this with different means: namely, chunk-based <b>reordering</b> rules and word <b>reordering</b> lattices, modified distortion matrices and early <b>reordering</b> pruning. Through extensive experiments, we show that our techniques can significantly advance the state of the art in PSMT for these challenging language pairs. When compared with a popoular tree-based SMT approach, our best PSMT systems achieve comparable or higher <b>reordering</b> accuracies while being considerably faster...|$|R

As Nivasch shows, the items with this technique can be maintained using a stack data structure, and each successive sequence value need be compared only {{to the top of the}} stack. The algorithm terminates when the repeated sequence element with smallest value is found. Running the same algorithm with multiple stacks, using random permutations of the values to <b>reorder</b> the values within each stack, allows a time–space tradeoff similar to the previous algorithms. However, even the version of this algorithm with a single stack is not a pointer algorithm, due to the comparisons needed to determine which of two values is smaller.|$|E

25|$|Almost all of {{the organic}} {{hydrogen}} is exchangeable to some extent. Isotopic exchange of organic hydrogen will <b>reorder</b> the distribution of deuterium and often incorporate external hydrogen. Generally, more mature materials are more substantially exchanged. With effective exchange, aliphatic hydrogen can finally reach isotopic equilibrium at the final stage. Equilibrium fractionation factor varies among different hydrogen sites. For example, aliphatic hydrogen isotope fractionation depends on the carbon atom that the hydrogen atom bonds with. To the first order, alkyl hydrogen isotope composition follows this trend: δDPrimary carbon < δDSecondary carbon < δDTertiary carbon. The fractionation factors between carbon sites also decrease with increasing temperature. This can be potentially used as a thermo-history indicator. The fractionation between whole molecule and water can be estimated by averaging all hydrogen-positions, and {{this leads to a}} relatively small variation of equilibrium fractionation between different groups of hydrocarbons and water. A theoretical prediction estimated this to be -80‰ to -95‰ for steranes, -90‰ to -95‰ for hopanes, and -70‰ to -95‰ for typical cycloparaffins between 0°C to 100°C. At the temperature of the oil window and gas window, the equilibrium fractionation between different group of organic molecules is relatively small, as compared with large primary signals.|$|E

By capturing non-local <b>reordering</b> phenomena, our proposed alignment model bears a closer resemblance to stateof-the-art translation model.
