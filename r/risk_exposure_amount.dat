In a large sample of funds, we find substantial evidence that hedge fund <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> vary across and within months, and that capturing within-month variation {{is more important}} for hedge funds than for mutual funds. We consider different within-month functional forms, and uncover patterns such as day-of-the-month variation in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> We also find that changes in portfolio allocations, rather than changes in the <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> of the underlying assets, are the main drivers of hedge funds' <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> variation. beta; hedge funds; mutual funds; performance evaluation; time-varying risk; window-dressing...|$|R

In a study of large US and international banks, we show that (1) the main driving force of bank risk disclosures is the shifts in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> (2) changes in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are negatively correlated with volatility changes, which suggests that banks reduce risk taking when volatility increases, and that (3) changes in <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are positively correlated among banks, {{which is consistent with}} banks exhibiting herding behavior in trading...|$|R
40|$|Firm-level <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> {{and costs}} of equity are {{notoriously}} difficult to estimate. Using a novel approach mapping consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> to firm characteristics, we combine the traditional portfolio-level approach to testing asset pricing models with firm-level information to measure firm-level <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> First, at the portfolio level, we investigate the empirical performance of a simple two-factor consumption-based asset pricing model for the cross-section of equity returns. The priced factors in the model are innovations in the growth and volatility of aggregate consumption. Our empirical results show that this model can explain 66 % of the cross-sectional variation in returns on a menu of 55 portfolios spanning size, value, momentum, asset growth, stock issuance, and accruals. Second, we use the estimated model to map point-in-time firm characteristics to consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> Through this measurement procedure, we uncover sizeable cross-sectional and time-series variation in firm consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> We verify that sorting on these ex ante consumption <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> produces portfolios with consistent ex post <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> and predicts cross-sectional variation in future firm equity returns...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} issue in global corporate risk management {{is whether the}} multinationality of a firm matters {{in terms of its}} effect on exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> In this paper, we examine the exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> of US firms during 1983 - 2006, comparing multinational and non-multinational firms and focusing on the role of operational hedging. Since MNCs and non-multinationals differ in size and other characteristics, we construct matched samples of MNCs and non-multinationals based on the propensity score method. We find that the multinationality in fact matters for a firm's exchange exposure but not in the way usually presumed - the exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are actually smaller and less significant for MNCs than non-multinationals. The results are robust with respect to different samples and model specifications. There is evidence that operational hedging decreases a firm's exchange <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> and increases its stock returns.

This is because risk sharing implies redistribution, as lucky individuals support the unlucky ones. We hypothesize that responsibility for risky choices decreases individuals’ willingness to share risk by dampening redistribution motives, and investigate this conjecture with a laboratory experiment. Responsibility {{is created by}} allowing participants to choose between two different risky lotteries before they decide how much risk they share with a randomly matched partner. Risk sharing is then compared to a treatment where <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> is randomly assigned.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we examine}} the impact of the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks on the risk management of insurance companies, and investigate whether these companies are more likely to use derivatives to hedge their market risk after the attack. We test whether insurer's market <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are lower after 2001. We then study how the companies' market <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> and their use of derivatives are affected by different firm characteristics. We also survey privately owned insurers to determine the importance of derivatives in their risk management, and how they responded to the terrorist attacks. By looking at insurers' quarterly and annual market <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> it is found that there is no discernible difference between property/casualty and life/health insurers during the period studied, and that the fluctuations and trend of their <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are very similar. Our examination of quarterly market <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> shows that except for equity <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> which is found to be increasing, we do not have strong evidence to show that insurers' market <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> are lower after 2001. Although the survey results show that some users of derivatives increase their use of these hedging tools, results from a regression analysis do not show strong support for the hypothesis that insurers are more likely to hedge with derivatives after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. We conclude that the terrorist attacks have prompted changes in risk management and operation strategies of some insurers, but have not increased the likelihood that insurers will use derivatives in risk management...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} sample size {{calculation}} for population-based longitudinal studies tend to overestimate the statistical power by overlooking important determinants {{of the required}} sample size, such as the measurement errors and unmeasured etiological determinants, etc. In contrast, a simulation-based sample size calculation, if designed properly, allows these determinants {{to be taken into}} account and offers flexibility in accommodating complex study design features. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) is a Canada-wide, 20 -year follow-up study of 30, 000 people between the ages of 45 and 85 years, with in-depth information collected every 3 years. A simulation study, based on an illness-death model, was conducted to: (1) investigate the statistical power profile of the CLSA to detect the effect of environmental and genetic risk factors, and their interaction on age-related chronic diseases; and (2) explore the design alternatives and implementation strategies for increasing the statistical power of population-based longitudinal studies in general. The results showed that the statistical power to identify the effect of environmental and genetic <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> and their interaction on a disease was boosted when: (1) the prevalence of the <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> increased; (2) the disease of interest is relatively common in the population; and (3) <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> were measured accurately. In addition, the frequency of data collection every three years in the CLSA led to a slightly lower statistical power compared to the design assuming that participants underwent health monitoring continuously. The CLSA had sufficient power to detect a small (1 <hazard ratio (HR) ≤ 1. 5) or moderate effect (1. 5 < HR≤ 2. 0) of the environmental <b>risk</b> <b>exposure,</b> as long as the <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> and the disease of interest were not rare. It had enough power to detect a moderate or large (2. 0 <HR≤ 3. 0) effect of the genetic <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> when the prevalence of the <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> was not very low (≥ 0. 1) and the disease of interest was not rare (such as diabetes and dementia). The CLSA had enough power to detect a large effect of the gene-environment interaction only when both <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> had relatively high prevalence (0. 2) and the disease of interest was very common (such as diabetes). The minimum detectable hazard ratios (MDHR) of the CLSA for the environmental and genetic <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> obtained from this simulation study were larger than those calculated according to the conventional sample size calculation method. For example, the MDHR for the environmental <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> was 1. 15 according to the conventional method if the prevalence of the <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> was 0. 1 and the disease of interest was dementia. In contrast, the MDHR was 1. 61 if the same exposure was measured every 3 years with a misclassification rate of 0. 1 according to this simulation study. With a given sample size, higher statistical power could be achieved by increasing the measuring frequency in participants with high risk of declining health status or changing <b>risk</b> <b>exposures,</b> and by increasing measurement accuracy of diseases and <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> A properly designed simulation-based sample size calculation is superior to conventional methods when rigorous sample size calculation is necessary...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role played}} by derivatives in determining the interest rate sensitivity of bank holding companies' (BHCs') common stock, controlling for the influence of on-balance sheet activities and other bank-specific characteristics. The major result of the analysis suggests that derivatives have {{played a significant role in}} shaping banks' interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> in recent years. For the typical bank holding company in the sample, increases in the use of interest rate derivatives corresponded to greater interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> during the 1991 - 94 period. This relationship is particularly strong for bank holding companies that serve as derivatives dealers and for smaller, enduser BHCs. During earlier years, however, there is no significant relationship between the extent of derivatives activities and interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposure.</b> There are two plausible interpretations of the relationship between interest rate derivative activity and interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> in the latter part of the sample period: one interpretation suggests that derivatives tend to enhance interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> for the typical BHC in the sample, while the other suggests that derivatives may be used to partially offset high interest rate <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> arising from other activities.

Non-linearity in the interest rate term structure is captured by the three-factor model of interest rate level, slope, and curvature.

Small banks and insurance companies have a positive <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> to the slope factor, while real estate firms have a negative <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> to the curvature factor.

40|$|Smoking in {{pregnancy}} {{is a major}} determinant of low birthweight and a range of adverse infant health outcomes. There is a well-established social gradient in smoking {{in pregnancy}} in the US and northern Europe. Social gradients in health-related behaviours may result from longitudinal accumulation and cross-sectional clustering of social <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> There is, however, no published confirmation of this explanation in empirical data with smoking in pregnancy as the outcome. This study aimed to test the effects of longitudinal accumulation and cross-sectional clustering of social <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> on smoking in pregnancy using data on the first pregnancies of 3163 female members of the 1958 British national cohort. Social class at birth and aged 11 years was used to create three dichotomous variables representing cumulative social class (both manual, one manual and one non-manual, both non-manual) early in the lifecourse. Cross-sectional clustering of social risk was represented by four dichotomous variables created from combinations of maternal age (< 20 vs. 20 +), own social class (manual vs. non-manual) and educational attainment (low vs. other). Cumulative social class in early childhood was associated with smoking in pregnancy in bivariate analysis but not after adjustment for cross-sectional clustering of social <b>risk</b> <b>exposures.</b> However, women {{who had been in the}} manual social groups at birth and 11 years were at increased risk of cross-sectional clustering of social <b>risk</b> <b>exposures</b> around pregnancy suggesting a pathway from early lifecourse <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> to social <b>risk</b> factors associated with a high risk of smoking in pregnancy.

Farmers that are better informed may value less the option to wait to adapt, and so are more likely to adapt than other farmers. adaptation, climate change, endogenous switching, Ethiopia, <b>risk</b> <b>exposure,</b> stochastic production function, skewness, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy, Risk and Uncertainty, D 80, Q 18, Q 54,...|$|R

We find that there is significant variation in the liquidity <b>risk</b> <b>exposure</b> of these “liquid” funds. Within this group of funds, those that embrace liquidity risk outperform those that eschew liquidity risk by 4. 86 percent per year. As a consequence of the liquidity <b>risk</b> <b>exposure,</b> funds experiencing outflows subsequently earn lower returns than funds receiving inflows. The effects of flows are more pronounced for funds employing leverage, for funds with high liquidity <b>risk</b> <b>exposure,</b> and during a liquidity crunch. These results underscore the importance of funding liquidity (the ease with which traders can obtain capital) and shed light on the asset-liability mismatch in the hedge fund industry...|$|R
