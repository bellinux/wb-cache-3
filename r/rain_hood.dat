5000|$|US&S first {{patented}} the Model 15A Highway {{crossing bell}} on February 20, 1917. The bell has been {{commonly referred to}} as the [...] "Teardrop" [...] bell by railroaders and signal fans alike because of its unique shape and thus the name has stuck. This bell has appeared on advertising literature for railroad signals {{as far back as the}} 1920s as far abroad as Chile and Italy on early wig wag crossings and flashers. There have been subtle variations in the Teardrop bell over the years ranging from different sized electric coils, inclusion of the patent date on the <b>rain</b> <b>hood,</b> as well as a very early version with a less characteristic <b>rain</b> <b>hood</b> that simply read [...] "UNION, patent pending." [...] This is the most commonly seen variation of the Teardrop. This bell is treasured by many for its slow low pitched ring at an irregular cadence. The production of this bell was discontinued sometime by the 1960s, but WABCO carried replacement castings and service manuals into the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Today, fashion hoods are {{generally}} soft headcoverings which {{form part of}} robbing a larger garment (e.g. an overcoat, shirt or cloak; an exception is a <b>rain</b> <b>hood</b> which {{is not part of}} a larger garment). They can be pulled up over the head when needed, or left to hang down the back when not. They may also be detachable to turn a winter overcoat into a summer one, or may be designed to be folded or rolled into a small pocket in the neck of the garment when not in use.|$|E
50|$|The {{windows and}} their {{openings}} {{make a major}} contribution {{to the character of}} the church. Those of the nave have stone block mullions with simple feathering. They are crossed braced with transoms with triangles above formed by simple canted stone. The small windows of the tower show a distinct Saxon influence, directly quoting St Peter's Church, Barton-upon-Humber. The openings are spanned by two stones meeting at the apex. They project forward to form a <b>rain</b> <b>hood.</b> In the chancel the tracery is more complex with stepped 'capitals' formed by three blocks in the lower tracery each faintly suggesting the Crucifixion. The windows are glazed in Prior's Early English Glass, except for the chancel east window and the Lady Chapel. The iron glazing bars were made by Priestman's yard.|$|E

25|$|At 4 p.m., Cheatham, on Shy's Hill, {{was under}} assault from three sides, and his corps broke and {{fled to the}} rear. Wood took this {{opportunity}} to renew his attack on Lee on Overton's Hill, {{and this time the}} momentum was overwhelming. Darkness fell, and heavy <b>rain</b> began. <b>Hood</b> collected his forces and withdrew to the south toward Franklin.|$|R
50|$|She brought Tonga to {{international}} attention when, during her sole visit to Europe, she attended the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London. During the coronation procession, {{it began to}} <b>rain</b> and <b>hoods</b> {{were placed on the}} carriages in the procession. As Tongan custom dictates that one should not imitate the actions of person they are honouring, she refused a hood and rode through the pouring rain in an open carriage, endearing herself to spectators. She served as Chairman of the Tonga Traditions Committee 1954-1965 and patronised the Tonga Red Cross Society.|$|R
50|$|Letter Box Study Group {{identifiers}} {{appear in}} brackets. The first pillar box was erected in the Channel Islands in 1852 {{and it was}} soon realised that, while successful, pillar boxes were expensive to manufacture and sometimes difficult to site. A box which could be recessed into a wall was preferred in rural areas where no pavement or street lighting existed. The First National Standard (WB74) design {{was made by the}} Birmingham, UK firm of Smith & Hawkes Ltd. and the first boxes were installed in 1857. Today, around 10 survive, mostly in the West Country and West Midlands of Great Britain.The design was seen to have several flaws which led to unacceptable ingress of water when in use in the wet British climate. A modified version, The Second National Standard (WB75 and WB76), debuted in 1859 and was more successful. A pedimented top and a large <b>rain</b> <b>hood</b> helped to keep water out of the box. Drainage holes were provided at the base to enable accumulated water to drain away easily. The doors of these two boxes were rather small and set high up the front of the box, which made clearing them awkward.|$|E
