40|$|Most {{research}} using the stress process model finds a path between stressors, {{sense of control}} and distress. This path infers that we experience stress, cognitively assess the situation, and then feel depressed. Another theoretical argument put forth is that our objective conditions and level of distress may color our cognitions. In other words, sometimes we feel depressed and this {{makes it difficult to}} feel in control. This study set out to uncover the complex associations between stressors, resources, and outcomes by testing for a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>path</b> in the stress process model between sense of control and various outcomes such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. To test this model, I performed a path analysis with prospective data (N = 1, 735) from a natural disaster. Overall, I found support for the theoretical model and evidence for a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>path</b> between sense of control, depression, and anxiety. The flood increased hardship and symptoms for depression, and was positively associated with social support, anxiety and PTSD. The flood had an indirect effect on sense of control through depression and anxiety. In addition to the path model, I also tested for interaction effects and discovered that sense of control was critical for determining the level of mental health symptoms respondents felt in response to the flood. ...|$|E

40|$|If the {{accuracy}} of the Omega Navigation System were to be limited at all times solely by unpredictable propagation disturbances, the relative timing with which the signals are transmitted must be controlled to an accuracy of less than 0. 5 microsec-onds. Tests of VLF signal trammissions over long distances have established that the timing stability of such signals will exceed one microsecond for a t least some pe-riod of time. Prior to 1972 the Naval Electronic Laboratory Center (NELC) now the Naval Ocean System Center (NOSC) was the synchronization control center for Omega and made the necessary calculations and adjustments using <b>reciprocal</b> <b>path</b> measure-ments. However, without external measurements the mean system "walkedn from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). After the U. S. Coast Guard and the Japanese Maritime Safety Agency (JMSA) became responsible for the synchronization of the Omega system a more sophisticated technique was developed. This method still re-lied on a <b>reciprocal</b> <b>path</b> technique, but also included a statistical filter which tracked each cesium frequency standard a t the transmitting stations and computed optimal phase adjustments based on internal path measurements. In 1977 with seven of the eight network stations on-line, external measurement source such as LORAN-C and portable clock measurements tied the Omega system to UTC time. In November 1985 Global Positioning System (GPS) data from Omega station Liberia was used {{for the first time as}} an external input to the existing Synchronization software package. By early 1987 GPS monitor receivers were installed at all the Omega Transmitting Sta-tions.

Background The evaluation of symptom clusters is a new field of scientific inquiry directed toward more focused symptom management. Yet, {{little is known about}} relationships between symptom clusters, predictors, and the synergistic effect of multiple symptoms on outcomes. Design Cross-sectional. Methods Data were collected from 436 patients with advanced stages of chronic kidney disease during July 2013 - February 2014 using validated measures of symptom burden and quality of life. Analysis involved structural equation modeling. Results: The final model demonstrated good fit with the data and provided strong evidence for the predicted relationships. Psychological distress, stage of chronic kidney disease, and age explained most of the variance in symptom experience. Symptom clusters had a strong negative effect on quality of life, with fatigue, sexual symptoms and restless legs being the strongest predictors.

Methods: In a prospective inception cohort study, 221 primary care patients with acute or subacute LBP were assessed at the time of initial consultation and then followed up at three and six weeks. Key measures were depressive symptoms (modified Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale) and LBP (sensory pain, present pain index and visual analogue scale of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire). Results: When only cross-lagged effects of six weeks were tested, a reciprocal positive relationship between LBP and depressive symptoms was shown in a cross-lagged structural equation model (β[*]=[*]. 15 and. 17, p[*]<[*]. 01). When lagged <b>reciprocal</b> <b>paths</b> at three- and six-week follow-up were tested, depressive symptoms at the time of consultation predicted higher LBP severity after three weeks (β[*]=[*]. 23, p[*]<[*]. 01).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the relations among attachment, offline coping, online coping, and adjustment, as well as to evaluate whether the rich-get-richer or social compensation hypotheses of Internet use explained these relations. Undergraduate students aged 17 to 25 years (N = 296) completed online measures of their Internet and Facebook use, attachment anxiety and avoidance, offline coping, online coping through Facebook, well-being, and distress. Results showed that the relation between higher levels of attachment anxiety and greater distress was partially mediated by online coping. Attachment avoidance was not related to online coping, but the relation between higher levels of attachment avoidance and decreased well-being was partially mediated by less frequent use of adaptive offline coping strategies. An alternative model suggested a possible <b>reciprocal</b> <b>path</b> indicating that individuals higher in both distress and well-being reported greater frequency of online coping. Further analyses of online coping indicated that most subtypes were related to more intense usage of Facebook, greater attachment anxiety and avoidance, greater use of avoidant coping strategies offline, greater distress, and reduced well-being. These results suggested that the relations among attachment, offline coping, online coping, and psychosocial adjustment are more complex than can be explained by either the rich-get-richer or social compensation hypotheses.

The dynamics of the enhancement factor is studied in a second experiment using correlation of thermal phonons at the same ultrasonic frequencies, without any active source. Coherent Backscattering Enhancement (CBE) {{is a consequence of}} interferences in multiple scattering or multiple reverberations of waves in a complex environment. It was first observed for electrons [1], then in optics [2, 3] where it exhibited as a doubling of the backscattered energy in the incident direction. Later, it was applied to various fields of wave physics, like ultrasound [4 – 6], laser in cold atoms [7], and more recently to seismology [8]. In these fields, CBE was shown to be an accurate way to measure transport mean-free paths of the medium, a quantity that characterizes its degree of heterogeneity.

Possible sex differences in genetic and environmental influences, and the origin of the covariance between fasting insulin and glucose were investi-gated. Subjects were 209 pairs of middle-aged twins, divided into 5 sex-by-zy-gosity groups. A general bivariate model and a reciprocal causation model including fasting insulin and glucose were used in the analyses. For both quanti-tative genetic models, a model specifying additive genetic and unique environ-mental factors, which were the same in males and females, showed the best fit to the data. Heritability estimates were modest and highly similar in both models: 20 – 25 % of the variance in fasting insulin, and around 50 % of the variance in fasting glucose levels could be attributed to genetic factors. The two models could not be discriminated on the basis of their fit to the data.

40|$|Emotion {{regulation}} {{plays an}} important role in emotional well-being, as well as in the protection against and recovery from mood and anxiety disorders. Previous studies of the functional neuroanatomy of emotion regulation have reported greater activity in prefrontal control-related regions during active regulation. These activations are accompanied by decreases in activity in emotion-responsive regions such as the amygdala and insula. These findings are widely interpreted as consistent with models of cognitive control that implicate top-down, negative influences from prefrontal cortex upon emotion-related processing in other regions. However, no studies to date have used measures of effective connectivity to investigate the likely influence of prefrontal control regions upon emotion-responsive regions in the context of effortful emotion regulation. In the present study, participants alternated between responding naturally to negative emotional stimuli and reinterpreting the negative stimuli with the goal of reducing their experienced negative affect. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to measure whole-brain blood-oxygen level dependent signal throughout the task. fMRI data were analyzed using partial least squares (PLS) and structural equations modeling (SEM) to test for differences in effective connectivity between natural and regulated emotional responding. Results indicate that three paths significantly distinguish between regulation and non-regulation negative conditions. The path from inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) to anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was significantly less positive during regulation than natural responding. In addition, the <b>reciprocal</b> <b>paths</b> between ACC and insula were more negative during regulation than natural responding. Taken as a whole, these changes in effective connectivity are consistent with assumptions of top-down modulation during effortful emotion regulation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 An {{advanced}} forward 'area tactical radar network, {{now under}} conceptual development by the Air Force Electronic Systems Division, {{can be viewed}} as a novel form of computer network but with other unique problems resulting from the specialized nature of the application. The proposed network will link together a number of short-range radars, each with associated data processing equipment, so that each radar site has a complete file of tracks for all targets seen by any radar in the network. In addition, the communication network is expected to be used for transmission of a variety of other types of command and control messages. A new class of adaptive routing protocols for computer communication networks have been developed in this thesis, using the radar network as a basis, but applicable to any computer comrnunication network. These new routing protocols utilize new techniques for searching out and using both <b>reciprocal</b> <b>paths</b> (paths over which messages can travel in either direction) and non-reciprocal paths (paths over which messages can travel in only one direction) for directed message routing. The computations required by the new routing protocols are carried out in a distributed manner at each network node. The only information on network structure which a node needs to store in order to carry out any of the routing computations is the identity of its neighbors. A GPSS simulation model of a 13 node radar network was used to determine the steady state characteristics of the new routing protocols in an undamaged network, from which a performance model was developed, and to determine the transient characteristics of the new routing protocols while adapting to various cases of network damage. The transient tests indicate that each of the new routing algorithms possess varying degrees of adaptability to network damage. Some of the new routing algorithms were shown to possess the capability to adapt to extreme cases of network damage. Further transient tests indicated that when some of the new routing algorithms are combined with acknowledgement techniques, complete protocols which reliably deliver all messages to their destinations, even following severe network damage, are formed. The new protocols developed in this thesis are suitable for use in conventional computer communication networks.

We numerically and theoretically investigate the time evolution of the momentum distribution of such quasi-particles when they are initially prepared in a quasi-monochromatic wave packet with a given mean momentum. The parallel transport of the pseudo-spin degree of freedom along scattering paths in momentum space generates a geometrical phase which alters the interference associated with <b>reciprocal</b> scattering <b>paths.</b> In the massless case, a well-known dip in the momentum distribution develops at backscattering (respective to the Dirac point considered) around the transport mean free time.

Its interplay with the geometrical phase induces an additional transient broken reflection symmetry in the momentum distribution.

In Study 1, hierarchical multiple regressions were used to assess the effects of individual differences (Block 1, e. g. dispositional optimism, coping self-efficacy, perceived control of time, humour), work and family variables (Block 2, e. g. affective commitment, skill discretion, work hours, children, marital status, family demands) and the work-life interface (Block 3, e. g. direction and quality of spillover between roles, work-life balance) on the outcomes. There were a mosaic of predictors of the outcomes with a group of seven that were the most frequent significant predictors and which represented the individual (dispositional optimism and coping self-efficacy), the workplace (skill discretion, affective commitment and job autonomy) and the work-life interface (negative work-to-family spillover and negative family-to-work spillover). Interestingly, gender and working hours were not important predictors. The effects of job social support, generally and for work-life issues, perceived control of time and egalitarian gender roles on the outcomes were mediated by negative work-to-family spillover, particularly for emotional exhaustion. Further, the effect of negative spillover on depression, anxiety and work engagement was moderated by the individual. s personal and workplace resources. Study 2 modelled the longitudinal relationships between the group of the seven most frequent predictors and the outcomes. Using a set of non-nested models, the relative influences of concurrent functioning, stability and change over time were assessed. The modelling began with models at Time 1, which formed the basis for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to establish the underlying relationships between the variables and calculate the composite variables for the longitudinal models. The CFAs were well fitting with few modifications to ensure good fit. However, using burnout and work engagement together required additional analyses to resolve poor fit, with one factor (representing a continuum from burnout to work engagement) being the only acceptable solution. Five different longitudinal models were investigated as the Well-Being, Mental Distress, Well-Being-Mental Health, Work Engagement and Integrated models using differing combinations of the outcomes. The best fitting model for each was a reciprocal model that was trimmed of trivial paths. The strongest paths were the synchronous correlations and the paths within variables over time. The <b>reciprocal</b> <b>paths</b> were more variable with weak to mild effects. There was evidence of gain and loss spirals between the variables over time, with a slight net gain in resources that may provide the mechanism for the accumulation of psychological advantage over a lifetime. The longitudinal models also showed that there are leverage points at which personal, psychological and managerial interventions can be targeted to bolster the individual and provide supportive workplace conditions that also minimise negative spillover. Bronfenbrenner. s developmental equation has been a useful framework for the current research, showing the importance of the person as central to the individual. s experience of the work-life interface. By taking control of their own life, the individual can craft a life path that is most suited to their own needs. Competent developmental outcomes were most likely where the person was optimistic and had high self-efficacy, worked in a job that they were attached to and which allowed them to use their talents and without too much negative spillover between their work and family domains. In this way, individuals had greater well-being, better mental health and greater work engagement at any one time and across time...|$|R

The two-dimensional, {{periodic}} Lorentz gas, is the dynamical sys-tem corresponding {{with the}} free motion of a point particle in a planar system of fixed circular obstacles centered at the vertices of a square lattice in the Euclid-ian plane. Assuming elastic collisions between the particle and the obstacles, we consider this dynamical system in the Boltzmann-Grad limit, i. e. assuming that the obstacle radius r and the <b>reciprocal</b> mean free <b>path</b> are asymptoti-cally equivalent small quantities, and that the particle’s distribution function is slowly varying in the space variable. While {{it is known that}} the particle’s distribution function in that limit cannot be governed by a linear Boltzmann equation [F. Golse, Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse 17 (2008), 735 – 749], we propose a limiting theory involving an extended phase space larger than the usual phase space of a classical point particle in which the limiting particle’s distribution function evolves under an integro-differential equation somewhat analogous to a linear Boltzmann equation. The particle’s distribution function in the classi-cal phase space is obtained by averaging out the additional variables involved in the extended phase space. We derive explicit formulas for the coefficients appearing in that integro-differential equation, and study its basic dynamical properties — especially, we establish an analogue of Boltzmann’s H theorem, provide a complete description of the equilibrium distribution functions and investigate the convergence to these equilibrium distribution functions in the long time limit.

40|$|The two-dimensional, {{periodic}} Lorentz gas, is the dynamical system corresponding {{with the}} free motion of a point particle in a planar system of fixed circular obstacles centered at the vertices of a square lattice in the Euclidian plane. Assuming elastic collisions between the particle and the obstacles, this dynamical system is studied in the Boltzmann-Grad limit, assuming that the obstacle radius r and the <b>reciprocal</b> mean free <b>path</b> are asymptotically equivalent small quantities, and that the particle's distribution function is slowly varying in the space variable. In this limit, the periodic Lorentz gas cannot be described by a linear Boltzmann equation (see [F. Golse, Ann. Fac. Sci. Toulouse 17 (2008), 735 [...] 749]), but involves an integro-differential equation conjectured in [E. Caglioti, F. Golse, C. R. Acad. Sci. Sér. I Math. 346 (2008) 477 [...] 482] and proved in [J. Marklof, A. Strömbergsson, preprint arXiv: 0801. 0612], set on a phase-space larger than the usual single-particle phase-space. The main {{purpose of the present}} paper is to study the dynamical properties of this integro-differential equation: identifying its equilibrium states, proving a H Theorem and discussing the speed of approach to equilibrium in the long time limit. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we derive the explicit formula for a transition probability appearing in that equation following the method sketched in [E. Caglioti, F. Golse, loc. cit. ].
