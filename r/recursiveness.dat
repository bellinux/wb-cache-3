"With {{the aid of}} {{the methods}} of Kleene (American Journal of Mathematics, 1935), the {{considerations}} of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of λ-definability, without making use of the notion of <b>recursiveness.</b> On the other hand, since {{the results of the present}} paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, [...] "General recursive functions of natural numbers") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of <b>recursiveness,</b> without making use of λ-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it." ...|$|E

The notion of λ-definability is due jointly to the present author and S. C.

The notion of <b>recursiveness</b> {{in the sense of}} §4 below is due jointly to Jacques Herbrand and Kurt Gödel, as is there explained. And the proof of equivalence of the two notions is due chiefly to Kleene, but also partly to the present author and to J. B. Rosser ...

5000|$|Giddens {{observed}} that in social analysis, the term structure referred generally to [...] "rules and resources" [...] {{and more specifically}} to [...] "the structuring properties allowing the 'binding' of time-space in social systems". These properties {{make it possible for}} similar social practices to exist across time and space and that lend them [...] "systemic" [...] form. Agents—groups or individuals—draw upon these structures to perform social actions through embedded memory, called memory traces. Memory traces are thus the vehicle through which social actions are carried out. Structure is also, however, the result of these social practices. Thus, Giddens conceives of the duality of structure as being:...the essential <b>recursiveness</b> of social life, as constituted in social practices: structure is both medium and outcome of reproduction of practices.

It also has some resemblance to MISTY1 in the <b>recursiveness</b> of its structure: the 128-bit full cipher is a Feistel network with an F-function operating on 64-bit halves, while the F-function itself is a Feistel network composed of a G-function operating on 32-bit halves. However the recursion does not extend further because the G-function is not a Feistel network. In the G-function, the 32-bit word is considered as four 8-bit bytes, {{each of which is}} passed through {{one or the other of}} the S-boxes, then combined in a moderately complex set of boolean functions such that each output bit depends on 3 of the 4 input bytes.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 106 {{organizations}} engaged in strategic alliances, we develop and test a framework of alliance-related organizational decision-making processes {{and their impact on}} alliance performance. With regard to direct effects, our results show a negative impact of decision-making <b>recursiveness</b> and no significant relationship for openness and procedural rationality. Acknowledging the importance of the organization's micropolitical context in which these decision processes are embedded, we also test the moderating influence of politicality. Our findings provide support for our hypotheses that in a context of low politicality, the decision-making characteristics of openness and procedural rationality have a positive influence, whereas <b>recursiveness</b> negatively affects alliance performance. In a context of high politicality, however, openness and procedural rationality exert a negative influence, and the negative impact of <b>recursiveness</b> is aggravated. We suggest that alliance-related decision making cannot be adequately understood without explicitly considering the micropolitical context in organizations.
