40|$|Volatilization of {{pesticides}} participates in atmospheric contamination and affects environmental ecosystems including human welfare. Modelling at relevant time and spatial scales {{is needed to}} better understand the complex processes involved in pesticide volatilization. Volt'Air-Pesticides has been developed following a two-step procedure to study pesticide volatilization at the field scale and at a quarter time step. Firstly, Volt'Air-NH 3 was adapted by extending the initial transfer of solutes to pesticides and by adding specific calculations for physico-chemical equilibriums {{as well as for the}} degradation {{of pesticides}} in soil. Secondly, the model was evaluated in terms of three pesticides applied on bare soil (atrazine, alachlor, and trifluralin) which display a wide range of volatilization rates. A sensitivity analysis confirmed the relevance of tuning to Kh. Then, using Volt'Air-Pesticides, environmental conditions and emission fluxes of the pesticides were compared to fluxes measured under 2 environmental conditions. The model fairly well described water temporal dynamics, soil surface temperature, and energy budget. Overall, Volt'Air-Pesticides estimates of the order of magnitude of the volatilization flux of all three compounds were in good agreement with the field measurements. The model also satisfactorily simulated the decrease in the volatilization rate of the three pesticides during night-time as well as the decrease in the soil surface <b>residue</b> <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> before and after incorporation. However, the timing of the maximum flux rate during the day was not correctly described, thought to be linked to an increased adsorption under dry soil conditions. Thanks to Volt'Air's capacity to deal with pedo-climatic conditions, several existing parameterizations describing adsorption as a function of soil water content could be tested. However, this point requires further investigation. Practically speaking, Volt'Air-Pesticides can be a useful tool to make decision about agriculture practices such as incorporation or for the estimation of overall pesticide volatilization rates, and it holds promise for time specific dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Malaria is {{a disease}} {{in desperate need of}} new {{chemotherapeutic}} approaches. Certain microtubule inhibitors, including vinblastine and taxol, have highly potent activity against malarial parasites and disrupt the normal microtubular structures of intra-erythrocytic parasites at relevant concentrations. While these inhibitors are useful tools, their potential as anti-malarial drugs is limited by their high toxicity to mammalian cells. In contrast, two classes of antimitotic herbicide, namely dinitroanilines (e. g. trifluralin and oryzalin) and phosphorothicamidates (e. g. amiprophosmethyl), exhibit moderate activity against the major human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum in culture but very low mammalian cytotoxicity. We examined the dynamics and kinetics of uptake and subcellular compartmentation of [C- 14]trifluralin in comparison with [H- 3]vinblastine. We wished to determine whether the relatively modest activity <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> was the consequence of poor uptake into parasite cells. Trifluralin accumulated in parasite-infected erythrocytes to similar to 300 times the external concentration and vinblastine at up to similar to 110 times. Accumulation into uninfected erythrocytes was much lower. Uptake <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> was rapid, non-saturable and readily reversed. It appears that the hydrophobic nature <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> leads to accumulation largely in the membranes of the parasite, reducing the levels in the soluble fraction and limiting access to its microtubular target. By contrast, vinblastine accumulated predominantly in the soluble fraction and uptake was saturable and mostly irreversible, consistent with binding predominantly to tubulin. The results indicate that synthesis <b>of</b> more polar <b>trifluralin</b> derivatives may be a promising approach to designing microtubule inhibitors with more potent antimalarial activity.

In Ames, experiments were conducted on a Clarion silty clay loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplaquall), while at Nashua the soil type was a Kenyon loam (fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludoll). Three methods of seedbed preparation for corn planting were utilized in a factorial experimental design, including no-till and moldboard or chisel plowing. No effect on corn growth was seen at the 1. 1 kg/ha rate <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin.</b> Averaged over four experiments, reductions in corn shoot height of 8 and 24 percent were observed five weeks after planting at the 2. 2 and 4. 5 kg/ha rates, respectively. In one experiment, early season carryover injury was more severe in reduced tillage areas than in moldboard plow areas. No yield reductions were observed at the 1. 1 or 2. 2 kg/ha rate, but reductions of 8 and 16 percent occurred at 4. 5 kg/ha trifluralin in two studies;A series of glasshouse experiments was conducted {{to determine the effects}} <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> on root growth and mineral relations of corn seedlings. Root weight to shoot weight ratios of corn seedlings were directly related to soil concentrations <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin.</b> Root length to shoot weight ratios, however, were inversely related to trifluralin rates. A lag period between the development of root and foliar injury symptoms was observed. Trifluralin disrupted both mineral and water relations of exposed plants. Phosphorus and potassium concentrations of shoot tissue were reduced up to 60 and 35 %, respectively, by 0. 25 ppm trifluralin. Growth inhibition due to trifluralin was partially overcome by supplementing soil with nutrients. Phosphorus absorption was more sensitive to <b>trifluralin</b> than that <b>of</b> potassium. Transpiration rates of corn leaves were reduced up to 27 and 56 % by 0. 25 and 0. 50 ppm, respectively. Reduced corn growth rates due to trifuralin injury apparently are due to the combined effects of root inhibition on mineral and water relations...|$|R

40|$|This Experiment was {{arranged}} as a strip-plot {{on the base}} of a completely randomized block design with three replications to study the effect of tillage (whether in day or night or in day by light-proof cover) and application of reduced dosage <b>of</b> imazethapyr and <b>trifluralin</b> on weed control, yield and yield components of chickpea. Main plots consisted of tillage methods and subplots consisted <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> (at doses <b>of</b> 480, 960 and 1440 g ai /ha) and imazethapyr (at doses of 50, 100 and 150 g ai /ha), plus weed free and weedy checks. Results showed weed biomass in day tillage, night tillage and in light-proof cover tillage were respectively 86, 127 and 148 g m- 2. Therefore tillage at night or by light-proof cover in day time showed not enough efficiency in weed control. Weed biomass increased when application dose of herbicides decreased. Chickpea grain yield showed significant differences when different doses of herbicides applied. The minimum and the maximum seed yield were obtained respectively in weed free (by 208 g m- 2) and weedy checks (by 123 g m- 2). Reduced dosage <b>of</b> imazethapyr and <b>trifluralin</b> could control weeds good enough by no significant decrease in chickpea yield.

40|$|Although {{leishmaniasis}} {{is a major}} tropical disease, {{the currently}} available drugs are toxic and inadequate. We show that the antimicrotubule herbicide trifluralin has antileishmania activity. The present study aimed at deducing {{the relationship between the}} structure of the molecule and its antiprotozoan activity. Nine dinitroanilines, all of which were analogs <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin,</b> were compared. We found that pendimethalin was 2. 5 -fold more potent than trifluralin, and the higher efficacy may be correlated with molecular structural features that increase the accessibility to one nitro group. This association was further supported by molecular modeling. Moreover, trifluralin samples from two sources differed in their activities by more than threefold, and gas column chromatography showed that impurities were present in the more potent sample...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{treatments}} <b>of</b> both <b>trifluralin</b> (at 10, 100 and 1000 mu M) and N 2 O (in {{the form}} of gas under pressure) were applied to Begonia flower buds to induce the formation of 2 n pollen. Three male fertile species (B. cucullata, B. subvillosa var. leptotricha and B. fischeri) and two male sterile hybrids (B. schmidtiana x B. cucullata and B. subvillosa var. leptotricha x B. cucullata) were treated. Pollen size, which is related to pollen DNA content, increased after both N 2 O and trifluralin treatments, but the induction of large pollen was genotype dependent. Trifluralin induced large pollen only in the male fertile species, while N 2 O treatments induced fertile 2 n pollen in the male sterile B. schmidtiana x B. cucullata. Cytological studies showed that trifluralin induced multinuclear monads that resulted in 4 n gametes in stead of 2 n gametes. In general, large pollen obtained after trifluralin treatments showed low germination capability, while large pollen obtained after N 2 O treatments retained high germination capability. Seedlings with raised ploidy level could only be obtained after crosses were performed with large pollen obtained from N 2 O treatments. Hence, N 2 O treatments are preferable to the use <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> to induce 2 n gametes in Begonia...|$|R
40|$|Crops {{resistant}} to glyphosate may mitigate the increasing {{contamination of the}} environment by herbicides, since their weeding requires smaller amounts of herbicides and fewer active ingredients. However, there are few published data comparing the fate of glyphosate with that of substitute herbicides under similar soil and climatic conditions. The objectives of the work reported here were (i) to evaluate and compare the fate in soil in field conditions of glyphosate, as used on glyphosate-resistant oilseed rape, with that of two herbicides frequently used for weed control on the same crop, albeit non-resistant: trifluralin and metazachlor, and (ii) to compare field results with predictions of the pesticide root zone model (PRZM), parameterized with laboratory data. Dissipation and vertical distribution in the soil profile <b>of</b> glyphosate, <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor were monitored in an experimental site located in Eastern France for 1 year. Herbicide persistence in the field increased as follows: metazachlor < glyphosate < trifluralin, contrary to laboratory results showing glyphosate to be least persistent. The main metabolite of glyphosate - aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) - was more persistent than glyphosate. AMPA and trifluralin had the largest vertical mobility, followed by metazachlor and glyphosate. PRZM underestimated the dissipation rate of glyphosate in the field and the formation of AMPA, but its predictions for trifluralin and metazachlor were correct. The simulation of herbicides and AMPA distribution in the soil profile was satisfactory, but the mobility <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor was slightly underestimated, probably because PRZM ignores preferential flow. In general, data from the laboratory allowed an acceptable parameterization of the model, as indicated by goodness-of-fit indices. Because of the detection of AMPA in the deep soil layer, the replacement <b>of</b> both <b>trifluralin</b> and metazachlor with glyphosate might not contribute to decreasing environmental contamination by herbicides. PRZM may be used to evaluate and to compare other weed control strategies for herbicide-resistant as well as non-resistant crops...|$|R
40|$|Leishmaniasis {{is a major}} {{tropical}} disease for which current chemotherapies, pentavalent antimonials, are inadequate and cause severe side effects. It {{has been reported that}} trifluralin, a microtubule-disrupting herbicide, is inhibitory to Leishmania amazonensis. In this study, the in vitro effect <b>of</b> <b>trifluralin</b> on different species of trypanosomatid protozoans was determined. In addition to L. amazonensis, trifluralin is effective against Leishmania major and Leishmania tropica, which cause cutaneous infections, Leishmania donovani, which causes visceral disease, Leishmania panamensis, which may cause mucocutaneous infection, and Trypanosoma brucei, an important human and veterinary pathogen. Moreover, most encouragingly, trifluralin is effective in vivo as a topical ointment against L. major and Leishmania mexicana murine cutaneous leishmaniasis. Thus, trifluralin is a promising lead drug for several related, prevalent {{tropical disease}}s: leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis of animals, and, possibly, African trypanosomiasis in humans...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the structural protein, tubulin, as a potential target for anti-trypanosomatid drug discovery and vaccine development. Recombinant alpha- and beta- tubulin proteins from Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in an E. coli expression system. The recombinant alpha- and beta- tubulins were used to determine the nature of binding <b>of</b> novel <b>trifluralin</b> analogues EPL-AJ 1003, 1007, 1008, 1016 and 1017. Native tubulin from rats was used {{to determine the extent of}} binding to mammalian tubulin. The results of this study clearly demonstrate two important aspects of the binding <b>of</b> <b>trifluralins</b> to tubulin. Firstly, they have specific affinity for trypanosomal tubulin compared with mammalian regardless of the chemical composition <b>of</b> the <b>trifluralin</b> analogue tested. Secondly, they have a demonstrably stronger affinity for alpha-tubulin compared with beta-tubulin. In addition, compounds 1007, 1008, 1016 and 1017 have strong binding affinities for alpha-tubulin, with limited binding affinity for mammalian tubulin, which indicates that these compounds selectively bind to trypanosomal tubulin. The morphology of bloodstream forms of T. b. rhodesiense exposed to trifluralin analogues was studied using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence to determine the ultrastructural changes these compounds induce as a result of binding to tubulin. All compounds tested induced severe irreparable damage in T. b. rhodesiense, including perturbation of subpellicular microtubules, extensive cytoplasmic swellings, axoneme and paraflagellar rod malformation, disconfiguration around the flagellar pocket and membrane disintegration. These results suggest that the mechanism of action <b>of</b> these <b>trifluralin</b> analogues is through the disruption of polymerization of tubulin into microtubules as a result of binding to alpha-tubulin. The potential for recombinant trypanosomal tubulins to be used as vaccine candidates was assessed by monitoring parasitaemia and length of survival of mice immunised with the proteins and challenged with a lethal infection of T. b. rhodesiense. Although all the mice vaccinated with recombinant tubulin developed a patent parasitaemia and did not survive, they were partially protected because their patency period and length of survival were significantly greater than the control groups. Furthermore, plasma collected from mice immunised with recombinant trypanosomal tubulin contained antibodies that recognized tubulin in a soluble extraction from T. b. rhodesiense. The results of this thesis confirm the potential for the structural protein, tubulin, to be used as a target for anti-trypanosomatid drug discovery and vaccine development...|$|R
