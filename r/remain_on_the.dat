5|$|As the Bankers {{are seen}} as a part of North Carolina's coastal heritage, they have been allowed to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> barrier islands.

5|$|At a four-way {{stop with}} {{channelized}} right turn lanes, drivers must turn to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highway. To {{the south is}} Renfrew County Road 40, which continues to Highway17 {{at the southern end}} of the Pembroke Bypass. Highway 148 continues east, crossing the Ottawa Valley Railway and the entrance to Hazley Bay before entering the community of Cotnam Island. The highway curves northeast and crosses the Ottawa River, entering Quebec midspan.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). Such children may <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
30|$|After debonding, {{the tooth}} and bracket {{surfaces}} were examined with a stereomicroscope (Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) under 40 × magnification. The adhesive remnant index (ARI) [33] {{was used to}} classify the failure modes, using the following scores: 0 indicates that no bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth, 1 indicates that {{less than half of}} <b>the</b> bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth, 2 indicates {{that more than half of}} <b>the</b> bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth and 3 indicates that all bonding resin <b>remained</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tooth, along with a clear impression of the bracket mesh.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} retain a {{consistent}} shape of the Stanley Cup, as there is only sufficient space for thirteen teams {{on each of the}} five lower bands, team names can only <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cup for 64 years. In 2005 the band for teams from 1941 to 1953 were removed and placed on display, thus Teeder Kennedy's name no longer appears on the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In {{the study}} of natural selection, the {{population}} of Soay sheep that <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island of Hirta {{have been used to}} explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success. Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively. The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.|$|E

5|$|Strenuous {{efforts by}} the Royal Navy to salvage the badly damaged {{battleship}} {{during the summer of}} 1906 failed, and in 1907 it was decided to give up and sell her for scrap.

5|$|The highway turns {{south at}} Flynns Corner, {{intersecting}} former Highway507.

Between Buckhorn and Burleigh Falls, the highway serves the cottages that line the northern shore of Lower Buckhorn Lake.|$|E

Although most InterCity and Intercity-Express trains now use {{the north-south}} tunnel route via Hauptbahnhof, some trains do still <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Stadtbahn's long distance tracks.

5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon lives mostly along mountain ranges, river valleys, coastlines, and increasingly in cities. In mild-winter regions, {{it is usually}} a permanent resident, and some individuals, especially adult males, will <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> breeding territory. Only populations that breed in Arctic climates typically migrate great distances during the northern winter.|$|E
5|$|To <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Arms Park site, {{additional}} space had to {{be found}} to allow safe access and to provide room for the increased capacity and improved facilities.

5|$|Traces of red pigment still <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> figure's {{body that}} was {{originally}} painted red overall. The feathers of her wings and the owls' feathers were also colored red, alternating {{with black and}} white. By Raman spectroscopy the red pigment is identified as red ochre, the black pigment, amorphous carbon ("lamp black") and the white pigment gypsum. Black pigment is also found on {{the background of the}} plaque, the hair and eyebrows, and on the lions' manes. The pubic triangle and the areola appear accentuated with red pigment but were not separately painted black. The lions' bodies were painted white. The British Museum curators assume that the horns of the headdress and part of the necklace were originally colored yellow, just as they are on a very similar clay figure from Ur. They surmise that the bracelets and rod-and-ring symbols might also have been painted yellow. However, no traces of yellow pigment now <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relief.|$|E

5|$|A defenseman is {{a player}} {{position}} whose {{responsibility is to}} assist the goalkeeper in preventing the opposing team from scoring. Each team fields three defensemen. These players generally <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive half of the field. Unless a defenseman gets the ball and chooses to run up the field and try to score or pass, by doing this {{they will need to}} cross the midfield line and signal one midfielder to stay back. A defensemen carries a long crosse which provides an advantage in reach for intercepting passes and checking.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If {{the location of the}} bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army {{in waiting}} near Bryennios's camp, and divided {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced to <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E

5|$|Asellus, {{formerly}} a human girl, was {{run over by}} a carriage and given a blood transfusion by the Mystic Lord Orlouge. Chosen as the Charm Lord's heir, she is despised by human and mystic alike due to her status as the only half-Mystic in existence. She escapes Orlouge's castle {{with the help of the}} Princess White Rose. Asellus and White Rose <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> run from Orlouge's many servants, but after White Rose sacrifices herself to save Asellus's life and freedom, Asellus decides to return and defeat Orlouge, to end the struggle once and for all.

5|$|At 8:10am Captain Brown {{ordered a}} course change to 060degrees and {{informed}} {{the men that}} the conn for the battleship would <b>remain</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eighth-level bridge until they cleared the course. This was unusual for Missouri, as the conn was usually shifted to the fourth-level bridge during the transit at the point when a ship passed Fort Wool and Old Point Comfort. The initial course change to 060 was altered to 058 {{as a result of}} a strong ocean current that swung Missouri too far to the right during the course correction.|$|E
