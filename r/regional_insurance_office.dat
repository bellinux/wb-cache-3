40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the personality variables Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC), Negativ affect and Social inhibition (the D-personality), and health behavior and attitudes toward keep-fit measures. Methods. The participants in this study were 170 embloyees at a <b>regional</b> social <b>insurance</b> <b>office</b> in a midsize town in the south of Sweden. Scales concerning health behavior and attitudes toward keep-fit measures were constructed and the participants completed these scales as well as those of MHLC and D-personality. Results. Participants with strong beliefs that other people, such as doctors or family-members, are responsible for their health, showed a more positive attitude as to keep-fit measures than those with a belief that health is controlled by themselves. The D-personality was significantly related to negative health behaviors. Conclusions. This study suggest that different personality-types show different health behavior and attitudes toward keep-fit meausures and therefore are in need of different kinds of support in order to promote a good health. This is especially relevant for persons with a high level of negativ affect and social inhibition...|$|R
40|$|At {{the turn}} of the year 2009 / 2010 there was a change in the {{regulations}} on sickness impact. This led to 328 persons in County of Kronoberg had an expired period of sickness benefit from the Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Office</b> (Försäkringskassan) when they reached the maximum time for sickness or temporary disability compensation. These individuals were offered introductory programs with the employment services. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how the population with expired period of sickness benefit from the <b>Regional</b> Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Office</b> in the County of Kronoberg (Försäkringskassan Kronoberg) is described in the initial stage, and to explore how individuals who achieved expired period of sickness benefit from the Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Office</b> (Försäkringskassan) talks about the meaning to get an expired period of sickness benefit regarding economic and social issues. The study was inspired by Grounded theory. The method has consisted of both quantitative and qualitative interviews. In total, six persons participated in the surveys. Narrative method was used in the interview with a person with experience of an expired period of sickness benefit from the Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Office</b> (Försäkringskassan). The interviews indicate that the authorities have different focus on the concept of rehabilitation. This means that what is to be regarded as rehabilitation and the efforts which may benefit the individual depends on which authority has the power of definition. This study is made before preparing administrators for either statistics or working methods were established by the relevant authorities. Longer experience in the field is still missing about what the change means for both individuals who have experience of the expired period of sickness benefit and professionals. This points out; further research in this area is needed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{the present}} study {{the effect of a}} workplace-oriented {{intervention}} for persons on long-term sick leave for clinical burnout, aimed at facilitating return to work (RTW) by job-person match through patient-supervisor communication, was evaluated. We hypothesised that the intervention group would show a more successful RTW than a control group. Methods In a prospective controlled study, subjects were identified by the <b>regional</b> social <b>insurance</b> <b>office</b> 2 - 6 months after the first day on sick leave. The intervention group (n = 74) was compared to a control group who had declined participation, being matched by length of sick leave (n = 74). The RTW was followed up, using sick-listing register data, until 1. 5 years after the time of intervention. Results There was a linear increase of RTW in the intervention group during the 1. 5 -year follow-up period, and 89 % of subjects had returned to work to some extent {{at the end of the}} follow-up period. The increase in RTW in the control group came to a halt after six months, and only 73 % had returned to work to some extent at the end of the 1. 5 -year follow-up. Conclusions We conclude that {{the present study}} demonstrated an improvement of long-term RTW after a workplace-oriented intervention for patients on long-term sick leave due to burnout.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{period from}} the mid- 1990 s to the mid- 2000 s saw a rapid {{increase}} in long-term sick leave in Sweden, primarily due to mental illness and often related to job burnout. This led to an urge for effective treatment programs that could prevent the often long sick leaves. In 2010 we presented a newly developed work-place intervention method, showing that 89 % of the intervention group had returned {{to work at a}} 1. 5  year follow-up, compared to 73 % of the control group. The main aim {{of this study was to}} assess the long-term stability of these promising results. METHODS: Sick leave registry data from the <b>Regional</b> Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Office</b> were analyzed for an additional year (50  weeks) beyond the original 1. 5  year period (80  weeks). Data from 68 matched pairs of intervention participants (IP) and controls were available. The proportions of participants being on full-time sick leave versus having returned to work to any extent were computed for every 10 th week. Generalized estimating equations were used with GROUP (IP versus controls) as between-subjects factor, WEEKS and AGE as covariates, and return-to-work (RTW) as dependent variable. Significant differences (Wald χ 2 with α[*]≤[*]. 05) was followed up with polynomial contrasts. Individual relapses to higher degrees of sick leave (e. g. from 50 % to 100 %) and whether partial RTW led to later full-time RTW, were also analyzed. RESULTS: The omnibus test over all 130  weeks showed a GROUP*WEEKS interaction effect (p[*]=[*]. 02), indicating differential group developments in RTW, though similarly high at week 130 in both groups with 82. 4 % of the IP and 77. 9 % of the controls having RTW (p[*]=[*]. 22; χ 2 -test). A significant interaction with age led to separate analyses of the younger and older subgroups, indicating a stable pattern of superior RTW only among younger IP (week 130 : 88. 6 % vs. 69. 7 %, p[*]=[*]. 054; χ 2 -test). There was no group difference in relapses into increased degree of sick leave. Part-time sick leave did not predict a later stable full-time RTW. CONCLUSIONS: The previously reported improvement in RTW with the newly developed workplace-oriented intervention showed a long-term stability only among younger participants...|$|R
