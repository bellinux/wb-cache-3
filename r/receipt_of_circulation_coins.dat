25|$|To {{commemorate the}} 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games, 17 Canadian coins were issued for general <b>circulation.</b> Two <b>of</b> the <b>circulation</b> <b>coins</b> honour Paralympic sports: {{wheelchair}} curling (released on July 11, 2007) and ice sledge hockey (released on March 18, 2010). The circulation quarters omitted a traditional phrase, Dei Gratia Regina, from their obverse side, making them the first godless <b>coins</b> in <b>circulation</b> since 1911.|$|R
25|$|Coins {{are usually}} metal or alloy, or {{sometimes}} made of synthetic materials. They are usually disc shaped. Coins made of valuable metal {{are stored in}} large quantities as bullion coins. Other coins are used as money in everyday transactions, circulating alongside banknotes. Usually the highest value <b>coin</b> in <b>circulation</b> (i.e. excluding bullion coins) is worth less than the lowest-value note. In the last hundred years, the face value <b>of</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>coins</b> has occasionally been lower than {{the value of the}} metal they contain, for example due to inflation. If the difference becomes significant, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw these <b>coins</b> from <b>circulation,</b> possibly issuing new equivalents with a different composition, or the public may decide to melt the coins down or hoard them (see Gresham's law).|$|R
5000|$|... 2000p: The 2000p Canada dime {{is scarce}} {{with fewer than}} 250 {{examples}} minted. The 2000p dime was lent to the vending industry by the Royal Canadian Mint to test the compatibility of the new plating process <b>of</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>coins</b> with existing vending machines and meters. Under contractual obligation, these coins were {{to be returned to}} the Mint once the compatibility tests were complete. Of the approximately 250 coins minted, many were not returned to the mint leading to significant debate surrounding the legality of owning these coins. High-grade examples of the 2000p 10 cent issue range from $1,500 to $3,000 CDN. Unlike the 5 cent 2000p issues, the 10 cent coin was not officially released by the Mint, and entered the numismatic market illegally and are still the property of the Royal Canadian Mint.|$|R
50|$|In 1877 President Ignacio de Veintimilla {{authorized}} the free <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> less than 900 fine, with the immediate result that good quality <b>coin</b> disappeared from <b>circulation,</b> replaced by <b>coin</b> from Chile and Bolivia {{that was only}} 500 fine.|$|R
50|$|In 1950, {{the first}} series <b>of</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>coins</b> was minted in {{aluminum}} bronze and copper in 4 denominations; 5, 10, 25 and 50 Satang coins with the obverse design being King Bhumibol’s portrait and the reverse design being the {{coat of arms}} {{that had been used}} during the reign of King Rama V. In 1986, the changes had been generally partial and made on certain values of coins only, following a comprehensive major revision of coin production in denomination, composition, size and pattern, they included and addition of 1 Satang and 10 Baht coins.Then, the government produced the complete series of 8 types of coins 10 Baht, 5 Baht, 1 Baht, 50 Satang, 25 Satang, 10 Satang, 5 Satang and 1 Satang. In 2005, 2 Baht coins were minted and made the Thai <b>circulation</b> <b>coins</b> consist <b>of</b> 9 denominations. Only 25 Satang up to 10 Baht are used in circulation while the 1, 5 and 10 Satang are minted to serve the accounting system. During this reign, a large number of coins has been issued. The first commemorative coin was minted in 1961 with the nickel 1 Baht coin to mark the return of Their Majesties from their state visits abroad. It is the first coin featuring the portrait of a female royal family member.|$|R
50|$|In November 1960 the Master of the Mint, N.A. Parker, {{advised the}} Minister of Finance {{that there was}} a need for a new facility. Capacity had already been reached in Ottawa. The Philadelphia Mint was {{producing}} a large number of Canadian 10¢ coins and all numismatic coins were being produced in Hull, Quebec. It was finally recognized that the Mint required an additional facility.In 1963 and 1964, the government discussed the possibility of building a new facility, which would be functional within two years. Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson suggested building the facility in Elliot Lake, Ontario. A 1968 study indicated that the Ottawa Mint facility was truly antiquated. When the Royal Canadian Mint became a Crown corporation in 1969, many believed that a decision would be reached.7 But although funds had been allocated for a new facility, no real planning had begun.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> <b>circulation</b> in {{the city}} of Rome represents a matter whose boundaries are still rather nebulous and undefined. This book aims at examining the coins of the Julio-Claudian and Flavian period unearthed in Rome, both in the municipal areas and with the excavations of the Governorate, {{in the late nineteenth and}} the first half of the twentieth century. These specimens are now available online at www. museicapitolini. net. Complemented with the pieces coming from other sites of the empire’s capital published so far, they have been subsequently compared with the finds from the cities of Latium vetus and Campania, in an effort to outline a picture <b>of</b> the <b>coin</b> <b>circulation</b> in the first century AD in such areas of the Italian peninsula...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a search theoretical model that captures two phenomena that have characterized several episodes of monetary history: currency shortages and the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> privately issued notes. As usual in these models, the media of exchange are determined {{as part of}} the equilibrium. We characterize all the different equilibria and specify the conditions under which there is a currency shortage and/or privately issued notes are used as means of payment. There is multiplicity of equilibria for the entire parameter space, but there always exist an equilibrium in which notes circulate, either alone or together with coins. Hence, credit is a self-fulfilling phenomenon that depends on the beliefs of agents about the acceptability and future repayment of notes. The degree <b>of</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coins</b> depends on two crucial parameters, the intrinsic utility of holding coins and the extent with which it is possible to find exchange opportunities in the market. 2 1...|$|R

50|$|On February 13, 1874 the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin</b> worn on {{both sides}} was {{prohibited}} and a new table of ratings for foreign coin was published.

50|$|Alternatively, one {{can place}} {{one or two}} fewer coins than usual in each roll. Half-dollars are a common choice {{for this kind of}} scam, for two reasons.

Also, since half-dollars rarely circulate, most bank tellers are unaware of the proper length and/or weight of a roll. Also owing to their lack <b>of</b> <b>circulation,</b> the missing <b>coins</b> {{are not likely to be}} discovered for a long time.|$|R
50|$|A {{traditional}} way of investing in palladium is buying bullion coins and bars made of palladium. Available palladium coins include the Canadian Maple Leaf and the Chinese Panda.

Authority to do this arose from its power to regulate the <b>circulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>coin.</b>|$|R
