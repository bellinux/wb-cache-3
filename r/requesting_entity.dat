50|$|Historically, {{access control}} models have {{included}} {{mandatory access control}} (MAC), discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory integrity control, and more recently role-based access control (RBAC). These access control models are user-centric and do {{not take into account}} additional parameters such as resource information, relationship between the user (the <b>requesting</b> <b>entity)</b> and the resource, and dynamic information e.g. time of the day or user IP.ABAC tries to address this by defining access control based on attributes which describe the <b>requesting</b> <b>entity</b> (the user), the targeted object or resource, the desired action (view, edit, delete...), and environmental or contextual information. This is why access control is said to be attribute-based.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In many cases, within {{distributed}} environments, authorization {{manifests itself}} {{in the form of}} existing trust relationships. Before pervasive computing can be successfully achieved, we may have to transcend the current notion of pre-established trust. This is not conducive to a low administrative overhead, nor is it realistic in a distributed environment, where processing may occur over a large number of nodes which may be distributed geographically across different domains. This paper presents a unique architecture which provides a distributed authorization capability that allows arbitrary entities to participate in the grid, while greatly improving scalability due to lower administrative overhead. Within our architecture, the access decision is made at the individual resource sites, based on the combination of local policy and a set of accumulated points carried in the <b>requesting</b> <b>entity’s</b> PKC. These points, which are derived from previous actions the entity has been involved with, will be used to represent an entity’s reputation. The system is called Augmented Authorization System Using Reputation (AASUR) ...|$|R

The defense mechanisms incorporated by proposed model against attacks such as bad mouthing attack, oscillating behavior attack and conflicting behavior attack are also demonstrated.|$|E

Requests for information and computations are formulated in Glossa, transmitted to the participating databases, translated and executed locally, and the results, rephrased in Glossa, are returned to the <b>requesting</b> <b>entity.</b> Thus, Glossa serves as a shared abstract layer among disparate databases and computational languages.

40|$|Abstract — Remote {{access to}} {{dynamically}} changing information elements is a required functionality for various network services, including routing and instances of context-sensitive networking. Three fundamentally different strategies for such access are investigated in this paper: (1) a reactive approach {{initiated by the}} <b>requesting</b> <b>entity,</b> and two versions of proactive approaches in which the entity that contains the information element actively propagates its changes to potential requesters, either (2) periodically or triggered by changes of the information element (3). This paper first develops a set of analytic models to compute different performance metrics for these approaches, with special focus on the so-called mismatch probability. The results of the analytic models allow for design decisions on which strategy to implement for specific input parameters (change rate of the information element, network delay characterization) and specific requirements on mismatch probability, traffic overhead, and access delay. Finally, the analysis {{is applied to the}} use-case of context-sensitive service discovery...|$|E
40|$|Pervasive {{computing}} {{promises to}} revolutionize computing, empower mobile users, and enhance mobility, customizability and adaptability of computing environments. Intrinsic {{to the notion}} of such environments is the capturing of location and context information. Context awareness and validation enables significant functionality to pervasive computing applications, users, resources and the ways they interact. Much of this functionality depends on validating context information and using it for granting access to data or resources. In this paper we propose an encryption and access control framework that uses both context and identity to determine whether an entity or a group of entities may access protected services, data, devices, and other resources. We assume that the resources are context-sensitive, thus requiring the <b>requesting</b> <b>entity</b> to be under a specific context before it is able to access the resource or decrypt the information. Our approach is unique in the way that we decouple context from identity, which adds extra security, facilitates value-added services, and enables efficient key management for group communication. 1...|$|E

30|$|The last {{column of}} Table 1 underlines that current IAM systems {{commonly}} {{operate on the}} basis of information on the subject (like employee data), the object (like access privileges and applications) and the assignments between both. Thus, they are only able to process a limited static view without considering extended contextual information like an employee’s activities within certain applications. In fact, most applications generate a huge amount of (audit) data such as information about a <b>requesting</b> <b>entity,</b> the affected resources, the location of access, the time and the decision of whether the request was granted or denied. Beside that, static information like assigned permissions, information about the access model or the history of an employee provides a relevant data source. Based on this source, key performance indicators may be computed e.g. for criticality or data quality which adapt the system’s current state thus providing better policy input. Additionally, data such as an employee’s contract status stemming from an HR system might further support policy management. We argue that considering these extended data types allows for the improved detection of access management policies.|$|E
40|$|With the {{developments}} of mobile communication, networks and information technology, many new information service patterns and dissemination modes emerge with some security and privacy threats in access control, i. e., {{the ownership of}} data is separated from the admin-istration of them, secondary/mutiple information distribution etc. Existing access control models, which are always proposed for some specific scenarios, are hardly to achieve fine-grained and adaptive access control. In this paper, we propose a novel Cyberspace-oriented Access Control model, termed as CoAC, which avoids the aforementioned threats by compre-hensively considering some vital factors, such as the access <b>requesting</b> <b>entity,</b> general tense, access point, resource, device, networks, internet-based interactive graph and chain of re-source transmission. By appropriately adjusting these factors, CoAC covers most of typical access control models and fulfills the requirements of new information service patterns and dissemination modes. We also present the administrative model of our proposed CoAC mod-el and formally describe the administrative functions and methods used in the administrative model by utilizing Z-notation. Our CoAC is flexible and scalable, it can be further refined and expanded to figure out new opportunities and challenges in the upcoming access control techniques. ...|$|E

The proposed model handles by itself situations both {{in which the}} <b>requesting</b> <b>entity</b> has a past experience with the service and a stranger entity requesting to access the service without any identity and past interaction with the service. The main contribution of the article includes: (1) we define {{an adaptive}} trust evolution algorithm that dynamically adjust trust value according to the entity's behavior thus minimizing human involvement for the security management; (2) we introduce the concept of maximum achievable trust to regulate the susceptible behavior; (3) An adaptive policy analyzer is incorporated for strategic attack detection together with appropriate actions and controls to counter these attack; (4) motivated by human nature, we use the confidence level to judge the recommendations; and (5) also, in order filter the malicious recommendation, we introduce X-bar control charts. In addition, we have showed the effectiveness of our model, by demonstrating it to be attack resistant against Bad mouthing attack, Oscillating behavior attack and conflicting behavior attack. Our future research will also be focused on implementation of the the proposed model on smart devices (laptops, PDAs and smart phones), to analyze the performance and optimized utilization of resources.|$|E
