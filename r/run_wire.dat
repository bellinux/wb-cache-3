50|$|One {{stroke of}} good luck is the sudden and mistaken arrival of an Army company clerk, Private First Class James Driscoll (Bob Newhart in his first film role). Larkin quickly puts Driscoll’s jeep to use by having Henshaw drive {{it back and forth}} behind their lines, after rigging it to {{backfire}} and sound like a tank, in an attempt to fool the Germans. Driscoll himself is put to use improvising misleading radio messages for a hidden microphone, discovered by Corby, left by the Germans in an abandoned pillbox (Newhart was noted for his telephone conversation skits in his stand-up comedy routines). Additionally, Larkin has his men <b>run</b> <b>wire</b> to three empty ammo cans, partially filled with rocks and hung from trees, distributed along gaps in their front lines, which they can pull to create noise to make the Germans believe that a much larger American force is present.|$|E
40|$|The {{transverse}} emittances in the SLAC Linear Collider can {{be severely}} diluted by collective wakefield effects and dis-persion. For the 1997 / 98 SLC/SLD run important changes were {{implemented in the}} way the emittance is optimized. Early in the linac, where the energy spread is large due to BNS damping, the emittance growth is dominated by dispersion. In this regime emittance tuning bumps may introduce additional wakefield tails and their use is now avoided. At the end of the linac the energy spread is min-imal and the emittance measurement is most sensitive to wakefield emittance dilution. In previous years, the emit-tances were tuned on wire scanners located near but not {{at the end of the}} linac (after about 90 % of its length). Simu-lations show that emittance growth of up to 100 % can oc-cur in the remaining 10 %. In this <b>run</b> <b>wire</b> scanners at the entrance of the Final Focus, the last place where the emit-tances can be measured, were used for the optimization. Screens at the end of the linac allow additional real time monitoring of the beam sizes. We show that the different tuning strategy provided significantly improved emittances at the interaction point of the SLC. ...|$|E
