5|$|The {{occupation}} of continental Europe and the Scandinavian North Sea coastline now meant tracking U-boats and enemy warships making for the Atlantic was now more difficult with the thin <b>resource</b> <b>pool</b> available. Assets were needed for reconnaissance, air support for Sunderlands {{operating in the}} Atlantic approaches, and anti-invasion patrol. However, any shipping of mainland Europe {{was likely to be}} hostile, which presented plenty of targets. No. 18 Group RAF continued offensive operations further north against German shipping near Norway. Its first success being the 'torching' of a German freighter near Kristiansund on 22 June by a No. 220 Squadron crew. Priority was anti-invasion operations. With the Battle of Britain underway, the Command was ordered to disrupt German preparations for Operation Sea Lion. In this respect, former RAF-Army co-operation squadrons, No. 53 and 59, were handed to Coastal Command in July 1940 for these tasks. No. 254 Squadron was supplemented with No. 21 and 57 Squadron, Bomber Command, in attacking shipping off the Norwegian coast, as result of alerts that suggested a German amphibious assault from there.|$|E
25|$|Scramble {{competition}} {{involves a}} more equal distribution of resources than contest competition and occurs {{when there is}} a common <b>resource</b> <b>pool</b> that an individual cannot be excluded from. For instance, grazing animals compete more strongly for grass as their population grows and food becomes a limiting resource. Each herbivore receives less food as more individuals compete for the same quantity of food.|$|E
25|$|The way {{in which}} {{resources}} are partitioned by organisms also varies and can be split into scramble and contest competition. Scramble competition involves a relatively even distribution of resources among a population as all individuals exploit a common <b>resource</b> <b>pool.</b> In contrast, contest competition is the uneven distribution of resources and occurs when hierarchies in a population influence the amount of resource each individual receives. Organisms in the most prized territories or {{at the top of}} the hierarchies obtain a sufficient quantity of the resources, whereas individuals without a territory don’t obtain any of the resource.|$|E
40|$|Measurability is {{a concept}} in elastic scaling based on the {{following}} two conditions: (a) a cloud service provider should be cautious, that is, should not exclude any cloud consumer’s <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern strategy from consideration; and (b) a cloud service provider should consider the cloud consumers’ <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern preferences, that is, should deem a cloud consumer’s <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern strategy ki infinitely more likely than k'i if it premises the cloud consumer to prefer ki to k'i. A <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern strategy is measurable if it can optimally be chosen under common <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern conjecture in the events (a) and (b). In this paper we present an algorithm that for every finite elastic scaling operation computes the set of all measurable <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern strategies. The algorithm {{is based on the}} new idea of a Static Workload preference limitation, which is a pair (ki, Vi) consisting of a <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern strategy ki, and a subset of <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern strategies Vi, for cloud service provider i. The interpretation is that cloud service provider i prefers some <b>resource</b> <b>pooling</b> pattern strategy in Vi to ki. The algorithm proceeds by successively adding Static Workload preference limitations to the elastic scaling...|$|R

40|$|Shared <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> are {{facilities}} {{featuring a}} certain amount of resources which can be used by different applications. For managing <b>resources</b> in such <b>pools,</b> the demand of each application can be used. Such a demand, however, is driven by the workload, which varies over time. For that reason, adaptive approaches have been proposed for the management of shared <b>resources</b> <b>pools.</b> Whereas a number of solutions exist in this context, they are either not truly decentralized or do not apply to the problem we are dealing with. In this paper, we then present Darma, an approach for managing shared <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> in a truly decentralized, adaptive, and optimal way. 1...|$|R
500|$|Patton's {{offensive}} {{came to a}} halt on August 31, 1944, as the Third Army ran out of fuel {{near the}} Moselle River, just outside Metz. Patton expected that the theater commander would keep fuel and supplies flowing to support successful advances, but Eisenhower favored a [...] "broad front" [...] approach to the ground-war effort, believing that a single thrust would have to drop off flank protection, and would quickly lose its punch. Still within the constraints of a very large effort overall, Eisenhower gave Montgomery and his Twenty First Army Group a higher priority for supplies for Operation Market Garden. Combined with other demands on the limited <b>resource</b> <b>pool,</b> this resulted in the Third Army exhausting its fuel supplies. Patton believed his forces were close enough to the Siegfried Line that he remarked to Bradley that with 400,000gallons of gasoline he could be in Germany within two days. In late September, a large German Panzer counterattack sent expressly to stop the advance of Patton's Third Army was defeated by the U.S. 4th Armored Division at the Battle of Arracourt. Despite the victory, the Third Army stayed in place as a result of Eisenhower's order. The German commanders believed this was because their counterattack had been successful.|$|E

40|$|In this Article, {{we argue}} that {{property}} theory, appropriately understood, shows that subsurface water, oil, and gas ought {{to be treated as}} shared property that can be exploited, {{if it is to be}} exploited at all, by the coordinating agreements of owners of the surface property, or their licensees, supervised by common law courts. We therefore offer the paradigm of shared property as the appropriate analysis for thinking about the law 2 ̆ 7 s approach to rights in oil and natural gas. We also argue that the shared property paradigm is largely consistent with the common law 2 ̆ 7 s approach to subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools,</b> even though conventional understanding of the law vacillates between the private property and commons property paradigms. Much of this Article is revisionist. We argue, unconventionally, that the common law embraced the paradigm of shared property in much of its regulation of subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> because it essentially treated those resources as owned by tenants in common, as modified by the common law nuisance exception for injuries to subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools.</b> Under this reading, the special common law rules regarding subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> have been misunderstood either as providing for (1) commons property treatment of subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> underground followed by private property treatment after the resources are extracted from the subsurface pools or (2) private property treatment of the resources even while underground but subject to loss of title if the resources crossed property boundaries. Under our reading of the cases, when interpreted against the paradigm of shared property, the common law consistently recognized shared ownership of subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> yet limited surface owner 2 ̆ 7 s rights to quiet enjoyment of subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> based solely on courts 2 ̆ 7 own perceived incapacity, because the resources are hidden, to understand the causal relationship between land use and disruption of enjoyment of subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools.</b> But this limit did not prevent courts from coordinating the exploitation of subsurface <b>resource</b> <b>pools</b> between surface owners by * 1043 recognizing causes of action for malicious interference, waste, and unreasonable exploitation. This analysis supports our claim that the property issues inherent in today 2 ̆ 7 s concerns over horizontal slickwater fracturing can be addressed under private agreements that are subject to judicial supervision. Moreover, because we now have the seismic technology to understand resource location and flows, the common law 2 ̆ 7 s reluctance to provide common owners of shared property with an accounting should dissipate...|$|R

40|$|<b>Resource</b> <b>pools</b> are {{collections}} of computational resources {{which can be}} shared by different applications.
