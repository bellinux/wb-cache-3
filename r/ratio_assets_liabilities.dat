The thesis analyzes the relationship of working {{capital management}} on company’s profitability in Indonesia for the period 2007 to 2011. For this purpose, multiple regression analysis is used to analyze 127 manufacturing companies which are listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange. The results indicate that the current asset to total <b>assets</b> <b>ratio,</b> current <b>liabilities</b> to total <b>assets</b> <b>ratio,</b> firm’s size, and sales growth are significantly affecting the profitability of firms. The effective policies must be formulated for the individual components of working capital. Furthermore, efficient management of financing and investing of working capital management (current <b>assets</b> and current <b>liabilities)</b> can increase the operating profitability of manufacturing companies. Keywords: Efficient Working Capital Management, Gross Working Capital Turnover <b>Ratio,</b> Current <b>Assets</b> to Total <b>Assets</b> <b>Ratio,</b> Current <b>Liabilities</b> to Total <b>Assets</b> <b>Ratio,...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} focused on the {{analysis}} and comparison of liquidity <b>ratios</b> and <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> management practices in top three banks from public, private and foreign sector in India. The analysis is based upon the liquidity ratios calculation and the determination of maturity gap profiles for the banks under study. The paper also compares these banks maturity gap profiles with their corresponding group’s maturity gap profiles. This paper identifies the interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet items of these banks to determine the gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities. The {{results of this study suggest}} that overall banks in India have very good short term liquidity position and all banks are financing their short term liabilities by their long term assets...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} a measure of external imbalances that combines the trade and the financial channels to forecast the real effective exchange rate for Chile. By making use of a quarterly database of external <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> for the period 1983 to 2005, and employing a recently developed test of out-of-sample predictive ability, we show that this measure is able to predict the real exchange rate at horizons of up to 2 years. Out-of-sample evidence of predictability tends to get stronger as the size of the window used to estimate the parameters increases. This is probably because of the greater relative importance of the external balance in the dynamics of the exchange rate in the last few years, or because of the increasing precision of parameter estimates with the sample size. When we break down our measure of external imbalances into its three components: exports to imports <b>ratio,</b> exports to <b>assets</b> <b>ratio</b> and <b>assets</b> to <b>liabilities</b> <b>ratio,</b> we find that out-of-sample predictability is mainly driven by the last two ratios. ...|$|R

The financial distress is a condition before the bankruptcy {{that can be seen}} inthe financial statements. Furthermore, the financial statements are being analyzed using ratioanalysis. The ratio analysis used as a predictor variable are current ratio, quick ratio, currentassets to total <b>assets</b> <b>ratio,</b> current <b>liabilities</b> to total <b>assets,</b> net profit margin ratio and net SHUto total <b>assets</b> <b>ratio.</b> While the research object is a cooperative financial statements reported on 2012. There are 63 cooperatives used as the sample with purposive sampling approach. Thehypothesis is analysed using logistic regression. The results found that three variables can be used to predict financial distress of the cooperative. Those variables are <b>ratio</b> of current <b>assets</b> to total <b>assets,</b> current <b>liabilities</b> to total <b>assets</b> and net SHU to total assets.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{purpose of}} this article is to analyse the trade-off between the (un) certainty in contributions on the one hand and benefits on the other that is embedded in different pension arrangements. The article employs the funding <b>ratio</b> (<b>ratio</b> of <b>assets</b> to <b>liabilities)</b> and the replacement rate (ratio of benefits to salaries) as key criteria for evaluating the risk sharing characteristics of a private pension plan from the perspective of the plan member. The stochastic simulations performed show that hybrid plans (those in between traditional DB and individual DC) appear to be more efficient and sustainable forms of risk sharing than either of the other two. Of the three main hybrid plans analysed, conditional indexation plans appear to have the greatest potential as sustainable forms of risk sharing. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the discussion about mandatory participation in collective funded pension schemes. It explores under what circumstances individual participants exercise the option to exit such a scheme if participation is voluntary. We begin by showing how the willingness to participate increases if the period over which the option is valid becomes longer. Then, we demonstrate how the pension fund’s set of policy instruments can be deployed to minimize the likelihood that any cohort exits the pension scheme. The instruments consist of contribution and indexation policies. Recovery of the funding ratio, i. e. the <b>ratio</b> of <b>assets</b> over <b>liabilities,</b> to its regulatory target level may be based on uniform contributions or age-dependent contributions. Specifically, while {{the value of the}} exit option deters younger workers from exiting the pension fund, a uniform contribution policy encourages older workers to stay in the pension scheme...|$|R
40|$|June 2013 As public {{pension plans}} {{continue}} to smooth in the losses from the 2008 downturn {{of the stock}} market, {{it is not surprising}} that the <b>ratio</b> of <b>assets</b> to <b>liabilities</b> has declined from 75 percent in 2011 to 73 percent in 2012. The Boston College research team also found that pension plan sponsors paid 80 percent of their annual required contribution (ARC) in 2012, roughly the same level they funded in 2011. This issue brief tackles the confusing road ahead as public pension plans calculate their <b>assets</b> and <b>liabilities</b> in 2014 according to new accounting standards issued by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). Key observations: • Funded levels among plans vary substantially; a few large plans had funded levels below 50 percent. • The growth of liabilities has slowed, but the growth of assets has slowed even more. • The 2012 valuations do not include the 24 percent stock market increase from June 2012 to June 2013. • The ARC increased significantly over the last three years due to higher unfunded liabilities related to the financial crisis. What are the implications for the future? While there will be more pension calculations to explain (see “Understanding New Public Pension Funding Guidelines and Calculations ” a...|$|R

The pension schemes that provide safer and smoother consumption streams are ranked higher in utility terms. The smoother consumption stream can be achieved by allowing risk shifting over time, using mainly indexation instruments instead of contribution instruments.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model the {{transfers}} of value {{between the various}} generations in a funded pension scheme (pension fund). Value-based generational accounting is used as framework of analysis. Pension benefits and contributions may depend on the funding ratio (the <b>ratio</b> of <b>assets</b> to <b>liabilities</b> of the fund). Furthermore, we define explicit risk allocation rules, specifying which stakeholders, when, {{and to what extent}} bear the risk. A pension deal may lead to substantial transfers of wealth between young and old generations, depending on the asset returns and the exact risk allocation scheme. Using contingent claims valuation methods, we calculate these transfers and the distribution of value across generations. A pension deal is recognized as a zero-sum game in value-terms, however it is potentially a positive-sum game in welfare-terms. Pension schemes that provide safer and smoother consumption streams are ranked higher in utility terms. A smoother consumption stream can be achieved by allowing risk shifting over time, using benefit indexation instruments, contribution instruments or a combination of these two type of instruments. Our results show that intergenerational risk sharing is welfare-enhancing compared with pure individual pension schemes. Even initially under-funded collective funds may still provide higher utilities than the individual benchmark...|$|R
40|$|In {{non-financial}} defined contribution (NDC) pension systems {{the contribution}} rate is kept {{at a constant}} level. A key element is the balance mechanism which is automatically applied if the finances appear insufficient. The balance mechanism {{is based on the}} <b>ratio</b> of <b>assets</b> to <b>liabilities.</b> When the ratio is below unity, it will slow down the indexation of both notional pension accounts and pension benefits. Thus the burden of adjustment will fall on replacement rates, but when and how, depends on what the demographic and economic future will contain. We apply the balance mechanism to the Finnish private-sector earnings-related pension system and simulate the future with stochastic population projections and asset yields. The results show that depending on the contribution rate level, a direct application of the balance mechanism {{may turn out to be}} a slow way of running down the system, or end up with huge funds. The problems may appear very far in the future. Scaling the balance mechanism appropriately, however, results in financial stability. korkeatasoisen ja geneerisen akateemisen tutkimuksen turvaaminen ennakkoluulottoman tuottavana ilman pakottamista yksitt 4 isen sovellusalan 2 ̆ 01 dmuottiin 2 ̆ 01 d.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{are going}} to study <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> {{management}} throughout the macroeconomic cycle in financial institutions. There are two important problems in financial institutions. The first is that <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> management has significant effects on the financial institution's value. The second is that in different stages of the macroeconomic cycle, the effect of <b>asset</b> and <b>liability</b> management approaches is not same. Therefore, the purpose of the thesis is to study how <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> management causes economic consequences for financial institutions and in what capacity. In this thesis, based on the analysis of <b>asset</b> <b>liability</b> management and the economic cycle, we establish a dynamic system to simulate how a financial institution makes decision throughout economic cycles. In order to simulate the system, we established a model to reflect how the economic cycle affects the financial institution's value by using the economic relationship and we built up the decision making progress. Then we simulate the system through Matlab. From the simulation results, we can observe the changes of system in the given time horizon. by Jingsi Yan. Thesis (S. M.)
