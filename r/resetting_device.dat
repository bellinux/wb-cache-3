A new charge sensitive circuit is introduced to amplify the hole signals with on-chip n-channel JFETs {{and without any}} <b>resetting</b> <b>devices.</b> The JFET gate-source junction is forward biased and the drain current is stabilized by a low frequency feedback on the JFET p+ well contact (used as a buried gate for the JFET). Preliminary setups with PIN diodes and tetrode n-JFETs are successfully tested. With about 5 pF total input capacitance, resolution of 86 rms electrons at 223 K with 10 us shaping time is obtained.

30|$|In this paper, we {{presented}} a forensic framework for mobile devices {{based on the}} cold boot attack. In contrast to other state-of-the-art implementations, we do not boot a full-fledged Linux kernel on the target device. Instead, we boot our easily portable minimal BMA, which occupies no more than 3 KB in the RAM. The BMA preserves the data structures of the previously running kernel and does not <b>reset</b> <b>device</b> memory. As we only overwrite constant data in the kernel code section, this ensures {{that all of the}} important kernel data remains available for analysis. The BMA provides a serial communication interface. This interface allows to dynamically request parts of the main memory. Forensic analysis can thus be conducted on the host system. For this purpose, we extended Volatility with a serial communication module for the analysis of the target device’s memory.|$|R

Tests used the Cellebrite UME- 36 Pro with the UFED Physical Analyzer, the Bulk Extractor open-source tool, and our own programs for extracting metadata, classifying file paths, and comparing them between images. Two phones were subjected to more detailed analysis. Results showed that many kinds of data were removed by the resets, but much user-specific configuration data was left. Android devices did poorly at removing user documents and media, and occasional surprising user data was left on all devices including photo images, audio, documents, phone numbers, email addresses, geolocation data, configuration data, and keys. A conclusion is that <b>reset</b> <b>devices</b> can still provide some useful information to a forensic investigation...|$|R
50|$|An {{oscillator}} start-up timer (OST) is {{a module}} {{used by some}} microcontrollers to keep the <b>device</b> <b>reset</b> until the crystal oscillator is stable. When a crystal oscillator starts up, its frequency is not constant, which causes the clock frequency to be non-constant. This would cause timing errors, leading to many problems. An oscillator start-up timer ensures that the device only operates when the oscillator generates a stable clock frequency.The PIC microcontroller's oscillator start-up timer holds the <b>device's</b> <b>reset</b> for a 1024-oscillator-cycle delay to allow the oscillator to stabilize.|$|R

50|$|SMBus has a {{time-out}} feature which <b>resets</b> <b>devices</b> if {{a communication}} takes too long.This explains the {{minimum clock frequency}} of 10 kHz to prevent locking up the bus. I²C can be a ‘DC’ bus, meaning that a slave device stretches the master clock when performing some routine while the master is accessing it. This will notify to the master that the slave is busy but {{does not want to}} lose the communication. The slave device will allow continuation after its task is complete. There is no limit in the I²C-bus protocol as to how long this delay can be, whereas for an SMBus system, it would be limited to 35 ms.SMBus protocol just assumes that if something takes too long, then it means {{that there is a problem}} on the bus and that all <b>devices</b> must <b>reset</b> in order to clear this mode. Slave devices are not then allowed to hold the clock LOW too long.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to inkjet printers, toner {{cartridges}} may contain smart chips that {{reduce the number}} of pages that can be printed with it (reducing the amount of usable ink or toner in the cartridge to sometimes only 50%), in an effort to increase sales of the {{toner cartridges}}. Besides being more expensive to the consumer, this technique also increases waste, and thus increases pressure on the environment. For these toner cartridges (as with inkjet cartridges), <b>reset</b> <b>devices</b> can be used to override the limitation set by the smart chip. Also, for some printers, online walk-throughs have been posted to demonstrate how to use up all the ink in the cartridge. [...] These chips offer no benefit to the end consumer—all laser printers originally used an optical mechanism to assess the amount of remaining toner in the cartridge rather than using a chip to electrically count the number of printed pages, and the chip's only function was as an alternate method to decrease the cartridge's usable life.|$|R
50|$|The {{ability for}} an {{electronic}} device {{to be able}} to reset itself in case of error or abnormal power loss is an important aspect of embedded system design and programming. This ability can be observed with everyday electronics such as a television, audio equipment or the electronics of a car, which are able to function as intended again even after having lost power suddenly. A sudden and strange error with a device might sometimes be fixed by removing and restoring power, making the <b>device</b> <b>reset.</b> Some <b>devices,</b> such as portable media players, very often have a dedicated reset button as they are prone to freezing or locking up. The lack of a proper reset ability could otherwise possibly render the device useless after a power loss or malfunction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{trend of}} {{microcontroller}} in industrial {{as well as}} domestic application is increasing now-a-days. The use of microcontroller is increasing due to the following advantages/features of controller such as Processor <b>reset,</b> <b>Device</b> clocking, central processor, RAM, I/O pins and Instruction cycle timers. There {{are two types of}} microcontroller available. They are- Embedded (8, 16, 32 -bit) and Digital Signal Processors. Now-a-days advanced controllers such as PIC, ARM and AVR are widely used in which AVR is used mostly due to several advantages. The disinfectant cleaner used by doctors to clean the medical instruments specially used in Endoscopy are very large in size, bulky and costly. The design of Disinfectant Cleaner is cost effective, light in weight, mobile and user friendly. Atmel AVR 8 - and 32 -bit microcontrollers deliver a unique combination of performance, power efficiency, and design flexibility. Optimized to speed time to market, they are based on the industry's most code-efficient architecture for C and assembly programming. No other microcontrollers deliver more computing performance with better power efficiency...|$|R

40|$|CMOS image sensors {{have benefited}} from {{technology}} scaling down to 0. 35 µm with only minor process modifications. Several studies have predicted that below 0. 25 µm, it will become difficult, if not impossible to implement CMOS image sensors with acceptable performance without more significant process modifications. To explore the imaging performance of CMOS image sensors fabricated in standard 0. 18 µm technology, we designed a set of single pixel photodiode and photogate APS test structures. The test structures include pixels with different size n+/pwell and nwell/psub photodiodes and nMOS photogates. To reduce the leakages due to the in-pixel transistors, the follower, photogate, and transfer devices all use 3. 3 V thick oxide transistors. To achieve higher voltage swing, the <b>reset</b> <b>devices</b> also use thick oxide transistors. The paper reports on the key imaging parameters measured from these test structures including conversion gain, dark current and spectral response. We find that dark current density decreases super-linearly in reverse bias voltage, which {{suggests that it is}} desirable to run the photodetectors at low bias voltages. We find that QE is quite low due to high pwell doping concentration. Finally we find that the photogate circuit suffered from high transfer gate off current. QE is not significantly affected by this problem, however...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we present the circuit VERDI (VErsatile Readout for Detector Integration), an {{integrated}} circuit {{developed for the}} readout of different families of radiation detectors, from nitrogen-cooled Ge and Si(Li) detectors, to silicon drift detectors (SDDs), scintillation detectors, photomultipliers tubes and others. The circuit may represent a suitable solution when a compact integration between a multi-element detector and the front-end readout is needed to realize a compact and low-power detection module. The circuit includes 8 channels, each one composed by a charge preamplifier, a shaping amplifier, a gain stage, a baseline holder and a peak stretcher. An on-chip selector provides at the output of each channel the waveform of a specific stage, including an RC integrator for external digital processing of the signal. Alternatively, the 8 channels may be multiplexed on a single output. Different settings, like gain, shaping time, preamplifier compensation and others, may be externally programmed by SPI accordingly to the specific detector in use. Only the input JFET, feedback capacitor and <b>reset</b> <b>device</b> are left external to the ASIC, and must be chosen specifically for each detector.

Using discrete JFET integrating amplifiers at their optimum temperature of 55 K, read noise less than 7. 5 electrons in 128 seconds of integration was obtained. Two models of single channel integrators are now available, the JF- 77 for use between 50 and 80 K and the JF- 4 for lower temperatures. A 1 x 15 linear array of complete integrators on a single integrated circuit was developed and will be made available in the near future. The successful operation of a superconducting stepper motor was demonstrated. The motor shows a three fold increase in torque over conventional motors operating at room temperature. The success of the motor stems {{from the use of}} superconducting coils in conjunction with developments in bearings for cryogenic use, rare-earth rotors, and motor cooling techniques.
