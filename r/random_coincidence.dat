However, in-beam PET data, measured at beams with a sub-µs-microstructure due to the accelerator radiofrequency (RF), are highly corrupted by <b>random</b> <b>coincidences</b> arising from prompt γ-rays following nuclear reactions as the projectiles penetrate the tissue [2, 3]. Since conventional PET random-correction techniques fail, the clinical in-beam PET at the therapy facility at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) Darmstadt merely reconstructs events registered in the pauses (∼ 2 - 4 s) between the beam macropulses (≤ 2 s) [1].

40|$|<b>Random</b> <b>coincidences</b> {{degrade the}} image in Positron Emission Tomography, PET. To {{compensate}} for their degradation effects, the rate of <b>random</b> <b>coincidences</b> should be estimated. Under certain circumstances, current estimation methods fail to provide accurate results. We propose a novel method, "Singles-Prompts" (SP), that includes the information conveyed by prompt coincidences and models the pile-up. The SP method has the same structure than the well-known "Singles Rate" (SR) approach. Hence, SP can straightforwardly replace SR. In this work, the SP method has been extensively assessed and compared to two conventional methods, SR and the delayed window (DW) method, in a preclinical PET scenario using Monte-Carlo simulations. SP offers accurate estimates for the randoms rates, while SR and DW tend to overestimate the rates (∼ 10 %, and 5 %, respectively). With pile-up, the SP method is more robust than SR (but less than DW). At the image level, the contrast is overestimated in SR-corrected images, + 16 %, while SP produces the correct value. Spill-over is slightly reduced using SP instead of SR. The DW images values {{are similar to those}} of SP except for low-statistic scenarios, where DW behaves as if randoms were not compensated for. In particular, the contrast is reduced, - 16 %. In general, the better estimations of SP translate into better image quality...|$|R
