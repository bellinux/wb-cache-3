The lyrics {{recall a}} {{youthful}} love affair: [...] "Do you <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> fell in love/We were young and innocent then". The song {{is set in the}} key of an original F Minor with Jackson's voice range from Eb3 to C5. The song's tempo is moderate at 116 beats per minute.|$|E
500|$|On 31 December 2008, it was {{announced}} that Pratchett was to be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band really knew what they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E
5000|$|... "'All I Want' started {{life as a}} {{possible}} track for the last studio album Whatever You Say, Say Nothing then got left behind. For technophobes this is from a rough mix, an old DAT and no one <b>remembers</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> recorded it or who pressed the red button — but it's as good as anything else here" ...|$|R

There are dollars in that city, and they are scarce just now at San Cristoval. Morales has been here, you understand. In the {{meanwhile}} {{it is likely that}} Don Pancho will find you a bottle of wine and a little comida.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{incarnation}} of the band was named Force and came together in 1979, in Upplands Väsby, Stockholm, and was integrated by vocalist Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bass guitarist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno. [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started the band Force we were playing covers in the rehearsal room, because {{we just wanted to}} learn our instruments, like all bands," [...] Tempest said, [...] "Then one day I said maybe we should do our own stuff. Nobody had any ideas, so I brought mine into the rehearsal room, and that is when we started writing our own stuff." ...|$|E
2500|$|The closing track, {{the longest}} {{composition}} ever released by Dylan, the 16-minute [...] "Highlands", most probably took its central motif ("My heart's in the highlands") from {{a poem by}} Robert Burns called [...] "My heart's in the highlands" [...] (published in 1790). In Jim Dickinson's account, [...] "I <b>remember,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> finished 'Highlands'—there are two other versions of that, the one that made the record is the rundown, literally, {{you can hear the}} beat turn over, which I think Dylan liked. But, anyway, after we finished it, one of the managers came out, and he said, [...] "Well, Bob, have you got a short version of that song?" [...] And Dylan looked at him and said: 'That was the short version.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{not all of}} Lopez's {{collaborators}} were new. She {{reunited with}} longtime collaborator, Rodney Jerkins (Darkchild) {{who has worked with}} Lopez numerous times in the past. Darkchild produced [...] "This Cannot Be Love", although the song did not make the final track listing for Love? It has similar introductory chords to [...] "The Boy Is Mine" [...] (1998) by Brandy Norwood and Monica. [...] "This Cannot Be Love" [...] has a progressive uptempo melody which continues to gather pace {{over the course of the}} song, while in the lyrics Lopez [...] "asks if true love exists." [...] When asked what inspired some of the album's records, Lopez told The Advocate, that whenever she records a new album she always thinks of dance music as it is popular in the gay community and club cultures. She said songs like [...] "This Cannot Be Love"have musicality similar to her worldwide hit, [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999), which was well received by the LGBT community. [...] " [...] talks about the idea of getting lazy in love. You know how we do that? When you're with somebody and you're like: Wait a minute— <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were so in love and obsessed with each other? What happened?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} {{hear that}} you feel like that, Julien. I <b>remember</b> {{sometimes}} <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were alone together in England, we seemed to find it a trifle difficult." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now that you've {{had your}} adventure, {{do you feel}} any better?" [...] I <b>remember</b> asking <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had changed our clothes and were sitting dry and {{comfortable}} again in the cockpit.|$|R
2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house." [...] Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.|$|E

6000|$|... “Yes, and we {{are going}} to journey from winter into summer,” added Phil. “It’s good <b>we</b> <b>remembered</b> that <b>when</b> <b>we</b> packed our suit-cases. At first I was going to put in nothing but heavy clothing.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Dunbar continued, [...] "They {{said this}} song is a smash in the gay community. And I said, gay community? They said, yeah man, it's a smash. And I says, why is it that? And they said, well it's what the lyrics are saying. She said the guy couldn't make love to her so they figured {{he had to be}} gay! And I said oh no! And I <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> they said that to me and I listened back to the song and there was a part in there... because I <b>remembered</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were editing that tune, it was too long, so we had to cut a section out of the tune so the section we cut out of the song really brought the whole song story together." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Our {{mother died}} before I can <b>remember,</b> and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were fifteen our father was seized with a {{dangerous}} illness which no spells could cure. Feeling death draw near, he called us to his bedside and took leave {{of us in}} these words: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he said. [...] "But I doubt, now," [...] he continued, with {{a little}} deprecating wave of his tea-cup at me, [...] "if Miss M. can <b>remember</b> me. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> first met we were {{precisely}} one week old, precisely one week old." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>remember</b> how, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had drunk, {{she raised}} her goblet--a {{beautiful}} chaste cup of solid gold--and drank, herself, in acknowledgment; and I remember, too, how, chancing to move my head, I caught a most singular, ill-omened smile upon the coarse lips of Messer Ramiro.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I {{hurt your}} {{feelings}} yesterday. Don't you <b>remember,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were visiting my patients--I think I spoke rather harshly. I didn't mean to. I'm very sorry." ...|$|E

6000|$|HELEN: I fear 'twill shake Thy gentle {{heart with}} tears.

[...] 600 Alas! all hope is buried now. But then men dreamed the aged earth Was labouring in that mighty birth, Which many a poet and a sage Has aye foreseen--the happy age [...] 605 When truth and love shall dwell below Among the works and ways of men; Which on this world not power but will Even now is wanting to fulfil.|$|R

6000|$|... "Do you think," [...] she enquired {{after a brief}} pause, [...] "that {{you will}} enjoy soldiering better than pseudo-diplomacy? I don't exactly know how to refer to your work.

6000|$|... "Very like," [...] said Mick; [...] "there's {{nothing that}} makes one so thirsty as {{listening}} to a song, particularly if it touches the feelings.
