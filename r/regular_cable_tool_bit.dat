50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>tool</b> rigs are {{simpler and}} cheaper than {{similarly}} sized rotary rigs, although loud and very slow to operate. The world record <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> well was drilled in New York {{to a depth}} of almost 12,000 ft. The common Bucyrus-Erie 22 can drill down to about 1,100 ft. Since <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> drilling does not use air to eject the drilling chips like a rotary, instead using a cable strung bailer, technically there is no limitation on depth.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{oil wells}} {{in modern times}} were drilled percussively, by repeatedly raising and dropping a <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> into the earth. In the 20th century, <b>cable</b> <b>tools</b> were largely replaced with rotary drilling, which could drill boreholes to much greater depths and in less time. The record-depth Kola Borehole used non-rotary mud motor drilling to achieve a depth of over 12000 m.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cable</b> <b>tool</b> rigs now {{are nearly}} {{obsolete}} in the United States. They are mostly used in Africa or Third-World countries. Being slow, <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> rig drilling means increased wages for drillers. In the United States drilling wages would average around US$200 per day per man, while in Africa {{it is only}} US$6 per day per man, so a slow drilling machine can still be used in undeveloped countries with depressed wages. A <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> rig can drill 25 ft to 60 ft of hard rock a day. A newer rotary drillcat top head rig equipped with down-the-hole (DTH) hammer can drill 500 ft or more per day, depending on size and formation hardness.|$|R
50|$|The {{toolpost}} is {{the part}} of a metalworking lathe which either holds the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> directly or holds a toolholder which contains the <b>tool</b> <b>bit.</b> There are a great variety of designs for toolposts (including basic toolposts, rocker toolposts, quick-change toolposts, and toolpost turrets) and toolholders (with varying geometry and features).|$|R

5000|$|A box tool {{is mounted}} on the turret of a turret lathe or screw machine. It is {{essentially}} a toolpost that brings its follower rest along with it. A <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> (or several <b>tool</b> <b>bits)</b> and a compact follower rest (usually V-shaped or with two rollers) are mounted opposite {{each other in a}} body which surrounds the workpiece (forms a [...] "box" [...] around it). As the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> puts a lateral deflecting force on the workpiece, the follower rest opposes it, providing rigidity. A different and popular type of box tool uses two rollers rather than a follower rest. One roller is called a [...] "sizing roller" [...] and the other roller is called a [...] "burnishing roller". The rollers turn with the stock to reduce scarring on the finished turn. Opposing <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> may be used (instead of a rest) to cancel each other's deflecting forces (called a [...] "balanced turning tool"), in which case the box tool begins to overlap in form, function, and identity with a hollow mill.|$|R

5000|$|The oldest form of {{drilling}} machinery is the <b>cable</b> <b>tool,</b> still used today. Specifically designed {{to raise and}} lower a bit into the bore hole, the spudding of the drill causes the bit to be raised and dropped onto {{the bottom of the}} hole, and the design of the cable causes the bit to twist at approximately [...] revolution per drop, thereby creating a drilling action. Unlike rotary drilling, <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> drilling requires the drilling action to be stopped so that the bore hole can be bailed or emptied of drilled cuttings.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>bits</b> {{have been}} used for centuries, yet their further {{technological}} development continues even today. Before about 1900, almost all <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> were made by their users, and many machine shops had forges. In fact, good machinists were expected to have blacksmithing knowledge, and although the chemistry and physics of the heat treatment of steel were not well understood (as compared with today's sciences), the practical art of heat treatment was quite advanced, and something that most skilled metalworkers were comfortably acquainted with. <b>Tool</b> <b>bits</b> were made of carbon tool steels, which have high enough carbon content to take hardening well. Each bit was forged with a hammer, quenched, and then ground with a grindstone. The exact details of the heat treatment and tip geometry were a matter of individual experience and preference.|$|R

In 1903, he introduced the offset <b>bit</b> for <b>cable</b> <b>tool</b> drilling to enable casing wells in hard rock and in 1912 the cement retainer that allowed casing to be cemented in the wells.
