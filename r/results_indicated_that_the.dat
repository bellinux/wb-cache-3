5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge {{that they were not}} deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
25|$|Boring's minor {{research}} strayed too {{far from}} Titchener's definition of psychology. It was at Titchener's suggestion {{that he decided to}} do his thesis on visceral sensibility. He conducted the study by placing a stomach tube in his own stomach {{to learn more about the}} sensations of the alimentary tract. The <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stomach and esophagus were more sensitive to temperature and pressure than had been realized. The studies indicate his interest, from an early age, in the physical and experimental components of psychology. In 1914, Boring's efforts were rewarded when he received his Ph.D.|$|E

25|$|The Neural Basis of Rationalization: Cognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making (2010) {{applied the}} free-choice {{paradigm}} to fMRI {{examination of the}} brain's decision-making process whilst the study participant actively tried to reduce cognitive dissonance. The <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> active reduction of psychological dissonance increased neural activity in the right-inferior frontal gyrus, in the medial fronto-parietal region, and in the ventral striatum, and that neural activity decreased in the anterior insula.

25|$|Latané and Darley {{performed}} three {{experiments to}} test bystander behavior in non-emergency situations Their <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{way in which}} the subjects were asked for help mattered. In one condition, subjects asked a bystander for his or her name. More people gave an answer when the students gave their name first. In another condition, the students asked bystanders for a dime. When the student gave an explanation, such as saying that their wallet had been stolen, the percentage of people giving assistance was higher (72%) than when the student just asked for a dime (34%). Additional research by Faul, Mark, et al., using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency, indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation.|$|E
25|$|In the North Pacific Ocean, the tritium (introduced as bomb tritium in the Northern Hemisphere) {{spread in}} three dimensions. There were {{subsurface}} maxima {{in the middle}} and low latitude regions, which is indicative of lateral mixing (advection) and diffusion processes along lines of constant potential density (isopycnals) in the upper ocean. Some of these maxima even correlate well with salinity extrema. In order to obtain the structure for ocean circulation, the tritium concentrations were mapped on 3 surfaces of constant potential density (23.90, 26.02, and 26.81). <b>Results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tritium was well-mixed (at 6 to 7nbsp&TU) on the 26.81 isopycnal in the subarctic cyclonic gyre and there appeared to be a slow exchange of tritium (relative to shallower isopycnals) between this gyre and the anticyclonic gyre to the south; also, the tritium on the 23.90 and 26.02 surfaces appeared to be exchanged at a slower rate between the central gyre of the North Pacific and the equatorial regions.|$|E

25|$|Another type of device {{people use}} {{to help their}} recall memory become {{efficient}} chunking. Chunking {{is the process of}} breaking down numbers into smaller units to remember the information or data, this helps recall numbers and math facts. An example of this chunking process is a telephone number; this is chunked with three digits, three digits, then four digits. People read them off as such when reciting a phone number to another person. There has been research done about these techniques and an institution tested two groups of people to see if these types of devices work well for real people, the results came back determining a significant performance difference between the group who did not use cognitive strategies and the group who did. The group using the techniques immediately performed better than the other group and when taking a pre-test and post-test the <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group using the techniques improved while the other group did not.|$|E
25|$|Dietary and {{nutritional}} choices affect sleep duration and quality. Research is being conducted {{in an attempt}} to discover what kinds of nutritional choices result in better sleep quality. A study in the Western Journal of Nursing Research in 2011 compared how sleep quality was affected by four different diets: a high-protein diet, a high-fat diet, a high-carbohydrate diet, and a control diet. <b>Results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diets high in protein resulted in fewer wakeful episodes during night-time sleep. The high carbohydrate diet was linked to much shorter periods of quiescent or restful sleep. These results suggest that ingested nutrients do play a role in determining sleep quality. Another investigation published in Nutrition Research in 2012 examined the effects of various combinations of dietary choices in regard to sleep. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} one perfect diet for sleep enhancement, this study indicated that a variety of micro and macro nutrients are needed to maintain levels of healthful and restful sleep. A varied diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat proteins, and whole grains can be the best nutritional option for individuals seeking to improve the quality of their sleep.|$|E
25|$|In a 1998 study, tritium {{concentrations}} in surface seawater and atmospheric water vapor (10meters above the surface) were sampled {{at the following}} locations: the Sulu Sea, the Fremantle Bay, the Bay of Bengal, the Penang Bay, and the Strait of Malacca. <b>Results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tritium concentration in surface seawater was highest at the Fremantle Bay (approximately 0.40Bq/liter), which could be accredited to the mixing of runoff of freshwater from nearby lands due to large amounts found in coastal waters. Typically, lower concentrations were found between 35 and 45 degrees south latitude and near the equator. Results also indicated that (in general) tritium has decreased over the years (up to 1997) due to the physical decay of bomb tritium in the Indian Ocean. As for water vapor, the tritium concentration was approximately one order of magnitude greater than surface seawater concentrations (ranging from 0.46 to 1.15Bq/liter). Therefore, the water vapor tritium is not affected by the surface seawater concentration; thus, the high tritium {{concentrations in}} the vapor were concluded to be {{a direct consequence of}} the downward movement of natural tritium from the stratosphere to the troposphere (therefore, the ocean air showed a dependence on latitudinal change).|$|E

The expedition to Peru is described in the French Geodesic Mission article and that to Lapland is described in the Torne Valley article. The resulting measurements at equatorial and polar latitudes confirmed that the earth was best modelled by an oblate spheroid, supporting Newton.|$|E
