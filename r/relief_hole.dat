5000|$|The Sauer 200 STR is a {{bolt action}} sport rifle {{based on the}} Sauer 200 {{receiver}} introduced in 1985. This receiver is CNC machined out of {{a single piece of}} steel and has been designed for maximum stability and is also used in several other Sauer rifle variants like the SIG-Sauer SSG 3000 and, slightly modified, in the 21st century Sauer 202. Tight manufacturing tolerances, a high quality surface finish and non protruding locking lugs are the basis for [...] "smooth" [...] bolt action manipulation. The bolt has six lugs that lock directly into the barrel. This construction prevents that bolt thrust forces act directly to the receiver that encloses the cartridge with a radial collar that, in conjunction with a gas <b>relief</b> <b>hole</b> intended for pressure relieve during catastrophic ammunition failures, contributes to strength and safety.Further the rifle features a relatively lightweight firing pin resulting in a 3 milliseconds lock time.|$|E

40|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of the herringbone grooved gas journal bearings (HGGJB) under fluid-structure interactions are systematically investigated using the finite element method. Stability and bearing capacity of the HGGJB are estimated and {{compared with those of}} the plain gas journal bearings (PGJB). Influences of the structural parameters, including the spiral angle, the groove number, the groove depth, the pressure <b>relief</b> <b>hole</b> diameter, the bearing radial clearance, the length to diameter ratio, and the rotating speed, on dynamic {{characteristics of}} HGGJB are analyzed. To verify the numerical simulation results, pressure nephograms and cross-section pressure curves of the same rotor model, calculated by the numerical simulation and the theoretical method, respectively, are compared. Similar results are obtained. Compared to the common constrained boundary conditions in the previous numerical simulations, boundary conditions adopted in this paper are complete self-absorption and the change of the gas inlet and outlet depends on the rotating state of the rotor, which are more accordant with the real dynamic {{characteristics of the}} HGGJB. In all, the results presented in this paper provide a deeper and better understanding of the dynamic characteristics of the HGGJB under fluid-structure interactions...|$|E

40|$|The {{deposition}} {{hole was}} {{closed on the}} 1 st February 2005 signifying {{the start of the}} hydration phase. Groundwater inflow through a number of conductive discrete fractures resulted in elevated porewater pressures leading to the formation of conductive channels (piping), the extrusion of bentonite from the hole and the discharge of groundwater to the gallery floor. This problem was addressed by drilling two pressure-relief holes in the surrounding rock mass. Artificial hydration began on the 18 th May 2005 after 106 days of testing. Initial attempts to raise porewater pressure in the artificial hydration arrays often resulted in the formation of preferential pathways. These pressure dependent features were not focused in one location but occurred at multiple sites at different times in the test history. These pathways appear to be relatively short lived, closing when water pressure is reduced. It was determined that both pressure <b>relief</b> <b>holes</b> should remain open until the bentonite had generated sufficient swelling pressure to withstand the high water pressure in the system when these holes are closed. Packers were installed into the pressure <b>relief</b> <b>holes</b> on 23 rd March 2006 and sections in them closed off over the period to 5 th July 2006. There was no repeat of the formation of piping through discrete channels so, on 20 th November 2006, pressures to the artificial hydration filters on the canister were increased to 2350 kPa...|$|R
50|$|The M98 action {{features}} {{two large}} oval shaped gas <b>relief</b> <b>holes</b> {{on the bottom}} of the bolt, which when catastrophic failures like a primer, cartridge rupture or detonation occur relieve high pressure gases into the magazine, and a gas shield on the bolt sleeve. Military M98 systems feature a secondary gas relieve where gas is routed down the locking lug raceway to a thumb hole cutout exit on left side of receiver. Civilian M98 systems often lack the thumb hole cut out, as the ammunition feeding is generally simplified to single round feeding only. These safety features are designed to route escaping gas out of the bolt and eventual debris away from the operator's face.|$|R

Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehner also conducted experiments to quarry limestone which took 12 quarrymen 22 days to quarry about 400 tons of stone. The labour force to quarry, transport, carve and install so much sandstone must have run into the thousands including many highly skilled artisans. The skills required to carve these sculptures were developed hundreds of years earlier, as demonstrated by some artefacts that have been dated to the seventh century, before the Khmer came to power.|$|R

50|$|The Accuracy International {{receiver}} {{is bolted}} with four screws and permanently bonded with epoxy {{material to the}} aluminium chassis, and was designed for ruggedness, simplicity and ease of operation. To this end, the heavy-walled, flat-bottomed, flat-sided receiver is a stressed part, machined in-house by AI from a solid piece of forged carbon steel. AW rifles are supplied in two action lengths—standard AW (short) and long SM (magnum). The six bolt lugs, arranged in two rows of three, engage a heat-treated steel locking ring insert pinned inside the front bridge of the action. The ring can be removed and replaced to refresh headspace control on older actions. The AW system cast steel bolt has a 0.75 in diameter combined with gas <b>relief</b> <b>holes</b> in a 0.785 in diameter bolt body and front action bridge allowing high-pressure gases a channel of escape {{in the event of}} a cartridge-case head failure. Against penetrating water or dirt the bolt has milled slots, which also prevent freezing or similar disturbances. Unlike conventional bolt-action rifles, the bolt handle is bent to the rear, which eases the repeating procedure for the operator and reduces the contour of the weapon. The action cocks on opening with a short, 60 degree bolt throw and has a non-rotating (fixed) external extractor and an internal ejector. Firing pin travel is 0.26 in to keep lock times to a minimum. Finally, an 11 mm integral dovetail rail located above the receiver is designed to accommodate different types of optical or electro-optical sights. As an option, a MIL-STD-1913 rail (Picatinny rail) can be permanently pinned, bonded and bolted to the action, providing a standard interface for many optical systems.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{pressure}} management via brine production optimisation to reduce reservoir pressure buildup during carbon dioxide (CO 2) sequestration using a geocellular model representing a {{sector of the}} Bunter Sandstone Formation. The Bunter Sandstone is a deep saline aquifer with high reservoir quality and is a leading candidate for potential CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) in the UK. Brine production optimization during CO 2 sequestration is necessary because it helps minimize brine waste and well construction and operational costs. In this paper, various sensitivity analyses were performed investigating well geometry, injection and production well spacing, pressure management and boundary condition effects. Two scenarios were investigated and development plans were proposed for annual injection of 7 MT/yr CO 2 (Scenario 1), which {{is equivalent to the}} CO 2 emissions of a 1. 2 GW coal-fired power plant, and for scenario 2, where we aim to utilize the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir model. Three pressure management schemes were compared for each scenario: no pressure management or no brine production, passive pressure management where pressure <b>relief</b> <b>holes</b> are drilled and brine passively flows to seafloor without external energy, and active pressure management where brine is actively pumped out. Brine production rate and relief well patterns were evaluated and optimised. The results show that well perforation length and the use of deviated wells {{have a significant impact on}} injectivity improvement whereas well radius has little impact on injectivity. Symmetrical well placements between injection and production wells yields higher storage capacity than asymmetrical ones, and increasing the number of relief wells improves CO 2 storage capacity. In the case of open boundary conditions, no pressure management is required because the reservoir quality enables pressure dissipation, resulting in a pressure buildup of less than 5 bars. In the case of closed boundary conditions, either passive or active pressure management is required to prevent seal failure from overpressurization of the reservoir and it also increases storage capacity. The cases with open boundaries, as expected, yield higher storage capacity than the cases with closed boundaries. In scenario 1, or assumed annual injection of 7 MT, storage capacity is 344 MT without pressure management and with open boundaries. This is compared to 332 and 328 MT for cases with closed boundaries and passive and active pressure management, respectively. In scenario 2, the maximum storage capacity of the model is 684 MT with no pressure management and open boundaries, and 504 and 683 MT with closed boundaries with passive and active pressure management, respectively. The storage efficiency ranges from 1 to 6 % in scenario 1 to the highest at 12 % in the maximum storage capacity case. In addition, three aquifer sizes; open boundary aquifer size of 2. 43 × 1012 m 3, an aquifer size of 1. 8 × 1010 m 3 based on pressure recharge studies of the Esmond Gas Field, and closed boundary aquifer size of 1. 22 × 1010 m 3, were compared for the optimised cases. The study shows that aquifer size has an impact on estimation of CO 2 storage capacity. The storage capacities of the three aquifer size cases ranging from the largest to smallest without pressure management are 344, 105 and 74 MT, respectively...|$|R
