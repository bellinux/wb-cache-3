In the Qur'an, there are many references to animals, detailing that they have souls, form communities, communicate with God and worship Him in their own way. Muhammad forbade his followers to harm any animal {{and asked them to}} respect the rights of animals. It is a distinctive characteristic of the Shariah that all animals have legal rights. Othman Llewellyn even argues that Shariah has mechanisms for the full repair of injuries suffered by non-human creatures including their <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> <b>court,</b> assessment of injuries and awarding of relief to them.

Testimony of CWs is often the centerpiece of the evidence substantiating plaintiffs‚Äô securities fraud claims. As a result, the investigation conducted prior to filing an amended complaint has become a central issue in the realm of securities litigation, subject to attack by the defendants. This Article discusses the legal and ethical considerations for contacting former employees of the defendants who may become ‚Äúconfidential informants‚Äù that provide invaluable information for substantiating securities fraud claims.

50|$|The Legislature also {{passed a}} law that year {{reducing}} the maximum commitment age from 16 to 14 years old. This was {{in keeping with the}} general thought that boys over the age of 14 {{were less likely to be}} reformed. They also abolishment of the alternative sentence. The alternative sentence was handed down by the judge at the time of sentencing and was designed to specify a sentence to prison if the boy was incorrigible at the reform school. In practice, however, it was found that in most cases the alternative sentence to prison was of a lesser duration than the reform school, sometimes amounting to only days. Because of this, some boys would act out at the reform school hoping for their alternative sentence to be enacted and for their sentence to be carried out in prison for a few days or weeks instead of the sentence to the reform school throughout their childhood.Also enacted was an order that every sentence, to the reform school would be until the age of 18; previously it was 21. At the time, it was thought that the reform process should take upwards to 4 years to thoroughly educate the boys in character, schooling, industry, and labor. Additionally the power to commit inmates was restricted to judges of the Superior and probate courts, and all boys should have legal <b>representation</b> <b>in</b> <b>court</b> provided by the state. It was thought that by limiting the number of judges able to commit boys to the state reform school the number of boys committed for minor offenses would be reduced.|$|E
