25|$|Eriksson's {{father was}} an innkeeper with the surname Lambert, but in 1797, her mother married E. Eriksson, a servant in the royal household, who later became a pad-maker, and Charlotta took her stepfather's name. She was {{accepted}} {{as a student at}} Dramatens elevskola in 1805, and was contracted as an actress in the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre</b> in Stockholm in 1812, at the same year as the other female star of her generation, Sara Torsslow. That same year, she married the choirmaster Johan Fredrik Wikström. In the first years of her career, she was considered pretty and nothing more; she had her breakthrough in 1820, when she played Ophelia instead of Carolina Kuhlman and was highly admired for her realistic interpretation of insanity.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre,</b> Eriksson had {{to replace}} Sara Torsslow in the roles given to her. This harmed {{her career as}} her style of acting was not suited to the {{emotional}} parts previously given to Torsslow, and exposed her to criticism. Therefore, these parts were {{taken over by the}} new actor Emilie Högquist, who became the new star within Torsslow's former repertoire. Eriksson could now return to her own repertoire, and her career became more successful; her new contract allowed her to play only the parts she herself chose to play and thought suitable, and she worked only freelance - a status she took advantage of to play in many other scenes. She toured the country with Wallinska sällskapet and played at the theatres of Djurgårdsteatern and in Dramatiska Teatern, the theatre of the Torsslow couple.|$|E

500|$|The Paris stage—at {{that time}} in dynamic {{conflict}} between traditional and experimental production styles—was inspirational for Bosse and convinced her that the low-key realistic acting style {{in which she was}} training herself was the right choice. Returning to Scandinavia, she was hesitant as to whether she should carve out a career in Stockholm, with its greater opportunities, or in Kristiania, to which she had closer emotional ties. In spite of the disadvantage of speaking Swedish with a Norwegian accent, Bosse let herself be persuaded by her opera-singer sister Dagmar to try her luck in Stockholm. [...] She applied for a place at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre</b> ("Dramaten"), the main drama venue of Stockholm, governed by the conservative tastes of King Oscar II and his personal advisors. After working hard at elocution lessons to improve her Swedish, which was Dramaten's condition for employing her, Bosse was eventually to become famous on the Swedish stage for her beautiful speaking voice and precise articulation. [...] Having trained her Swedish to a high level, she was engaged by Dramaten in 1899, where the sensation of the day was the innovative play Gustaf Vasa by August Strindberg.|$|E

After her graduation from drama school she worked at the Swedish Theatre, where she had her big star breakthrough in Sweden as Ophelia in Hamlet, opposite Schanke in the title role, in 1924.

50|$|Born {{and raised}} in Gothenburg, Sweden's second largest town, Gunn Wållgren {{played a lot of}} amateur theatre in local groups in her teenage years. She knew very early that she wanted to become an actress {{although}} her father; the stern company manager Harald Wållgren, strongly disapproved: To get the theatre ideas out of her head, he even sent her overseas on a trip to Switzerland. However, the acting dreams only increased as she strolled by the coast of Lake Constance and had only gotten worse by the time she returned. Carrying a tremendous personal shyness and insecurity (which came to define and restrict her private persona all her life) she secretly applied for the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre's</b> acting school in Stockholm (in 1934) - and was admitted on first try, at age 21.|$|R
50|$|She retired officially from {{stage in}} 1938, due to having {{developed}} {{a case of}} severe stage fright, {{and turned back to}} filming. She appeared in several notable supporting parts in Swedish films in the 1930s-1950s, for example in Ingmar Bergman's early 1948 film Music in Darkness, in the thriller Ett brott (A Crime) (1940) and in Kejsarn av Portugallien (The Emperor of Portugallia) (1944), based on the novel by Selma Lagerlöf, and in a pair of films by Hasse Ekman such as Kungliga patrasket (The Royal Rabble) (1945) and Flickan från tredje raden (The Girl from the Third Row) (1949). Borgström was also a teacher in the performing arts at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre's</b> acting school; Dramatens elevskola, in the 1930s-1940s.

5000|$|While {{living in}} Paris Westergren {{received}} a call from Swedish director Göran Gentele, who offered her a role in his 1951 comedy film Leva på 'Hoppet'. She accepted the offer to appear in the film, which also starred a number of other relatively unknown persons at the time, including Ingrid Thulin, Per Oscarsson, Gunvor Pontén, and Jarl Kulle. Westergren returned to Sweden to shoot Leva på 'Hoppet, which became her acting debut. The film sparked her interest in acting, and when she decided to study again she sent in applications to both the fashion university college Beckmans designhögskola and the acting school Dramatens elevskola (English: The <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre's</b> acting school). The auditions for Dramatens elevskola were held earlier than those for Beckmans designhögskola, and Westergren was admitted to the school after only one audition.|$|R
2500|$|Lind's mother ran a {{day school}} for girls {{out of her}} home. [...] When Lind was about nine years old, her singing was overheard by the maid of Mademoiselle Lundberg, the {{principal}} dancer at the Royal Swedish Opera. The maid, astounded by Lind's extraordinary voice, returned {{the next day with}} Lundberg, who arranged an audition and helped her gain admission to the acting school of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre,</b> where she studied with Karl Magnus Craelius, the singing master at the theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Long Day's Journey into Night {{was first}} {{performed}} by the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre</b> in Stockholm, Sweden. During O'Neill's lifetime, the Swedish people had embraced his work to a far greater extent than had any other nation, including his own. Thus, the play had its world premiere in Stockholm on February 2, 1956, in Swedish (as Lång dags färd mot natt), in a production directed by Bengt Ekerot, with the cast of Lars Hanson (James Tyrone), Inga Tidblad (Mary Tyrone), Ulf Palme (James Tyrone, Jr.), Jarl Kulle (Edmund Tyrone) and Catrin Westerlund (Cathleen, the serving-maid or [...] "second girl" [...] as O'Neill's script dubs her). The premiere and production were very successful, and the directing and acting critically acclaimed.|$|E
2500|$|The public, it seems, {{could not}} get enough of her, judging by the critics; they {{appeared}} to be in awe of her beauty, admiring of her graceful movement, which was described as relaxed, soft and elegant, and of the sensitive, delicate way she interpreted the parts she was given. In the press, Sara Fredrica Strömstedt-Torsslow, Charlotta Eriksson and Elisabeth Frösslind were compared to a rose or a tulip, a jasmine or a daisy, and a lily or a myosotis; Torsslow was claimed to represent [...] "the deeply moving", Eriksson [...] "the sensitive pleasantness and the female lovability" [...] and Frösslind [...] "the small sweetness, wittiness and naivety". The paper Freja said that she was: [...] "far superior to all the other actresses" [...] at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Lind {{was born}} in 1820 and {{enrolled}} at the Swedish <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre's</b> acting school at age ten. In 1838, she gained fame for her performance at the Royal Swedish Opera as Agathe in Der Freischütz. After this, she was in great demand throughout Sweden {{and the rest of}} Europe for a decade. [...] By 1849, when Lind {{was in the middle of}} her third triumphant London season, the American showman P. T. Barnum had become aware of her success and the large audiences she attracted. He had toured Europe in 1845 and 1846 with his first great attraction, General Tom Thumb. He had never heard Lind sing, and was by his own admission unmusical, but he knew that concert halls sold out wherever she performed. Furthermore, he was confident that her reputation for philanthropy could be turned to good use in his publicity. In October 1849, he engaged an Englishman, John Wilton, to locate Lind and make her an offer.|$|R
5000|$|Ragnar {{was born}} in Kalmar, Sweden and {{is the son of}} {{district}} manager Hans Ragnar and the postal clerk Karin, née Pettersson. Ragnar trained at Dramatens elevskola (The <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre's</b> acting school) in 1962-65. The following year he got a job as director's assistant to Ingmar Bergman (on his stage production of Peter Weiss' play The Investigation), where Ragnar states he learned a lot on the art of acting and directing from [...] "the master", just by watching and listening when Bergman worked with his actors and the script. In 1968 Per Ragnar had his breakthrough as an actor, earning much critical acclaim and audience praise for his performances in the Arnold Wesker [...] "trilogy" [...] staged that year in Sweden: Hönssoppa med korngryn (Chicken Soup with Barley), Rötter (Roots) and Jag talar om Jerusalem (I'm talking about Jerusalem). The same year he also made his film-breakthrough with Korridoren (The Corridor), Jan Haldoff's social commenting film on hospitals and the health care system in Sweden, where Ragnar plays a young doctor, new on the job, facing the dilemmas of prioritizing patients.|$|R
50|$|Björnstrand {{was born}} Knut Gunnar Johanson in Stockholm as son of actor Oscar Johanson and Ella Mauléon. After his {{education}} at the <b>Royal</b> <b>Dramatic</b> <b>Theatre's</b> acting school, he made several appearances in theatre, film and radio. Björnstrand's first collaboration with Ingmar Bergman was the 1941 theatre production of August Strindberg's The Ghost Sonata. His first major film role was in Hampe Faustman's Natt i hamn in 1943. After signing a contract with Svensk Filmindustri, he was offered mainly parts in comedies, including Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night (1955). In 1957, however, he appeared in two dramatic roles for Bergman, in The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries. He regularly starred in other films by Bergman until 1968, when his work for the director became infrequent. He also played major roles at the Stockholm Stadsteater and in private theaters. In later years, due to {{the consequences of a}} stroke, Björnstrand avoided long-term contracts, and focused on theatre and television work. His last film was Bergman's Fanny and Alexander (1982): since he was suffering from memory loss at the time, the production was a difficult one for him. Björnstrand died in Stockholm in 1986.|$|R
