Three, five, and eight vertically aligned primary <b>recirculations</b> were found for the three cases, respectively, which showed decreasing strength with decreasing height.

Local maxima of turbulence intensities were found at the interfaces between the primary <b>recirculations</b> and the shear layer. The pollutant trajectory followed the primary <b>recirculations.</b> High pollutant concentration and variance were found near the buildings where wind flowed upward. Large gradients of pollutant concentration and variance were also observed at the interfaces between the primary <b>recirculations</b> and the shear layer. Detailed analyses of concentration budget showed that the advection terms were responsible for pollutant redistribution within primary <b>recirculations,</b> while the turbulent transport terms were responsible for pollutant penetration between primary <b>recirculations</b> as well as pollutant removal from the street canyon. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} {{process of}} atherosclerosis {{leads to the}} formation of an atheroma plaque in the blood vessel. The interaction between the blood and the plaque may have dangerous consequences such as the rupture of the plaque. This rupture exposes tissue factors to the blood flow, leading {{to the formation of}} a clot that might result in a heart attack or an ischemic stroke. The blood-plaque interaction may also produce <b>recirculations</b> downstream of the plaque, and these <b>recirculations</b> enhance the risk of clot formation. In this paper we study the blood-plaque interaction using a fluid-structure interaction model. The atheroma plaque is composed of a lipid pool and a fibrous cap and both are modeled as hyperelastic materials. The blood {{is supposed to be a}} non-Newtonian fluid with a variable viscosity modeled by the Carreau law. The parameters used in our simulations are taken from experimental data. We investigate the non-Newtonian effects on the <b>recirculations</b> downstream of the atheroma plaque and on the stress over the plaque. The simulations show that the Newtonian model significantly overestimates the <b>recirculations</b> in comparison with the non-Newtonian model. They also show that the Newtonian model slightly underestimates the stress over the plaque for usual shear rates, but that this underestimation can become significant for low shear rates.

40|$|Abstract — Recently, {{there has}} been a lot of {{attention}} on the constructions of optical queues by using optical Switches and fiber Delay Lines (SDL). In this paper, we consider the constructions of optical queues with a limited number of <b>recirculations</b> through the fibers in such SDL constructions. Such a limitation on the number of <b>recirculations</b> comes from practical feasibility considerations, such as crosstalk, power loss, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) from the Erbium doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA), and the pattern effect of the optical switches. We first transform the design of the fiber delays in such SDL constructions to an equivalent integer representation problem. Specifically, given 1 ≤ k ≤ M, we seek for an M-sequence d M 1 = (d 1, d 2, [...] ., dM) of positive integers to maximize the number of consecutive integers (starting from 0) that can be represented by the C-transform relative to d M 1 such that there are at most k 1 -entries in their C-transforms. Then we give a class of greedy constructions so that d 1, d 2, [...] ., dM are obtained recursively and the maximum number of representable consecutive integers by using d 1, d 2, [...] ., di is larger than that by using d 1, d 2, [...] ., di− 1 for all i. Furthermore, we obtain an explicit recursive expression for d 1, d 2, [...] ., dM given by a greedy construction. Finally, we show that an optimal M-sequence (in the sense of achieving the maximum number of representable consecutive integers) can be given by a greedy construction. The solution of such an integer representation problem can be applied to the construction of optical 2 -to- 1 FIFO multiplexers with a limited number of <b>recirculations.</b> We show that the complexity of searching for an optimal construction can be greatly reduced from exponential time to polynomial time by only considering the greedy constructions instead of performing an exhaustive search. Similar results can be obtained for linear compressors and linear decompressors with a limited number of <b>recirculations.</b> I...|$|R

Furthermore, some ramjet combustors are dump combustors rather than a more conventional type. Dump combustors inject fuel and rely on <b>recirculation</b> generated by a large change in area in the combustor (rather than swirlers in many gas turbine combustors).

Five years of 4 -day kinematic back trajectories, computed with the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model version 4 (HYSPLIT), were clustered and classified in groups of similar length and curvature. To better describe the tropospheric circulations at BCN, backward trajectories arriving at 5500, 3000, and 1500 m above sea level were analyzed.

40|$|Street-level urban air {{pollution}} is a challenging concern for modern urban societies. Pollution dispersion models {{assume that the}} concentrations decrease monotonically with raising wind speed. This convenient assumption breaks down when applied to flows with local <b>recirculations</b> such as those found in topographically complex coastal areas. This study looks at a practically important and sufficiently common case of {{air pollution}} in a coastal valley city. Here, the observed concentrations {{are determined by the}} interaction between large-scale topographically forced and local-scale breeze-like <b>recirculations.</b> Analysis of a long observational dataset in Bergen, Norway, revealed that the most extreme cases of recurring wintertime air pollution episodes were accompanied by increased large-scale wind speeds above the valley. Contrary to the theoretical assumption and intuitive expectations, the maximum NO 2 concentrations were not found for the lowest 10  m ERA-Interim wind speeds but in situations with wind speeds of 3  m s − 1. To explain this phenomenon, we investigated empirical relationships between the large-scale forcing and the local wind and air quality parameters. We conducted 16  large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments with the Parallelised Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM) for atmospheric and oceanic flows. The LES accounted for the realistic relief and coastal configuration {{as well as for the}} large-scale forcing and local surface condition heterogeneity in Bergen. They revealed that emerging local breeze-like circulations strongly enhance the urban ventilation and dispersion of the air pollutants in situations with weak large-scale winds. Slightly stronger large-scale winds, however, can counteract these local <b>recirculations,</b> leading to enhanced surface air stagnation. Furthermore, this study looks at the concrete impact of the relative configuration of warmer water bodies in the city and the major transport corridor. We found that a relatively small local water body acted as a barrier for the horizontal transport of air pollutants from the largest street in the valley and along the valley bottom, transporting them vertically instead and hence diluting them. We found that the stable stratification accumulates the street-level pollution from the transport corridor in shallow air pockets near the surface. The polluted air pockets are transported by the local <b>recirculations</b> to other less polluted areas with only slow dilution. This combination of relatively long distance and complex transport paths together with weak dispersion is not sufficiently resolved in classical air pollution models. The findings have important implications for the air quality predictions over urban areas. Any prediction not resolving these, or similar local dynamic features, might not be able to correctly simulate the dispersion of pollutants in cities...|$|R
25|$|From a {{study in}} 1991, the tritium profile {{was used as a}} tool for {{studying}} the mixing and spreading of newly formed North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), corresponding to tritium increases to 4TU. This NADW tends to spill over sills that divide the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic Ocean and then flows to the west and equatorward in deep boundary currents. This process was explained via the large-scale tritium distribution in the deep North Atlantic between 1981 and 1983. The sub-polar gyre tends to be freshened (ventilated) by the NADW and {{is directly related to the}} high tritium values (>1.5TU). Also evident was the decrease in tritium in the deep western boundary current by a factor of 10 from the Labrador Sea to the Tropics, which is indicative of loss to ocean interior due to turbulent mixing and <b>recirculation.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} {{the effect of}} biodiesel on a D.P.F. {{it was found that}} though the presence of sodium and potassium carbonates aided in the catalytic conversion of ash, as the diesel particulates are catalyzed, they may congregate inside the D.P.F. and so interfere with the clearances of the filter. This may cause the filter to clog and interfere with the regeneration process. In a study on the impact of E.G.R. rates with blends of jathropa biodiesel it was shown that there was a decrease in fuel efficiency and torque output due to the use of biodiesel on a diesel engine designed with an E.G.R. system. It was found that CO and CO2 emissions increased with an increase in exhaust gas <b>recirculation</b> but NOx levels decreased. The opacity level of the jathropa blends was in an acceptable range, where traditional diesel was out of acceptable standards. It was shown that a decrease in Nox emissions could be obtained with an E.G.R. system. This study showed an advantage over traditional diesel within a certain operating range of the E.G.R. system.|$|E
25|$|While in the {{stratosphere}} (post-test period), the tritium interacted with and oxidized to water molecules and was present {{in much of the}} rapidly produced rainfall, making tritium a prognostic tool for studying the evolution and structure of the hydrologic cycle as well as the ventilation and formation of water masses in the North Atlantic Ocean. Bomb-tritium data were used from the Transient Tracers in the Ocean (TTO) program in order to quantify the replenishment and overturning rates for deep water located in the North Atlantic. Bomb-tritium also enters the deep ocean around the Antarctic. Most of the bomb tritiated water (HTO) throughout the atmosphere can enter the ocean through the following processes: a) precipitation, b) vapor exchange, and c) river runoff – these processes make HTO a great tracer for time-scales up to a few decades. Using the data from these processes for 1981, the 1TU isosurface lies between 500 and 1,000meters deep in the subtropical regions and then extends to 1,500–2,000meters south of the Gulf Stream due to <b>recirculation</b> and ventilation in the upper portion of the Atlantic Ocean.

25|$|Current {{research}} for the EGC is focused on freshwater fluxes. Because the EGC runs through the Greenland Sea and eventually through the Labrador Sea (as the West Greenland Current) it can have strong implications for the strengthening and or weakening of deep water formations in the Greenland and Labrador Seas. The Meridional Overturning Circulation is a density driven circulation in which a small perturbation in the density field could easily slow down or speed up the deep water formation in the Nordic Seas. Jones et al. note {{that there are three}} different freshwater sources for the EGC: Pacific water, river runoff, and sea-ice meltwater. They find that the biggest contributor to the freshening of the EGC is due to river runoff, followed by Pacific water, and a distant last is sea-ice meltwater (nearly negligible). They find that even though these sources freshen the EGC, these specific sources do not penetrate very well into the central Greenland Sea where the deep convection takes place. They then decide that there must be some other freshwater influence in the central Greenland Sea. They believe it may be from solid sea ice being transported to the central Greenland Sea and then melting. Solid sea ice is very mobile, and winds can easily direct its flow along with ocean currents. Previous thoughts were that the <b>recirculation</b> of the EGC in the Greenland Sea via the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone helps lead to a freshening of the central Greenland Sea, however, Rudels et al. disproved this theory and said it must be due to solid sea ice melt and precipitation in the central Greenland Sea.|$|E
25|$|Although the 200Tdi engine {{had been}} an undoubted {{technological}} and sales success, it had certain limitations and flaws {{that needed to be}} rectified. Despite the numerous differences, it was still in essence a direct-injection version of the older Diesel Turbo engine. It was also considered rather raucous and unrefined, especially for use in the Discovery and Range Rover models. A special version of the engine had to be produced to fit the Defender, and problems with weak head gasket had been identified. The British Army (and some other military buyers) had not opted for the 200Tdi because it could not be fitted with a 24-volt generator for powering radio equipment- instead the Army continued to buy vehicles with 2.5-litre naturally aspirated diesels. Upcoming European diesel emissions regulations (Euro I) meant that Land Rover would be forced to radically alter the engine anyway. The resulting development project (coded Romulus) produced the 300Tdi engine. Although externally very similar to the Discovery/Range Rover version of its predecessor, 208 changes were made. These included modifications to the block, cylinder head, fuel injector system and ancillary systems. The crankshaft, pistons and connecting rods were significantly altered over the 200Tdi. The most obvious external changes were the fitting of a rubber acoustic cover over the engine to reduce noise and the change to a single serpentine belt to drive the ancillaries instead of the multiple V-belts of the older engines. Emissions regulation included the fitting of an exhaust gas <b>recirculation</b> system. Power and torque outputs remained the same, and the engine had been specifically designed to be compatible with all the models in the Land Rover range without any changes. This meant that the Defender engines were fitted in the same tune as the Discovery/Range Rover engines. The 300Tdi was noticeably smoother and quieter than the 200Tdi, but was generally found to not be quite as economical in real-world use. It turned out that the Euro I emissions regulations were not as severe as Land Rover anticipated, and so the 300Tdi was able to remain in production until the introduction of the Euro III rules. When fitted to vehicles with an automatic transmission, power was increased to 122 horsepower {{to make up for the}} power losses in the transmission. These engines (designated 23L) had Bosch Electronic Diesel Control systems, where the mechanical injector system was controlled by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle to reduce emissions. The 300Tdi was replaced in 1998 by the 5-cylinder Td5, bringing to an end the line of Land Rover 4-cylinder engines that can be traced back to 1957. The Td5 engine was loosely based on the Rover Group's L-series diesel engine. The 300Tdi remained in production in Brazil, and was offered as an option on rest of world (non-UK/Europe) models. Following Ford's acquisition of Land Rover in 2000, the engine was used in Brazilian-built Ford pick-up trucks as well. Increasing emissions laws worldwide and falling sales led to production of the 300Tdi ending in 2006. A much-modified 2.8-litre version was built by International Engines in Brazil until 2010, and was available as an after-market fitment to Land Rovers through specialist converters. International then became MWM International Motores and a further update of the 300Tdi design was launched as the 3.0 Power Stroke. Although based around the same block and basic architecture as the 300Tdi the Power Stroke has major differences such as electronic common rail injection and new crossflow cylinder head with Overhead camshaft.|$|E
