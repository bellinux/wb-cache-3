25|$|During flight day 9 Danny Olivas and Christer Fuglesang {{performed}} EVA 3. The pair completed all {{tasks that}} were to be done, including installing two GPS antennas and deploying the Starboard 3 (S3) Payload Attach System (PAS), a new <b>Rate</b> <b>Gyro</b> Assembly (RGA) 2 and routing of Node 3 Avionics cables. The joint crew also completed more transfer, mostly transfer for return to earth in the MPLM and space shuttle mid-deck. The ISS crew also replaced a bolt on the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) so that the MPLM won't get stuck, and also to ensure correct capture of the HTV.|$|E
25|$|Flight day 5 saw the {{completion}} of the first spacewalk by Rick Mastracchio and Clayton Anderson. The pair released the new ammonia tank assembly for transfer to station for installation on a later spacewalk. They also removed an experiment from outside on the Kibo Exposed Facility, replaced a <b>Rate</b> <b>Gyro</b> Assembly (RGA) and performed several get-ahead tasks. The spacewalking pair was assisted by the SSRMS which was operated by pilot Jim Dutton and mission specialist Stephanie Wilson. While the spacewalk was going on, Naoko Yamazaki was assisted by commander Alan Poindexter, and the Expedition 23 crew to move several of the large science racks from the MPLM Leonardo to their new location on the ISS.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 4 Stephanie Wilson and Naoko Yamazaki grappled and berthed the Multi-purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo. The MPLM was berthed to {{the station}} at 04:24 UTC (00:24 EDT). The hatches were opened by station flight {{engineer}} Soichi Noguchi and shuttle mission specialist Clayton Anderson at 11:58 UTC (07:58 EDT). The joint STS-131/Expedition 23 crews began transferring cargo from the MPLM, with the first item being a <b>Rate</b> <b>Gyro</b> Assembly (RGA) which will be replaced on the first spacewalk of the mission. During flight day 4 commander Alan Poindexter did several in-flight interviews. Commander Poindexter was joined by mission specialists Rick Mastracchio and Stephanie Wilson. The interviews were with the Tom Joyner Radio Show, WVIT-TV and Fox News Radio. At {{the end of the}} day Mastracchio and Anderson entered the Quest airlock and begin breathing pure oxygen for an hour, while the atmospheric pressure inside the airlock was lowered to 10.2 psi. This procedure is known as the pre-breathe protocol and is done before every spacewalk, to purge nitrogen from the blood stream and prevent decompression sickness.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> over {{other types of}} gyros is the fast response rate and their relatively low cost.|$|R

50|$|<b>Rate</b> <b>gyros</b> {{are used}} in rate {{integrating}} gyroscopes, and in attitude control systems for vehicles, and {{in combination with other}} sensors to make inertial navigation systems.|$|R
50|$|A <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> {{is a type}} of gyroscope, which {{rather than}} {{indicating}} direction, indicates the rate of change of angle with time. If a gyro has only one gimbal ring, with consequently only one plane of freedom, it can be adapted for use as a <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> to measure a rate of angular movement.|$|E
50|$|The warhead section {{contained}} the W85 warhead, the <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> unit and the cables that {{passed from the}} G&C section to the RS.|$|E

50|$|The Agni {{family of}} {{missiles}} uses a strapdown INS system for flight control and navigation. Necessary inertial sensors were indigenously {{developed for the}} purpose, including laser <b>rate</b> <b>gyros.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{scheme for}} {{estimating}} the angular velocity of a spacecraft without <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> is presented. It {{is based upon}} a nonlinear estimator whose inputs are measured inertial vectors and their calculated time derivatives relative to vehicle axes. It works for all spacecraft attitudes and requires no knowledge of attitude. It can use measurements {{from a variety of}} onboard sensors like Sun sensors, star trackers, or magnetometers, and in concert. It can also use look angle measurements from onboard tracking antennas for tracking and data relay satellites or global positioning system satellites. In this paper, it is applied to a Sun point scheme on the Hubble Space Telescope assuming all or most of its onboard <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> have failed. Simulation results are presented for verification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of esti-mating the attitude of a rigid body equipped with a triad of <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> and a pan and tilt camera. The nonlinear attitude observer integrates angular velocity measurements from <b>rate</b> <b>gyros,</b> with images of a planar scene provided by the camera. By exploiting directly sensor information, i) a stabilizing feedback law is introduced and the exponential convergence to {{the origin of the}} estimation errors is shown; ii) an active vision system is proposed that relies on an image-based exponentially ISS control law for the camera pan and tilt angular rates to keep the features in the image plane. The discrete time implementation of the observer makes use of recent results in geometric numeric integration to preserve the rotation matrix properties. Simulated and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed solution. I...|$|R
50|$|A Rate {{integrating}} gyroscope is a <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> with a {{built in}} integrator. It {{is usually a}} component of an Inertial Measurement Unit or a stabilization system.|$|E
50|$|A small <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> is {{enclosed}} in a capsule that {{is attached to}} the fly rod. Rate gyros measure angular rotation. The signal from the <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> is transferred via cable to a small data collection box that is held or clipped to the caster or instructor. A Palm Pilot {{is attached to the}} box and data collected in transferred to the Palm via infrared beaming. The proprietary software installed on the Palm crunches the data, turning it into a casting signature that reveals many things about rod rotation.|$|E
50|$|The data {{updating}} algorithms (direction cosines or quaternions) {{involved are}} too complex to be accurately performed except by digital electronics. However, digital computers are now so inexpensive and fast that <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> systems {{can now be}} practically used and mass-produced. The Apollo lunar module used a strapdown system in its backup Abort Guidance System (AGS).|$|E

50|$|Lightweight digital {{computers}} {{permit the}} system to eliminate the gimbals, creating strapdown systems, so called because their sensors are simply strapped to the vehicle. This reduces the cost, eliminates gimbal lock, removes the need for some calibrations, and increases the reliability by eliminating some of the moving parts. Angular rate sensors called <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> measure the angular velocity of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Each SRB {{contained}} three <b>Rate</b> <b>gyro</b> assemblies (RGAs), {{with each}} RGA containing one pitch and one yaw gyro. These provided an output proportional to angular rates about the {{pitch and yaw}} axes to the orbiter computers and guidance, navigation and control system during first-stage ascent flight {{in conjunction with the}} orbiter roll rate gyros until SRB separation. At SRB separation, a switchover was made from the SRB RGAs to the orbiter RGAs.|$|E
50|$|Attitude {{control of}} the {{horizontal}} flying Agena was provided by an inertial reference package with three gyroscopes, two horizon sensors, and micro-jets using a nitrogen-freon mixture of cold gas. Pitch and roll were sensed by two hermetic integrating gyro units. A <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> unit determined yaw error by sensing orbital rate. Pitch and roll gyro errors were corrected from the horizon sensors, which were later supplemented by Sun and star trackers. This enabled the Agena to accommodate the higher pointing stability required for better ground resolution imaging with the improved Corona cameras.|$|E
50|$|Mariner 9 was mated to Atlas-Centaur AC-23 on May 9 with {{investigation}} into Mariner 8's failure ongoing. The malfunction was {{traced to a}} problem in the Centaur's pitch control servoamplifier and because it was not clear if the spacecraft itself had been responsible, RFI testing was conducted on Mariner 9 to ensure the probe was not releasing interference that could cause problems with the Centaur's electronics. All testing came back negative and on May 22, a tested and verified <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> package arrived from Convair and was installed in the Centaur.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This work {{proposes a}} {{cascaded}} architecture com-prising a nonlinear attitude observer and a nonlinear controller for position and attitude stabilization of a quadrotor. The attitude estimates are obtained from <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> measurements, corrupted by bias, and image coordinates from {{a set of}} landmarks on the terrain, obtained by a controllable pan and tilt camera. Lateral-longitudinal stabilization is achieved with a nested saturation control law by feedback of the image measurements, estimated body attitude, and corrected <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> measurements. The vehicle is stabilized vertically using an additional vertical position sensor. Due to the input-to-state stability property of controller, the quadrotor position and attitude are shown to converge to the desired equilibrium point and the convergence is robust to the estimation errors. Additionally, the pan and tilt camera is actively actuated to keep the landmarks visible in the image sensor for most operating conditions. The performance of the proposed ensemble is illustrated with some simulation results. I...|$|R
40|$|In future {{versions}} of Saab Gripen, the mechanical artificial horizon {{will be replaced}} by a computer calculated attitude and heading, independent of the inertial navigation system (INS). The system uses data from sensors already existing in the aircraft, which are easily available in a highly integrated, 4 th generation combat aircraft such as the Gripen. The sensor information used is a three-axis magnetic detector, true airspeed, angle of attack, barometric altitude, flight control <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> and load factor. The sensor data is fused together in an Extended Kalman filter (EKF). Each sensor by itself is of relatively poor quality. For instance, the accuracy of the <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> is in the order of degrees per second, rather than degrees per hour {{as is the case in}} gyros dedicated for navigation use. However, when all data are combined, they provide an attitude and heading estimate with sufficient quality for its purpose; to cross-monitor the INS, and to serve as a backup in case the INS fail [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that an applied force {{was necessary to}} perform in-flight identification of the mass and center of mass of a spacecraft. This paper shows that the mass and center of mass of a rigid spacecraft can be determined using only torque-producing actuators such as control-moment gyros or reaction wheels, and commonly available sensors, e. g., <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> and accelerometers. A space-station application is presented...|$|R

50|$|The Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE) is a space {{engineering}} research payload. It {{consists of a}} <b>rate</b> <b>gyro,</b> reaction wheels, a precision pointing payload, and a scanning and pointing payload that produces motion disturbances. The goal of the experiment was to test a closed loop control system that will compensate for motion disturbances. On orbit, Commander Stephen S. Oswald and Pilot William G. Gregory used MACE to test about 200 different motion disturbance situations over 45 hours of testing during the mission. Information from MACE {{will be used to}} design better control systems that compensate for motion in future spacecraft.|$|E
5000|$|The BILL 2 uses OTA or Overfly Top Attack {{to attack}} its target. The missile flies towards the target on a {{standard}} horizontal trajectory, but rather than directly hitting the target head on, it overflies it, detonating its warhead {{on top of an}} armored vehicle, where the armour is usually lighter. It also utilizes additional guidance accuracy via the installed <b>rate</b> <b>gyro,</b> which monitors the tracking movement of the launcher. It is designed primarily to attack armoured or unarmoured vehicles, but {{can also be used to}} attack helicopters or soft ground targets, such as light buildings.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{document}} the Zero-Gyro Sunpoint mode for Hubble Space Telescope, a safemode designed to ensure a power positive state without the use of <b>rate</b> <b>gyros.</b> This paper presents an overview of the Zero-Gyro Sunpoint algorithm, followed by details of the algorithm, control system design, and simulation results.

40|$|A fully {{instrumented}} hardware {{model of}} a flexible offset-feed antenna has been constructed for laboratory tests. Three <b>rate</b> <b>gyros,</b> four angular position laser sensors, {{and a set of}} ten distributed accelerometers are used to rconstruct the antenna state. Three control moment gyros are used to simultaneously orient the antenna, and to maintain a stable line of sight. A description is presented of the distributed antenna control system and experimental results...|$|R
25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS <b>rate</b> <b>gyros.</b> These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|R
50|$|A {{guidance}} system failure was quickly suspected as the culprit, but JPL navigation chief Bill O'Neil dismissed {{the idea that}} the entire {{guidance system}} had failed. He argued that an autopilot malfunction had occurred since the event had occurred at the exact moment when the system was supposed to activate. Investigation proceeded quickly and the problem was soon discovered {{to be the result of}} a malfunction in the pitch <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> amplifier. A diode intended to protect the system from transient voltages was thought to have been damaged during repairs/installation of the pitch amplifier's printed circuit board, something that would not have been detected through bench tests.|$|E
50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of using IMUs for navigation {{is that they}} typically suffer from accumulated error. Because the guidance system is continually integrating acceleration with respect to time to calculate velocity and position (see dead reckoning), any measurement errors, however small, are accumulated over time. This leads to 'drift': an ever-increasing difference between where the system thinks it is located and the actual location. Due to integration a constant error in acceleration results in a linear error in velocity and a quadratic error growth in position. A constant error in attitude <b>rate</b> (<b>gyro)</b> results in a quadratic error in velocity and a cubic error growth in position.|$|E
50|$|The fourth launch was K-26 on April 30, which {{carried a}} Milstar {{communications}} satellite. During the Centaur's flight, an uncontrolled roll motion developed, causing the upper stage and payload rotate at ever-increasing rate. This threw the stage off course {{so when it}} came time for restart, the Centaur cartwheeled out of control and left its payload in a useless orbit. This failure was found to be the result of an incorrectly programmed equation in the guidance computer. The error caused the roll <b>rate</b> <b>gyro</b> data to be ignored by the flight computer, resulting in open-loop firing of the roll control thrusters until the RCS fuel was depleted.|$|E
40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope has {{the most}} {{stringent}} pointing requirements imposed on any spacecraft to date. The overall HST stability shall not exceed 0. 007 arc-seconds rms. The Pointing Control System utilizes fine guidance sensors and <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> for attitude reference and rate information. Control torques are provided by reaction wheels. A digital computer collects the sensor data, performs the control law computations, and sends torque commands to the reaction wheels. To attain this precision pointing, improvements {{were made to the}} <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> to lower their noise characteristics and to the reaction wheels to reduce their emitted vibration levels. The control system design was validated in a test sequence which progressed from model verification tests on an air-bearing to operations-oriented, closed loop testing on the assembled vehicle. A test system is described which allowed the simultaneous production of test case command loads for the flight computer and plots of predicted profiles to assist in test data analysis. Workarounds were required during system test to accommodate gyro biases and noise introduced into the closed loop system. Testing and analysis indicate that the HST will provide the capability to meet the requirements for precision pointing...|$|R
40|$|Attitude {{determination}} and control systems (ADACS) {{are responsible for}} establishing desired satellite orientations. Proper satellite orientation is necessary for many science instruments and communication systems. Popular sensors include magnetometers, sun sensors, and <b>rate</b> <b>gyros,</b> and popular actuators include reaction wheels and magnetorquers. This paper investigates an ADACS design using these sensors and actuators that could feasibly be implemented on a CubeSat. The B-Dot law is used for satellite de-tumbling, and a linear inverse dynamics PD controller is utilized for steady state pointing, allowing for the analytical estimation of optimal controller gains. The inverse dynamics controller calculates desired satellite angular accelerations and then calculates the torques required to achieve these angular accelerations. This makes controller performance independent of initial conditions or system inertia properties. This system uses the magnetorquers to dump reaction wheel momentum and analyzes the satellite’s kinematic response to applied torques in order to calibrate the <b>rate</b> <b>gyros</b> and estimate system moments of inertia. Simulation results corresponded well to the analytical predictions. Often, an oscillating equilibrium would occur when controller gains were low, but this oscillation could be mitigated by selecting large controller gains such that the system was heavily overdamped and scaling down large commanded angular acceleration values to within system capabilities...|$|R
