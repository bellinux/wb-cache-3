The example provided here {{is based on the}} seminal work on abstract interpretation by Cousot and Cousot [3], who used it for static analysis of imperative programs. Cousot and Cousot discuss an abstraction function, ff, relating the concrete semantics to an approximate one that explicitly exhibits an underlying structure implicitly present in the <b>richer</b> <b>concrete</b> structure associated with program executions. (The work has since been extended to declarative languages, for example [1, 4].) Finite flowcharts are used to model the program semantics. The flowchart is represented by a directed graph, viz. a set Nodes, and a set Arcs, where Arcs is a subset of Nodes Θ Nodes. Each program point, or arc 2 Arcs, is associated with a possible set of environments, where an environment is a possible binding for each identifier of the program. In order to accommodate incomplete information, sets associated with program executions can be `lifted' by top and bottom elements ?; ? respectively. In particular the set of program identifiers is augmented by ? Id; ? Id to become semantic domain Id, where Id is a lattice with an imposed ordering : 8 id 2 Id ffl ? Id v id v ?

40|$|A goal of {{successful}} learning is {{the transfer of}} learned knowledge to novel situations. However, spontaneous transfer is notoriously difficult to achieve. In this research, we argue that learning and transfer can be facilitated when knowledge is expressed in an abstract, generic form. In Experiments 1 and 2, undergraduate students learned two isomorphic domains, which {{were based on the}} same algebraic group, with one domain expressed in a more abstract, generic form and the other expressed in a more concrete form. In both experiments, transfer from more abstract to more concrete was greater than the reverse. In Experiment 3, undergraduate students learned the same algebraic group under varying degrees of concreteness. Our results demonstrate that the use of perceptually <b>rich,</b> <b>concrete</b> symbols may hinder learning. This research indicates that concreteness may have substantial learning and transfer costs, whereas abstractness may have benefits.

40|$|Lisp {{has shown}} that a {{programmable}} syntax macro system acts {{as an adjunct to}} the compiler that gives the programmer important and powerful abstraction facilities not provided by the language. Unlike simple token substitution macros, such as are provided by CPP #the C preprocessor#, syntax macros operate on Abstract Syntax Trees #ASTs#. Programmable syntax macro systems have not yet been developed for syntactically rich languages such as C because <b>rich</b> <b>concrete</b> syntax requires the manual construction of syntactically valid program fragments, which is a tedious, di#cult, and error prone process. Also, using two languages, one for writing the program, and one for writing macros, is another source of complexity. This research solves these problems byhaving the macro language be a minimal extension of the programming language, byintroducing explicit code template operators into the macro language, and by using a type system to guarantee, at macro de#nition time, that all macros and macro functions only produce syntactically valid program fragments. The code template operators make the language context sensitive, which requires changes to the parser. The parser must perform type analysis in order to parse macro de#nitions, or to parse user code that invokes macros. ...|$|E

The authors test an adaptation to case-based learning that facilitates abstracting problem-solving schemas from {{examples and}} using them to solve further problems: analogical encoding, or learning by drawing a comparison across examples. In 3 studies, the authors examined schema abstrac-tion and transfer among novices learning negotiation strategies. Experiment 1 showed a benefit for analogical learning relative to no case study.

30|$|Evidence conferring a {{computational}} {{advantage for}} contextually <b>rich</b> <b>concrete</b> concepts (Xiao et al., 2012) adheres to the predictive coding (PC; e.g., Barsalou, 2013; Friston, 2005; Summerfield et al., 2006) account of conceptual retrieval. In essence, predictive coding describes a hierarchical {{process by which}} sensory signals sent from bottom-up perceptual systems in the brain converge with top-down signals, or models. Such models are derived from data collected over repeated exposure to a given concept or situation—insofar as models are unable to account for all situational variance, error signals are necessary for updating inaccurate predictions at each stage in the hierarchy. Thus, predictive coding is predicated {{on the notion that}} cortico-cortical circuits: 1) are arranged hierarchically and 2) are comprised of feedforward (ascending) and feedback (descending) connections between subcortical structures and cortex, 3) include both driving and modulatory connections, and 4) interact such that cortical neurons are able to model corporeal states and subsequently modulate sensorimotor neurons based on feedback loops producing error at each level in the hierarchy (Friston, 2003). Thus, correlating with incoming sensory data, cortical regions predict external conditions based on models derived from prior experience; this top-down model is compared with perceptual input and updated via modulatory interneurons at each layer in the hierarchy until the model closely matches the sensory data, thereby reducing error in the signal (Friston, 2012).|$|E

The book is {{largely based on}} an extensive research project called the Women’s Voices Project, which was conducted with 333 African American women across five U. S. cities. Jones and Shorter-Gooden give life to the phenomena they call “shifting ” through the many voices and experiences of the courageous women they interviewed. Throughout the 10 chapters, the authors weave research findings with quotes from identified participants, vividly demon-strating {{the ways in which}} racism and sexism uniquely affect the social, emo-tional, and spiritual lives of African American women. Chapter 1 refers to shifting as “a sort of subterfuge that African Americans have long practiced to ensure their survival in our society ” (p. 5). The authors use <b>rich,</b> <b>concrete</b> examples to demonstrate the ways Black women alter their true selves in many different contexts. These modifica-tions are often in response to major American stereotypes about Black women, including characterizations such as being unshakable, unfeminine, criminal, and promiscuous.

Chapter 1, like most of the chapters, ends with encouraging suggestions and examples of how African American women can transcend barriers.

40|$|The tectonic social upheavals of the 16 th {{through the}} 18 th centuries that {{produced}} the bourgeois state left Western society with {{a new set of}} social institutions, including the modem museum. With a raison d'etre simultaneously dependent on and at odds with the march of time, the modem museum enjoys a false air of permanence, for it is clearly an historically contingent institution and there is no guarantee as to its future. The Wunderkammer and the princely gallery-the modem museum's important predecessors-expose the institution's potential as a site for the expansion of knowledge that drives social change, as well as its potential as a site for the inculcation of traditional values and the status quo. The evolution of the educational functions of the modem museum traces the course of a complex and increasingly tense dialectic that highlights how much Western society has changed and how urgently its institutions need to renegotiate their relationship with "the public. " This thesis argues that broad societal shifts of the past half-century require the museum to abandon its established theoretical and operational models and to embrace a community-based vision that draws on the best new museological theory. Theoretical ballast for the argument is provided by Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Jurgen Habermas, and Michel Foucault, and also by Maxine Greene, Henry Giroux, and Paulo Friere in their elaboration of social theory within a specifically pedagogical context. All these theories suggest the museum acts as some form of mediating institution between the realm {{of the state and the}} realm of the individual or citizen. The thesis juxtaposes two cases of museum practice from the early 1990 s-the Royal Ontario Museum's disastrous Into the Heart of Africa exhibit, and the controversial deaccessioning of human skeletal remains from the Peterborough Centennial Museum and Archives. It analyzes the museological models and values behind each case, and suggests that the programming undertaken in the Peterborough case provides a <b>rich</b> <b>concrete</b> example of successful community-based museum with lessons that might be applied by much larger institutions despite their broader mandates, and their multiplex and far-flung audiences...|$|E

40|$|The work {{considers}} {{issues in}} {{the execution of the}} Z notation in a logic programming language. A subset of Z which is capable of being animated is identified, together with the necessary theoretical foundations for the relationship of Z to its executable form. The thesis also addresses the transition from research results to potentially useful tools. The thesis has 4 major parts: Tools Survey: A survey of tools which support the animation of Z is presented and the advantages (and disadvantages) to be gained from an animating system which uses a logic programming language are discussed. Requirements, particularly correctness, are described and discussed and weaknesses in the current tools are identified. Correctness - Program Synthesis: If a program can be deduced directly from the specification, then it is partially correct with respect to the specification. This method of obtaining a program from a specification is one form of logic programming synthesis. We examine such formal links between a specification (in Z) and an executable form and also some translation techniques for synthesising a logic program from a Z specification. The techniques are illustrated by examples which reveal important shortcomings. Translation Rules to Godel: New techniques for the animation of Z utilising the Godel logic programming language are presented which circumvent these shortcomings. The techniques are realised via translation rules known as structure simulation. Two substantial case studies are examined as proof of concept. These indicate both the coverage of the Z notation by structure simulation and the practicality of the rules. Correctness - Abstract Approximation: Published criteria for correctness of an animation are compared and contrasted with the method of Abstract Interpretation (AI). In AI a concrete semantics is related to an approximate one that explicitly exhibits an underlying structure present in the <b>richer</b> <b>concrete</b> structure. In our case, the concrete semantics is Z associated with ZF set theory. The approximate semantics of the execution are the outputs of Z. The criteria are applied to a logic programming language (the original w as applied to a functional language). Formal arguments are presented which show that the structure simulation rules obey the criteria for correctness.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{establish}} a structure result for the universal abelian variety over A 5. This {{implies that the}} boundary divisor of A 6 is unirational and leads to a lower bound on {{the slope of the}} cone of effective divisors on A 6. The general principally polarized abelian variety [A;] 2 Ag of dimension g 5 can be realized as a Prym variety. Abelian varieties of small dimension can be studied in this way via the <b>rich</b> and <b>concrete</b> theory of curves, in particular, one can establish that Ag is unirational in this range. In the case g = 5, the Prym map P: R 6 ! A 5 is finite of degree 27, see [DS]; three different proofs [Don], [MM], [Ve 1] of the unirationality ofR 6 are known. Themoduli spaceAg is of general type for g 7, see [Mu], [T]. Determining the Kodaira dimension of A 6 is a notorious open problem. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give a simple unirational parametrization of the uni-versal abelian variety over A 5 and hence of the boundary divisor of a compactification of A 6. We denote by ϕ: Xg 1 ! Ag 1 the universal abelian variety of dimension g 1. The moduli space eAg of principally polarized abelian varieties of dimension g and their rank 1 degenerations is a partial compactification of Ag obtained by blowing-up Ag 1 in the Satake compactification, cf.

As a result, the composition of repair masonry mortars is now being more frequently addressed in mortar research. Just recently, for example, it has become apparent that Portland cement mortars, extensively exploited as repair mortars over the past few decades, are not suitable for repair because of their chemical, physical, mechanical, and aesthetic incompatibilities with original materials. This paper focuses on the performance of various lime-based alternative materials intended for application in repairing historic structures when subjected to mechanical loading. Results of basic material tests indicate that the use of metakaolin as a pozzolanic additive produces mortars with superior strength and sufficiently low shrinkage. Moreover, mortar strength can be further enhanced by the addition of crushed brick fragments, which explains the longevity of Roman <b>concretes</b> <b>rich</b> in pozzolans and aggregates from crushed clay products such as tiles, pottery, or bricks.

40|$|My thesis {{focuses on}} Nietzsche’s ethics. More precisely, its main {{objective}} is to explore Nietzsche’s substantive ethical framework in a comprehensive, detailed, and systematic manner. Furthermore, the thesis also attempts to examine the epistemological, non-ethical ground of the Nietzschean substantive ethics. Also, it deals with Nietzsche’s critique of conventional morality, and explains Nietzsche’s criticism of morality {{in terms of his}} substantive ethics. The central argument of the thesis is, very briefly, that Nietzsche’s philosophy as a whole does have a distinctive, substantive ethical system. Its constitutive elements or contents, being coherently related, are <b>rich,</b> complicated, and <b>concrete.</b> The major category Nietzsche employs in his ethics is the notion of ‘value’ understood as merit or desirability; he is not much concerned with the right or obligatory. Nietzsche views some human qualities, abilities and states and a style of life as noble and desirable for us. Specifically, the creative way of life, creative capacity, self-discipline, the capacity for ‘self-commanding’, knowledge, health, strong affectivity, and vitality constitute the core of Nietzsche’s evaluative standard. Moreover, a variety of dispositions, such as honesty, solitude, courage, and magnanimity, position themselves within his theory of value and are posited as crucial virtues. Finally, my thesis aims at analysing these particular contents of Nietzsche’s substantive ethical system and to examine how the system as a whole works. As such, the thesis is fundamentally an exposition based upon Nietzsche’s own texts, especially, his later works including Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Beyond Good and Evil, The Genealogy of Morals, Twilight of the Idols, and The Antichrist.

Triangulation was used to collect the data needed for my research; methods used were both qualitative and quantitative to provide <b>richer</b> and more <b>concrete</b> data. A mix of interviews, participant observation, physical artefacts and company documents were used to enhance this study. All gathered information was collated and generated into a case study to provide readers with access to the narratives. The case study aimed to shed light on these key questions: To what extent does the theory of McDonaldization still hold resonance in its company of origin? To what extent has organisational change has facilitated a change in the degree of employee motivation at all levels of hierarchy? To what extent has the altering of McDonald’s organisational culture on paper had an impact in reality? This dissertation gives an insight into the internal workings of one restaurant and aims to assess it as part of the wider web of the organisation and the industry as a whole. The dissertation assesses the rate and effectiveness of organisational culture change and the affect, if any, on employee motivation and job satisfaction. This dissertation concludes with the notion that organisational culture change has not yet fully taken root and has had varying degrees of effect. Although these results are taken from the one store, the comments raised are indicative of the organisation as a whole. The reasons behind this apparent failure are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ordinary Portland cement {{concrete}} {{is a very}} popular construction material used in developed/underdeveloped countries. The basic ingredients of concrete are cement, fine and coarse aggregates bounded by water. Fine and coarse aggregates are generally inert materials which do not react with cement during hydration process rather act as filler material. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete is good for normal construction; however, for industrial construction OPC concrete may {{come in contact with}} different types of aggressive environment such as acid producing or acid based industries, fruit and vegetable processing industries, underground structures subjected to water logging and salinity which results in degradation of concrete. Corrosion of reinforcement for exposed portion of conrete structure is also very important especially in case of concrete highway bridges or other important heavy structures. <bSupplementary cementing materials (SCM&# 8217;s) are commonly used to improve strength and durability of concrete. The incorporation of these materials also reduces the cost of the concrete. The most commonly used SCM&# 8217;s are silica fume, fly ash, blast furnace slag, metakaolin, rice husk ash etc. These SCM&# 8217;s are finer than cement and hence improve the packing of the concrete mixture, resulting in increased compressive strength. The durability of concete containing SCM&# 8217;s is improved due to the chemical reaction of various compounds present in supplementary cementing material with cement during the hydration process. The increase in replacement level SCM&# 8217;s by weight with the cement also influencethe strength and durability properties of concrete. Kaolin clay, a source of metakaolin; has been frequently used in pottery industry and it is abundantly available in Pakistan; however, it has never been used as supplementary cementing material by local construction industry. This study was undertaken to assess the potential of locally produced metakaolin for using as pozzolan especially for durability of concrete against acid and carbonation The main objective of the research includes a) to develop reactive metakaolin from kaolin clay, c) to evolve Strength Degradation Model for metakaolin concrete against acid attackDuring the first phase of study, metakaolin was successfully developed from the Nagar Parkar kaolin. The kaolin was calcined at several temperatures ranging from 600 oC to 1000 oC for variable durations of 6 to 10 hours. The calcined clay in each case wafinely divided to specific surface of approximately 645 m 2 /kg. The powdered samples were subjected to X-ray Diffraction Tests (XRD) as well to Strength Activity Index Tests (SAI) for 7 and 28 days.

A set of solutions is suggested and examined globally concerning security improvements of nuclear energy supply. Aim is to prevent the release of fission products under any circumstance. Furthermore, it is essential to limit consequences to the plant itself in case of hypothetical incidents. Exemplified at the European Pressurized Water Reactor (EPR) the requirements of controlling core melt-accidents are pointed out and a solution for melt retention (core- catcher) is described. Process knowledge of postulated core melt accidents is enhanced by understanding the behaviour of structural materials in combination with a core melt. Therefore, suitable measures to ensure the integrity of reactor containment can be developed. Explicitly the requirements of protective and sacrificial materials are identified. The stability of various refractory materials all based on zirconia (ZrO 2) in contact with metallic phase of core melt has been investigated in large-scale experiments. These tests were characterised by high temperature metallic melts with melt temperature of about 2000 °C and melt masses of up to 6 mg. They proved that zirconia could fulfil the task of a protective material against the metallic melt impact. Erosion effects have not been detected. The early sintering of the zirconia ramming mass led to high surface stability which could effectively prevent infiltration of the metallic melt into the zirconia ramming mass. Anyhow, loose ramming mass was still found below the stable layer. This is advantageous with respect to the prevention of crack formation due to thermal loads. Experiments investigating the behaviour of zirconia protective materials against high-temperature metallic melts showed a good long-term stability for the investigated zirconia compounds. Furthermore the MCCI (Molten Corium Concrete Interaction) behaviour of various structural and sacrificial concretes was characterised in experiments with high-temperature metal melts. The experimental goals are related to investigations of interactions between concrete and core melt in two-dimensional geometries, particularly in terms of ratio of horizontal and vertical erosion. In three transient experiments (without after-heating of melt) with high-temperature-melts six different types of concretes were investigated. These six tests were carried out with melt masses by 1 mg each and temperatures of about 2. 000 °C. In all attempts the rate of melt progression in the wall increases super proportional in comparison to the erosion at the bottom. The sacrificial <b>concrete</b> <b>rich</b> in iron oxide showed the highest erosion. The sacrificial concretes with portland cement showed a higher erosion than the sacrificial concretes with alumina cement. Due to largest integral erosion, iron oxide-rich concrete appears as sacrificial concrete most qualified. The results can be used both for the enhancement and validation of appropriate computer models and beyond that to meet a selection of suitable accident controlling measures. On the one hand the represented results are usable for answering questions to existing plants, on the other hand likewise also for future plants...|$|R
