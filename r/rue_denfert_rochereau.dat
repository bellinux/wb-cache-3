In connection with the settlement of his parents' estate, as well as to enable his wife to get to know his relatives (and vice versa), the Cooks drove across the U.S., from east to west and back again, during a period of about five months in 1925, staying for one month in his Iowa hometown. Returning to Europe, they decided to permanently settle in France. The sculptor Jacques Lipchitz introduced them to architect Le Corbusier, then largely unknown, who, during this time, was designing a series of villas, including innovative homes for Michael Stein (Gertrude's brother) and Lipchitz himself. In 1926, they commissioned the architect to design what Le Corbusier said was the first [...] "true cubic house," [...] called Villa Cook or Maison Cook, on the outskirts of Paris, at 6 <b>rue</b> <b>Denfert</b> <b>Rochereau</b> in Boulogne-sur-Seine.|$|E

It ran from a Paris terminal near the present-day metro station of <b>Denfert</b> <b>Rochereau</b> through Bourg-la-Reine - where a branch to Robinson via Sceaux (actually the original main line of 1846) originates - Massy Palaiseau (present-day TGV connection), and Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse to Limours. Plans to extend it to Chartres never bore fruit, as competing lines made the project superfluous.|$|R

In 1895, Alice married the British Army officer Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend who led his command to its {{destruction}} at Kut al Amara in 1916. Elisabeth had a tragic destiny. After divorcing from her first husband, the diplomat and count Jean de Forceville, she married with Alfred Émile <b>Denfert</b> <b>Rochereau,</b> and got divorced from him too. In 1987, during an exhibition of São Paulo Museum of Art collection in the Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Martigny, Switzerland, Elisabeth's nephew, Jean de Monbrison, {{wrote a letter to}} the museum reporting her sad end: she was converted to Catholicism at a young age, but even so she was sent to Auschwitz due to her Jewish descent, and died on the way to concentration camp, in March 1944, aged 69.|$|R
5000|$|... 1947-1951: Developing {{geometric}} abstract art (optical art): Finally, Vasarely {{found his}} own style. The overlapping developments are named after their geographical heritage. Denfert {{refers to the}} works influenced by the white tiled walls of the Paris <b>Denfert</b> - <b>Rochereau</b> metro station. Ellipsoid pebbles and shells found during a vacation in 1947 at the Breton coast at Belle Île inspired him to the Belles-Isles works. Since 1948, Vasarely usually spent his summer months in Gordes in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur. There, the cubic houses {{led him to the}} composition of the group of works labelled Gordes/Cristal. He worked on the problem of empty and filled spaces on a flat surface as well as the stereoscopic view.|$|R
