5|$|Some {{media outlets}} tied {{the fact that}} the <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>star</b> Betelgeuse would undergo a {{supernova}} {{at some point in the}} future to the 2012 phenomenon. However, while Betelgeuse was certainly in the final stages of its life, and would die as a supernova, there was no way to predict the timing of the event to within 100,000 years. To be a threat to Earth, a supernova would need to be no further than 25 light years from the Solar System. Betelgeuse is roughly 600 light years away, and so its supernova would not affect Earth. In December 2011, NASA's Francis Reddy issued a press release debunking the possibility of a supernova occurring in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Antares (Alpha Scorpii) is a <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>star</b> in {{a binary}} {{system with a}} hotter blue main-sequence star Antares B. Antares B can {{therefore}} be termed a hot companion of the cool supergiant.|$|E

5000|$|This group, {{along with}} the Double Cluster, was later named the Perseus OB1 Association. Based on its radial velocity, Bidelman also became first to see that S Persei {{is part of the}} Per OB1 association, which was later confirmed. Among the first stars that were studied at far-infrared wavelengths, M-type supergiants may be used to find the spiral arms of our galaxy. Bidelman found four <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars</b> in 1947, {{bringing}} the total then known to 13. How <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars</b> evolved was considered an [...] "astronomical puzzle", so the Double Cluster was used to test ideas about the evolution of <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars</b> during the 1960s. The M-type supergiants of h and χ Per became the prototypes of this class of stars, and the major source of data for their properties.|$|R

In 2006 a large cluster of new <b>stars</b> {{containing}} 14 <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars</b> was discovered there and named RSGC1. In 2007 a cluster of approximately 50,000 newly formed stars named RSGC2 was located {{only a few hundred}} light years from RSGC1. It is thought to be less than 20 million years old and contains 26 <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars,</b> the largest grouping of such stars known. Other clusters in this region include RSGC3 and Alicante 8.|$|R
50|$|Red <b>supergiants</b> are <b>stars</b> with a <b>supergiant</b> {{luminosity}} class (Yerkes class I) of spectral type K or M.

500|$|Two spectroscopic companions {{have been}} {{proposed}} to the <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>star.</b> Analysis of polarization data from 1968 through 1983 indicated a close companion with a periodic orbit of about 2.1 years. Using speckle interferometry, the team concluded that the closer of the two companions was located at [...] (~9 AU) from the main star with a position angle (PA) of 273 degrees, an orbit that would potentially place it within the star's chromosphere. The more distant companion was estimated at [...] (~77 AU) with a PA of 278 degrees. [...] Further studies have found no evidence for these companions or have actively refuted their existence, but {{the possibility of a}} close companion contributing to the overall flux has never been fully ruled out. [...] High resolution interferometry of Betelgeuse and its vicinity, far beyond the technology of the 1980s and 90s, have not detected any companions.|$|E

40|$|Detailed non-LTE {{calculations}} for <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars</b> {{are presented}} {{to investigate the}} influence of NLTE on the formation of atomic iron and titanium lines in the J-band. With their enormous brightness at J-band <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars</b> are ideal probes of cosmic abundances. Recent LTE {{studies have found that}} metallicities accurate to 0. 15 dex can be determined from medium resolution spectroscopy of individual <b>red</b> <b>supergiants</b> in galaxies as distant as 10 Mpc. The non-LTE results obtained in this investigation support these findings. Non-LTE abundance corrections for iron are smaller than 0. 05 dex for effective temperatures between 3400 K to 4200 K and 0. 1 dex at 4400 K. For titanium the non-LTE abundance corrections vary smoothly between - 0. 4 dex and + 0. 2 dex as a function of effective temperature. For both elements, the corrections also depend on stellar gravity and metallicity. The physical reasons behind the non-LTE corrections and the consequences for extragalactic J-band abundance studies are discussed. Comment: 37 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|We discuss four {{questions}} dealing with massive star evolution. The {{first one is}} {{about the origin of}} slowly rotating, non-evolved, nitrogen rich stars. We propose that these stars may originate from initially fast rotating stars whose surface has been braked down. The second question is about the evolutionary status of alpha-Cygni variables. According to their pulsation properties, these stars should be post <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars.</b> However, some stars at least present surface abundances indicating that they should be pre <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars.</b> How to reconcile these two contradictory requirements? The third one concerns the various supernova types which are the end point of the evolution of stars with initial masses between 18 and 30 Msun, i. e. the most massive stars which go through a <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> phase during their lifetime. Do they produce types IIP, IIL, IIn, IIb or Ib supernovae or do they end without producing any SN event?

The measured mean diameters and the spectral energy distributions were combined to determine effective temperatures. The results give further support to the recently derived hotter temperature scale of <b>red</b> <b>supergiant</b> <b>stars</b> by Levesque et al.
