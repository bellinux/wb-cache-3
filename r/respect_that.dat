5|$|According to the Court of Inquiry, 'the prime {{cause of}} this lamentable episode' was the {{responsibility}} of Colonel Martin. Described as a ‘’loner’’ for whom officers had little respect, Martin’s primary fault {{was that he was}} too trusting, to the point of naivety. While he cared for the welfare of his men and saw that their living conditions were improved, he was described as being too much of a ‘’solder’s friend’’, to the point that other British officers found that this attitude and work ethic of Martin’s severely undermined their authority over the sepoys. Over time, that served to erode the <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> the British officers and even the sepoys had for him.|$|E
5|$|As {{the last}} {{surviving}} {{member of the}} RNAS, and the last living {{founding member of the}} RAF, Allingham was an honoured guest when the British Air Services Memorial was unveiled at Saint-Omer on 11 September 2004. During the ceremony Allingham was given the Gold Medal of Saint-Omer, which marked the award of the Freedom of the Town. The group of RAF technical trainees that joined him at this ceremony continued to visit Allingham at his retirement home in Eastbourne, demonstrating the bond of <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> these men had for Allingham.|$|E

5|$|She has a {{very good}} voice. She's quite shy about it and won't admit it. Lots of people are {{knocking}} on my door to meet her about everything, movies, what-not. But she's not really interested in any of it. She just wants to go to school. She says to me, 'Mum, I just want to be a normal kid. I'm not ready for any of that.' I <b>respect</b> <b>that,</b> and if she ever wants to work with me on any level, I welcome it. But otherwise, I leave her to homework and school.|$|E
5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not doing what he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E

The hometown Bruins fans gave him a standing ovation after the game ended as well.|$|E
25|$|Wald's {{vision for}} Henry Street was one unlike any {{others at the}} time. Wald {{believed}} that every New York City resident was entitled to equal and fair health care regardless of their social status, socio-economic status, race, gender, or age.

A strong advocate for adequate bed-side manner, Wald believed that regardless of if a person could afford at-home-care, they deserved to be treated with the same level of <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> some who could afford it would be.|$|E

25|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{of the law and}} the <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary's independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference. The judiciary's role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.|$|E
25|$|Ravenna's newfound ascendance did {{not last}} under the successors of Theodoric as they lacked the <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> Theodoric {{commanded}} of both the Romans and Goths within his capital and the empire as a whole, in particular his grandson Athalaric who succeeded him {{at the age of}} eight under the regency of his mother Amalasuintha. The Gothic Kingdom eventually fell to the invasions by Belisarius as part of Justinian's ambitious plans of reconquering the territories of the western empire lost to Germanic invasions.|$|E
25|$|Thant died of {{lung cancer}} in New York on 25 November 1974. By that time, Burma was ruled by a {{military}} junta which refused him any honours. The then Burmese president Ne Win was envious of Thant's international stature and the <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> was accorded him by the Burmese populace. Ne Win also resented Thant's close links with the democratic government of U Nu which Ne Win had overthrown in a coup d'état on 2 March 1962. Ne Win ordered Thant be buried without any official involvement or ceremony.|$|E

25|$|Politicians court mafiosi {{to obtain}} votes during elections. A mafioso's mere {{endorsement}} {{of a certain}} candidate can be enough for their clients, relatives, and associates to vote for that candidate. A particularly influential mafioso can bring in thousands of votes for a candidate; such is the <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> a mafioso can command. The Italian Parliament has {{a huge number of}} seats (945, roughly 1 per 64,000 citizens) and a large number of political parties competing for them, meaning that a candidate can win with only a few thousand votes. A mafia clan's support can thus be decisive for their success.|$|E
25|$|Artisans and {{craftsmen}} — {{their class}} {{identified with the}} Chinese character meaning labor — were much like farmers in the <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> they produced essential goods needed by themselves {{and the rest of}} society. Although they could not provide the state with much of its revenues since they often had no land of their own to be taxed, artisans and craftsmen were still given a higher place than merchants. Since ancient times, the skilled work of artisans and craftsmen was handed down orally from father to son, although the work of architects and structural builders were sometimes codified, illustrated, and categorized in Chinese written works.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} threats to the long-term well being of human remains in museum collections is improper storage and packing. Proper storage of human remains is not only necessary for their physical preservation, but it also demonstrates the <b>respect</b> <b>that</b> sensitive materials such as these should be accorded. The ideal storage location for sacred artifacts and human remains is a designated space away {{from the rest of}} the collection; however, there are often many constraints which prevent this from being possible. At the minimum, ethical guidelines suggest that remains from different individuals should be stored in separate boxes or compartments from each other.|$|E
