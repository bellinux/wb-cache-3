30|$|Introduction: Formulations of cyclotron-produced 99 mTc contain trace {{amounts of}} other Tc {{isotopes}} {{depending on the}} isotopic composition of starting 100 Mo. Presence of other nuclides may affect image quality and patient dosimetry. Therefore, quantification of radioisotopic impurities is very important. Currently, radioisotopic purity of cyclotron-produced 99 mTc is measured using gamma-ray spectrometry and is time-consuming. We sought to identify another approach better suitable for quality control during <b>routine</b> <b>productions.</b>|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: With “shielding” method, lead {{canister}} attenuated low-energy gamma-emission (including from 99 mTc) {{and allowed}} detecting impurities present in trace amounts with better sensitivity. While “high-energy breakthrough” measured in ionization chamber {{does not give}} true radioactivity values for each contaminant, it offers sufficient information about relative amount of high-energy radioactive impurities in the product. This {{could serve as a}} surrogate test during <b>routine</b> <b>productions</b> when cross-calibrated with gamma-spectrometry data for given isotopic composition of 100 Mo targets.|$|R

40|$|Myer Myers (1723 [...] 1795) created {{outstanding}} {{works in}} {{silver and gold}} for leading members of the New York elites and was the most productive silversmith in the city during {{the third quarter of}} the eighteenth century. Many objects with his mark have long been regarded as among the most important American statements of the Rococo style, and he is perhaps best known as the maker of the only Jewish ritual silver to survive from Colonial America. These objects also provide an extraordinary amount of information about craft, patronage, and religious diversity in pre- and post-Revolutionary America. As a native American Jew, Myers was part of a small but close-knit community that provided him with patrons as well as mercantile contacts. His leadership role within the New York Jewish community mirrored and to some extent reinforced his prominence in his craft. Myers's career as a silversmith offers insights into the complexities of the often-romanticized and oversimplified subject of preindustrial craftsmanship in America. Surviving objects with his marks clearly were the product of a sizeable workshop that made both routine, less expensive forms as well as the unique, style-conscious wares for which Myers is renowned. While highlighting his outstanding works, this study also will situate them within his <b>routine</b> shop <b>production,</b> giving a more complete picture of his output. It will also highlight the interrelationships between different craftsmen in precious metals that traditionally have been interpreted as autonomous artists. Myers's finest works clearly demonstrate the importance of specialist craftsmen, such as engravers, chasers, and piercers. His <b>routine</b> <b>productions</b> apparently were marketed not only through his own establishment, but also through other silversmiths and jewelers who worked primarily as retailers.

30|$|In this article, the {{emphasis}} is put on one important parameter, the pH value {{that has to be}} taken into account, especially for complexations with radiometals. At a low pH, the coordinating moieties of the chelator can be protonated and therefore inactivated [1]. Focusing on gallium- 68, the pH must be in a range of 3.5 to 5.5 {{due to the fact that}} gallium starts to form insoluble colloids and hydroxides at a higher pH that are not available for complexation [2, 3]. Correspondingly, pH buffering systems are necessary for a successful product formation. Appropriate buffers for 68 Ga-labeling are supposed to be weak gallium-complexing agents that hinder hydrolysis to hydroxides and keep the metal in its active ionic state [4, 5]. Sodium acetate (NaOAc), sodium succinate, and 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl)- 1 -piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) were reported as the most favorable buffers for 68 Ga-labeling so far [6]. Nevertheless, the latter one was reported to result in better radiochemical yields for [68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC than the first ones at low precursor amounts [7]. Hence, HEPES should be the buffer of choice for clinical <b>routine</b> <b>productions</b> and especially scientific labeling approaches. However, the drawback of using HEPES is that the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) defines HEPES as an impurity that has to be below a specified limit [8].|$|R
