50|$|Joe Traeger {{developed}} the Traeger pellet grill in 1985 and patented it in 1986. The first Traeger Grills began production in 1988 and {{were introduced to}} a public that {{had never seen anything}} like them. Early Traeger Grills didn’t look all that different from traditional offset smokers with the exception of a side-mounted hopper where the firebox would typically be. However, the internal workings of the grill were unlike anything else on the market. For starters, Traeger Grills were electric and controlled by a simple three-position switch. Like the pellet stove, a <b>rotating</b> <b>auger</b> fed pellets from the hopper to the fire pot, where they were lit by an igniter rod. A fan then stoked the fire and distributed heat and smoke throughout the grill. A metal plate, called the deflector plate, sat between the fire and the grill grate, keeping food and grease from coming in contact with the flames and preventing flare-ups.|$|E
40|$|Soft {{alluvial}} soils present unfavourable {{conditions for}} engineering developments {{due to their}} poor bearing capacities and high potential for experiencing shrinkage and swelling. This paper focusses on deep dry soil mixing (DDSM), which introduces cementitious binders to soft soils via a <b>rotating</b> <b>auger</b> drill, thereby producing soil-cement columns. Ordinary Portland cement (CEM-I) is globally used across the construction industry and is {{the most commonly used}} binder for DDSM applications due to its high strength performance. However, CEM-I production is one of the world׳s most energy intensive and expensive industrial processes, contributing 5 – 7 % of the world׳s total CO 2. There is now significant pressure on the cement and construction industries to greatly reduce their CO 2 emissions by developing “greener” alternatives to CEM-I, which are both more environmentally and financially sustainable in the long-term. Alkali activated industrial by-products (IBP׳s) such as ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), known as geopolymers have been identified as potential alternatives. These are advantageous due to negating the need to transfer IBP׳s to landfill, their abundance, negligible or zero production costs. Geopolymers are capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 64 %. Calcium-bearing slags have also been found to possess potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS). Comparisons with the strength and durability of untreated and stabilised soils have been made in this study. Results indicate that stabilising an alluvial soil with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) activated GGBS produced significant strength and durability improvements surpassing CEM-I. The addition of NaOH allowed pozzolanic reactions to occur, leading to improved mechanical properties with time, with a particularly marked improvement in strength...|$|E
40|$|In February 2007, a 63 year-old male {{mechanic}} (the victim) sustained fatal injuries {{after being}} {{pulled into a}} snow thrower at a ski resort. The snow thrower was temporarily parked in the Snowmaking Department garage. The victim was working alone {{at the time of}} the incident and there was no witness. At approximately 8 : 15 pm, two co-workers went to the garage to look for the victim after receiving a phone call from the victim's wife who reported that he had not come home. When they arrived at the garage, they saw the victim's pick up truck parked outside the garage door, the garage door opened 12 inches, and the victim caught in the auger of the snow thrower. The engine of the snow thrower was stalled. It appeared that the victim had tried to move the snow thrower out of the garage. He started the engine, engaged the PTO, got off the tractor, and positioned himself between the garage door and the auger to open the door. The clearance between the door and the auger was 14. 5 inches. His flannel shirt was caught by the <b>rotating</b> <b>auger</b> and he was pulled into it. The victim did not receive any training on how to operate the snow thrower, nor was he authorized to operate or move the machine. The local emergency rescue squad responded and arrived on site within ten minutes. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. The Medical Examiner reported in the toxicology report that the victim's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was 0. 12 %. The legal limit of BAC for operating motor vehicles in New York State is 0. 08 %...|$|E
50|$|If the clog {{is caused}} by a dense, but shreddable obstacle, such as tree roots or glass wool, the auger might break it up enough to enable flow. A small, {{lightweight}} obstruction might be snagged or corkscrewed by the auger, enabling the operator to pull it away. As the <b>auger</b> <b>rotates,</b> it also flails against the interior walls of the pipe, scraping off minerals and oil.|$|R
40|$|The All-Terrain Hex-Legged Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) is a six-limbed robot {{designed}} to support surface explorations on Near Earth Objects, the Moon and Mars. ATHLETE can carry large payloads on its top deck and {{can carry a}} fully equipped pressurized habitat in low gravity. The robot has wheels on each of its six articulated limbs, allowing it to actively conform to terrain while driving and to walk when driving is impractical. With {{the use of a}} tool adapter, ATHLETE limbs can be equipped with end effectors to support various mission objectives. For work on Near Earth Objects and other microgravity environments, an anchoring mechanism is needed to keep the ATHLETE from floating off the surface. My goal for this spring session at JPL was to design and build a counter <b>rotating,</b> double <b>auger,</b> anchoring mechanism. The mechanism mates to the tool adapter and is driven off the wheel motor. The double auger anchoring mechanism will be tested in a regolith simulant that will determine the uplift capacity of the anchoring mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{initial stages}} of the {{oxidation}} of the beryllium (0001) surface were studied under ultra-high vacuum conditions using a <b>rotating</b> analyzer ellipsometer, <b>Auger</b> Electron Spectroscopy (AES) and Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED). The behavior of the ellipsometric parameters has been investigated for both single crystal (high temperature) and polycrystalline (low temperature) oxide growth. Changes in ψ and Ɗ are seen which may be indicative of structural transformations in the overlayer. At room temperature, an initial decrease followed by a rapid increase in ψ {{may be associated with}} the formation of regions of crystalline BeO. Changes in Ɗ are also seen when a polycrystalline BeO layer is annealed to form an epitaxial single crystal layer...|$|R
40|$|This machine cuts coal along a {{longwall}} face extending up to 500 feet by a <b>rotating</b> <b>auger</b> with bits. The machine also transports the coal that is cut acting as screw conveyor. By virtue of an integral shroud comprising {{part of the}} conveyor the machine is also amenable to a separation of the zones where men work from air being contaminated by dust and methane gas by the cutting action. Beginning as single intake air courses, the air separates at the working section where one split provides fresh air to the Occupied Zone (OZ) for human needs and the other split purges and carries away dust and methane from face fragmentation in the Cutting Zone (CZ). The attractiveness of the Variable Wall Mining Machine is that it addresses the limitations of current longwall mining equipment: it can consistently out-produce continuous mining machines and most longwall shearing machines. It also is amenable to configuring an environment, the dual-duct system, where the air for human breathing is separated from dust-laden ventilating air with methane mixtures. The objective of the research was to perform a mathematical and experimental study of the interrelationships {{of the components of}} the system so that a computer model could demonstrate the workings of the system in an animation program. The analysis resulted in the compilation of the parameters for three different configurations of a dual aircourse system of ventilating underground mines. In addressing the goal of an inherently safe mining system the dual-duct adaptation to the Variable Wall Mining Machine appears to offer the path to solution. The respirable dust problem is solvable; the explosive dust problem is nearly solvable; and the explosive methane problem can be greatly reduced. If installed in a highly gassy mine, the dual duct models would also be considerably less costly...|$|E
40|$|To {{control the}} insect pests in stored grains, {{conventional}} methods (fumigation, controlled atmosphere, {{hot and cold}} air, and ionizing radiation) have been applied, however those methods have major drawbacks (remaining toxic chemicals, inefficient heating, long treatment time, etc). One of the alternative methods for the disinfestation is radio frequency (RF) heating based on electromagnetic radiation. The main advantage of the RF heating over thermal gradient driven conventional heating methods is volumetric and selective heating. It is governed by {{the characteristics of the}} electromagnetic energy, and the electrical, thermal, and physical properties of materials. Dielectric property of bulk canola seed (Brassica napus L.) and red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum, Herbst, 1797) were measured at different moisture contents (5 %, 7 %, 9 %, and 11 %), temperatures (30 to 80 °C) and frequencies (5 to 30 MHz) using a precision LCR (L : inductance, C : capacitance, and R : resistance) meter and a dielectric test fixture. The dielectric properties decreased with increasing frequency regardless of temperature or moisture content (MC), but increased in proportion to increasing temperature or MC. Other properties (specific heat, thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity) of the bulk canola seeds increased with temperature or MC. On the other hand, density and emissivity decreased with temperature or MC. Properties (specific heat, thermal conductivity and dielectric properties) of the red flour beetle increased in proportional to increasing temperature, which the excepting of a density, which decreased with increasing temperature. Temperature distribution in the bulk canola seed at various volumes (small – 196. 3 cm 3, medium – 1, 766 cm 3, and large – 6, 503 cm 3) and MCs (5 %, 7 %, 9 %, and 11 %) was determined during RF heating (1. 5 kW, 27. 12 MHz). The temperature of the small and the large volumes (having relatively larger top and bottom surface areas than the electrode) of seeds decreased from the center toward the wall region due to heat losses from the outer boundary of the seed. The contrast, {{in the case of the}} medium volume of seed, a relatively higher temperature at the region between the middle and outer boundary was observed due to the edge effect. A 2 % agar gel was used to demonstrate the effect of sample volume on the formation of the electric field affecting the RF heating pattern. The temperature distribution of the 2 % agar gel was in good agreement with that of the bulk canola seed. The mortalities of the red flour beetle infesting canola seeds of the small and medium volumes during RF heating were determined at different end temperatures (30 to 80 °C) and initial seed MCs (5 %, 7 %, 9 %, and 11 %). Complete mortalities of the adult insects were achieved at 80 ºC for the small volume of the seeds at all MCs, at 60 ºC and 9 % and 11 % MCs, and at 70 ºC and 5 % and 7 % MCs for the medium volume. Complete mortalities at the other life stage (pupa, larva, egg) of the insect were achieved at 55 ºC at all MCs and volumes. Over 95 % mortality of the adult insects was achieved at over 60 ºC temperature at any MCs and volumes. Germination, major and minor axes, roundness and colour of the seeds and quality of the seed oil were not affected significantly by RF treatment temperature at all MCs. There is potential to realize complete mortality at all life stages of the insect infesting the seed at 60 ºC by RF heating, regardless of the volume of the seed sample, with proper design to achieve more uniform temperature distribution and shorter RF heating time. The thermal death kinetics of the adult red flour beetles infesting the stored canola seed at various MCs (5 %, 7 %, 9 %, and 11 %) and volumes (small and medium) of seed were characterised based on the dynamic temperature increment of the seed and experimental data of the insect mortalities during RF heating. The first order reaction model was the most satisfactory to describe the thermal death kinetics of the adult red flour beetle. The determined activation energy (100 kJ/mol) for the thermal death of the adult red flour beetles was lower than that for some other insects (codling moth, Indianmeal moth and navel orangeworm) determined from experiments with a heating block system, which indicated that the adult red flour beetle was more susceptible to thermal death of RF heating than the other insects heated using the heating block. Selective heating of the red flour beetle in two different volumes of bulk canola seed at 5 %, 7 %, 9 % and 11 % MC using the RF heating unit was simulated using the finite element method based commercial simulation package (COMSOL Multi-physics). The simulated temperatures of the seed and insects were compared with measured temperatures at the various MCs and all volumes. Non-uniform RF heating of the seed was observed regardless of the MC or volume. The RF selective heating of the insect was most effective for the small volume of seed at 11 % MC. The temperature of the insects was a maximum of 14. 6 °C higher than the temperature of the seed. As an application of the developed simulation, the effect of voltage (tested with half and double the estimated voltages from the previous simulation) on RF heating uniformity and selective RF heating was determined by comparison of simulated temperature distributions of the seed at 11 % MC and the insects. The RF heating uniformity in the seeds improved and the selective RF heating of the insects was enhanced with increasing voltage, regardless of the volume of the seed. To improve RF heating uniformity, mixing the seed with a <b>rotating</b> <b>auger</b> during the RF heating was considered. From further simulations, uniform RF heating of the seeds was observed near the outlet by help of mixing effect...|$|E
50|$|A thermal screw {{desorber}} typically {{consists of}} a series of 1-4 augers. The auger system conveys, mixes, and heats contaminated soils to volatilize moisture and organic contaminants into a purge gas stream. Augers can be arranged in series to increase the soil residence time, or they can be configured in parallel to increase throughput capacity. Most thermal screw systems circulate a hot heat-transfer oil through the hollow flights of the auger and return the hot oil through the shaft to the heat transfer fluid heating system. The heated oil is also circulated through the jacketed trough in which each <b>auger</b> <b>rotates.</b> Thermal screws can also be steam-heated. Systems heated with oil can achieve soil temperatures of up to 500 °F, and steam-heated systems can heat soil to approximately 350 °F.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine {{the nature of the}} chemical interactions of oxygen and sulfur with iron when surfaces are stationary and also during sliding in a vacuum environment. Various gases that contained sulfur, oxygen, or both were adsorbed to iron at 23 C. The gases included oxygen, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and sulfur dioxide. Friction experiments were conducted with a hemispherical rider sliding on a <b>rotating</b> disk. An <b>Auger</b> cylindrical mirror analyzer was used to monitor the iron surface chemistry. The results {{of this study indicate that}} oxygen will completely displace sulfide films from iron surfaces. Organic thiols containing sulfur, such as methyl mercaptan, adsorb to an iron surface dissociatively. Only sulfur is detected on the iron surface. Sliding inhibits the formation of sulfide films on iron with the adsorption of hydrogen sulfide and methyl mercaptan. With oxygen and sulfur dioxide, the sliding process does not affect adsorption behavior...|$|R
