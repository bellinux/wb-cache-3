No work was carried out as maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority was given to the completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E

The 1991 Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be <b>reviewed</b> <b>in</b> 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation.

5|$|In later campaigns, the Croatian {{army would}} pursue {{a variant of}} blitzkrieg tactics, with the Guard brigades {{punching}} through the enemy lines while the other units simply held the lines at other points and completed an encirclement of the enemy units. In a further attempt to bolster its armed forces, Croatia hired Military Professional Resources Inc. (MPRI) in September 1994 to train some of its officers and NCOs. Begun in January 1995, MPRI's assignment involved fifteen advisors who taught basic officer leadership skills and training management. MPRI activities were <b>reviewed</b> <b>in</b> advance by the US State Department to ensure they did not involve tactical training or violate the UN arms embargo still in place.|$|E
