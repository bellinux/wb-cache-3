40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{an alternative}} test method {{to evaluate the}} energy consumption of frost-free refrigerators and freezers for residential applications. While the standardized methods require the <b>refrigerating</b> <b>appliance</b> to be kept running according to its onboard control system, which usually drives the refrigerator through an on-off cycling pattern, the proposed approach assesses the refrigerator energy performance in the steady-state regime, being therefore much faster and more reliable. In this procedure, the cooling capacity is matched to the cooling loads by PID-controlled electrical heaters installed within the refrigerated compartments, so that the compartment temperatures are kept at the desired standardized levels. Comparisons between the experimental results obtained using the steady-state energy (SSE) test and the standardized procedures showed that the former follows closely the trends observed for the latter...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyses}} {{the relationships}} between product design and end-of-life treatment, but also between product and waste policies, based on a relevant case study. Commercial <b>refrigerating</b> <b>appliance</b> is a suitable case study due to its recent inclusions in the scope of two important European pieces of legislation, the Waste of Electric and Electronic Equipment Directive and the Ecodesign Directive. Commercial refrigerating appliances are business to business products with several peculiarities such as: customized design, high range of dimensions, content of complex electronic components and parts difficult to treat and recycle. The method used for the analysis: formalization, through literature review and survey of recycling plants, of treatments applied to the studied waste product; investigation of problems and difficulties in the recycling plants; identification of possible product-related improvement strategies; definition of workable product design options. For the analysis of actual recycling practices, data has been gathered through interviews with four European recyclers, and by consulting manufacturers and other experts of these products. Several potential design options to improve the recyclability of these products are identified and discussed, such as the design for dismantling of some key components, the restriction of some blowing agents and the labeling of insulation foams. The article finally shows how the enforcement of these design features, in particular through mandatory product policies such as the Ecodesign Directive, could facilitate their end-of-life treatment and hence ease the compliance with the waste legislation...|$|E

An experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of room temperature, door opening, thermostat setting position, relative humidity, and loading on energy consumption of a household refrigerator-freezer. With the experimental data, a multiple regression equation is developed to investigate their combined effect. Finally, energy consumption according to the regression equation with optimum setting conditions is compared with ISO standard test conditions, Our comparison reveals that ISO refrigerator-freezer test standards are applicable with respect to Malaysian climatic conditions and usage patterns...|$|R
30|$|Many of China’s {{exports to}} these {{countries}} are also subject to non-tariff barriers-mostly technical barriers to trade (TBTs). Particularly, the USA and Canada impose these TBTs on several electrical <b>appliances,</b> like <b>refrigerating</b> <b>appliances,</b> water and gas heaters, dishwashers, washing machines, fluorescent lamps, batteries, air conditioners and radio communication equipment which they import from China. The USA also imposes specific TBTs on children products imported from China. Imports of textile products from China are subject to such TBTs by Canada. Japan imposes these technical barriers on import of wooden furniture and construction machines from China. China also on its part applies several such non-tariff barriers to its imports {{in the form of}} licensing requirements and TBTs to all its partners including the TPP countries (WTO).|$|R

40|$|The European Commission's {{directive}} {{on energy}} labelling of refrigerating appliances cal ls {{up on all}} member states to enforce full compliance to the directive. This includes the checking of the energy consumption as declared by the manufacturer, {{on the basis of}} the European Standard EN 153. The standard EN 153 stipulates that the rated value is accepted as long as the difference between measured and rated values does not exceed 15 %. At higher tolerances, three extra samples should be measured for which - on average - a tolerance of maximum 10 % is accepted. For the Dutch ministry of Economic affairs, TNO MEP undertakes a verification campaign of <b>refrigerating</b> <b>appliance</b> energy labels. Measurements carried out in 1997 and 1998 on 47 models show that conformity between rated and measured energy consumption is above 80 % Consumer organisations in EU member states however claim high percentages (up to 89 % for certain categories) of refrigerating appliances that do not conform to the rated energy consumption. These claims are based on measurements that (on puipose) do not take account of the tolerance levels prescribed by the standard EN 153. The discussion now focuses on the necessity of a 15 % tolerance in the European Standard, in which in-laboratory precision, inter-laboratory differences and production spread all play key-roles. These subjects are addressed based on the experience of TNO-MEP in verification measurements for the energy label, and the role of TNO-MEP as co-ordinator of an inter-laboratory comparison of test resuks (ring test) on refrigeratin g ap p liance energy consumption...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} cutting housings of <b>refrigerating</b> <b>appliances</b> with a CO 2 laser, as a stage of their disassembly during recycling. The housings are made of laminar “sandwich” composites with low susceptibility to be processed after withdrawal from use. The problems of their utilization result from difficulties to separate the three materials making individual layers of the composite, i. e. metal, foamed polyurethane and a thermoplastic material. In the suggested method of cutting with laser beam, utilized are significant differences between melting points and flash points of these materials. Implementation of this method {{makes it possible to}} recover from waste housings sections of any shape, which could be reused with regard to their maintained insulating and mechanical properties (rigidity, compression strength) ...|$|R

40|$|Summary. The main {{directions}} {{of use of}} freeze-dryed products and ingredients are revealed. The analysis of sales markets of freeze-dryed products is provided. It is shown that introduction of innovative production technologies will allow to develop dynamically {{not only to the}} large companies, but also small firms that will create prerequisites for growth of the Russian market of freeze-dryed products. Tendencies of development of the freeze-drying equipment are analysed. Relevance of development of energy saving freeze-dryers is proved The integrated approach to creation of competitive domestic technologies and the equipment for sublimation dehydration of thermolabile products consists in use of the effective combined remedies of a power supply, a process intensification, reduction of specific energy consumption and, as a result, decrease in product cost at achievement of high quality indicators.

40|$|The “Resource Efficiency Assessment of Product- REAPro” {{method has}} been {{developed}} to assess energy related products against a set of resource efficiency criteria, and to identify hot-spots and improvement potentials. The method has been applied and tested to various case-studies as: dishwashers, electronic displays, computers (notebook and tablets) and enterprise servers. These applications allowed to progressively refine the method from a scientifically perspective, but also to link the results to potentially new policy applications, including {{the development of new}} types of workable Ecodesign measures and Ecolabel criteria. The present report summarizes the recent advancements of the REAPro method and the definition of innovative requirements. In particular, novel elements discussed in the report are: -	Analysis of benefits of reused components: The REAPro method only partially addressed the “reusability” concept (i. e. the potential full reuse of products at the EoL). However, it did not address the possibility that only certain key components (i. e. those having the highest residual value) could be collected from waste for the manufacturing of new products. This aspect has been addressed in a new method that allows to identify if, and to what extent, it is environmentally beneficial to reuse certain components for the remanufacturing of products (Chapter 2). In particular, it is observed that a product with reused components can still be environmentally convenient even if it has a higher energy consumption compared to brand-new products. The results of the method could be applied to build novel policy requirements, which allow higher energy efficiency thresholds for products that embody reused components. -	Revision of the assessment of the index on recyclability: based on comments received by stakeholders related to previous case-studies, the index on recyclability benefit rate of the REAPro method has been revised to clearly separate the environmental impacts of the WEEE recycling from the potential credits due to the secondary raw materials produced (Chapter 3). -	Assessment of the disassemblability and dismantlability of key components: design for disassembly of key components has been identified as a crucial aspect for the repair and recycling of the products. JRC has been working on developing suitable and verifiable requirements to assess disassemblability and dismantlability since 2012. These requirements have evolved, thanks to comments and suggestions from different stakeholders, and in particular from Market surveillance authorities of some Member States, which are in charge of verification of requirements. Two different types of requirements are presented and discussed in this report (Chapter 4) : one based on numbers of disassembly steps necessary to disassemble certain components; and other based on criteria to grant the identification, access and extraction of key components for the product’s recycling, including requirements on their fastening and the provision of relevant information for the end-of-life treatments. -	Recyclability of plastics: recycling of plastics {{is one of the biggest}} challenges in the WEEE treatment and is addressed in Chapter 5 of this report. Criticalities in plastic recycling have been analysed. In particular, large number of different polymers, technological barriers for plastic sorting, content of additives (especially flame retardants), difficulties for the extraction of plastic parts, downcycling and low value of secondary materials are among the reasons of very low recycling rates for plastics in WEEE. The reports therefore propose some potential requirements based on plastic marking and provision of information. A novel index on the content of flame retardants in plastic parts is proposed. Together with requirements on dismantlability, these requirements could contribute to improve the recycling of plastics from WEEE. At the time of the report (December 2016) several of the requirements above mentioned have been integrated and discussed in various policy proposals, as the Ecodesign requirements for electronic displays, enterprise servers and commercial <b>refrigerating</b> <b>appliances,</b> and Ecolabel criteria for computers and displays.
