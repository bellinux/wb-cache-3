40|$|Available {{data show}} that Vietnam emerges {{as one of the}} first {{recipients}} of climate changeadaptation-related aid. In addition, reporting by OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) members based on the <b>Rio</b> <b>marker</b> methodology indicates that Vietnam attracted a significantly largestshare of “international adaptation finance” than of bilateral official development aid (ODA) while thiscountry is at the same time one of the first recipients of bilateral ODA in the world (third biggestrecipient in 2010 - 2013). Our screening of aid activities labelled by DAC donors as adaptation-related in Vietnam shows thatthese observations need to be qualified. The case of Vietnam illustrates some of the practicalchallenges of monitoring international climate finance and some of the weaknesses of currentreporting systems in this regard. Any estimates of international climate finance should therefore beconsidered with caution. This paper also highlights the limits of a strictly accounting approach to international climatefinance – an approach that is however particularly apparent in negotiations under the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This approach could indeed provide adisincentive to use some types of aid (such as general budget support or debt relief) that are potentiallyhighly relevant to address intersectoral issues such as climate change adaptation and mitigation. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Paris Agreement commits {{nations in}} Article 2 (1) to “Making finance flows {{consistent}} with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. ” However there is an absence of internationally agreed accounting rules that would permit overall assessments of progress to this goal and any meaningful comparisons of performance between countries. This is true also for the quantitative Copenhagen/Cancún promise by developed nations to jointly mobilize US$ 100 billion by 2020. Our goal is to provoke discussion about {{the depth of the}} problems this lack of a functional definition and accounting system have created and perpetuated. We do so by describing the fragmented system of national reporting of climate finance and how the OECD’s <b>Rio</b> <b>Marker</b> system is serving neither contributors nor recipients. More than a trust issue between developed and developing countries, we argue that the lack of modalities to account for climate finance also considerably impedes the effective functioning of the bottom-up approach that now prevails under the UNFCCC. The deadline to propose "modalities of accounting climate finance" by 2018 is a crucial window in which to address this chronic issue in international climate policy. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
