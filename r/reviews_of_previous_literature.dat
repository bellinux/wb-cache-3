40|$|Arabic and English are {{acknowledged}} as two major natural languages {{used by many}} countries and regions. <b>Reviews</b> <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature</b> conclude that machine translation (MT) between these languages is disappointing and unsatisfactory due to its poor quality. This research aims to improve the translation quality of MT between Arabic and English by developing higher quality parallel corpora. The thesis developed a higher quality parallel test corpus, based on corpora from Al Hayat articles and the OPUS open-source online corpora database. A new Prediction by Partial Matching (PPM) -based metric for sentence alignment {{has been applied to}} verify quality in translation between the sentence pairs in the test corpus. This metric combines two techniques; the traditional approach is based on sentence length and the other is based on compression code length. A higher quality parallel corpus has been constructed from the existing resources. Obtaining sentences and words from two online sources, Al Hayat and OPUS, the new corpus offers 27, 775, 663 words in Arabic and 30, 808, 480 in English. Experimental results on sample data indicate that the PPM-based and sentence length technique for sentence alignment on this corpus improves accuracy of alignment compared to sentence length alone...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - To {{explore the}} {{contention}} that, contrary to earlier research suggesting {{that people in}} transition economies such as Russia and China have a propensity not to share knowledge, Russians' and Chinese' {{may in fact be}} more inclined to share knowledge than people in Western, industrialised countries but that this willingness to share knowledge is highly influenced by group membership. Design/methodology/approach - Our argument is based on <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature</b> and cases and the authors' own semi-structured interview research conducted with Western and local managers and employees in Russia and China over the past decade. Findings - The research finds that the extent to which group membership influences the processes of knowledge sharing and whether it is impeded or facilitated in Russia and China is determined by both cultural and institutional factors. Practical implications - The paper has important practical implications in providing guidelines on the initiatives that international businesses can implement to create knowledge-sharing organizational cultures in their subsidiary operations in Russia and China. Originality/value - The research is original and adds value to existing literature in that we examine an issue erstwhile not explored in mainstream organizational writings, namely an in-depth consideration of the relationship between groups and knowledge sharing, with particular reference to two emerging markets.

40|$|Slamming often {{occurs in}} severe sea states {{particular}} for high speed vessels, {{which can cause}} damage to ship hulls or even equipment on ships. Analysis of transient dynamic response of ship hulls is useful in establishing criterion related to slamming loads and predicting seakeeping behavior of the ship. Thus this thesis is mainly focused on dynamic response of the ship due to slamming loads. Experimental study of the floating structure dynamics can be very expensive. Hence, numerical methods {{are considered to be}} very useful for dynamic analysis of the ship. The ship to be analyzed in this work is owned by Wagenborg which is a multi-purpose cargo/container ship. The bench mark committee has provided all the information about the ship and corresponding sea condition. Three-dimensional finite element model is established in Sesam Genie. Hydrodynamic coefficients are computed in Sesam HydroD. The model made in Genie is imported in ABAQUS for dynamic analysis. The material properties, sections, mesh size and load cases are defined in ABAQUS. The introductory part of this thesis gives an overview of slamming phenomenon and <b>reviews</b> <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature.</b> The second part of the thesis introduces different types of external loads which act on the ship hull and the response induced by these loads. Slamming load theories are described especially. The third part elaborates dynamic response analysis theories and corresponding analysis methods. The analysis methods used in ANAQUS are also specified in this section. The forth part of the thesis presents details of the finite element modelling of the ship using software Sesam and ABAQUS. Different ship models are established for comparison. The final part presents the results of eigenvalue analysis and dynamic response analysis. Parametric studies are performed in this section. The conclusions are made in the final part...|$|E

This research proposes that women are put in a double bind where those who portray themselves as more communal and submissive are overlooked for leadership positions and women who try to utilize male tactics (such as being more aggressive) receive negative consequences for violating normative gender roles. To change this dynamic the authors suggest that managerial positions should be re-advertised to highlight the feminine qualities needed for a position and staff training should involve a segment accentuating gender issues in the office to make everyone aware of possible discrimination.|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} in organisational sociology {{has focused on}} how organisational forms are evolved, transformed and sustained. This paper continues in this line of enquiry and tests the role of IT in organisational transformation. The transformation of an organisation can be gauged by observing key organisational attributes {{that are likely to}} feature in transformed (new) organisations. Following a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature,</b> three major factors, that is, business strategy, IT strategy, IT strategic alignment were hypothesised to influence the dimensions of new organisational forms (NOFs). To test this model, data were collected from a survey of 312 Australian businesses. Structural equation modelling was employed to test the research hypotheses. Results from this study uncovered that the level of strategic alignment was significantly associated with the attributes of NOFs. This implies that organisations that have progressed well in the IT-business alignment maturity ladder are likely to change their structure and control mechanisms. This study concludes by highlighting some of the theoretical and practical implications of the findings...|$|R

Method: methodological study of face and content validation, judging clarity, relevance, pertinence and comprehensiveness of a care protocol, elaborated from the integrative <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature</b> {{and based on}} the conceptual model of assistance perioperative nursing of Castellanos and Jouclas. The protocol was evaluated by five anesthesiologists and nurses from the surgical center. The results were analyzed through the content validity index. Results: among the 119 items assessed by experts, 11 (9. 2 %) instrument items presented content validity index of < 80 % and were changed. The items with disagreement were related to the selection and availability of materials and equipment, especially before anesthetic induction. The content validity index, obtained for the different items, proposed after the amendments mentioned, ranged from 80 to 100 %, in the three periods of anesthesia, indicating the proper validity of the proposed content. Conclusion: the nursing care protocol in anesthesia was considered valid...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{research into}} psychological momentum in sports, researchers and theorists still {{appear to be}} divided on whether the concept is real or illusionary (Burke, Edwards, Weigard & Weinberg, 1997).

Future researchers are encouraged to focus on athletes’ experiences and employ qualitative methods to i) develop a clearer conceptualization of psychological momentum, ii) examine athletes perceived experiences of psychological momentum - including momentum starters, iii) explore specific cognitive, affective and behavioral changes associated with experiencing psychological momentum, and iv) use evidence from both qualitative and quantitative studies to critically evaluate the three current conceptual models of psychological momentum...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with modelling variations {{in the use of}} health-care services between small geographic areas. A range of potential explanatory variables are identified from a <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature,</b> ranging from social, economic, and demographic factors through access to services, and practitioner characteristics, to new measures of behaviour and lifestyle. Real admissions data for the city of Leeds relating to a variety of services over a three-year period are introduced to calibrate a series of utilisation models. It is argued that the strength of the goodness of fit makes these models potentially useful in the evaluation of resource allocation between service providers. By providing better global models of usage it is possible to examine small-area outliers to highlight areas where revealed demand, or usage, is not reflecting need as much as it should. In particular, this paper demonstrates the importance of lifestyle preferences in modelling the utilisation of health-care services. ...|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{determine}} the roles of reactive oxygen species HO∙ and HO 2 − in the bleaching of melanins by alkaline hydrogen peroxide. Experiments using melanosomes isolated from human hair indicated that the HO∙ radical generated in the outside solution does not contribute significantly to bleaching.

Additionally, when both oxidants are present, bleaching is increased dramatically in both rate and extent. Careful experimental design enabled {{the separation of the}} roles and effects of these key reactive species, HO∙ and HO 2 −. Rationalisation of the results presented, and <b>review</b> <b>of</b> <b>previous</b> <b>literature,</b> allowed the postulation of a simplified general scheme whereby the strong oxidant HO∙ is able to pre-oxidise melanin units to o-quinones enabling more facile ring opening by the more nucleophilic HO 2 −.
