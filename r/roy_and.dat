5|$|Sportswriters {{and players}} have called Brodeur {{one of the}} {{greatest}} goalies in NHL history. USA Todays Kevin Allen placed Brodeur in a group including <b>Roy</b> <b>and</b> Sawchuk as the leading NHL goalie, noting that Brodeur had the advantage in wins. Writer Steve Politi noted Brodeur's longevity as an advantage on other top all-time goalies such as Roy; Brodeur played 70 or more games in 12 seasons, compared to 0 for Roy. Sportsnet's Chris Boyle, after running a statistical analysis, placed Brodeur eighth in his all-time goaltending list; he offered the rationale that Brodeur's teammates helped him achieve his major records, while goalies such as <b>Roy</b> <b>and</b> Hašek had superior stats in their best seasons.|$|E

5|$|Antoine Gardano {{became the}} primary Italian {{publisher}} for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought {{out one of}} his madrigal books as well. Arcadelt's Il bianco e dolce cigno opened one of Gardano's books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point. In Paris, some of Arcadelt's chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant and Jacques Moderne, so must have been written in Italy. After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of the printing firm of Le <b>Roy</b> <b>and</b> Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice.|$|E
5|$|Arcadelt wrote over 200 madrigals {{before he}} left Italy in 1551 to return to France, where he spent the {{remainder}} of his life; his numerous chansons date from this and subsequent years. In 1557 he published a book of masses, dedicated to his new employer, Charles de Guise, Cardinal of Lorraine (Arcadelt was maître de chapelle, i.e. choirmaster for him). In this publication he was mentioned {{as a member of the}} royal chapel, and therefore must have served both Henry II (died 1559) and Charles IX during this late phase of his career. In Paris he employed the publishing house of Le <b>Roy</b> <b>and</b> Ballard, who printed his abundant chansons, masses and motets just as the Venetian printers had earlier printed his madrigals.|$|E
