40|$|The Mackenzie Basin {{in northwestern}} Canada covers {{approximately}} 1. 8 million km 2 and extends from 52 °N to 70 °N. Much of the Basin is currently too cool and <b>remote</b> from <b>markets</b> to <b>support</b> a viable agricultural sector, but the southern {{portion of the}} Basin has the physical potential to support commercial agriculture. This case study employed agricultural land rating and crop models to estimate {{the degree to which}} a CO 2 -induced global warming might alter the physical potential for commercial agriculture throughout the Basin. The two climate change scenarios considered in this analysis would relax the current constraints imposed by a short and cool frost-free season, but without adaptive measures, drier conditions and accelerated crop development rates were estimated to offset potential gains stemming from elevated CO 2 levels and warmer temperatures. In addition to striving for a better understanding of the extent to which physical constraints on agriculture might be modified by climate change, there is a need to expand the research context and to consider the capacity of agriculture to adapt to altered climates. ...|$|R

30|$|It {{is worth}} {{pointing}} out {{the main difference between}} this model and previous models on the link between a firm’s efficiency and the number and remoteness of its destination markets, which follow Melitz (2003). Previous models assume that each firm faces a strictly positive demand for its output, in every market, at any positive price set by the firm. This is, for example, the consequence of assuming CES preferences, which is the usual assumption in the literature. Therefore, in the absence of fixed costs of exporting to each destination, these models would imply that all firms export to all markets. Hence, fixed cost of exporting to each market (together with the fact that more-efficient firms are larger) is the key mechanism in these models for the result that only the more efficient firms sell in the more <b>remote</b> <b>markets.</b> To the contrary, in this model, each individual firm faces a demand with finite choke prices for each quality. Consequently, the reason why the less-efficient firms do not sell in the more-remote markets is their inability to produce at low enough marginal costs. Furthermore, the mechanism for the link between destination-market remoteness and export quality (the Alchian–Allen effect) in this model is also different from the usual one. The mechanism usually considered is that if transport costs are not proportional to shipment’s value but have a per unit component, a higher transport cost to a more <b>remote</b> <b>market</b> reduces the relative price of higher-quality exports with respect to lower-quality exports (see Hummels and Skiba 2004). Then, under usual assumptions on demand, this implies that shipments to more <b>remote</b> <b>markets</b> have a bigger proportion of higher-quality goods. The mechanism in this model is that the higher the trade costs, the stronger the selection effect on exporters. Since more-efficient firms produce higher quality, trade costs result in higher-quality exports to more <b>remote</b> <b>markets.</b> In the next subsection, we turn to the model’s implications on human capital and wage differences across firms.|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} the {{relationships}} between managing market complexity, skills, and frequency of usage of <b>marketing</b> <b>support</b> services. The research was conducted through a structural equation modeling using data from 67 SMEs that operate in Malaysia. To analyze and interpret the result, a measurement model and a structural model were utilized for the main constructs – managing market complexity, skills, perceived usefulness, and the usage of <b>marketing</b> <b>support</b> services. This study found that owners, who are facing difficulties in managing their businesses, which are focused on market complexity, are more frequent users of the <b>marketing</b> <b>support</b> services. In terms of skills, SMEs with longer experience are lesser users of the <b>marketing</b> <b>support</b> services. The results from the moderator analysis failed to validate that perceived usefulness affects the relationship between managing market complexity {{and the frequency of}} usage as well as skills. The results of this study can prove to SMEs that frequent use of <b>marketing</b> <b>support</b> services can help in dealing with market complexity. The role of perceived usefulness should not be sidelined by service providers as it may have a negative impact in the long run. The findings will be of interest to researchers, policy makers, and service providers...|$|R
