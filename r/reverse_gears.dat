25|$|The engine exhaust, exiting at {{the rear}} left, is cooled to reduce the thermal {{signature}} of the Leclerc. Transmission is a hydromechanical type with five forward and two <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> Fuel tanks carry 1,300 litres and act as extra protection for the tank; two 200-litre external tanks can be fitted on {{the rear of the}} turret, but these have to be jettisoned before entering combat, since they limit turret rotation.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} {{are provided by}} German companies MTU and Renk respectively. The water-cooled engine generates 1,400hp and is integrated with an Indian turbocharger and epicyclic train gearbox with four forward and 2 <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> A local transmission is under trials and it is envisioned to ultimately replace the Renk-supplied unit. The tracks which were being supplied by German company Diehl are now being manufactured by L. The cooling pack has been designed for desert operations. The Arjun has a lower ground pressure than the lighter T-72, due to its design.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of articulated locomotives {{was a major}} impetus to the {{development of}} power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> instead of just one on a simple locomotive. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features. In British use, locking cylinders remained in use. The Hadfield <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> with added locking cylinder.Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system.|$|R

500|$|The Sd.Kfz. 10 {{was unique}} among German {{half-track}} designs {{as it used}} a hull rather than a frame.

500|$|While touring Europe for {{a second}} time, {{in an attempt to}} {{integrate}} foreign design trends into the new Trubia, Captain Ruiz de Toledo found a new type of track system in Germany. Designed to avoid having problems with the tracks coming off the vehicle, the new design substituted the traditional tracks with a system which was held together by a lateral metal wall, with the roadwheels suspended from the chassis. [...] The track system was the most innovative and unique part of the new Trubia light tank. [...] Apart from the new tracks, the Trubia was to have a greater velocity (at least [...] ) and greater road range than the FT. While a new machine gun was installed on the glacis plate, the tank's crew was increased from two to three, which caused the hull to be enlarged; this also allowed the engine to be maintained from inside the vehicle, allowing the crew to fix small breakdowns in the field. [...] To refrigerate the engine and the crew, a compressed air dispenser was installed inside the chassis. This solved problems dealing with the crew's claustrophobia and the intake of gasses originating from the engine found in the FT, and made crewing the tank much more ergonomic. [...] The original [...] was replaced with a more powerful [...] Daimler four cylinder engine. The transmission had four forward gears and four <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> [...] The new tank proved satisfactory—and even bettered the FT in some aspects—and the Spanish Army ordered the construction of four prototypes.|$|E

The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of , gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to [...] The engine's drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate centrifugal clutch. The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30's major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. The tank's weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on [...] wide tracks. The tank could ford [...] deep water obstacles without preparation, up to [...] with minor preparation, and up to [...] with full preparation. Full preparation for water operations consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment's air intake louvers, and the installment of infra-red driving equipment, including a searchlight. In 1969 a single special dive training vehicle was adapted, nicknamed the AMX 30 Gloutte (from French faire glouglou, [...] "gurgle"), without engine and tracks, that over a ramp could quickly be lowered into a reservoir by a winch; it was equipped with an escape tube.|$|E
2500|$|The Leclerc has an eight-cylinder SACM (now Wärtsilä) V8X-1500 1,500hp Hyperbar {{diesel engine}} and a Renk AG [...] {{automatic}} transmission, with five forward and two <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b> The official maximum speed by road is 72km/h and 55km/h cross country (speeds {{in excess of}} 80km/h were reported on road). The maximum range is given as 550km, and can be extended to 650km with removable external tanks. The [...] "hyperbar" [...] system integrates a Turbomeca TM 307B gas turbine in the engine, acting both as a turbocharger and an APU giving auxiliary power to all systems when the main engine is shut down. The Hyperbar name comes from the unusually high boost pressure of 7.5 bar and the resulting mean effective pressure of 32.1 bar. To compare, the largest diesel engine in the world (the Wärtsila RTA96) has a mean effective pressure of 18.6 bar. In addition, with boost available even at idle, this arrangement also works as an anti-lag system.|$|E
