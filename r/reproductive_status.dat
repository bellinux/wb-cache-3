5|$|Rodents use scent marking in {{many social}} {{contexts}} including inter- and intra-species communication, the marking of trails {{and the establishment}} of territories. Their urine provides genetic information about individuals including the species, the sex and individual identity, and metabolic information on dominance, <b>reproductive</b> <b>status</b> and health. Compounds derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are bound to several urinary proteins. The odor of a predator depresses scent-marking behavior.|$|E
5|$|The tammar wallaby has a {{promiscuous}} mating system. It is {{a seasonal}} breeder and births largely occur during late January and early February. During the breeding season, the male's prostate and bulbourethral gland enlarge. However, {{there does not}} appear to be any seasonal difference in the weight of the testes. Around two weeks before the first births, the males will begin sniffing the uro-genital openings and pouches of the females to determine their <b>reproductive</b> <b>status.</b> After giving birth, females enter estrus and allow males to mate with them. However, a male that attempts to mate with an estrous female may face aggression from other males. A male can achieve reproductive success by mate-guarding. During the estrous period, males establish a dominance hierarchy and the higher ranking males will try to prevent subordinates from mating with estrous females. Several males may pursue a single female.|$|E

40|$|Infant cuteness can {{influence}} adult-infant interaction {{and has been}} shown to activate reward centres in the brain. In a previous study, we found men and women to be differentially sensitive to small differences in infant facial cuteness, with <b>reproductive</b> hormone <b>status</b> as the potential underlying cause. It is unclear, however, whether <b>reproductive</b> hormone <b>status</b> impacts on the aesthetic and incentive salience of infant faces. To address this question, we conducted two interlinked studies. We used static images of the same smiling and neutral-looking infant faces in both a rating task, in which participants had to rate the cuteness of infant faces (aesthetic salience - 'liking'), and a key-press task, in which participants could prolong or shorten viewing time of infant faces by rapid alternating key-presses (incentive salience - 'wanting'). In a first study, we compared the performance of men, women who are taking oral contraceptives, and regularly cycling women. In this study, we found a significant correlation between cuteness ratings within and between groups, which implies that participants had the same concept of cuteness. Cuteness ratings and effort to look at faces was linked regardless of sex and <b>reproductive</b> hormone <b>status,</b> in that cute faces were looked at for longer than less cute faces. A happy facial expression contributed only marginally to the incentive salience of the face. To explore the potential impact of <b>reproductive</b> hormone <b>status</b> in more detail, we followed a subset of regularly cycling women during the menstrual, follicular and luteal phases of their cycle. The aesthetic and incentive salience of infant faces did not change across the menstrual cycle. Our findings suggest that <b>reproductive</b> hormone <b>status</b> does not modulate the aesthetic and incentive value of infant faces. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Giant {{freshwater}} prawn (GFP) Macrobrachium rosenbergii is unique with males categorized in five different morphotypes (small claw, orange claw, blue claw, old blue claw and no claw males) and females in three <b>reproductive</b> <b>statuses</b> (mature ovary, berried and spawned females). In {{the present study}} we examined genetic inheritance of female and male morphotypes, their body weights and genetic associations between morphotypes and body traits. Restricted maximum likelihood fitting a multi-trait animal model was performed on a total of 21, 459 body records collected over five generations in a GFP population selected for high growth rate. The estimates of variance components showed that there were substantial differences in additive genetic variance in body weight between male morphotypes. The low and significantly different from one genetic correlations between the expressions of body weight in male morphotypes also suggest that these traits {{should be treated as}} genetically different traits in selective breeding programs. By contrast, body weights of female types are essentially the same characters as indicated by the high genetic correlations between homologous trait expressions. In addition to body weight, male morphotypes and female <b>reproductive</b> <b>statuses</b> were treated as traits in themselves and were analysed as binary observations using animal and sire linear mixed models, and logit and probit threshold models. The estimates of heritability back-transformed from the liability scale were in good agreement with those obtained from linear mixed models, ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 43 for male morphotypes and 0. 06 to 0. 10 for female types.

25|$|Feed {{for their}} cattle {{is by far}} {{one of the largest}} {{expenses}} for dairy producer whether it be provided by the land they graze or crops grown or purchased. Pasture based dairy producers invest much time and effort into maintaining their pastures and thus feed for their cattle. Pasture management techniques such as rotational grazing are common for dairy production. Many large dairies that deliver food to their cattle have a dedicated nutritionist who is responsible for formulating diets with animal health, milk production, and cost efficiency in mind. For maximum productivity diets must be formulated differently depending on the growth rate, milk production, and <b>reproductive</b> <b>status</b> of each animal.|$|E
25|$|The size of {{the brown}} facial {{markings}} on the heads of females {{also serves as a}} visual cue for members of the colony and serves as a badge of higher ranking status and <b>reproductive</b> <b>status.</b> Females with larger brown facial markings also have larger ovaries. These visual cues help other wasps to not only determine if a wasp is of the same species, but also to determine what to do and how to distribute themselves around the nests.

Acts of aggressions are much more likely to be exhibited towards a female with these distinctive markings in order to maintain a control system within the nest.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{dairy farms}} divide the animals into {{different}} management units {{depending on their}} age, nutritional needs, <b>reproductive</b> <b>status,</b> and milk production status. The group of cows that are currently lactating, the milking herd, is often managed most intensively {{to make sure their}} diet and environmental conditions are conducive to producing as much high quality milk as possible. On some farms the milking herd is further divided into milking strings, which are groups of animals with different nutritional needs. The segment of the adult herd that are in the resting period before giving birth to their next calf are called dry cows because they are not being milked. All female animals that have yet to give birth to their first calf are called heifers. They will grow up {{to take the place of}} older animals in the milking herd and thus are sometimes generally referred to as the replacement herd.|$|E

500|$|Olfaction is {{particularly}} important to lemurs, except for the indri, which lacks most common lemur scent glands and has a greatly reduced olfactory region in the brain. Olfaction can communicate information about age, sex, <b>reproductive</b> <b>status,</b> as well as demarcate the boundaries of a territory. It is most useful for communication between animals that rarely encounter each other. Small, nocturnal lemurs mark their territories with urine, while the larger, diurnal species use scent glands located on various parts of their anatomy. The ring-tailed lemur engages in [...] "stink fights" [...] by rubbing its tail across scent glands on its wrists, and then flicking its tail at other male opponents. Some lemurs defecate in specific areas, otherwise known as latrine behavior. Although many animals exhibit this behavior, it is a rare trait among primates. Latrine behavior can represent territorial marking and aid in interspecies signaling.|$|E
500|$|Before a {{juvenile}} male leaves its mother's web, it builds a small sperm web {{on which it}} deposits its sperm from its gonads and then collects it back into each of its two palps (copulatory organs), because the gonads and palps are not internally connected. After it moults into its last instar, it sets off wandering to seek a female. The male spider does not eat during this period. How males find females is unclear, {{and it is possible}} they may balloon like juveniles. A Western Australian field study found that most males took 6 to 8 weeks to travel around [...] with occasional journeys of over , but that only around 11–13% successfully found a mate. They are attracted by pheromones, which are secreted by unmated sexually mature female redback spiders onto their webs and include a serine derivative (N-3-methylbutyryl-O-(S)-2-methylbutyryl-L-serine). This is thought to be the sole method by which males assess a female's <b>reproductive</b> <b>status,</b> and their courtship dismantles much of the pheremone-marked web.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{advent of}} {{democracy}} in South Africa in 1994 created a unique opportunity for new laws and policies to be passed. Today, a decade later, South African reproductive health policies and the laws that underwrite them {{are among the most}} progressive and comprehensive in {{the world in terms of}} the recognition that they give to human rights, including sexual and reproductive rights. This paper documents the changes in health policy and services that have occurred, focusing particularly on key areas of sexual and reproductive health: contraception, maternal health, termination of pregnancy, cervical and breast cancer, gender-based and sexual violence, HIV/ AIDS and sexually transmitted infections and infertility. Despite important advances, significant changes in women’s <b>reproductive</b> health <b>status</b> are difficult to discern, given the relatively short period of time and the multitude of complex factors that influence health, especially inequalities in socio-economic and gender status. Gaps remain in the implementation of reproductive health policies and in service delivery that need to be addressed in order for meaningful improvements in women’s <b>reproductive</b> health <b>status</b> to be achieved.

2500|$|Indiana bats feed {{exclusively}} on terrestrial and aquatic flying insects. The most common prey items taken by Indiana bats are moths (Lepidoptera), beetles (Coleoptera), and mosquitoes and midges (Diptera). Selection of prey {{depends largely on}} availability in the foraging habitat with diet varying seasonally, by <b>reproductive</b> <b>status</b> of females, and from night to night. In southern Michigan, Indiana bats primarily ate caddisflies (Trichoptera) and bees, wasps, and ants (Hymenoptera), {{in addition to the}} more common prey previously listed.

2500|$|Sexual {{activity}} of kangaroos consists of consort pairs. Oestrous females roam widely and {{attract the attention}} of males with conspicuous signals. A male will monitor a female and follow her every movement. He sniffs her urine to see if she is in oestrus, a process exhibiting the flehmen response. The male will then proceed to approach her slowly to avoid alarming her. [...] If the female does not run away, the male will continue by licking, pawing, and scratching her, and copulation will follow. After copulation is over, the male will move on to another female. Consort pairing may take several days and the copulation is also long. Thus, a consort pair is likely to {{attract the attention of}} a rival male. As larger males are tending bonds with females near oestrus, smaller males will tend to females that are farther from oestrus. Dominant males can avoid having to sort through females to determine their <b>reproductive</b> <b>status</b> by searching for tending bonds held by the largest male they can displace without a fight.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The <b>reproductive</b> health <b>status</b> of China's low-income urban {{women is}} {{believed}} to be poor. Therefore, understanding their reproductive history and needs and improving services provision is very important. However, few studies have been done to assess <b>reproductive</b> health <b>status,</b> knowledge and needs in this low-income population. The {{purpose of this study is}} to broadly assess reproductive and family planning history, knowledge and health needs among low income urban women with an aim to informing health services interventions. Methods 1642 low-income women age 18 – 49 from Haidian district, Beijing were selected. All were interviewed via a standardized questionnaire in 2006. Results Most women reported at least one pregnancy and delivery (97. 7 %, 98. 3 %). Deliveries in hospitals (97. 3 %) by medical personnel (98. 5 %) were commonplace, as was receipt of antenatal care (86. 0 %). Nearly half had at least one abortion, with most (56. 0 %) performed in district hospitals, by physicians (95. 6 %), and paid for out-of-pocket (64. 4 %). Almost all (97. 4 %) used contraception, typically IUDs or condoms. Reproductive knowledge was limited. Health needs emphasized by the participants included popularizing reproductive health information, being able to discuss their reproductive health concerns, free reproductive health insurance, examination and treatment. Conclusion Among poor urban women in Beijing, antenatal care and contraceptive use were common. However, abortions were also common. Knowledge about reproductive health was limited.
