40|$|Whether on land or at sea, border {{areas are}} not just sites of conflict. For the ethnically diverse {{communities}} who live {{at the margins of}} empires or nations, border crossing is a facet of everyday life. It may involve trade and smuggling, pillaging <b>raids,</b> <b>flight</b> from fighting or from the state, human trafficking, marriage, or family visits. These historical events and trends are often narrated within the confines of national histories. Yet they highlight the fuzziness of national boundaries and the importance of forms of social organization that cut across borders and unite individuals and communities that nations seek to separate and distinguish. Not only does the study of border areas and border crossings “rescue history from the nation,” to borrow from Prasenjit Duara (1995), but it also points out that the highly local can be transnational, and that apparently remote places can be linked to global currents of people, ideas, and commodities [...] ...|$|R

Subsequently, it was used operationally as part of [...] "Circuses" [...] against coastal targets and on 19 August in support of the Dieppe <b>Raid.</b> The <b>Flight</b> became No. 515 Squadron RAF on 1 October 1942, operations with [...] "Moonshine" [...] continuing until November 1942.|$|R
5000|$|... "This officer {{has taken}} part in thirty-five bombing <b>raids,</b> ten {{photographic}} <b>flights</b> and twenty-one reconnaissances, many at low altitudes. He is a most efficient and keen observer who has rendered as such most valuable service. Moreover, he is a bold and determined fighter when attacked, and has accounted for four enemy machines." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the Axis side, the Germans {{launched}} attacks at sea in {{the autumn}} and winter against British aircraft carriers and destroyers, sinking several including the carrier [...] {{with the loss of}} 519 lives. Action in the air began on [...] when the Luftwaffe launched air raids on British warships. There were various minor bombing <b>raids</b> and reconnaissance <b>flights</b> on both sides.|$|R
50|$|In July 1918, the {{squadron}} went to Capelle, Dunkirk, equipped with DH.9s for day-bombing operations against targets in North-West Belgium. In October 1918, it moved to Bisseghem, Belgium, and remained based {{there until the}} Armistice. During its service overseas {{the squadron}} made 59 successful bombing <b>raids,</b> 40 reconnaissance <b>flights,</b> two photographic flights, dropped approximately 70 tons of bombs, and shot down nine enemy aircraft (a further 20 were reported shot down, but were not confirmed).|$|R
50|$|On all {{occasions}} this N.C.O. observer {{has carried}} out his work conscientiously and well, notably when engaged on photographic service, obtaining excellent results often under very difficult conditions. Since joining his present squadron {{he has taken}} part in twenty-nine bombing <b>raids,</b> ten photographic <b>flights,</b> and fourteen reconnaissances, many at low altitudes. On four occasions he has encountered large formations of enemy aeroplanes, and has himself shot down out of control three machines.|$|R
50|$|In {{the liberation}} of Vienna by the Red Army, troops {{remained}} in the area occupied by the Volkssturm and SS Amtshaus from the fighting since the Volkssturm units during an air <b>raid</b> in the <b>flight</b> taken. On April 10, 1945, the Soviet army arrived in Margareten and installed in the Upper Amtshausgasse 3-5 (former employment), the Russian commander. Nevertheless, {{the majority of the}} roads after the war were impassable, and there was neither light nor gas. The public transport was decommissioned, and the parks were used as dumping sites for debris and garbage. Homelessness, disease, hunger and chaos dominated the immediate postwar period.|$|R
25|$|On 19 March 1940, Hampdens {{took part}} in the first {{deliberate}} bombing of German soil in a nighttime raid upon the seaplane hangars and slipways in Hörnum, Sylt. The type continued to operate at night on bombing <b>raids</b> over Germany. <b>Flight</b> Lieutenant Rod Learoyd of 49 Squadron, was awarded the Victoria Cross for the attack that he led on the Dortmund-Ems canal on 12 August 1940. On 25 August 1940, Hampdens from various squadrons participated on the RAF's first bombing raid on Berlin. Sergeant John Hannah was the wireless operator/air gunner of an 83 Squadron Hampden and was awarded the Victoria Cross on 15 September 1940, when he fought the flames of the burning aircraft, allowing the pilot to return it to base.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1940, {{an order}} was placed {{for a total}} of three Beaufighters {{converted}} to use the alternative Merlin engine. The Merlin engine installations and nacelles were designed by Rolls-Royce as a complete [...] "power egg" [...] unit; the design and approach of the Beaufighter's Merlin installation was later incorporated into the design for the much larger Avro Lancaster bomber. Success with the Merlin-equipped aircraft was expected to lead to production aircraft in 1941. In June 1940, the first Merlin-powered aircraft conducted its first flight. In late 1940, the two Merlin-equipped prototypes (the third having been destroyed in a bombing <b>raid),</b> were delivered. <b>Flight</b> tests found that the Merlins left the aircraft underpowered and gave a pronounced tendency to swing to port, making take-offs and landings difficult and resulting in a high accident rate — out of 337 Merlin-powered aircraft, 102 were lost to accidents.|$|R
5|$|More than 150,000 men {{turned out}} to join Legion units during the next week and began {{pursuing}} on Morgan's cavalrymen. Gen. Hobson and his men arrived in Corydon on July 10, after crossing the Ohio River from Kentucky. Although a Confederate victory, the Battle of Corydon had delayed Morgan by six crucial hours, allowing the pursuing Union army to begin closing the gap. Union cavalry numbering six thousand men were soon {{only a few miles}} behind him. Morgan briefly continued north and raided Salem. He then turned his east to Ohio as his <b>raid</b> turned into <b>flight</b> to escape. He was thwarted at the Battle of Buffington Island, where he tried to cross the Ohio River to safety. Only about 250 of his men were across the river, when Union gunboats brought his attempt to an end. Morgan was later captured at the Battle of Salineville, the furthest north regular Confederates ever reached.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 September 1939, {{after an}} early morning air <b>raid</b> alert, a <b>flight</b> of No. 56 Squadron Hawker Hurricanes took off from North Weald. These were {{followed}} by two reserve Hurricanes. The two reserves were identified as enemy aircraft and Spitfires from Hornchurch, among them 74 Squadron, were ordered to attack them. Both were shot down. One pilot, P/O Montague Hulton-Harrop was killed; the other pilot, Frank Rose, survived. The pilot who fired the fatal shots was 74 Squadron's John Freeborn. The exact {{story of what happened}} in this incident, which {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Battle of Barking Creek", may never be known. Even the origin of the name is obscure, as it did not take place above Barking Creek but near Ipswich, in Suffolk. This was the first RAF operational death of the war.At the subsequent courts martial, it was accepted that the entire incident was an unfortunate error.|$|R
5000|$|A {{particularly}} notable {{series of}} attacks caused the disabling and {{sinking of the}} Tirpitz. Tirpitz had been moved into a fjord in northern Norway where she threatened the Arctic convoys and was too far north to be attacked by air from the UK. She had already been damaged by an attack by Royal Navy midget submarines {{and a series of}} attacks from carrier-borne aircraft of the Fleet Air Arm, but both attacks had failed to sink her. The task was given to No. 9 and No. 617 Squadrons where they were deployed to Yagodnik, near Archangel a staging base in Russia to attack Tirpitz with Tallboy bombs. On 15 September 1944, the RAF bombers struck the battleship in the forecastle, which rendered her unseaworthy, so she was sent to the Tromsø fjord where temporary repairs were made so she was anchored as a floating battery. This fjord was in range of bombers operating from Scotland and from there, in October, she was attacked again, but cloud cover thwarted the attack. Finally on 12 November 1944, the two squadrons attacked Tirpitz. The first bombs missed their target, but following aircraft scored two direct hits in quick succession. Within ten minutes of the first bomb hitting the Tirpitz, she suffered a magazine explosion at her [...] "C" [...] turret and [...] killing 1,000 of her 1,700 crew. All three RAF attacks on Tirpitz were led by Wing Commander J. B. [...] "Willy" [...] Tait, who had succeeded Cheshire as CO of No. 617 Squadron in July 1944. Among those pilots participating in the <b>raids</b> was <b>Flight</b> Lieutenant John Leavitt, an American who piloted one of the 31 Lancasters. Leavitt's aircraft dropped one of the bombs that hit the Tirpitz dead centre. Despite both squadrons claiming that it was their bombs that actually sank the Tirpitz, it was the Tallboy bomb, dropped from a No. 9 Sqn Lancaster WS-Y (LM220) piloted by Flying Officer Dougie Tweddle that is attributed to the sinking of the warship. F/O Tweddle was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his part in the operations against the Tirpitz.|$|R
