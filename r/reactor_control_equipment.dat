40|$|Abstract. In {{the process}} of {{mechanical}} automation, due {{to the development of}} drive equipment in diversification, miniaturization, digitalization, intellectualization and the development of sensor in miniaturization, digitalization, visualization, on the one hand, automation mechanical structure become simple, on the other hand, with the increase of the dependence on <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> for automation machinery, an automated machinery needs many kinds of control mode and means to complete the production. With the improvement of mechanical motion complexity, there will appear accumulation phenomenon of <b>control</b> <b>equipment,</b> in addition, in order to complete the data transfer between all kinds of <b>control</b> <b>equipments,</b> each <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> need to build all kinds of communication protocol and special cables to connect. In order to solve the "accumulation" phenomenon, <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> manufacturers competing to launch the new scheme. In this paper, a control project based on the control products of Mitsubishi electric company was proposed, which illustrates the change of the control way of mechanical automation.
