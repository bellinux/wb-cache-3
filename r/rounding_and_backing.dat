50|$|A large {{traditional}} hand bookbinding studio or workshop may {{be divided}} into areas for different tasks such as sewing, <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> the spine, attaching the boards to the book and covering the book with cloth or leather. These processes are collectively called forwarding and would be {{carried out in the}} forwarding department. This area of the bindery would typically have equipment such as sewing frames, guillotines, board choppers for cutting boards used as covers, laying presses for holding books when being worked on and nipping presses for flattening paper, board, etc. Recently, some compact material have been developed, allowing the processing of almost all the operations.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the 15th century, swell in textblocks was accommodated, if it all, by {{shaping the}} wooden boards that formed a book's covers. The inner surface of each board would be lightly tapered along the spine edge, {{so that the}} removed wood created a space for the thicker paper along the sewn folds. By the 15th century, though, the process of <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> became common, and books were given their {{characteristic}} rounded spines and shoulders. This mushroom-like shape compensates for the swell of the book by using the extra thickness to create an extra surface against which the boards of the book can rest.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to evaluate the performance of rounded and backed books against books left square backed. The variables which are introduced into the study will enable the results to provide needed information on the performance of the many different binding constructions librarians and library binders are confronted with. <b>Rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> is an optional operation when binding a book, an operation which is sometimes by-passed on smaller books. A book that is not rounded and backed is square backed. It is suspected that <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> a book will indeed enhance its performance and durability, therefore guaranteeing more circulations and a longer life. The books were tested in the Dudley A. Weiss Book Testing Laboratory at Rochester Institute of Technology. The testing procedures used, the Tumble Tester and the Universal Book Tester, were designed to accelerate simulated book usage. During the destructive testing, visual observations were made at progressive time intervals {{to determine the effects of}} <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> versus square backed, thus answering all the questions stated in the objectives section in Chapter 2. Upon the completion of all testing, the observations were summarized to determine what effect <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> had on the performance of the books. Many very interesting observations were made. When <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> a book, the ridge that is formed when bending the pages or signatures over one-another, does indeed provide added support to the joint strength and the binding. However; to assure the best possible performance of a rounded and backed book, it is important that a uniform layer of joint adhesive is applied. A book lacking good joint adhesion will destruct much faster than a book guaranteed to have optimum joint adhesion, whether rounded and backed or square backed...|$|E

There was great excitement among the other Folk. They set up a wild chattering, that was loudest when Red-Eye was at a distance, and that hushed when the chase led him near. They were impotent onlookers. The females screeched and gibbered, and the males beat their chests in helpless rage. Big Face was especially angry, and though he hushed his racket when Red-Eye drew near, he did not hush it to the extent the others did.|$|R
40|$|Medieval and Historical Bindings in a Modern Design (Czech Republic) ' {{consists}} of twelve hand-bound volumes of varying sizes, nine {{of which were}} made especially for the exhibition in 2006. Commissioned by the Society for Czechoslovakian Bookbinders for the Lanskroun Castle Gallery and timed to open at the launch of its 5 th Annual conference, nine new volumes were exhibited with 3 earlier pieces, all exploring the efficacy of historic binding techniques for contemporary bound volumes. The binding of the volumes involved a number of research challenges and, in particular, to obviate the problem which occurs in single sheet binding. Single sheet bindings do not offer the opportunity of being sewn through the centre of a folded section and this can result in the swelling at {{the spine of the}} book. By adapting compression techniques from both English and German binding (medieval and later) the problem of swelling was resolved. A slight inner gutter bevel was seated again text thread swelling. The exhibition also contained examples of the <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> technique. This was particularly important in the medieval period and beyond for books that needed to be put on upright display or sacramental purposes or when they were being read either upright or opened flat. An example of the <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> technique in the exhibition was used to bind a copy of the King James’ Bible which the researcher decorated in gold tooled in Cambridge Panel Design. The exhibition also demonstrated the use of other historical materials and techniques recast into contemporary binding, all opening happily for reading. These included the use of transparent and veiled vellum, blind tooling and silk binding. After Lanksroun, the exhibition moved to The Museum of Book Binding at Lockett in the Czechoslovakian Republic. Three volumes were acquired by the Dodd Research Centre at the University of Connecticut, USA...|$|E
40|$|In {{analyzing}} {{and evaluating}} binding methods today, {{as well as}} projecting and forcasting for the future, let us first focus our attention {{on some of the}} significant changes and developments taking place in the industry. Within the last decade, mechanization and technological advancements have made impressive gains in updating library binding. All indications are that this is just the beginning, and that we are moving into an era of accelerated automation and development. Prior to this time, of course, steady progress was realized in binding technology, but it was in far more moderate degrees than what is being experienced now. The sewing machine formerly constituted one of the main mechanized functions, and could probably be considered the most sophisticated operation in the over-all binding process. Other essential but less complex machinery consisted of stamping and type setting equipment, cutting machines, semi-automatic <b>rounding</b> <b>and</b> <b>backing</b> equipment and book presses. These devices usually encompassed the full spectrum in a modern library binding operation. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E

50|$|For example, in many languages, {{including}} English, most front vowels are unrounded, {{while most}} back vowels are rounded.
