500|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} were mounted {{together on the}} swingarm {{in front of the}} pivot axle {{at the bottom of the}} spine frame. The near-horizontal engine and transmission together as a unit formed a [...] "power egg" [...] style which would later be used by Benelli and Motobi. The tubular swingarm also served as the exhaust pipe. Behind the pivot axle, the swingarm, the reinforced rear fender, and the supports for the rear carrier formed a triangular structure which supported the <b>rear</b> <b>spring.</b> This suspension system allowed a long suspension travel and a soft spring rate. Test rides on the complete prototype began in December 1947 and showed that the combination of long travel and soft springs needed damping. Friction dampers were added.|$|E
2500|$|Chassis {{preparation}} included heavy-duty {{front and}} rear springs (part of the factory's optional handling package), <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> traction control arms, heavy-duty shock absorbers and a [...] "panhard" [...] type track bar in the rear to eliminate side sway. Stock wheels and tires were replaced by wide magnesium racing wheels and Goodyear racing tires. The cars were aerodynamically modified: the front ends were lowered, the hoods were slanted down and spoilers were installed below the front bumpers. The car interiors had structure-stiffening roll cages for driver protection, a stock bucket seat modified for additional support, and supplementary engine-monitoring instruments.|$|E
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> assembly and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|E
50|$|The M-426 {{appeared}} in March 1967; like the delivery version, it had stiffer <b>rear</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Another version, the Type 17, {{was also}} produced. This used a 2550 mm (100.4 in) wheelbase. It shared its {{hexagonal}} radiator and <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> with the Type 15.|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} handling {{package was}} introduced in 1985 that incorporated a revised front sway bar, gas filled shock absorbers, and lower friction <b>rear</b> <b>springs.</b> A total of 17,814 Grand Wagoneers were built for 1985.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{suspension}} initially used quarter-elliptic <b>rear</b> <b>springs,</b> but buyers frequently squeezed four or {{five people}} into the nominally two-seater car, and in later models the chassis was extended at the rear to allow for more robust semi-elliptic springs.|$|R
5000|$|Detail changes. Power {{increased}} from 139 to [...] The rear suspension linkage and <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> rate were replaced, improving handling. Pillion grab rails were added, the gearboxes were made stronger, and new six-piston Tokico front calipers replaced the previous model's four-piston units. The {{weight of the}} bike increased to 241.7 kg.|$|E
50|$|The {{front and}} <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> {{rates have been}} increased, and the {{internal}} valving of the dampers revised. New front damper mounting brackets are fitted together with a softer front anti-roll bar. These changes, {{in combination with the}} revised wheel/tyre equipment, provide a nose down rake and slightly lowered ride height, and produce the driving characteristics described above.|$|E
50|$|The Austin was a brass era American {{automobile}} {{manufactured in}} Grand Rapids, Michigan from 1901 to 1921. The company, founded by James E. Austin {{and his son}} Walter Austin, built large, expensive and powerful touring cars with an unusual double cantilever <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> arrangement placing the rear wheels behind (sometimes well behind) the passenger compartment, for a longer wheelbase to improve rider comfort {{in an era of}} rough roads as well as a unique two-speed rear axle.|$|E
50|$|Although the sturdily {{constructed}} chassis {{was based}} on that from earlier Sunbeams, the hitherto characteristic semi-elliptical leaf springs were, at the back, replaced by cantilever <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> which {{during the second half}} of the decade became a Sunbeam hallmark.|$|R
50|$|The {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} used existing components, but with unique twin <b>rear</b> <b>springs</b> {{to give a}} 1.75-ton payload. Using standard One Ten axles (Dana-designed units built by Salisbury Engineering) led to stability problems, so bespoke units were used, being 12-inches (30 cm) wider than the standard ones.|$|R

50|$|An unadvertised at-cost option (#696) {{included}} upgraded {{springs and}} dampers, front anti-roll bars and rear-axle-rebound straps to prevent tuck-under. Aftermarket kits were also available, {{such as the}} EMPI Camber Compensator, for the knowledgeable owner. The suspension was modified for 1964 models, with inclusion of a standard front anti-roll bar and a transverse-mounted <b>rear</b> <b>spring.</b> In 1965, the totally redesigned four-link, fully independent rear suspension maintained a constant camber angle at the wheels. Corvairs from 1965 were not prone to the formerly characteristic tuck-under crashes.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} NSX body design {{received only}} minor modifications from Honda {{in the new}} millennium when in December 2001 the original pop-up headlamps were replaced with fixed xenon HID headlamp units, along with slightly wider rear tires to complement a revised suspension. Front spring rates were increased from 3.2 kg/m to 3.5 kg/m, <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> rates were increased from 3.8 kg/m to 4.0 kg/m and the diameter of the rear stabilizer bar increased from 17.5 mm to 19.1 mm with a 2.3 mm wall thickness.|$|E
50|$|Some inline {{blowback}} markers will leak {{air from}} the barrel when uncocked. The striker sits forward against the seal pin, causing the cup seal to open enough to leak {{air from the}} valve, which escapes out the barrel. Pull the charging handle or knob to pull back the striker and remove the pressure from the seal pin. However, during storage, you should always remove the air source and leave the marker uncocked. The <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> can be damaged if stored {{a long time in}} a cocked position.|$|E
50|$|Neither AJS or Matchless {{opted for}} plunger type <b>rear</b> <b>springing,</b> and the Model 16 {{retained}} a rigid rear frame until 1949, when pivoted rear suspension controlled by hydraulically dampened spring units designed and made by Matchless became available. The difference was {{indicated by the}} S (for springer) designation.|$|R
50|$|When first {{introduced}} into service, the Mitsubishi Shogun was operating above the vehicle maximum plated axle weight.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the difference in powertrain with the Y34 Cedric/Gloria, the Y34 M45 has a completely different instrument panel design, similar to the F50 Q45. Other differences includes a completely different rear multi-link suspension design. The Y34 Cedric/Gloria's rear multi-link suspension design is similar to Z32 300ZX, and S14/S15 Silvia/200SX/240SX where the <b>rear</b> <b>spring</b> is mounted on the strut. The rear suspension design on the Y34 M45 {{is very much like}} the rear suspension design on the Z33 350Z, where the spring is mounted independent of the shock/strut, and sits directly on the lower arm, in a spring cup.|$|E
