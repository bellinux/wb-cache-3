5|$|The {{boundary}} of the eastern Languedoc with the Southern Rhône Valley wine region was moved slightly in 2004, {{with the result that}} Costières de Nîmes AOC is now a Rhône appellation rather than a Languedoc one. In that year, INAO moved the responsibility for oversight of this appellation's wine to the regional committee of the Rhône valley. Local producers of Côtes du Rhône-styled wines made from Syrah and Grenache lobbied for this change since the local winemaking traditions did not coincide with administrative borders, and presumably due to the greater prestige of <b>Rhône</b> <b>wines</b> in the marketplace. Such changes of borders between wine regions are very rare, so out of habit, Costières de Nîmes remains listed as a Languedoc wine in many publications.|$|E
2500|$|Though Grenache is {{most often}} {{encountered}} in blended wines (such as the <b>Rhone</b> <b>wines</b> or GSM blends), varietal examples of Grenache do exist. As a blending component, Grenache is valued for the added body and fruitiness that it brings without added tannins. As a varietal, the grape's naturally low concentration of phenolics contribute to its pale color and lack of extract but viticultural practices and low yields can increase the concentrations of phenolic compounds. Grenache-based wines tend {{to be made for}} early consumption with its propensity for oxidation make it a poor candidate for long-term aging. However, producers (such as some examples from Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Priorat) who use low yields grown on poor soils can produce dense, concentrated wines that can benefit from cellaring. The fortified vin doux naturels of France and Australian [...] "port-style" [...] wines are protected from Grenache's propensity for oxidation by the fortification process and can usually be drinkable for two or three decades.|$|E
2500|$|The 1986 {{planting}} of Syrah was particularly {{significant in the}} history of Washington wine as it was the first {{planting of}} a variety that would go on to have much success in the state wine industry. At the urging of David Lake, Mike Sauer received several cuttings from Joseph Phelps Winery, one of the original California Rhone Rangers, and planted them. As a Master of Wine, David Lake had vast knowledge about the growing conditions of many notable wine regions and saw similarities between the hot, steep south-facing slopes of Red Willows and those of the Hermitage and Côte-Rôtie AOC in the northern Rhône Valley. Red Willow, in particular, reminded Lake of the La Chapelle vineyard in Hermitage that belongs to Jaboulet. David Lake and several cellar workers from Columbia came to Red Willow to assist in the planting of the first Syrah vines. Amidst the vines the crew buried several bottles of Hermitage, Côte-Rôtie and other <b>Rhone</b> <b>wines</b> to [...] "inspire" [...] the Syrah vines.|$|E

2500|$|In Spain, {{there are}} monovarietal wines made of Garnacha tinta (red Grenache), {{notably in the}} {{southern}} Aragon wine regions of Calatayud, Carinena and Campo de Borja, {{but it is also}} used in blends, as in some Rioja wines with tempranillo. Grenache is the dominant variety in most Southern <b>Rhône</b> <b>wines,</b> especially in Châteauneuf-du-Pape where it is typically over 80% of the blend. In Australia it is typically blended in [...] "GSM" [...] blends with Syrah (commonly known as Shiraz in that country) and Mourvèdre with old vine examples in McLaren Vale. In Italy, the Sardinian D.O.C. wine Cannonau di Sardegna is by law 99% local Grenache (Cannonau). Grenache is also used to make rosé wines in France and Spain, notably those of the Tavel district in the Côtes du Rhône and those of the Navarra region. And the high sugar levels of Grenache have led to extensive use in fortified wines, including the red vins doux naturels of Roussillon such as Banyuls, and as the basis of most Australian fortified wine.|$|E
60|$|And, after all, the Parliament {{changed his}} {{sentence}} {{into one of}} banishment; and to Roussillon, in Dauphiny, our poet must carry his woes without delay. Travellers between Lyons and Marseilles may remember a station on the line, some way below Vienne, where the Rhone fleets seaward between vine-clad hills. This was Villon's Siberia. It {{would be a little}} warm in summer perhaps, and a little cold in winter in that draughty valley between two great mountain fields; but what with the hills, and the racing river, and the fiery <b>Rhone</b> <b>wines,</b> he was little to be pitied on the conditions of his exile. Villon, in a remarkably bad ballad, written in a breath, heartily thanked and fulsomely belauded the Parliament; the ENVOI, like the proverbial postscript of a lady's letter, containing the pith of his performance in a request for three days' delay to settle his affairs and bid his friends farewell. He was probably not followed out of Paris, like Antoine Fradin, the popular preacher, another exile of a few years later, by weeping multitudes; (1) but I daresay one or two rogues of his acquaintance would keep him company for a mile or so on the south road, and drink a bottle with him before they turned. For banished people, in those days, seem to have set out on their own responsibility, in their own guard, and at their own expense. It was no joke to make one's way from Paris to Roussillon alone and penniless in the fifteenth century. Villon says he left a rag of his tails on every bush. Indeed, he must have had many a weary tramp, many a slender meal, and many a to-do with blustering captains of the Ordonnance. But with one of his light fingers, we may fancy that he took as good as he gave; for every rag of his tail, he would manage to indemnify himself upon the population in the shape of food, or wine, or ringing money; and his route would be traceable across France and Burgundy by housewives and inn-keepers lamenting over petty thefts, like the track of a single human locust. A strange figure he must have cut {{in the eyes of the}} good country people: this ragged, blackguard city poet, with a smack of the Paris student, and a smack of the Paris street arab, posting along the highways, in rain or sun, among the green fields and vineyards. For himself, he had no taste for rural loveliness; green fields and vineyards would be mighty indifferent to Master Francis; but he would often have his tongue in his cheek at the simplicity of rustic dupes, and often, at city gates, he might stop to contemplate the gibbet with its swinging bodies, and hug himself on his escape.|$|E

50|$|For {{most of the}} 20th {{century before}} the early 1970s, the only {{northern}} Rhône wine well-known far from the region was Hermitage, and there was little demand on the export market for <b>Rhône</b> <b>wines.</b> Producing wine from hillside vineyards requires more labour than on flat vineyards, and is therefore economically difficult when demand and prices are low. This was particularly felt by some Rhône appellations in the early post-World War II era, including Condrieu and its neighbour Côte-Rôtie, with the 1950s and 1960s a particularly difficult time. <b>Rhône</b> <b>wines</b> in general started to be more in demand from the early 1970s, and stronger so from the late 1970s/early 1980s. From this time, the négociant business of Marcel Guigal at Ampuis was important in expanding the market for Condrieu wines. Guigal primarily made his name with his Côte-Rôtie wines which then {{paved the way for}} his bottlings from other appellations, which also includes a significant portion of white wine.
