This ability is due to the broadband sweep of the signal, which allows for better resolution of the time delay between the call and the returning echo, thereby improving the cross correlation of the two. Additionally, if harmonic frequencies are added to the FM signal, then this localization becomes even more precise.|$|E

40|$|The Eyesafe Ladar Test-bed (ELT) is a {{experimental}} ladar {{system with}} the capability of digitizing return laser pulse waveforms at 2 GHz. These waveforms can then be exploited o-line in the laboratory to develop signal processing techniques for noise reduction, range resolution improvement, and <b>range</b> <b>discrimination</b> between two surfaces of similar range interrogated by a single laser pulse. This paper {{presents the results of}} experiments with new deconvolution algorithms with the hoped for gains of improving the <b>range</b> <b>discrimination</b> of the ladar system. The sparsity of ladar returns is exploited to solve the deconvolution problem in two steps. The rst step is to estimate a point target response using a database of measured calibration data. This basic target response is used to construct a dictionary of target responses with dierent delays/ranges. Using this dictionary ladar returns {{from a wide variety of}} surface congurations can be synthesized by taking linear combinations. A sparse linear combination matches the physical reality that ladar returns consist of the overlapping of only a few pulses. The dictionary construction process is a pre-processing step that is performed only once. The deconvolution step is performed by minimizing the error between the measured ladar return and the dictionary model while constraining the coecient vector to be sparse. Other constraints such as the non-negativity of the coecients are also applied. The results of the proposed technique are presented in the paper and are shown to compare favorably with previously investigated deconvolution techniques...|$|E

A line of these early warning stations across the north of Canada is visualized to relieve the load on the main defenence system.

Coherent pulse and integration techniques are used to distinguish moving targets from permanent echoes. The antenna pattern is 100 in azimuth and cosecant to 40, 000 ft.

40|$|Abstract—Conically {{scanning}} pencil-beam scatterometer systems, such as {{the recently}} launched SeaWinds radar, constitute an important class of instruments for spaceborne climate observation. In addition to ocean winds, scatterometer data are being applied {{to a wide range}} of land and cryospheric applications. A key issue for future scatterometer missions is improved spatial resolution. Pencil-beam scatterometers to date have been real-aperture systems where only <b>range</b> <b>discrimination</b> is used, resulting in a relatively coarse resolution of approximately 25 km. In this paper, the addition of Doppler discrimination techniques is proposed to meet the need for higher resolution. Here, the unique issues associated with the simultaneous application of range and Doppler processing to a conically scanning radar are addressed, and expressions for the theoretical measurement performance of such a system are derived. Important differences with side-looking imaging radars, which also may employ Doppler techniques, are highlighted. Conceptual design examples based on scatterometer missions of current interest are provided to illustrate this new high-resolution scatterometer approach. It is shown that spatial resolution of pencil-beam scatterometer systems can be improved by an order of magnitude by utilizing combined range/Doppler discrimination techniques, while maintaining the wide-swath and constant incidence angle neaaaaeded for many geophysical measurements.

Oligonucle otide probes are synthesized in situ via a light- activated process within the channels of a three-dimensional microfluidic reaction carrier. Arrays {{can be designed}} and produced within hours according to the user’s requirements. They are processed in a fully automatic workflow. We have characterized this new platform with regard to dynamic <b>range,</b> <b>discrimination</b> power, reproducibility and accuracy of biological results. The instrument detects sample RNAs present at a frequency of 1 : 100 000. Detection is quantitative over more than two orders of magnitude. Experiments on four identical arrays with 6398 features each revealed a mean coefficient of variation (CV) value of 0. 09 for the 6398 unprocessed raw intensities indicating high reproducibility. In a more elaborate experiment targeting 1125 yeast genes from an unbiased selection, a mean CV of 0. 11 on the fold change level was found.

40|$|In humans, {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made to link spatial changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral density, connectivity strength, and phase-amplitude modulation to neurological, physiological, and psychological correlates. In contrast, standard rodent EEG techniques employ only few electrodes, which results in poor spatial resolution. Recently, a technique was developed to overcome this limitation in mice. This technique was based on a polyimide-based microelectrode (PBM) array applied on the mouse skull, maintaining a significant number of electrodes with consistent contact, electrode impedance, and mechanical stability. The present study built on this technique by extending it to rats. Therefore, a similar PBM array, but adapted to rats, was designed and fabricated. In addition, this array was connected to a wireless EEG headstage, allowing recording in untethered, freely moving rats. The advantage of a high-density array relies {{on the assumption that the}} signal recorded from the different electrodes is generated from distinct sources, i. e., not volume-conducted. Therefore, the utility and validity of the array were evaluated by determining the level of synchrony between channels due to true synchrony or volume conduction during basal vigilance states and following a subanesthetic dose of ketamine. Although the PBM array allowed recording with high signal quality, under both drug and drug-free conditions, high synchronization existed due to volume conduction between the electrodes even in the higher spectral frequency <b>range.</b> <b>Discrimination</b> existed only between frontally and centrally/distally grouped electrode pairs. Therefore, caution should be used in interpreting spatial data obtained from high-density PBM arrays in rodents...|$|E
40|$|Behavioural {{experiments}} using {{a variety}} of experimental situations (Figs. 1, 3, 6, 7, 9) were conducted to investigate the visual cues which bees use in the task of object-ground discrimination. The bees 2 ̆ 7 flight and landing behaviour was video-filmed throughout the experiments. The evaluation of the video data shows that bees trained to find a randomly textured figure raised above a similarly textured ground land mainly on the boundaries of the figure, facing its inner surface (Fig. 2 a, b). Bees can also be trained to find a 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 hole 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7, i. e. a low texture viewed through a window cut in a raised texture, but these bees are not attracted to the edges of the hole (Fig. 5 a, b). Bees trained to a single edge between a low and a raised random texture land at the edge mainly facing the raised side (Table 1). Bees approaching the edge from the high side cross the edge in most cases without landing on it (Table 1). Bees trained to an edge between 2 striped patterns, one raised above the other, again land on the edge facing the raised pattern, regardless of whether the stripes on the 2 patterns run parallel or perpendicular to each other or to the edge (Fig. 8). In this case, the bees acquire range information by flying in oblique directions with respect to the orientation of the stripes (Fig. 10). All of the results suggest that the edge elicits landings when the bee perceives a local increase in the speed of image motion, signalling an abrupt decrease in range. This is corroborated by the results of further experiments in which artificial motion was used to simulate range differences between the two sides of an edge (Table 2). We conclude that image speed is a powerful cue in <b>range</b> <b>discrimination</b> as well as object detection...|$|E
