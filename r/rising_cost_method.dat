50|$|In the past, {{the price}} of oil has led to {{economic}} recessions, such as the 1973 and 1979 energy crises. The effect {{the price of}} oil has on an economy is known as a price shock. In many European countries, which have high taxes on fuels, such price shocks could potentially be mitigated somewhat by temporarily or permanently suspending the taxes as fuel <b>costs</b> <b>rise.</b> This <b>method</b> of softening price shocks is less useful in countries with much lower gas taxes, such as the United States. A baseline scenario for a recent IMF paper found oil production growing at 0.8% (as opposed to a historical average of 1.8%) would result in a small reduction in economic growth of 0.2-0.4%.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{objective was to}} examine how companies classify the calculation {{of the cost of}} production and how the company in the sale price of the product. Analysis techniques in this study is to use the full <b>costing</b> <b>method,</b> because the full <b>costing</b> <b>method</b> is the determination of the cost of a product that takes into account all elements of production cost, which includes the cost of raw materials, direct labor costs, factory overhead and variable factory overhead costs remain. The results of the analysis is the determination of prices by the owner is too high compared to that determined by the researcher. Differences are in because there is a fee beyond the cost of production by firms included in the cost of production as a result the cost of production increases. Along with the <b>rising</b> <b>cost</b> of production of the product sales price also rises...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposal}} {{and management}} of solid wastes are ancient problems. The evolution of practices naturally changed as populations grew and sites for disposal became less acceptable. The central search was for easy disposal at minimum <b>costs.</b> The <b>methods</b> changed from indiscriminate dumping to sanitary landfill, feeding to swine, reduction, incineration, and various forms of re-use and recycling.

Markets for salvage vary widely or disappear completely. The search for conserving materials and energy at minimum cost must go on forever. Winston Churchill once remarked, in a speech at M. I. T. (1949), that our problem in public affairs is "to discipline an array of gigantic and turbulent facts. " This well characterizes the solid waste challenge. As others have already noted at this session, and need not be repeated here, we have a "gigantic " accumulation of solid wastes and an equivalent collection of real and imaginary facts. Of real data, we are always in short supply when we attempt to convert principles into reality. The Not-So-Distant Past Before recklessly prophesying the future, {{a look at the}} past is relevant. It is a cliche to assert that those who ignore the past are destined to repeat its mistakes. It should disclose practices now rediscovered, list reasons for failure, and seek to do better in resurrecting them. Diagnoses of failure, theoretically, should provide wiser therapies than those of decades ago. Recycling and re-use are new names for old wines figuratively in new returnable bottles. Their fate is here examined. Solid wastes were once described as "'matter in the wrong place. " This definition implicitly recognizes that such wastes are really never disposed of. They are converted into something else, which ultimately must be taken care of. The materials which concern us have a wide spectrum of hazard-fro...|$|R
40|$|Background: In Switzerland the aim {{of health}} {{insurance}} (LAMaI) is to control <b>rising</b> health <b>costs.</b> One <b>method</b> is to institute a prospective payment system (DRGs) for all Swiss hospitals in 2012, according to which hospital funding will be based only on medical and administrative data. Question: What is the contribution of nursing {{to the analysis of}} hospital stays? Method: On the basis of aIl patient hospital stays in the CHUV (Lausanne) during 2005 and 2006, we have compared a medico-administrative data model and a nursing data model. We used a logistic regression on the probability of patient exit. Results: The capacity of discrimination of the model is appreciably improved since the surface under curve O. C. R. passes from 0. 712 with the casemix data and the rang of day to 0. 785 if it's adds data on heaviness of care (pseudo R² respectively 0. 096 and 0. 152). Discussion: This approach provides evidence on the feasibility of using standards of care pathway allowing managers to analyse the organisation of patient care and securing a better estimate of hospital funding...|$|R
