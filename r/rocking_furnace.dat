50|$|For {{both the}} {{practical}} application and {{scientific study of}} chalcogenide glasses, glass purity is of utmost importance. Varying levels of trace impurities, even at levels of a few parts per million can alter the spectroscopic behavior of a glass. Similarly, impurities are a major concern for optical components. Impurities in the raw materials and hence in the resulting glass, contribute {{to the loss of}} power through an optical component, whether it {{is in the form of}} a long glass fiber or an infrared window. These impurities contribute to the optical loss through absorption and scattering as well as serving as nucleation sites for crystallization.Although high purity raw elements are now commercially available, with 99.9999% purity routine for many metals, even this level of purity is often not sufficient, particularly for optical fiber applications.More of a concern are commercially available chalcogenide compounds such as germanium sulfide, gallium sulfide or arsenic sulfide. Although these may have been synthesized from high purity elements, the conversion process itself can readily introduce oxide, water or organic impurities. It is not unheard of to find for example, commercial gallium sulphide contaminated with 45% or more gallium oxide through incomplete reaction of the precursors during production.The conventional method for producing chalcogenide glasses is through the use of sealed ampoule melting. In this technique the required glass precursor materials are sealed under vacuum in a silica ampoule, melted, and then quenched to form a glass within the ampoule. The requirement for the sealed atmosphere is dictated by the volatile nature of many of the precursors which if melted in open atmosphere can result in large compositional changes or complete removal of components with low vapour pressures. This process also has the effect of trapping any impurities in the precursors within the glass as thus the precursor purity limitsthe ultimate quality of the glass that is produced. In addition, impurities can be transferred to the glass from the ampoule walls.The closed nature of the process leads to tightly controlled quality. In addition to the open and closed systems for glass melting,chalcogenide chemical vapour deposition is emerging as a method to produce high quality chalcogenide glass, in both thin film and bulk glass form. Gallium lanthanum sulfide glasses use essentially non-volatile components La2S3, La2O3 and Ga2S3 to form the basic glass with glass modifiers added as needed. This allows melting in an open atmosphere, under a flowing inert gas, typically argon. Batches of the compounds are prepared in a nitrogen-purged glovebox, placed in a vitreous carbon crucible and transferred to a silica tube furnace in a sealed vessel. Melting is typically at 1150 °C for 24 hours. The molten gallium sulfides fluxed the lanthanum compounds and incorporated them into the melt at temperatures much lower than their respective melting points. The viscosity of the melt is low enough, at approximately 1 poise to allow full mixing without the need for a <b>rocking</b> <b>furnace</b> which is required for melting in an ampoule. The melt is normally quenched to glass by pushing it into a water cooled jacket. An advantage of melting in an open atmosphere is the ability of volatile impurities to boil off and be carried away, a significant advantage over sealed systems. For example, no SH- impurity is observed in the absorption spectra of Ga-La-S glasses, compared to very significant quantities in sulphide glasses melted by the sealed ampoule technique.|$|E

40|$|Petrology is {{the science}} of rocks. Geologists map rocks in the field, and bring selected. samples back to the {{laboratory}} for detailed petrographic analysis, mineralogical study and chemical analysis. On {{the basis of these}} studies, existing hypotheses for the origin of the rocks are tested, or new hypotheses are erected. From examination of the rocks in field and laboratory, geologists then attempt to deduce their histories. Experimental petrology involves further laboratory experiments which reproduce the conditions within the Earth during the generation and evolution of a rock or rock suite. This involves subjecting minerals and rocks, or their synthetic equivalents, to high pressures and temperatures under varied but precisely controlled conditions. Determination of the reactions which occur under the known conditions in the laboratory provides calibrations for the processes involved in formation of the rocks in nature, defining the actual conditions, and facilitating selection among competing hypotheses of origin. Furthermore, exploration of reactions under various conditions within the laboratory may reveal processes operating within the Earth which were previously unsuspected Experimental petrology had its beginnings in adventurous experiments on minerals and <b>rocks</b> using <b>furnaces</b> or cannon barrels. It became a force in Earth sciences starting in the early 1900 s with the systematic determination of high-temperature phase equilibria involving the crystallisation of synthetic silicate liquids, which included representatives of the common rock-forming minerals. These investigations brought the rigour of thermodynamics to the processes of partial melting of rocks and the crystallisation of magmas, and elucidated many problems in igneous petrology. Only in the 1950 s did phase equilibrium experiments with simultaneously maintained high temperatures and pressures become routine. At first the experiments reproduced conditions only within the continental crust, then during the 1960 s the experimental range was extended to high-pressure conditions within the mantle, equivalent to about 100 km depth. During the 1980 s one type of large-volume apparatus reproduced conditions down to 650 km in the Earth, and a miniature device has reproduced conditions corresponding to 2000 km depth, not far short of the mantle-core boundary of the Earth. The equipment mentioned above is static, with samples being held at constant pressure and temperature as reactions occur in the samples. A dynamic experimental approach reproduces conditions to the centre of the Earth; a sample is shattered by the passage of a shock wave, and its properties under extremely high pressures are measured during the last nanoseconds before its destruction...|$|R
40|$|Interbasin {{flow in the}} Great Basin {{has been}} {{established}} by scientific studies during the past century. While not occurring uniformly between all basins, its occurrence is common and {{is a function of}} the hydraulic gradient between basins and hydraulic conductivity of the intervening <b>rocks.</b> The <b>Furnace</b> Creek springs in Death Valley, California are an example of large volume springs that are widely accepted as being the discharge points of regional interbasin flow. The flow path has been interpreted historically to be through consolidated Paleozoic carbonate rocks in the southern Funeral Mountains. This work reviews the preponderance of evidence supporting the concept of interbasin flow in the Death Valley region and the Great Basin and addresses the conceptual model of pluvial and recent recharge [Nelson, S. T., Anderson, K., Mayo, A. L., 2004. Testing the interbasin flow hypothesis at Death Valley, California. EOS 85, 349; Anderson, K., Nelson, S., Mayo, A., Tingey, D., 2006. Interbasin flow revisited: the contribution of local recharge to high-discharge springs, Death Valley, California. Journal of Hydrology 323, 276 – 302] as the source of the Furnace Creek springs. We find that there is insufficient modern recharge and insufficient storage potential and permeability within the basin-fill units in the Furnace Creek basin for these to serve as a local aquifer. Further, the lack of high sulfate content in the spring waters argues against significant flow through basin-fill sediments and instead suggests flow through underlying consolidated carbonate rocks. The maximum temperature of the spring discharge appears to require deep circulation through consolidated rocks; the Tertiary basin fill is of insufficient thickness to generate such temperatures as a result of local fluid circulation. Finally, the stable isotope data and chemical mass balance modeling actually support the interbasin flow conceptual model rather than the alternative presented in Nelson et al. [Nelson, S. T., Anderson, K., Mayo, A. L., 2004. Testing the interbasin flow hypothesis at Death Valley, California. EOS 85, 349] and Anderson et al. [Anderson, K., Nelson, S., Mayo, A., Tingey, D., 2006. Interbasin flow revisited: the contribution of local recharge to high-discharge springs, Death Valley, California. Journal of Hydrology 323, 276 – 302]. In light of these inconsistencies, interbasin flow is the only readily apparent explanation for the large spring discharges at Furnace Creek and, in our view, is the likely explanation for most large volume, low elevation springs in the Great Basin. An understanding of hydrogeologic processes that control the rate and direction of ground-water flow in eastern and central Nevada is necessary component of regional water-resource planning and management of alluvial and bedrock aquifers...|$|R
40|$|Chalcogenide glasses {{have several}} {{potential}} uses for new photonic devices for two reasons: i) their infrared (IR) transparency and ii) viscous flow {{at the glass}} transition temperature (Tg). Because of the latter, these glasses can be drawn to optical fibre and polished glass discs can be patterned above Tg for instance as planar waveguides. The fibre or waveguide shaped chalcogenide glasses have several potential uses as chemical sensors, biosensors, laser power delivery etc. and hence efforts {{have been made to}} synthesise high optical quality chalcogenide glasses. The well-established melt-quenching method was used as a comparative to prepare chalcogenide glass-melts in this project. Conventionally, the chalcogenide glass-melts are prepared using a <b>rocking</b> resistance <b>furnace</b> but this process is very long and cumbersome. To make the glass-melting process fast, simple and cost effective microwave heating was investigated instead in this project, and this was the main aim of the project. As 2 S 3,Ge 33 As 12 Se 55, Te 20 As 30 Se 50 glasses were made with partial success and As 2 S 3, Gel 7 As 18 Se 65 glasses successfully, {{for the first time to}} the author's knowledge, through microwave heating in a domestic microwave oven (DMO) working at a frequency 2. 45 GHz in less than an hour while the resistance heating method took about 1. 5 days. The DMO output power was 800 W or 1000 W, and co-heating using both the microwaves and convection current heating to 220 °C enabled some glass preparations to be carried out in ca. 10 minutes. The reactants were crushed manually for the DMO preparation of chalcogenide products keeping in mind that electric current tends to flow at the surface of the material which is known as 'skin effect'. The size of the silica glass melt-ampoule was kept as small as possible (normally - 10 cm) so that the DMO chalcogenide-melt could collect at the bottom of the ampoule and form a DMO chalcogenide rod product. The increased rate of reaction in the DMO compared to the rate of reaction in the <b>rocking</b> resistance <b>furnace</b> was attributed to the formation of plasma which caused a very high temperature (> 1000 °C) of the reaction system leading to the almost instant melting of the some reactants. The boiling DMO chalcogenide-melt was seen in several cases but As/S = 2 : 3 (at%) did not boil when exposed to microwaves. Visually homogenous DMO chalcogenide-products were formed in each of the above stated compositions except in the case of DMO As-S product when four distinct layers could be seen. The red transparent portion of the DMO As-S sample was X-ray amorphous and showed no crystal feature in SAED (Selected area electron diffraction) using TEM (Transmission electron microscopy) whereas the non-glassy portion showed some crystalline peaks in XRD (X-ray diffraction) but showed no crystalline features in SAED. The DMO Ge/As/Se= 33 / 12 / 55 (at%) rod product showed a single crystalline peak in the XRD pattern but it was completely amorphous according to SAED. On the other hand, the DMO Te/As/Se = 20 / 30 / 50 (at %) rod product showed slight evidence of crystallinity from SAED but was completely amorphous in XRD. DMO As/Se = 40 / 60 (at %) rod product and DMO Ge/As/Se= 17 / 18 / 65 (at %) rod did not show any crystalline structure from XRD and from SAED. The inhomogeneity of the DMO As-S glass was further reflected in the multiple Tgs observed using DTA (Differential thermal analysis) viz. : 166 °C, - 194 °C (broad) and 300 °C in the first DTA run. Though, the sample showed a single Tg value of 202 °C during the second DTA run after quenching in-situ the sample from the first DTA run. The stoichiometry of this glass wasAs 43. 9 Se 56. 1 when observed through EDX (Energy dispersive X-ray analysis) which was performed using ESEM (Environmental scanning electron microscopy) showing that the glass was inhomogeneous. The DMO As/Se = 2 : 3 (at %) rod product showed a single Tg value of 180 °C ± 5 °C and the stoichiometry was found to be As 40. 1 Se 59. 9 from EDX analysis which was very close to the desired value. The DMO rod product obtained from the composition Ge/As/Se = 17 / 18 / 65 showed a single Tg value of 246 °C ± 5 °C and the observed stoichiometry of the DMO chalcogenide product was Gel 7. 6 As 19. 2 Se 63. 5. Whereas the Ge 32. 8 As 11. 0 Se 56. 4 DMO rod product could be made from the batch composition Ge/As/Se= 33 / 12 / 55 with a Tg value of 368 °C ± 5 °C but the conventionally prepared glass exhibited a stoichiometry Ge 33. 8 As 12. 5 Se 50. 6 with Tg value 371 DC± 5 °C showing that a slight increase in percentage of germanium in the glass composition increases the Tg value. The Te 19. 6 As 30. 4 Se 50. 0 DMO rod product was obtained from Te/As/Se = 30 / 20 / 50 batch composition having a Tg value of 371 °C ± 5 °C showing that the experimental values for the stoichiometry and Tg of the product were very close to the desired value. A sample of Te/As/Se = 20 / 30 / 50 was heated in the DMO only for 5 minutes when stoichiometry of the product was found to be Te 19. 6 As 32. 6 Se 47. 8 showing that prolonged exposure of microwaves, which facilitated boiling, was important for homogenisation of the product (note that DMO As-S product never boiled) since the ampoule was not rocked inside the DMO. It was observed that optical absorption at 2. 9 urn wavelengths due to hydroxide contamination for the DMO As-S product was reduced to - 3 % of that of the AS 2 S 3 glass made through conventional heating. The absorption bands for -OH group at 2. 9 urn and H 20 at 6. 3 mum were very low in almost all the DMO products. Some carbon and silica contamination was found to be slightly larger in DMO products than that present in the conventionally prepared products and the reasons for this are not known at present. The DMO chalcogenide products were obtained reproducibly except in the cases of the DMO As-S product. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

To evaluate the effects of aggregate and emulsion types on aggregate loss performance of seal coat, three emulsions and eight aggregates including CRS- 2 P, RS- 2 P, and AE- 90 S for emulsions and Trap <b>Rock,</b> Sandstone, Blast <b>Furnace</b> Slag, Steel Slag, Limestone, Dolomite, Crushed Gravel (one face), and Crushed Gravel (two faces) were tested utilizing the sweep test and Vialit test. In addition, to explore influential factors (i. e., electrical surface charge interaction, water evaporation change in emulsion, water affinity of aggregate, etc.), the Zeta potential, water content, and X-ray deflection (XRD) tests were also conducted. According to the Zeta potential test results, the electrical surface charge of an aggregate in emulsions varies {{with the type of}} emulsion (i. e., with the pH of the emulsifier). From the water content test, among the emulsions, CRS- 2 P was the earliest emulsion to have enough bond strength to retain aggregates in open traffic. In addition, aggregate can retard the water evaporation process of emulsions. Based on the XRD test results, Sandstone and Dolomite have the highest and smallest content of SiO 2, respectively among the eight aggregates. This means that Sandstone and Limestone have the highest and lowest water affinity (hydrophilic and hydrophobic), respectively. In the sweep test with Limestone with various curing time, CRS- 2 P showed superior aggregate loss performance among the emulsions. Comparing the sweep test results to the water contents of emulsions, faster water evaporation presented better aggregate loss performance. This finding indicates that the bond strength of emulsion to retain aggregate can be mainly a function of water evaporation in emulsion. Based on the sweep test at 77 ˚F after 24 hours of curing, CRS- 2 P performed the best regardless of aggregate type. The Vialit test at a temperature range of 35 °F to - 22 F° after 24 hours of curing shows the most aggregate loss at lower testing temperatures. AE- 90 S had the strongest resistance in losing aggregate among the three emulsions at lower temperatures, which is an opposite trend comparing to the sweep test results. Also, Crushed Gravel with two faces outperformed Crushed Gravbel with one face. According to statistical analysis results, it was concluded that AE- 90 S and Crushed Gravel with two faces showed the best performance among the emulsions and aggregates, respectively. In addition the best-performing aggregate-emulsion combinations were AE- 90 S with most of the aggregates, except for Steel Slag. Thus, the aggregate type in terms of mineral/chemical composition is not a major factor affecting the aggregate loss performance. To develop a seal coat design, seal coat performance was evaluated for various emulsion (EAR) and aggregate application rates (AAR) by using three different evaluation methods: the IRI, friction, and visual inspection. Based on these performance tests, immediate failure occurring locally during construction due to incorrect application rate (e. g., insufficient aggregate rate) can cause total failure of the seal coat road resulting from a chain reaction. Employing a factor to compensate for AAR discrepancies between target and actual is critical for seal coat survival during construction. This study confirms the irrelevance of seal coat application to IRI values due to the thin coat and the limitation of the IRI measurement (e. g., 250 mm moving average). The friction test results show an adequate skid resistance performance on all seal coat test sections. In addition, friction improvements due to seal coat applications were confirmed within a range of seal coat rates applied in this study. Overall, IRI, friction, and visual inspection did not show distinct differences in seal coat performance in terms of application rates. A methodology in selecting an equipment factor for correcting any difference between a target rate and a measured rate was developed considering reliability and a designed rate using the McLeod equation. Design software, “INDOT SEAL COAT DESIGN (iSeal) ”, was developed as part of the study to aid the seal coat design process and incorporates INDOT seal coat practice. The software was largely based on the McLeod design method which includes factors that the INDOT seal coat specification lacks. Furthermore, an additional factor, an equipment factor, was implemented into the design process to resolve issues due to discrepancies between designed rate and applied rate...|$|R
