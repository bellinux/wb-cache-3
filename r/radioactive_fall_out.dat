40|$|The finite {{limits of}} fossil fuels have not been fully {{realized}} by the public. Inspite {{of the fact that}} dependency on imported oil has become a hard reality than a simple economics of supply and demand, there is a false sense of optimism that somehow the perceived policy changes will alleviate the supply problems and high cost of energy. The inexpensive and abundant supply of energy has indeed been the foundation of our civilization, as we know today. But this very growth in energy production and consumption is threatening our existing ecological balance. The problems of climatic variations, ozone depletion, acid rain and <b>radioactive</b> <b>fall</b> <b>out,</b> are all of global magnitude and all are related to the production and consumption of energy. It is therefore imperative that we review the alternative sources of energy, particularly in the light of increasing cost {{of fossil fuels}} and try {{to get out of this}} paradigm and look beyond the carbon-based energy sources. This will require appropriate incentives for R & D and a need to optimize the energy policies to help open new horizons...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATIONS. During {{the arms}} race after World War II, several nations {{conducted}} atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons. It was thought these tests would be safe, in that most <b>radioactive</b> particles would <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> close to the test site while the remainder would decay harmlessly in the stratosphere before eventually falling into the troposphere. However, radioactivity appeared in eastern North American food only days after weapons tests. In response, ground-breaking meteorological {{studies were carried out}} that discovered processes responsible for rapid exchange of air between the stratosphere and troposphere (e. g., Reed 1955; Danielsen 1968). Over the next half century, X START 08 combined high-altitude long-range aircraf t, new chemical instrumentation, and high-resolution meteorological models to map the chemical and microphysical structure and the major transport processes in the extratro-pical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|Proponents {{of a new}} {{generation}} of low-yield nuclear earth-penetrating weapons (EPWs), such as modified versions of the B 61 - 11 currently in the US stockpile, claim that such weapons could be used against deeply buried and hardened underground bunkers with “minimal collateral damage. ” Even a very low-yield nuclear EPW exploded in or near an urban environment will, however, cause radioactive dirt and debris and other <b>radioactive</b> material to <b>fall</b> <b>out</b> over several square kilometers. A nuclear EPW with a yield less than one-tenth of that of the nuclear weapon used on Hiroshima or Nagasaki could result in fatal doses of radiation to tens of thousands of victims. Biological and chemical agents stored in targeted bunkers may be dispersed into the atmosphere without being destroyed by an EPW, potentially injuring or killing unprotected civilians. The number of casualties from a nuclear EPW attack would depend on the location of the target, the density of the surrounding population, the extent of debris dispersal, and the possibility of escape or evacuation. In addition to the acute and long-term medical consequences, use of nuclear weapons would weaken existing restraints against further proliferation or use of nuclear weapons and would cross a threshold that has been maintained since 1945, when the United States detonated the first nuclear weapons over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
