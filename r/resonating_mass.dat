40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} over many years that Coriolis mass flow meters are unable to perform well when presented with two-phase (gas/liquid) flow. There are two aspects to the problem: {{it can be difficult to}} maintain flowtube oscillation at higher levels of two-phase flow (typically 2 - 20 % of gas by volume), and even at low levels of gas entrainment, where the flowtube continues to <b>resonate,</b> <b>mass</b> flow errors can be severe. This paper provides an overview of how to provide good Coriolis mass flow and density measurements in two-phase flow, and explains the central role of the flowtube drive control system. Two classes of application having widespread industrial significance are addressed: the problem of batching to or from an empty Coriolis flowtube, and dealing with continuous two-phase flow.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{resonator}} structure {{with a high}} Q factor, which {{has the potential to}} replace the Quartz crystal. In order to achieve a higher Q, complete decoupling of the resonating structure from the supporting ends is desired. One of the ways of achieving this is to distribute the stress uniformly throughout the support beam rather than their being concentrated at the fixed ends. This suggests a <b>resonating</b> <b>mass</b> supported by torsion wires. Here, three resonating structures are connected in a serial fashion. The outer two resonators act as interfaces to the external oscillator circuit, while the centre one is fully decoupled. The losses at the end of torsion wires are thus kept to lowest value. The other losses, namely damping and internal friction losses, are kept to a minimum by providing vacuum and using high quality material for the torsion wire. Modal analysis and static stress analysis were done on the structures and results clearly show the fundamental torsion mode of vibration and extremely small stresses at the fixed ends of the torsion wire...|$|E
40|$|The Active Control of Structural Response (ACSR) {{vibration}} suppression system, where {{hydraulic actuators}} located between the gearbox and the fuselage {{are used to}} cancel vibration in large helicopters, has been used successfully for many years. However the power consumed by the actuators can be high, and using hydraulic actuation for smaller rotorcraft {{has not been seen}} as practical. In contrast to active vibration reduction systems, passive vibration isolation systems require no external power. Passive vibration isolation systems however have the disadvantage of being limited to working at one specific frequency which will not be acceptable as slowed rotor flight becomes more common for fuel efficiency and noise legislation reasons. In this thesis two electrically powered actuation concepts, one piezoelectric, and one electromagnetic were initially evaluated. An electrically powered actively augmented passive, or hybrid, vibration reduction system based on an electro hydrostatic actuator (EHA) concept was proposed to be developed further. This hybrid actuator will have a wider range of operating frequencies than a purely passive system, and have lower power consumption than a purely active system. The design is termed a “Resonant EHA”; in that the resonant frequency of the coupled fluid, pump and electric motor rotor inertia matches the fundamental vibration frequency. The hydraulic cylinder, fluid and pump act as a single stage gear ratio, and the. brushless electric motor’s inertia is the main <b>resonating</b> <b>mass</b> as in a Dynamic Antiresonant Vibration Isolator (DAVI) passive vibration reduction system. The electrical power is used to compensate for friction in the actuator and other losses, and if needed can shift the operating point away from the resonant frequency. Simulation results indicated that a hydraulic circuit in which the pump leakage is fed back into the low pressure line would introduce unacceptable disturbances in the flows to and from the cylinder. To eliminate the source of the disturbances, a fully integrated electric motor and pump circuit design was chosen in which the electric motor is immersed in hydraulic fluid. An EHA demonstrator was built sized for a 1. 5 tonne rotorcraft. For sizing comparison purposes the frameless brushless D. C motor for each strut of 1. 5 tonne rotorcraft has a rotor and stator mass of approximately 1 kg, and can produce a continuous stall torque of 2 Nm. The bidirectional pump has a displacement of 1. 5 cm 3 /rev, the mean system pressure was taken as 90 bar, and the double ended hydraulic cylinder has a 32 mm diameter bore, and 18 mm rod. Initial test results for the proof of concept EHA showed highly significant free play with a reversal of torque direction, resulting in unacceptable loss in transmission stiffness. The free play was traced to the gear pump and a hypothesis for the origin of the free play was put forward. To avoid torque reversals the EHA was further tested with a constant offset torque bias which proved successful in restoring a sufficient stiffness to the transmission. The sizing of the electric motor and power consumed with a non-zero offset torque is greater than a torque reversing motor, which limits the immediate application of the device in the present form. Future research investigating the use of other transmission elements, such as a piston pump, to obtain a more linear stiffness is recommended. As a hybrid vibration isolation system a Root Mean Square (RMS) reduction by a factor of four and near elimination of the fundamental frequency vibrations was achieved for the frequency range of 10 to 20 hertz.

40|$|Prohibitive {{cost and}} large size of {{conventional}} angular rate sensors have limited their use to large scale aeronautical applications. However, {{the emergence of}} MEMS technology {{in the last two}} decades has enabled angular rate sensors to be fabricated that are orders of magnitude smaller in size and in cost. The reduction in size and cost has subsequently encouraged new applications to emerge, but the accuracy and resolution of MEMS angular rate sensors will have to be greatly improved before they can be successfully utilised for such high end applications as inertial navigation. MEMS angular rate sensors consist of a vibratory structure with two main resonant modes and high Q factors. By means of an external excitation, the device is driven into a constant amplitude sinusoidal vibration in the first mode, normally at resonance. When the device is subject to an angular rate input, Coriolis acceleration causes a transfer of energy between the two modes and results in a sinusoidal motion in the second mode, whose amplitude is a measure of the input angular rate. Ideally the only coupling between the two modes is the Coriolis acceleration, however fabrication imperfections always result in some cross stiffness and cross damping effects between the two modes. Much of the previous research work has focussed on improving the physical structure through advanced fabrication techniques and structural design; however attention has been directed in recent years to the use of control strategies to compensate for these structural imperfections. The performance of the MEMS angular rate sensors is also hindered by the effects of time varying parameter values as well as noise sources such as thermal-mechanical noise and sensing circuitry noise. In this thesis, MEMS angular rate sensing literature is first reviewed to show the evolu- tion of MEMS angular rate sensing from the basic principles of open-loop operation to the use of complex control strategies designed to compensate for any fabrication imperfections and time-varying effects. Building on existing knowledge, a novel adaptively controlled MEMS triaxial angular rate sensor that uses a single vibrating mass is then presented. Ability to sense all three components of the angular rate vector with a single vibrating mass has advantages such as less energy usage, smaller wafer footprint, avoidance of any mechanical interference between multiple <b>resonating</b> <b>masses</b> and removal of the need for precise alignment of three separate devices. The adaptive controller makes real-time estimates of the triaxial angular rates as well as the device cross stiffness and cross damping terms. These estimates are then used to com- pensate for their effects on the vibrating mass, resulting in the mass being controlled to follow a predefined reference model trajectory. The estimates are updated using the error between the reference model trajectory and the mass&# 039;s real trajectory. The reference model trajectory is designed to provide excitation to the system that is sufficiently rich to enable all parameter estimates to converge to their true values. Avenues for controller simplification and optimisation are investigated through system simulations. The triaxial controller is analysed for stability, averaged convergence rate and resolution. The convergence rate analysis is further utilised to determine the ideal adaptation gains for the system that minimises the unwanted oscillatory behaviour of the parameter estimates. A physical structure for the triaxial device along with the sensing and actuation means is synthesised. The device is realisable using MEMS fabrication techniques due to its planar nature and the use of conventional MEMS sensing and actuation elements. Independent actuation and sensing is achieved using a novel checkerboard electrode arrangement. The physical structure is refined using a design automation process which utilises finite element analysis (FEA) and design optimisation tools that adjust the design variables until suitable design requirements are met. Finally, processing steps are outlined for the fabrication of the device using a modified, commercially available polysilicon MEMS process...|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric energy {{harvesting}} from vibrations {{is a field}} that has gathered much attention over the past decade. The purpose of this application is to realize ambient sources of kinetic energy such as vibrations, {{and turn them into}} useful electrical energy for powering low powered sensor nodes. The most typical form of piezoelectric {{energy harvesting}} comes from cantilevered bimorphs. These bimorph structures are typically rectangular in shape with a tip <b>mass,</b> <b>resonating</b> in the fundamental mode of vibration. This creates a stress concentration near the fixed end of the cantilever, which linearly decreases towards the free end, hence creating an inefficient system. In order to improve this scenario by achieving a constant axial strain profile through the length of the geometry, tapered cantilevered bimorphs have been proposed in literature. However, an exhaustive set of experimental data and proper characterization, with appropriate constraints such as matching resonance frequency to prove this concept is elusive. In this dissertation, the effect of changing the geometry from rectangular cantilevered bimorphs into triangular ones with matching resonance frequency and volumes is presented. It is shown that for tapered geometry with matching volume and resonance frequencies, triangula...|$|R

40|$|Examining Canada and Britain from 1990 to 2004, {{the thesis}} explores how {{the surge in}} {{minority}} nationalist agitation that occurred in Quebec and Scotland changed the political environment in Canada (outside Quebec) and England allowing regional elites to advance political agendas which mobilized regional and national identities. The thesis considers the role of democratic institutions at the regional level in shaping political demands through a comparative study of regional and national identity mobilization in Nova Scotia and the North East of England. The analysis contends {{that the relationship between}} minority and majority nations is dialectical; nationalism stems from fundamentally different interpretations of the state and is not the ‘fault’ of either nation. Using this claim as the basis for analyzing elite debate at the centre and in the regions, the dissertation systematically examines regionalism within the majority nation by investigating debates at the national and regional level. The work looks at parliamentary debates, campaign material, newspaper accounts and elite interviews; and as identity mobilization and political debates are targeted at the electorate, survey analysis is undertaken to see whether elite debate <b>resonated</b> with the <b>masses.</b> The thesis demonstrates that regionalism is a component of the ongoing (re) conception of nation within the majority nation, and that during periods of strong minority nationalist agitation, a political environment is created which allows elites in the majority nation to mobilize national and regional identities. Regional identity mobilization is shown {{to be part of the}} nationalism of the majority nation; as the dominant conception of the state within the majority encompasses the minority nations as co-nationals and equal citizens, regional elites are able to use the minority nations as examples of successful agitation without subscribing to their interpretations of the state. Regional levels of democracy did not alter the nature of regionalism in either state and though the demands issued may have been different, the underlying concerns were the same: a lack of voice and efficacy.
