40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{the development of}} sliding mode control strategies for linear, time delay systems with bounded disturbances that are not necessarily matched. The {{emphasis is on the}} development of frameworks that are constructive and applicable to real problems. For many systems it may not be practical to measure all the system states and therefore a static output feedback sliding mode control design paradigm is considered. The novel feature of the method is that Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) are derived to compute solutions to both the existence problem and the finite time reachability problem that minimize the ultimate bound of the reduced-order sliding mode dynamics in the presence of time varying delay and unmatched disturbances. The methodology is therefore constructive and provides guarantees on the level of closed-loop performance that will be achieved by uncertain systems which experience delay. An uncertain model with both matched and unmatched disturbances from the literature provides a tutorial example of the proposed method. A case study involving the practical application of the design methodology in the area of liquid monopropellant <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> <b>control</b> is also presented...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2012, Virgin Galactic {{announced}} that the unpowered [...] glide flight test program was essentially complete. The company thereafter stated its intention to fit the hybrid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> and <b>control</b> system to the vehicle, before resuming the glide flight test program with the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> installed, in order to recharacterize the spacecraft's glide performance with slightly different weight distribution and aerodynamics. In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.|$|R
50|$|The main {{propulsion}} system of the Transfer Orbit Stage was an Orbus 21 solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor.</b> Attitude <b>control</b> was provided by hydrazine thrusters. The inertial guidance system used a ring laser gyroscope produced by Honeywell. Its control system employed a digital optimal, time-scheduled control algorithm to provide stability whilst the Orbus 21 was burning, while a phase-plane controller was used to manage its reaction-control system.|$|R
40|$|Computations are {{performed}} {{to investigate the}} effect of <b>rocket</b> <b>control</b> <b>motors</b> on flush air-data sensor systems. Such sensors are critical for the control of space vehicles during launch and re-entry, but are prone to interference from <b>rocket</b> <b>motors,</b> hypersonic-flow effects, etc. Computational analyses provide a means for studying these interference effects and exploring opportunities for mitigating them, either through design techniques or through appropriate processing of the sensor outputs. In the present work, the influence of <b>rocket</b> <b>control</b> <b>motors</b> on the nosecone flush air-data sensors of a launch-abort vehicle is studied. Particular {{attention is paid to}} the differential effect of various control-jet combinations on surface pressures. The relative effectiveness of inviscid, viscous, turbulent and two-phase-flow approximations in addressing this problem is also investigated...|$|R

The angle-of-twist process provides {{the right combination of}} preload accuracy, reliability, process control, and assembly-friendly design. It improves significantly over previous methods. The sophisticated angle-of-twist process controls have yielded answers to all discrepancies encountered while the simplicity of the root process has assured joint preload reliability...|$|R
50|$|The second {{design is}} a {{simplified}} version, intended to reduce cost {{by eliminating the}} <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> depending on its natural buoyancy to propel the mine upward. There is yet a third mine derived from the second one with further simplification to reduce cost by further eliminating the control fins, thus lacking the directional capability, and this mine had to be released much earlier from its anchorage like the one with directional capability but without the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor.</b> The area <b>control</b> of both type, of course, is {{much less than the}} one with <b>rocket</b> <b>motor,</b> but still larger than the Specialized-1, which could only travel in straight line.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the temperature changes in mechanical jet tabs {{in a system}} of <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> thrust vector <b>control,</b> estimated by the simulation and experimental tests methodology. The heat transfer calculation is based on complex computational fluid dynamics simulations of both the nozzle and external tab flows, as the comprehensive integral flow zones with high flow parameters gradients. Due to a complexity of the model for flow calculations, the experimental estimation of the calculated results is carried out. The temperature is measured by jet tabs embedded thermocouples, and conducted through the <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> static tests. A good agreement of the calculated and measured results is achieved. The main aim of the developed method is to establish an approved calculation tool for designing new TVC systems in order to avoid disadvantages due to overheating.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three years, a team at The Aerospace Corporation has been {{investigating}} high Delta-V solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> propulsion systems for CubeSats. All solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> have an unknown thrust misalignment. Therefore, any vehicle propelled by a solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> must include an attitude control system (ACS) capable {{of dealing with the}} torque generated by this thrust misalignment. We have designed and flight-tested two solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> thrust vector <b>control</b> (TVC) systems that provide the means for an ACS to null the thrust misalignment of a small solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> and allow the CubeSat to be steered while accelerating. The two TVC systems use completely different approaches [...] one is a moving mass system, the other is a nozzle jet paddle system. The TVC systems can be combined with a small solid (or liquid) <b>rocket</b> <b>motor</b> to provide a 1 U (a 10 cm cube) x 1 kg propulsion unit that can be attached to a 1 kg CubeSat and provide up to 950 m/s of Delta-V. The propulsion systems are highly scalable and can be designed to provide smaller or larger amounts of Delta-V as desired. A 2 U (a 20 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm cuboid) x 2. 5 kg propulsion unit attached to a 1 kg CubeSat can provide up to 1400 m/s of Delta-V. The proof-of-concept designs and flight tests of these propulsion systems are presented...|$|R
50|$|The {{launch vehicle}} {{was the fifth}} and final Little Joe II flown. The {{propulsion}} system consisted of four Algol and five Recruit <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> The attitude <b>control</b> system {{was similar to the}} one used on mission A-003 except that the reaction control system was deleted and the vehicle was provided with the capability of responding to a radio-transmitted pitch up command. The pitch up maneuver was required to help initiate tumbling of the launch vehicle. The spacecraft for this mission consisted of a modified Block I command and service module boilerplate, BP-2, and a modified Block I launch escape system (airframe 002). The center of gravity and thrust vector were changed to assure that power-on tumbling would be attained after abort initiation. The earth landing system was essentially the same as that used during Pad Abort Test 2.|$|R

50|$|Specific impulse is {{also used}} to measure {{performance}} in model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> Following are some of Estes' claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors: Estes Industries is a large, well-known American seller of model rocket components. The specific impulse for these model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> is much lower than for many other <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> because the manufacturer uses black powder propellant and emphasizes safety rather than maximum performance. The burn rate and, hence, chamber pressure and maximum thrust of model <b>rocket</b> <b>motors</b> is also tightly controlled.|$|R
40|$|Combusting environments where high {{velocities}} are encountered {{present a}} very challenging {{environment for the}} application of the Particle image Velocimetry (PIV) method. The physical features of the flow- background irradiance from burning gases, dense smoke, compressibility effects, inability to control seeding densities and inherent CCD limitations- make the measurement process difficult in the exhaust plume of solid <b>rocket</b> <b>motors.</b> A precisely <b>controlled</b> optical shutter-the Liquid Crystal Variable Attenuator (LCVA) -was used to control the light intensity reaching the CCD. The use of the LCVA alleviates the CCD limitations and permits a cross-correlation of images even in the presence of strong background irradiation. Phase averaged velocity fields were obtained in the unsteady rocket flow, by controlling the start of the triggering sequence using a photo-detector placed at the nozzle exit and interfacing it to the synchronizer (Fig. 1). Peak centerline velocities of more than 600 m/s were measured in burning particle laden gas flows at temperatures exceeding 2500 K.
