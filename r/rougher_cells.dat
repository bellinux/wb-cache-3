To overcome {{the limitations of the}} existing response surface (RS), surrogate or metamodel modeling methods for complex models over large variable domain, a new adaptive and regressive RS modeling method using quadratic functions and local area model improvement schemes is introduced. The method applies an iterative and Latin hypercube sampling based RS update process, divides the entire domain of design variables into multiple cells, identifies <b>rougher</b> <b>cells</b> with large modeling error, and further divides these cells along the roughest dimension direction. A small number of additional sampling points from the original, expensive model are added over the small and isolated rough cells to improve the RS model locally until the model accuracy criteria are satisfied. The method then combines local RS cells to regenerate the global RS model with satisfactory accuracy. An effective RS cells sorting algorithm is also introduced to improve the efficiency of model evaluation. Benchmark tests are presented and use of the new metamodeling method to replace complex hybrid electrical vehicle powertrain performance model in vehicle design optimization and optimal control are discussed.

40|$|Froth {{flotation}} is {{a widely}} used and versatile mineral processing method for concentrating metal ores. A finely ground ore feed is processed through a flotation circuit consisting of interlinked cells where mineral particles are separated from waste material by using their differences in surface properties. The layout of the circuit {{has been found to}} greatly affect the overall flotation performance. While industrial flotation circuit design has in the past relied on experience, due to the complex nature of the process, only small scale circuit optimisations using simple flotation models were reported in literature. This work proposes a new system capable of automatic generation of optimal circuit designs for any given feed. The system combines a circuit simulator containing detailed froth-phase flotation models with a robust genetic algorithm to search through possible layouts and to produce the global optimal result. An empirical model to predict the pulp phase flotation rate constant was developed, which was used together with physics-based models describing the froth recovery and entrainment factor to simulate the flotation process. Three feed models with different complexities were also developed. Comparable flotation performance was observed between a modelled 10 -cell rougher circuit and the experimental results from Northparkes copper concentration plant. Through the genetic algorithm, optimal layouts were obtained for circuits consisted of 3 to 10 cells. Layouts containing only <b>rougher</b> <b>cells</b> were able to recover a maximum amount of mineral and were found optimal for smaller circuits, whilst inclusion of cleaner cells in the optimal layouts was found more beneficial for larger circuits. This circuit modelling and optimisation system was used to study the sensitivity of flotation performance and optimal layouts to variations in feed particle size and grade. The results showed strong correlations between the variables and froth phase behaviours which determined the concentrate recovery and grade, the optimal layouts were, however, robust and relatively resilient to the changes in feed conditions.

40|$|Trithiocarbonates (TTCs) {{with less}} than six carbon atoms per {{molecule}} historically {{have proved to be}} better bulk sulphide mineral collectors than conventional dithiocarbonates (DTCs). However, high vapor pressures of the short-chain mercaptan decomposition products prevented them from general industrial use. Impala’s commitment in TTC development changed in 2002 when the nC 12 -trithiocarbonate indicated strong synergism when added to their existing flotation suite. A concerted research effort at the University of Utah followed, and in particular on their surface chemistry. To compliment current research and development at Impala, fundamental work regarding the surface hydrophobicity of pyrrhotite under electrochemically controlled conditions was undertaken at Utah University. Controlled contact angle measurements showed that the surface hydrophobicity of pyrrhotite can be increased by small additions of nC 12 -trithiocarbonate to SIBX. It was also found that this improvement in the surface hydrophobicity with the SIBX-TTC mixture was more significant at lower oxidation potentials. Work at Utah University further showed that a C 12 decomposition product {{may or may not be}} present with an adsorbed TTC molecule. External reflectance infrared spectroscopy in the mid infrared region suggested a “crowding” of the collectors at the surface when SIBX and TTC are combined. This was based on an increase in the absorbance of the -CH 2 - peaks in the mixed collector system. In bench scale flotation tests on PGM bearing samples from the Merensky reef, it was found that a 5 molar percent replacement of SIBX with nC 12 -trithiocarbonate improved the flotation activity relative to the standard SIBX-DTP mixture. Improvements were in the recoveries of PGMs, copper and nickel. The addition of TTC also increased the flotation rates of both slow and fast floating valuables as is predicted by the Kelsall equation. The optimum mixture for the pilot plant trials was thus a 5 molar percent replacement of the current collector suite with nC 12 -TTC. Based on the bench flotation results, research was extended to a pilot plant trial. At a depressant dosage of 100 g/ton, the PGM concentrate grades from the first rougher cell improved from 120 g/ton to 175 g/ton when the TTC was introduced. This was achieved without any effect on the recovery from the first cell. This increase in concentrate grade is believed to arise from the nature of both: The mineral-collector surface state, and The bubble surface interaction. Overall, the standard SIBX-DTP collector combination and the new SIBX-DTP-TTC collector combination (both at 100 g/ton depressant) was also compared to pilot plant tests with SIBX-DTP at high (350 g/ton) depressant dosages. The latter suite forms the currents reagent suite at Impala Platinum. When comparing the first two trials, at 100 g/ton depressant, the addition of TTC as a ternary collector resulted in a recovery improvement of approximately 2. 2 % with a simultaneous increase in final concentrate grade from 57 g/ton to 73 g/ton. The result was a reduction in solids recovery from 5. 3 % to 4. 1 %. When comparing the TTC trial to the standard collector suite at high depressant dosages, only a small reduction (3. 6 % vs. 4. 1 %) in solids recovery was achieved with a final concentrate grade of 85 g/ton. The PGM recoveries were very similar. Based on current Merensky milling rates, depressant and TTC costs, and calculated replacements based on the pilot plant tests, a projected cost saving on chemicals is R 9. 6 million per annum. Financial impacts on processing, grade and kinetics have not been made. It was also concluded that the detrimental effect of mild steel milling on the flotation activity of SIBX-DTP was diminished with the addition of the long-chain TTC with SIBX and DTP. As part to this research, a preliminary plant trial on UG- 2 underground material showed a reduced primary rougher chromite grade as well as a significant increase in PGM concentrate grade for the first two primary <b>rougher</b> <b>cells.</b> This is an important finding, especially for the melting process. In this final study a partial (5 molar percent) replacement of the standard collector used was also made. What was further realised was a significant increase in the final concentrate grade when compared to the standard conditions.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{measurement}} of particle loading on bubbles in the collection zone during flotation. Existing methods and instruments are critically reviewed to form a basis for developing a new bubble load meter. The new bubble load measuring device {{which is based on}} the Dyer (1995) and Seaman et al., (2004) concept is presented. It was noted that the Dyer (1995) concept as improved by Moys et al. (2010) had advantages that with refinement could yield a more robust working instrument. The device had to meet the following objectives: It must measure bubble loads accurately without particle losses as a result of bubble coalescence, or break up. Secondly the instrument should also be capable of collecting a solid sample in excess of 200 grams which is the minimum mass required for PGM analysis as function of particle size. Results of applying this newly designed bubble load meter in the laboratory and industrial plant are presented. It was shown at laboratory level through salt tracer experiments that the 20 mm and 30 mm riser worked well for the bubble load meter without sampling unattached particles. The intensity of the axial mixing in the 50 mm riser resulted in some salt transport up the riser, to an extent that would compromise the bubble load quality. An axial mixing model with 16 tanks in series was developed for the bubble load meter riser and parameters were estimated using Matlab’s Simulink toolbox. A satisfactory fit was obtained after the inclusion of an additional parameter that accounts for salt transport as a result of mechanical push by bubble swarms and the salt adsorbed on the bubble lamella. Industrial work at Lonmin’s EPC plant yielded a maximum sample mass of 35. 5 grams with the 20 mm ID riser instead of the target mass of 200 grams. This was attributed to a number of factors which include that the sample was taken using small diameter riser (20 mm ID) which meant that fewer bubbles were collected per unit cross sectional area and also the occasional breakage of the filter paper due to blinding which reduced sampling times.

While the froth recovery parameter was defined as the fraction of particles that are recovered by true flotation that reports to the concentrate, the froth flow number was defined as the ratio between the total mass of solids recovered in concentrate (by true flotation +entrainment) and the mass of solids entering the froth by true flotation, i. e. collected mineral (particle-bubble aggregates). A froth flow number can assume any value less than, equal to or greater than one depending on the contribution of entrainment and true flotation. It was also demonstrated that bubble load values in conjunction with certain assumptions can be used to estimate entrainment.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Flotation is {{a widely}} used {{separation}} process in the mineral industry. The successful operation of a flotation plant depends {{on a number of}} factors such as the suspension of mineral particles in the pulp, collector efficiency, bubble particle attachment and froth stability. In addition, the role of the froth zone is crucial in the flotation process as it plays a significant role in controlling the final product grade and recovery. The importance of the froth zone in both laboratory and plant scale flotation cells has been recognised by researchers for many years (Cutting et al., 1986; Feteris et al., 1987; Gorain et al., 1998 b; Lynch et al., 1981). Savassi et al. (1997), using an indirect mass balancing technique on a plant scale flotation cell, estimated that the recovery of particles in the froth zone of a <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> can vary from 70 % to 10 % depending on the position of the <b>cell</b> in a <b>rougher</b> bank. As a result 50 % of overall plant flotation cell efficiency can be lost due to poor froth performance. The froth recovery, the mass flowrate of particles reporting to the flotation product as a fraction of the mass flowrate that enters the froth layer, is a single parameter that can globally express the overall froth performance. If known, it could be a quantity of great utility in flotation plant design and the simulation of flotation circuits. However, the complexity of the froth zone, and interactions in the flow of solids and liquid between the pulp and froth zones, make it difficult to perform independent straightforward measurements of the froth recovery. At present, a number of indirect methods are available in the minerals industry to measure froth recovery (Alexander et al., 2003; Savassi et al., 1997; Vera et al., 1999). These methods are based on certain assumptions, which are not completely justified. As a result, it is quite important to develop a direct method to perform independent froth recovery measurements and investigation of froth behaviour. The overall objective of this research work is to study the froth zone and measure the froth recovery of a flotation cell A froth dropback method is used to directly measure froth recovery and experiments are performed with laboratory, pilot-scale and plantscale flotation cells. The effects of both physical and operating conditions (e. g. particle size, fine to coarse particles ratio in feed, air flowrate, froth depth, collector concentration and frother concentration) on froth recovery are investigated. In order to carry out the aforementioned works, a unique device has been developed to measure the dropback of particles from the froth zone. The aim is to decouple the froth zone from the pulp zone, to allow independent measurement of the froth recovery. The device consists of two concentric cylindrical tubes. The inner tube is denoted the dropback collection chamber or catcher. During the experiments, particleladen bubbles are allowed to pass through the annular gap between the two concentric tubes and a stable froth is formed {{at the top of the}} froth dropback (FDB) device. The collection chamber is mounted directly beneath the froth layer. Particles that fall off the froth are collected in the dropback chamber, and concentrate passes over the lip of the cell and is collected from a product launder. The mass flowrate into the device is estimated as the sum of the concentrate and dropback flowrates, and the froth recovery can then be calculated. In the first part of this thesis, the FDB device was used in a controlled laboratory environment to investigate the froth behaviour. Flotation experiments were performed using pure silica mineral. A mixture of finer 60 G (d₈₀ = 72 μm) and coarser 50 N (d₈₀ = 299 μm) silica particles with a wide particle size distribution was used as feed. The effect of important flotation parameters such as the ratio of fine-to-coarse particles in the feed, the collector concentration, the air flowrate, and froth depth on froth recovery were investigated. It was found that froth recovery can be as low as 60 % in the laboratory flotation environment. It was also found that the froth recovery is a strong function of particle size. Finer particles have high froth recoveries whereas the coarse particles have low froth recoveries, and are more prone to detach and report in the dropback stream. One of the important findings of the investigation is that the presence of fine particles can have a very significant effect on the collection of coarse particles in the flotation cell. The investigation also found that an increase in collector concentration significantly increases the collection of coarse particles in the collection (pulp) zone. However, higher collector concentrations can lead to destabilisation of the froth zone, resulting in a significant loss of the coarse particles from the froth zone. Air flowrate was found to have a positive impact on both collection and froth zone recovery. It was found that the froth zone works as a barrier to the collection of very coarse particles. However, at shallow froth depths, a significant collection of coarse particles in the product is found, but the froth recovery drops quickly as froth height is increased. In the second part of the thesis, an investigation into froth zone recovery in a controlled plant environment is presented. The laboratory apparatus was taken to the Northparkes copper mine, near Parkes, NSW, and a feed of copper-enriched minerals was taken from the head of the cleaner scavenger bank in an operating circuit. The feed slurry had a relatively higher copper grade varying from 5. 2 % to 6. 8 %. During this investigation, the size and grade of the particles in the flotation samples were analysed to acquire in-depth knowledge about the froth dropback mechanism. It was found that the froth recovery could be as low as 70 % but it is relatively easy to achieve values in the range 75 to 85 % by the correct choice of operating variables. The results show trends similar to those found in the laboratory with silica. Froth recovery was higher for finer particles whereas for coarse particles it decreases. It was found that the air flowrate has a positive impact on both collection (pulp) and froth zone recoveries. However, the effect was more prominent in the froth zone. Froth depth was found to have a significant effect on froth recovery. A larger number of valuable mineral particles detach and report to the dropback stream, with increasing froth height. Increasing the collector concentration gave expected results in the collection (pulp) zone, with a significant increase in coarse particle recovery. However, at high collector concentrations, it was observed that there was an increase in bubble coalescence and froth instability as well as a slight decrease in froth recovery. Increasing the frother concentration gave a significant improvement in froth recovery and a slight increase in collection zone recovery was also found. This may be attributed to the formation of finer, more stable, bubbles and a corresponding increase in froth stability. Size and grade analysis of the samples suggest that the dropback particles are mainly composite or middling fractions. It appears that particles whose grade is higher than the feed may be collected into the froth zone, but some particles with grades lower than the concentrate may detach from the froth and report to the dropback stream. In the third part of the thesis, a study of froth recovery and dropback in an operating plant <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> is presented. The dropback device was modified to make it sufficiently robust for in-plant testing. It was then inserted into the rougher bank of the Northparkes copper concentrator and the froth recovery was measured on two consecutive days. The feed grade to the <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> was 0. 4 % Cu. During the test work, the air flowrate into the <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> was varied. Each run was repeated for three times to check the reproducibility of the procedure. From the experimental results of Day 1 and Day 2, it was found that the froth recovery of the <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> was very high, around 90 %, and was a strong function of particle size. Increasing the air rate slightly increases the froth recovery overall, and also enhances the recovery of coarse particles. The dropback particles have higher grade than <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> feed but lower than concentrate grade. From grade vs particle size analysis, it was also found that for relatively coarser particles the dropback grade is much higher than the grades of both feed and <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> tailings. However, for relatively finer particles the dropback grade is lower than the feed grade, possibly as a result of entrainment. It was also found that the copper grade of concentrate collected from the dropback device was lower than that of the <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> itself, for the same froth height. This result could have come about because of a disparity in the froth residence time, which was lower in the dropback device than in the froth layer in the <b>rougher</b> <b>cell.</b> Alternatively, the finest gangue particles may not have had sufficient time to drain out of the froth. This thesis represents the first systematic attempt to measure froth dropback using feed samples drawn from an operating mineral concentrator. The froth recovery results are higher than had been expected from the few reported accounts in the literature. While the results are promising, it is clear however that the froth dropback device is still at an early development stage. There are few limitations in the current froth dropback device. However, one limitation is that entrainment is not eliminated and further research work should be carried out to minimise entrainment. It is worth noting that, because it is possible to physically capture samples of the particles that have dropped out of a froth, closer examination of the surfaces of these particles, and their fractional liberation using Mineral Liberation Analysis or QemScan, will give valuable information about the measures that could be taken to increase their overall recovery, especially relating to the flotation of coarse particles. In summary, the experimental results from the three phases of this investigation suggest that the froth recovery can be as low as around 60 %, but it is relatively simple to achieve froth recoveries in the range 75 % – 85 % using standard operating variables. Froth dropback is a strong function of particle size. Coarser particles are more prone to detach from the froth zone and report as dropback particles. Results from the high grade copper flotation work suggest that composite or middling particles, having lower grades than concentrate but higher grades than feed, report as dropback particles. These findings provide valuable information on the behaviour of flotation froths in the laboratory and in an operating concentrator. The value gained from the findings of this research work in industrial plant operations, together with further research into managing the froth zone effectively and improving coarse particle recovery, has the potential to reduce energy consumption and therefore further improve productivity in the mining industry...|$|R

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. In 2012, Anglo American Platinum {{assembled}} a technical task team of metallurgists for their concentrator operations. Although {{there has been}} extensive research in literature regarding the flotation response and behaviour of reagents, there still exists a gap between fundamental laboratory scale research and plant scale application. This thesis {{will focus on the}} development of techniques for optimising and characterising frother on a full scale plant using the Anglo American Platinum Bubble Sizer (AAPBS) which is a commonly used tool by the plant metallurgist. The techniques developed have been based on the application of fundamental research of frothers in literature. This thesis consists of three main focus areas: 1) Developing a technique for measuring the relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and frother concentration on a full scale plant. 2) Developing a technique for estimating frother concentrations in process streams in full scale plant 3) Establishing whether the relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and superficial gas velocity in a flotation bank of identical cells in series in a plant operating at frother concentration above the CCC is identical, and whether this can be used to detect the decrease of frother concentration to below the CCC at any point in the bank. Furthermore, the metallurgical performance of a bank with a decrease in frother concentration below the CCC midway through the bank was determined before and after the addition of frother, which was added as such that all the cells in the bank operate with a frother concentration above the CCC. There were two techniques investigated for measuring the relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and frother concentration. Both techniques involved using the AAPBS and the use of forced air mechanically agitated tank cells. Technique 1 involved using the first <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> on a flotation plant, dosing frother at different rates into the cell to target different frother concentrations and then measuring the resultant bubble size whilst operating at a fixed air rate. The coalescence mechanism here was occurring in a three phase solids/aqueous/air system occurring in a continuous stirred tank. Similarly Technique 2 involved using the first rougher cell; however, the first cell was depleted of frother by bypassing the frother dosage line into the next cell. This was done to isolate the first <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> and to minimise disturbance {{to the rest of the}} rougher bank. Known concentrations offrother were made up in potable water and these were added into the AAPBS. Bubbles from the pulp phase enter the bubble riser tube which is long and narrow (3 m x 25 mm diameter) which is representative of two phase aqueous/air “plug flow” system. These bubbles coalesce to different degrees based on the known frother concentration. The resulting bubble size distribution was then be measured by taking photographs at the viewing pane of the AAPBS. The air rate in the cell was kept constant to within 0. 7 - 0. 9 cm/s and the photographs were analysed using software provided by stone three to determine the sauter mean bubble diameter and the bubble size distribution. Technique 1 was applied to Plant A UG 2 concentrator which was using a polyglycol type frother called Betafroth 206 C which has an undisclosed composition and a molecular weight of approximately 200 g/mol. The first <b>rougher</b> <b>cell</b> used was an Outokumpu 70 m 3 forced air mechanically agitated tank cell. The results showed no clear relationship between sauter mean bubble diameter and frother concentration. Furthermore, the sauter mean bubble diameter was already very small and it appeared that the changes in between runs were more strongly linked to the superficial gas velocity than frother concentration. The fact that the sauter mean bubble diameter obtained was already small implied that the frother concentration in the cell was already high. This could have been due to an additional source of frother due to spillage or in the process water that potentially elevated the actual frother concentrations in the cell. Technique 1 also resulted in significant disturbances to the entire rougher bank because it involved changing the frother dosages to the bank. This would affect the flotation performance of the bank for a prolonged period and affect plant performance. Hence it was decided that technique 1 would not be suitable...|$|R

The oral cavity is considered the natural habitat for the species, which has been implicated as a periodontal pathogen. In plaque samples from periodontitis patients we observed {{the presence of a}} rough morphotype of P. micros in addition to the previously recognized smooth morphotype. The rough morphotype has not been described previously. Roth morphotypes are frequently isolated simultaneously from the same patient. In this paper strains of both morphotypes are described. The smooth morphotype, represented by the type strain, grew as small, dome-shaped, bright white, nonhemolytic colonies. The rough morphotype grew as equally white dry colonies which were hemolytic and had wrinkled edges. DNA-DNA reassociation studies revealed homology at the species level between the two morphotypes; in addition, no differences in physiological characteristics were observed when the organisms were tested with API- 32 A and API-ZYM kits. The <b>rough</b> <b>cells</b> had long, thin fibrillar structures outside the cell envelope when they were stained negatively for electron microscopy. In the smooth morphotype these structures were not present. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of whole-cell extracts were different for the two morphotypes. In xylene-water phase partition studies, the smooth morphotype was found to be hydrophobic, whereas the rough morphotype was found to be relatively hydrophilic. The distinct morphotypes were stable on blood agar; however, the rough morphotype changed to a nonfibrillar type with a smooth colony morphology after repeated subculturing in broth...|$|R
30|$|Several {{treatments}} {{have demonstrated}} that Dunaliella is capable of accumulating β-carotene and glycerol under conditions of high irradiance and other saline stress conditions (Arun and Singh 2012). Highly photosynthetic systems in the Altiplano represent exceptional conditions for these aspects such as salinity variations and high UV irradiance especially in aquatic systems over the salt crust (sunlight screen reflector). Intensive pigmentation and dynamic responses (e.g. aplanospore cysts formation) of Dunaliella salina to the seasonal changes is a clear example of well adapted species to these conditions. Moreover, some Dunaliella species not only reproduce by division of vegetative cells but show sexual reproduction as well (Oren 2005). One {{of the most interesting}} adaptations in Dunaliella species is the formation of vegetative cysts (Hamburger 1905; Margulis et al. 1980; Borowitzka and Huisman 1993; Oren 2005) during winter conditions of short and cold days (Borowitzka and Huisman 1993). These formations (aplanospore cysts) generate great resistance to long periods of dryness, with two extremely resistant thick coats which form a <b>rough</b> <b>cell</b> wall (Leonardi and Cáceres 1997); germinations process occurs in shallow sediments that had become exposed to diluted waters (Oren and Ben-Yosef 1997). This behavior has not been described yet in the Altiplano. Interestingly, our results reported aplanospore formations only during the driest season in winter condition (Fig.  8 b), and germination process in the austral spring when the systems could receive intermittent rains events (Fig.  8 c). Furthermore, our result in Laguna Colorada detected cadmium concentrations (Table  1) over the tolerance limit described for toxic levels (plants tolerance) in nature (Dong et al. 2007).|$|R

Scientific Reports, 6, 12. doi: 10. 1038 /srep 34395 Root hairs are tubular extensions of the epidermis. Root hairs of the monogenic recessive maize mutant roothairless 6 (rth 6) are arrested after bulge formation during the transition to tip growth and display a <b>rough</b> <b>cell</b> surface. BSR-Seq in combination with Seq-walking and subsequent analyses of four independently generated mutant alleles established that rth 6 encodes CSLD 5 a plasma membrane localized 129 kD D-type cellulose synthase with eight transmembrane domains. Cellulose synthases are required for the biosynthesis of cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer of plant cell walls. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that RTH 6 {{is part of a}} monocot specific clade of D-type cellulose synthases. D-type cellulose synthases are highly conserved in the plant kingdom with five gene family members in maize and homologs even among early land plants such as the moss Physcomitrella patens or the clubmoss Selaginella moellendorffii. Expression profiling demonstrated that rth 6 transcripts are highly enriched in root hairs as compared to all other root tissues. Moreover, in addition to the strong knock down of rth 6 expression in young primary roots of the mutant rth 6, the gene is also significantly down-regulated in rth 3 and rth 5 mutants, while it is up-regulated in rth 2 mutants, suggesting that these genes interact in cell wall biosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|The exact {{segmentation}} of nucleus and plasma of a {{white blood}} cell (leukocyte) {{is the basis for}} the creation of an automatic, image based differential white blood cell count(WBC). In this contribution we present an approach for the according segmentation of leukocytes. For a valid classification of the different cell classes, a precise segmentation is essential. Especially concerning immature cells, which can be distinguished from their mature counterparts only by small differences in some features, a segmentation of nucleus and plasma has to be as precise as possible, to extract those differences. Also the problems with adjacent erythrocyte cells and the usage of a LED illumination are considered. The presented approach can be separated into several steps. After preprocessing by a Kuwahara-filter, the cell is localized by a simple thresholding operation, afterwards a fast-marching method for the localization of a <b>rough</b> <b>cell</b> boundary is defined. To retrieve the cell area a shortest-path-algorithm is applied next. The cell boundary found by the fast-marching approach is finally enhanced by a post-processing step. The concluding segmentation of the cell nucleus is done by a threshold operation. An evaluation of the presented method was done on a representative sample set of 80 images recorded with LED illumination and a 63 -fold magnification dry objective. The automatically segmented cell images are compared to a manual segmentation of the same dataset using the Dice-coefficient as well as Hausdorff-distance. The results show that our approach is able to handle the different cell classes and that it improves the segmentation quality significantly...|$|R

40|$|Assembly of {{adherent}} biofilms {{is the key}} mechanism {{involved in}} Staphylococcus epidermidis virulence during device-associated infections. Aside from polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), the accumulation-associated protein Aap and the extracellular matrix binding protein Embp act as intercellular adhesins, mediating S. epidermidis cell aggregation and biofilm accumulation. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate structural features of PIA-, Aap-, and Embp-mediated S. epidermidis biofilms in more detail and to evaluate their specific contributions to biofilm-related S. epidermidis immune escape. PIA-, Embp-, and Aap-mediated biofilms exhibited substantial morphological differences. Basically, PIA synthesis induced formation of macroscopically visible, <b>rough</b> <b>cell</b> clusters, whereas Aap- and Embp-dependent biofilms preferentially displayed a smooth layer of aggregated bacteria. On the microscopic level, PIA was found to form a string-like organized extracellular matrix connecting the bacteria, while Embp produced small deposits of intercellular matrix and Aap was strictly localized to the bacterial surface. Despite marked differences, S. epidermidis strains using PIA, Aap, or Embp for biofilm formation were protected from uptake by J 774 A. 1 macrophages, with similarly efficiencies. In addition, compared to biofilm-negative S. epidermidis strains, isogenic biofilm-forming S. epidermidis induced only a diminished inflammatory J 774 A. 1 macrophage response, leading to significantly (88. 2 to 88. 7 %) reduced NF-κB activation and 68. 8 to 83 % reduced interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) production. Mechanical biofilm dispersal partially restored induction of NF-κB activation, although bacterial cell surfaces remained decorated with the respective intercellular adhesins. Our results demonstrate that distinct S. epidermidis biofilm morphotypes are similarly effective at protecting S. epidermidis from phagocytic uptake and at counteracting macrophage activation, providing novel insights into mechanisms that could contribute to the chronic and persistent course of biofilm-related S. epidermidis foreign material infections...|$|R

40|$|A {{panel of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies (MAbs) to seven Brucella outer membrane proteins were characterized. These antibodies {{were obtained by}} immunizing mice with sodium dodecyl sulfate-insoluble (SDS-I) fractions, cell walls, or whole bacterial cells of Brucella abortus or B. melitensis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to screen the hybridoma supernatants and to determine their binding at the surface of rough and smooth B. abortus and B. melitensis cells. The outer membrane proteins (OMPs) recognized by these antibodies were the proteins with molecular masses of 25 to 27 kDa and 36 to 38 kDa (porin) (major proteins) and the proteins with molecular masses of 10, 16. 5, 19, 31 to 34, and 89 kDa (minor proteins). Surface exposure of these OMPs was visualized by electron microscopy by using the MAbs and immunogold labeling. Binding of the MAbs on whole <b>rough</b> bacterial <b>cells</b> indicates that the 10 -, 16. 5 -, 19 -, 25 - to 27 -, 31 - to 34 -, 36 - to 38 -, and 89 -kDa OMPs are exposed at the cell surface. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results indicate a much better binding of the anti-OMP MAbs on rough strains than on the corresponding smooth strains except for the anti- 19 -kDa MAb. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that on smooth B. abortus cells only the 89 - and 31 - to 34 -kDa OMPs were not accessible to the MAbs tested.
