50|$|The Akash, {{like the}} Russian 2K12 Kub (SA-6 Gainful), {{utilizes}} an integrated ramjet-rocket propulsion system, which provides thrust for the missile {{throughout most of}} its flight. Because this missile has an integrated <b>ram-rocket,</b> maneuverability is highest. The engine is 'on' throughout the flight. The thrust is on till the missile intercepts the target. Most other surface-to-air missiles, including the U.S. Patriot and the Russian S-300 series, use solid-fuel rocket propulsion.|$|E

The theoretical analysis of the four basic components: supersonic diffuser, primary combustor, secondary combustor, and exhaust nozzle of the <b>ram-rocket</b> are presented. Because of the complexity of the evaluation of the propellant performance, a trial and error technique is used in a digital computer in order to calculate the desired proerties and performance parameters. A computer code has been developed for this project with a variance of 1) flight Mach number, 3 < M < 5, 2) flight altitude, 15, 000 ft < z < 35, 000 ft and with a constant area subsonic combustor. This project also provides the effect of the parameters on the propulsion performance characteristics. It shows that: 1) With a constant-area combustor, maximum specific thrust is achieved when sufficient heat is added to choke the flow at the combustor exit. 2) For the same amount of propellant-air ratio the "fuel richer" solid propellant mixture has higher performance in the specific thrust and propellant specific impulse. 3) At the same flight altitude, the thrust and propellant specific impulse increase as the flight Hach number increases. 4) For the same flight Mach number, the higher the flight altitude, the lower the total thrust, propellant specific impulse and thrust power. The <b>ram-rocket</b> seems to be well adapted for reusable boosters, tactical missiles and air to space shuttle vehicles for the present and near future...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (page 60) A <b>ram-rocket</b> is {{a hybrid}} system engine which combines a ramjet with a rocket engine {{with the intent}} to utililize the operational advantages of one engine to compensate for the operational disadvantages of the other. The rocket is normally arranged to be embedded inside the ramjet and functionally replaces the conventional fuel injector used in regular ramjets. The fuel rich rocket exhaust fluid provides the fuel source for secondary combustion with the ingested air in the ramjet combustion chamber. This study parametrically investigates the thermodynamic performance and sizing requirement of the <b>ram-rocket</b> as a function of flight altitude, flight velocity, rocket oxidizer/fuel ratio, air/rocket exhaust flow ratio, and inlet static pressure ratio. It also examines the effect of Subsonic and Supersonic mixing/combustion. The engine is analyzed by the cascade analysis technique. Input data are the operating conditions. Output are the matching geometry and perfomance parameters including thrust, thrust augmentation ratio, and thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC). Due to the parametrical nature of the study and the extensive usage of iterative calculation techniques, a computer program was developed to facilitate the analysis. (See more in text. ...|$|E
