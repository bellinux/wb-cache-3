40|$|The study {{examined}} {{environmental effects of}} urbanization of River Ajilosun drainage basin in Ado-Ekiti, Nigeria. Data were generated on flood width, channel width, and storm drain dimensions {{with the aid of}} a <b>ranging</b> <b>pole,</b> tape measure and a piece of plank. Also, 150 copies of structured questionnaire were administered on respondents who were also landlords of houses in River Ajilosun drainage basin. The data were analyzed with descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, range and simple percentage. The Student’s‘t ’ test was used to compare the differences in the occurrence of flooding and erosion between the upper and lower segments of River Ajilosun. In addition to these, photograph of some features were taken to complement the various data. The findings of the study revealed the environmental effects of urbanization in the drainage basin to include increase in spatial extension of flooding and flood prone areas, increased erosion of River Ajilosun channel, and sediment pollution of the basin surface, indiscriminate refuse disposal/refuse sedimentation of streets and general pollution of the environment. The measures suggested for curbing these problems are relocation of illegal structures, adequate implementation and enforcement of Town Planning Laws, construction of new storm drains, rehabilitation of the old ones and regular desilting of the storm drains among others. 1. 0...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} morphometric parameters and flooding in River Ajilosun in Ado-Ekiti in Ekiti State, Nigeria. Direct field measurement of some morphometric parameters of the river were carried out {{with the aid of}} tape measure, <b>ranging</b> <b>pole</b> and tie rod. Some data were also abstracted from the topographical map of the river on scale 1 : 50, 0000. This was in addition to some data which were generated through the systematic administration of 150 copies of structured questionnaire. The various data generated were subjected to descriptive statistics of the mean, standard deviation, range and percentages. This was also in addition to the use of Student’s‘t ’ statistic for the testing of the hypotheses raised at 0. 05 significant level. The outcome of the statistical analyses and the overall discovery of the study showed that the morphometric properties of the cross-sectional values of the width, depth and hydraulic radius vary spatially across and along the profiles of River Ajilosun. The result of the hypotheses revealed that channel width and channel depth dimensions exhibited spatial variation between the upper concrete-channelized and the lower non-concrete channelized (alluvial) reaches of the river. The result also indicated positive correlation values of channel depth and channel width with flooding in the river at 0. 01 level. However, the hydraulic radius exhibit negative correlation with flooding and was significant at 0. 05 level. The paper suggests wise modification of Rive...|$|E
40|$|A mobile mapping system (MMS) is {{a mobile}} {{multi-sensor}} platform {{developed by the}} geoinformation community to support the acquisition of huge amounts of geodata {{in the form of}} georeferenced high resolution images and dense laser clouds. Since data fusion and data integration techniques are increasingly able to combine the complementary strengths of different sensor types, the external calibration of a camera to a laser scanner is a common pre-requisite on today's mobile platforms. The methods of calibration, nevertheless, are often relatively poorly documented, are almost always time-consuming, demand expert knowledge and often require a carefully constructed calibration environment. A new methodology is studied and explored to provide a high quality external calibration for a pinhole camera to a laser scanner which is automatic, easy to perform, robust and foolproof. The method presented here, uses a portable, standard <b>ranging</b> <b>pole</b> which needs to be positioned on a known ground control point. For calibration, a well studied absolute orientation problem needs to be solved. In many cases, the camera and laser sensor are calibrated in relation to the INS system. Therefore, the transformation from camera to laser contains the cumulated error of each sensor in relation to the INS. Here, the calibration of the camera is performed in relation to the laser frame using the time synchronization between the sensors for data association. In this study, the use of the inertial relative movement will be explored to collect more useful calibration data. This results in a better intersensor calibration allowing better coloring of the clouds and a more accurate depth mask for images, especially on the edges of objects in the scene...|$|E

40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} (TLS) is a newer, active method of remote sensing for the automatic detection of 3 D coordinate points. This method {{has been developed}} particularly during the last 20 years, in addition to airborne and mobile {{laser scanning}} methods. All these methods use laser light and additional angle measurements {{for the detection of}} distances and directions. Thus, several thousands to hundreds of thousands of polar coordinates per second can be measured directly by an automatic deflection of laser beams. For TLS measurements, the coordinates and orientation of the origin of the laser beam can be determined to register different scan positions in a common coordinate system. These measurements are usually conducted by Global Navigation Satellite Systems or total station surveying, but also identical points can be used and data driven methods are possible. Typically, accuracies and point densities of a few centimetres to a few millimetres are achieved depending on the method. The derived 3 D point clouds contain millions of points, which can be evaluated in post-processing stages by symbolic or data-driven methods. Besides the creation of digital surface and terrain models, laser scanning is used in many areas for the determination of 3 D objects, distances, dimensions, and volumes. In addition, changes can be determined by multi-temporal surveys. The terrestrial laser scanner Riegl LMS Z- 420 i was used in this work in combination with the Differential Global Positioning System system Topcon Hiper Pro, based on Real Time Kinematic (RTK-DGPS). In addition to the direct position determination of the laser scanner, the position of a self-developed reflector on a <b>ranging</b> <b>pole</b> was measured by the RTK-DGPS system to accurately derive the orientation of each measured point cloud. Moreover, the scanner is equipped with an additional, mounted camera Nikon D 200 to capture oriented pictures. These pictures allow colouring the point cloud in true colours and thus allow a better orientation. Furthermore, the pictures can be used for the extraction of detailed 3 D information and for texturing the 3 D objects. In one of the post-processing steps, the direct georeferencing by RTK-DGPS data was refined using the Multi Station Adjustment, which employs the Iterative Closest Point algorithm. According to the specific objectives, the point clouds were then filtered, clipped, and processed to establish 3 D objects for further usage. In this dissertation, the feasibility of the method has been analysed by investigating the applicability of the system, the accuracy, and the post-processing methods by means of case studies from the research areas of coastal geomorphology, agronomy, and geoarchaeology. In general, the measurement system has been proven to be robust and suitable for field surveys in all cases. The surveys themselves, including the selected georeferencing approach, were conducted quickly and reliably. With the refinement of the Multi Station Adjustment a relative accuracy of about 1 cm has been achieved. The absolute accuracy is about 1. 5 m, limited by the RTK-DGPS system, which can be enhanced through advanced techniques. Specific post-processing steps have been conducted to solve the specific goals of each research area. The method was applied for coastal geomorphological research in western Greece. This part of the study deals with 3 D reconstructed volumes and corresponding masses of boulders, which have been dislocated by high energy events. The boulder masses and other parameters, such as the height and distance to the current sea level, have been used in wave transport equations for the calculation of minimum wave heights and velocities of storm and tsunami scenarios and were compared to each other.

The LKMR {{is listed as}} an endangered species due to predation by feral and free roaming domestic cats (Felis catus) and raccoons (Procyon lotor), road mortality, effects of storm surges, sea level rise, the small declining metapopulation size, and possible habitat loss from hardwood encroachment. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the current LKMR density on lands managed by the United States Navy, Naval Air Station Key West and evaluate how vegetation structure and patch elevation effect LKMR population density. I conducted fecal pellet counts to determine LKMR density, collected vegetation data using percent composition of ground cover, Robel <b>range</b> <b>pole,</b> and point-centered quarter methods, and obtained data on patch area and elevation. I used simple linear regression to assess the relationship between LKMR density and 9 measured vegetation characteristics, patch area, and patch elevation to determine which variables have an influence on LKMR density and the relationship between them. In my examination of the simple regression models, 6 out of the 11 variables appeared to influence LKMR population density. The average per patch percent composition of nonliving material and grasses, maximum height of vegetation at the <b>range</b> <b>pole,</b> distance to nearest woody vegetation, patch elevation, and visual obstruction readings (VOR) individually accounted for 26. 4 %, 30. 4 %, 18. 1 %, 8. 5 %, 6. 8 %, and 1. 4 % of the variability in LKMR density, respectively.

Six spatial dimensions expected to have three different perceptual structures in terms of the point and range nature of O 1, INT and O 2 were analysed. Presented with images, the participants were instructed to identify each region (O 1, INT, O 2), first by looking at the region, and then circumscribing it using the computer mouse. We measured the eye movements, identification times and various characteristics of the drawings such as the relative size of the three regions, overlaps and gaps. Three main results emerged.

For ease of use and convenience a Trimble Guided Grader is studied with the most up to date grader control system. The Trimble Guided Grader is supported by a Trimble SPS 930 total station achieving 1 ” of error in the Vertical and Horizontal circles. Teaming up of both these systems gives the best opportunity for accurate results whilst eliminating the likelihood of bias creeping in. Modern Trimble Guided Grader technology {{has the ability to}} record the finished surface constructed through a simple push of a button.

I used pitfall arrays and Sherman live traps to sample small mammals along 9 traplines at the land-use interface and on a gradient extending 375 m into each land-use. I used point-centered-quarter, <b>range</b> <b>pole,</b> and line-transect sampling to characterize plant community structure. Two generalist small mammal species had increased abundance as distance into the sugarcane increased. Two species with wide geographic ranges appeared to select areas within 75 m of the interface. Four species with restricted habitat tolerances or diets were negatively affected by sugarcane, as was 1 species that selects for low ground cover. Two species may have avoided the interface. For the majority of species in the Lowveld, sugarcane does not provide habitat. Sugarcane monocultures > 375 m in width may form a barrier to movement of small mammal species. Species richness and diversity significantly decreased at the interface of 2 sites, however, 1 site had increased diversity associated with the interface. My analysis indicated a difference in community composition between the 2 land-uses and differences between the farthest interior conservation area (375 m) -interface (0 m) and the farthest interior sugarcane (375 m). There was no difference in community composition between seasons or distances within the conservation area. The farthest interior sugarcane trapline had distinctness from other traplines within the sugarcane, and may be of importance for minimizing the effects of habitat fragmentation in lowveld savanna.

Implications for the analysis for dark matter searches are discussed. Comment: 28 pages, latex, and 7 fig...|$|R
