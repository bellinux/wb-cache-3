5|$|After {{crossing}} the Passaic River into Bergen County, {{the road is}} called Paterson Avenue and designated as County Route 120, in Wallington, in a residential and light-density commercial area. The road becomes the border between Wallington {{to the north and}} East <b>Rutherford</b> to the south. At the end of Wallington, Paterson Avenue is the border between Carlstadt and East <b>Rutherford</b> for a short distance but then the road dips into East <b>Rutherford</b> to avoid a hill (the bypass, which goes over the hill, is called Hoboken Road). The road returns to the Carlstadt/East <b>Rutherford</b> border at Route 17 which it crosses over via an overpass, and is then designated as Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road for a distance.|$|E
5|$|After leaving politics, <b>Rutherford</b> {{continued}} his law practice and {{his involvement with}} a wide range of community groups. Most importantly, he became chancellor of the University of Alberta, whose earlier founding had been a personal project. He died of a heart attack June 11, 1941. A University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and Jasper National Park's Mount <b>Rutherford</b> are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, <b>Rutherford</b> House, was opened as a museum in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1911 federal election, {{several local}} Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked <b>Rutherford</b> {{to run against}} him in Strathcona. Relations between Oliver and <b>Rutherford</b> had always been chilly—Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross, who he viewed as a rival for {{dominance}} of the Liberal party in Alberta, and his Edmonton Bulletin had taken {{the side of the}} dissidents during the railway scandal. A nominating meeting unanimously nominated <b>Rutherford</b> as Liberal candidate, though Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting. Before this meeting came to pass, however, <b>Rutherford</b> abruptly withdrew. Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that this was due to the Conservatives' nomination of William Antrobus Griesbach, dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude their opposing him. Rumours at the time alleged that <b>Rutherford</b> had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund, and had balked. <b>Rutherford</b> himself cited a desire to avoid splitting the vote on reciprocity, which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed. Whatever the reason, for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.|$|E

5|$|During this time, {{his social}} circle grew to include William Cameron Edwards. Through Edwards, <b>Rutherford</b> was {{introduced}} to the Birkett family, which included former Member of Parliament Thomas Birkett. <b>Rutherford</b> married Birkett's niece, Mattie Birkett, in December 1888. The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893), and Marjorie (born in 1903, but died sixteen months later). <b>Rutherford</b> had a traditional view of gender roles, and was happy to leave most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Frank Oliver, who had {{represented}} Edmonton in the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories since 1888, {{resigned to}} pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged <b>Rutherford</b> to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing by-election. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature petition urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former Edmonton mayor Matthew McCauley who, like <b>Rutherford,</b> ran as an independent. <b>Rutherford</b> campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but <b>Rutherford</b> received more than forty percent of the vote.|$|E

5|$|Originally from Ireland, <b>Rutherford</b> immigrated {{with his}} parents to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Colony, {{at the age of}} eighteen.

He was a representative of both houses of the North Carolina House of Commons, as well as an unsuccessful candidate for governor. <b>Rutherford</b> was an advocate of the anti-federalist movement and was appointed President of the Legislative Council of the Southwest Territory in 1794. <b>Rutherford</b> retired to Sumner County, Tennessee, where he died on August 10, 1805, at the age of 84.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rutherford</b> {{was born}} on November 8, 1869 to James Calvin <b>Rutherford</b> and Leonora Strickland and raised in near-poverty in a Baptist farm family.

Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed <b>Rutherford</b> to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to take his place on the family farm. <b>Rutherford</b> took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.|$|E

5|$|By June, four of {{the seven}} Watch Tower Society directors—Robert H. Hirsh, Alfred I. Ritchie, Isaac F. Hoskins and James D. Wright— had decided they had erred in {{endorsing}} Rutherford's expanded powers of management, claiming <b>Rutherford</b> had become autocratic. In June, Hirsch attempted to rescind the new by-laws and reclaim the board's authority from the president. <b>Rutherford</b> later claimed he had by then detected a conspiracy among the directors to seize control of the society. In July, <b>Rutherford</b> gained a legal opinion from a Philadelphia corporation lawyer that none of his opposers were legally directors of the society. The Watch Tower Society's official 1959 account of its history claimed the legal advice given to the ousted directors confirmed that given to Rutherford; however, the pamphlets produced by the expelled board members at the time indicated that their legal advice, acquired from several attorneys, disagreed with Rutherford's. On July 12, <b>Rutherford</b> filled what he claimed were four vacancies on the board, appointing Macmillan and Pennsylvania Bible Students W. E. Spill, J. A. Bohnet and George H. Fisher as directors. Between August and November the society and the four ousted directors published a series of pamphlets, with each side accusing the other of ambitious and reckless behavior. The former directors also claimed <b>Rutherford</b> had required all headquarters workers to sign a petition supporting him and threatened dismissal for any who refused to sign. The former directors left the Brooklyn headquarters on August 8. On January 5, 1918, shareholders returned <b>Rutherford</b> to office.|$|E
5|$|Education was a {{personal}} priority of Rutherford's, as evidenced by his retention {{of the office of}} Education Minister for his entire time as Premier and by his enthusiastic work in founding the University of Alberta. In 1911 he was elected by Alberta's university graduates to the University of Alberta Senate, responsible for the institution's academic affairs. In 1912 he established the <b>Rutherford</b> Gold Medal in English for the senior year honours English student with the highest standing; the prize still exists today as the <b>Rutherford</b> Memorial Medal in English. In 1912, with the University's first graduating class, <b>Rutherford</b> instituted a tradition of inviting convocating students to his house for tea; this tradition would last for twenty-six years.|$|E

5|$|Route 17 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Route 7 and County Route 507 (Belleville Turnpike) {{on the border}} of Kearny, Hudson County and North Arlington, Bergen County. It heads north through North Arlington on Ridge Road, a two-lane local street that passes by businesses and the Holy Cross Cemetery {{on the east side of}} the road. It intersects County Route 26 (Jauncey Avenue) and crosses into Lyndhurst at the Lincoln Avenue intersection. In Lyndhurst, Route 17 intersects County Route 28 (Kingsland Avenue). At the intersection of County Route 30 (<b>Rutherford</b> Avenue), which runs along the border of Lyndhurst and <b>Rutherford,</b> the route turns east onto <b>Rutherford</b> Avenue to parallel the Route 3 freeway to the south and head for the edge of the New Jersey Meadowlands, widening to a four-lane road at the intersection with Orient Way. Route 17 makes a curve to the south, crossing entirely into Lyndhurst, and makes a hairpin turn to the north, widening to a divided highway.
