However, the destructor still has a <b>return</b> <b>operation</b> back to C runtime provided by libc. DTrace focuses on data integrity enforcement. We assume a control flow integrity (CFI) enforcement is deployed. Under CFI assumption, the attacker cannot control the program execution directly into the trap operation in the destructor into kernel to disable Intel PT, and jump back to continue program execution without instruction tracing. Furthermore, DTrace works as an enhancement to CFI system as non-control data attacks are a great threat to security-critical applications.|$|E

40|$|We use monads {{to relax}} the {{atomicity}} requirement for {{data in a}} database. Depending on the choice of monad, the database fields may contain generalized values such as lists or sets of values, or they may contain exceptions such as various types of nulls. The <b>return</b> <b>operation</b> for monads ensures that any ordinary database instance will count as one of these generalized instances, and the bind operation ensures that generalized values behave well under joins of foreign key sequences. Different monads allow for vastly different types of information to be stored in the database. For example, we show that classical concepts like Markov chains, graphs, and finite state automata are each perfectly captured by a different monad on the same schema...|$|E

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / November 14 - 16, 1978 / Hyatt House Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe TDRSS {{performance}} is based, {{to a large}} extent, {{on the ability to}} maintain phase coherency between user, satellite, and ground segment. This is especially true for the MA return subsystem, which uses coherent referencing for multiplexing and demultiplexing between the TDRS and ground processor. Phase noise appearing on these referencing waveforms destroy the phase coherency, and will degrade the overall MA <b>return</b> <b>operation.</b> In this paper the manner in which this phase referencing is achieved is described. In addition, the results of a preliminary study to distinguish the key MA return phase noise sources, {{and the manner in which}} each will ultimately influence performance, is presented. The results show that the return phase noise effects can be separated into "coherent" and "noncoherent" contributions, and each must be separately evaluated. The effect of the various tracking loop bandwidths throughout the link is shown, and the manner in which the specific phase noise spectra are eventually filtered is developed...|$|E
40|$|Transpower New Zealand Limited has {{measured}} DC {{currents in}} transformer neutrals in the New Zealand electrical network at multiple South Island locations. Near-continuous archived DC current data exist since 2001, starting with 12 different substations and expanding from 2009 to include 17 substations. From 2001 to 2015 up to 58 individual transformers were simultaneously monitored. Primarily, the measurements {{were intended to}} monitor {{the impact of the}} high-voltage DC system linking the North and South Islands when it is operating in “Earth return” mode. However, after correcting for Earth <b>return</b> <b>operation,</b> as described here, the New Zealand measurements provide an unusually long and spatially detailed set of geomagnetically induced current (GIC) measurements. We examine the peak GIC magnitudes observed from these observations during two large geomagnetic storms on 6 November 2001 and 2 October 2013. Currents of ~ 30 – 50 A are observed, depending on the measurement location. There are large spatial variations in the GIC observations over comparatively small distances, which likely depend upon network layout and ground conductivity. We then go on to examine the GIC in transformers throughout the South Island during more than 151 h of geomagnetic storm conditions. We compare the GIC to the various magnitude and rate of change components of the magnetic field. Our results show that there is a strong correlation between the magnitude of the GIC and the rate of change of the horizontal magnetic field (H′). This correlation is particularly clear for transformers that show large GIC current during magnetic storms...|$|E
