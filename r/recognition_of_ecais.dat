We adjudicate between two existing hypotheses: <b>Recognition</b> <b>of</b> oral spelling uses central reading processes, or <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> oral spelling uses central spelling processes in reverse. We tested the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> oral spelling and spelling to dictation abilities of a single individual with acquired dyslexia and dysgraphia. She was impaired relative to matched controls in spelling to dictation but unimpaired in <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> oral spelling. <b>Recognition</b> <b>of</b> oral spelling for exception words (e. g., colonel) and pronounceable nonwords (e. g., larth) was intact.

40|$|We {{aimed at}} verifying the {{hypothesis}} that facial mimicry is causally and selectively involved in emotion recognition. For this purpose, in Experiment 1, we explored the effect of tonic contraction of muscles in upper or lower half of participants' face {{on their ability to}} recognize emotional facial expressions. We found that the "lower" manipulation specifically impaired <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> happiness and disgust, the "upper" manipulation impaired <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> anger, while both manipulations affected <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> fear; <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> surprise and sadness were not affected by either blocking manipulations. In Experiment 2, we verified whether emotion recognition is hampered by stimuli in which an upper or lower half-face showing an emotional expression is combined with a neutral half-face. We found that the neutral lower half-face interfered with <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> happiness and disgust, whereas the neutral upper half impaired <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> anger; <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> fear and sadness was impaired by both manipulations, whereas <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> surprise was not affected by either manipulation. Taken together, the present findings support simulation models <b>of</b> emotion <b>recognition</b> and provide insight into the role of mimicry in comprehension of others' emotional facial expressions...|$|R

40|$|Early <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> {{childhood}} mental-health {{problems can}} help minimise long-term negative outcomes. <b>Recognition</b> <b>of</b> mental-health problems, needed for referral and diagnostic evaluation, is largely dependent on health-care professionals' (HCPs) judgement of symptoms {{presented by the}} child. This study aimed to establish whether HCPs <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> mental-health problems varies {{as a function of}} three child-related factors (type of problem, number of symptoms, and demographic characteristics). In an online survey, HCPs (n = 431) evaluated a series of vignettes describing children with symptoms of mental-health problems. Vignettes varied by problem type (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Conduct Disorder (CD) and Major Depressive Disorder), number of symptoms presented (few and many), and child demographic characteristics (ethnicity, gender, age and socio-economic status (SES)). Results show that <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> mental-health problems varies by problem type, with ADHD best recognised and GAD worst. Furthermore, recognition varies by the number of symptoms presented. Unexpectedly, a child's gender, ethnicity and family SES did not influence likelihood <b>of</b> problem <b>recognition.</b> These results are the first to reveal differences in HCPs' <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> various common childhood mental-health problems. HCPs in practice should be advised about poor <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> GAD, and superior <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> ADHD, if <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> all childhood mental-health problems is to be equal...|$|R

40|$|Reverse {{engineering}} of {{a communications}} network {{is the process}} of identifying the communications protocol used in the network. This problem arises in various situations such as eavesdropping, intelligent jamming, cognitive radio, and adaptive coding and modulation (ACM). According to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, the first step in reverse engineering of communications networks is <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> physical layer which consists <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> digital modulations and identification of physical layer transmission techniques. The next step is <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> data link layer (consisting <b>of</b> frame synchronization, <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> channel codes, reconstruction of interleavers, reconstruction of scramblers, etc.) and also <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> network and transport layers.

40|$|Researchers {{argue that}} faces are {{recognized}} via {{the configuration of}} their parts. An important behavioral finding supporting this claim is the face-inversion effect, in which inversion impairs <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> faces more than nonface objects. Until recently, faces were the only class of objects producing the inversion effect for untrained individuals. This study investigated whether the inversion effect extends to human body positions, a class of objects whose exemplars are structurally similar to each other. Three experiments compared the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> upright and inverted faces, houses, and body positions using a forced-choice, same/different paradigm. For both reaction time and error data, the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> possible human body postures was more affected by inversion than the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> houses. Further the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> possible human body postures and <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> faces showed similar effects of inversion. The inversion effect was diminished,for impossible body positions that violated the biomechanical constraints of human bodies. These data suggest that human body positions, like faces, may be processed configurally by untrained viewers...|$|R
