During 1919 the station became Sericulture Demonstration Farm-cum-Guts Section.In 1943 by acquiring lands, the Demonstration Farm was converted into Hill <b>Rearing</b> <b>Station.</b> During the years, the increased demand for silk for defense purpose made it imperative for strengthening the station for supply of industrial F1 silkworm seeds. Since the demand for “Foreign Race” to meet the male component necessitated the production of seeds at this station which had favourable climatic conditions the station was converted into Foreign Race Seed Station during 1944 and the station began to collect and maintain different exotic silkworm races from various leading silk producing countries of the World. These races were ultimately supplied to Central Silkworm Seed Station, Sri Nagar in 1958, where they were maintained as Germplasm Bank.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Haringvliet estuary, {{just south}} of Rotterdam, used to connect the North Sea to the Rhine and Meuse rivers, until it was closed for water safety reasons by the Haringvliet dam in 1970. With the closure, the dynamic tidal {{ecosystem}} turned into a stagnant freshwater lake. Fish such as salmon and eel could no longer move between river and sea and largely disappeared from the rivers. In 2011 the Dutch government approved a plan to open partly the sluices in the Haringvliet dam to allow salt water to enter {{a part of the}} estuary and open up a route for migratory fish to reach their spawning grounds upstream. When this happens in 2018, matters will improve for fish migration. However, much more effort is needed to restore the natural estuarine dynamics and bring back life, ecological and economical, to the delta. January 2015, WWF-Netherlands, Natuurmonumenten, Sportvisserij Nederland, ARK Natuurontwikkeling, Staatbosbeheer and Vogelbescherming Nederland were awarded a 13. 5 million Euro grant by the Dutch Post Code Lottery to realise an ambitious restoration of the tidal landscape of the Haringvliet. The programme will aim for restoring the tidal landscape of channels, shoals and sandbanks to host salmon and trout, as well as dolphins, porpoises and water birds. Special attention is given to the European sturgeon, which disappeared from the rivers as a result of pollution and overfishing. A <b>rearing</b> <b>station</b> and reintroduction programme will bring back this majestic fish. There will be special attention to reducing the threats of professional fisheries in the Haringvliet estuary and around the dam in specific. Options are to change to different fishing methodologies and to develop fish free zones around the dam. The Haringvliet delta is not only in need of an ecological boost, but also an economic one. Public access to restored nature is part of the wider plan. This approach will provide lots of opportunity for sustainable economic development in the region...|$|E

40|$|FAO {{assisted}} the Government of Ethiopia under the Technical Cooperation Programme through projects TCP/ETH/ 2307 and TCP/ETH/ 4405 in planning {{the development of}} a crocodile farm to enable the country to export crocodile skins. As a result of this assistance, the Government initiated construction of a crocodile hatchery and <b>rearing</b> <b>station</b> at Arba Minch, and requested UNDP/FAO assistance in order to obtain the expertise, training and equipment necessary for the effective management of the station. This assistance was provided through the UNDP/FAO project ETH/ 84 / 009 The experiences of the project suggested that crocodile farming using the technology adopted at Arba Minch could form the basis for a successful commercial export venture. However, two main issues needed to be resolved concerning the operation of the Arba Minch farmFirstly, problems have been encountered in ensuring a sustainable supply of low-cost food because supplies of fish offal that had been expected from another organization were not forthcoming. The farm has therefore had to rely on ad hoc hunting and the purchase of expensive fish fillets. A possible solution was for the farm to catch low-value fish species not wanted for industrial purposes or for human consumption from Lakes Chamo and Abaya. A proposal was made for a two-year project that would develop organizational and technological approaches for exploiting this resource, and it was recommended that the Government seek assistance from the international donor community for its implementationThe second issue concerned the proposal made to the Government by a foreign firm for the more intensive rearing of crocodiles in a totally controlled environment. Although the introduction of this technology would result in faster growth and greater uniformity of the crocodiles, it would require increased investment as well as higher inputs of energy, water and scarce management skills. It was strongly recommended that the Government undertake a careful and thorough analysis of the economic feasibility of the proposal before making a final decisio...|$|E
40|$|Since tagging of Slllolts {{began in}} Ireland {{there have been}} sixteen distant water recaptures, of adult salmon tagged as Slllolts or parr in Irish waters.

40|$|Although {{crocodile}} {{resources are}} still plentiful and widely distribu ted in the Solomon Islands, they {{are subject to}} intense hunting pressure, both for commerci al purposes and because crocodiles are not usually tolerated near human settlements. Althou gh a few people have tried to rear young crocodiles in captivity, no skins are known to h ave been obtained through rearing. Moreover, experience in Papua New Guinea has shown th at it is difficult to raise the animals in captivity and perhaps impossible with the limi ted facilities available in remote villagesEarnings from the currently exported skins were minimal, partly beca use of poor preparation following opportunistic hunting in remote areas and partly beca use the salt- water crocodile is a protected species in terms of the `Convention on Internatio nal Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora' (CITES), which severely limits the p ossible marketIf the Solomon Islands were to benefit from a more rational exploita tion of their crocodile resources, a radical change in the management strategy was needed. Th e available stock cannot immediately support large-scale commercial rearing. It was recomme nded that the Government discourage crocodile hunting for skins, in favour of a small, wel l-controlled ranching operation, which would {{serve as a model for}} future expansion and hold w astage to a minimum. Appropriate changes in legislation, and localized conservation measu res, would also assist in building up the stock and would support a submission to CITES to allow commercial activities with this species. It was also recommended that the Solom on Islands become a party to CITES, in order, ultimately, to gain access to the European ma rketIt was further recommended that a hatchery and <b>rearing</b> <b>station</b> be bu ilt for demonstration purposes at the Mamara slaughterhouse; it should be possible to p roduce about 500 skins a year with the offal presently available, and it was recommended that food trials with fish waste be conducted, in preparation for the establishment of expanded r earing facilities based on the fish canneriesTo this end, it was likely that the Government would require technic al support and external assistance in the fields of legislation and organization, rearing t echnology, extension, and the training of national officers.

40|$|Baltic salmon (Salmo salar) populations {{originating}} from the Swedish East Coast {{have suffered from}} the reproduction disorder M 74 since 1974. Between 1992 – 96 the mean frequency of M 74 in Swedish compensatory <b>rearing</b> <b>stations</b> varied between 50 and 80 %. The highest recorded incidence of M 74 was in 1993 when 96 % of all family groups from the River Ume developed M 74. Since 1997 the mean annual frequency of M 74 in Swedish compensatory <b>rearing</b> <b>stations</b> has been about 25 %. Finnish and Estonian Baltic salmon have also demonstrated development of M 74 in the 1990 s. Several factors have been hypothesized {{to be involved in}} the aetiology including loading of man-made pollutants, lowered levels of antioxidant compounds and large-scale changes of the food web with accompanying alterations of the nutritional quality of the basic prey species for Baltic salmon (Norrgren et al. 1993 a; Börjeson and Norrgren 1997). However, today it is evident that the primary cause of M 74 is a deficiency in thiamine (Vitamin B 1) due to a poor maternal transfer (Amcoff et al. 1998 a). M 74 -similar syndromes (EMS and Cayuga Syndrome) also affect several salmonid species in the North American Great Lakes (Fisher et al. 1995 : Fitzsimons 1995; Marcquenski and Brown 1997). Thiamine is essential as a co-factor for three enzymes necessary in carbohydrate metabolism: the transketolase in the non-oxidative part of the penthose phosphate shunt; the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in the junction between the glycolytic pathway and the citric acid cycle; and the a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex in the citric acid cycle.
