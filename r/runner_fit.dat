50|$|Full-scale {{work on the}} TsKB-12 {{prototype}} {{began in}} June 1933, and the aircraft was accepted into production on 22 November 1933, a month before it took to the air. The TsKB-12 was of mixed construction, using a wooden monocoque fuselage and wings employing a KhMA chrome-molybdenum steel alloy wing spar, dural ribs and D1 aluminum alloy skinning on the center and leading edges, with the remaining portions of the wings fabric covered. Another modern feature were the ailerons which ran along almost the entire trailing edge of the wing and also operated as flaps (in the manner of more modern flaperons) by drooping 15°. The cockpit was covered by a 40-centimetre-wide (16 in) canopy which featured an Aldis-type tubular gun sight which could slide {{back and forth on}} <b>runners</b> <b>fitted</b> with rubber bungee cords. A 225 l (59.4 US gal) fuel tank was fitted {{directly in front of the}} cockpit. The main landing gear was fully retractable by a hand crank. The armament consisted of a pair of 7.62×54mmR (0.30 in) ShKAS machine guns in the wings, mounted on the outboard side of the main gear and 900 rounds of ammunition.|$|R
50|$|He only {{switched}} to athletics {{at the age}} of 20. Fiasconaro discovered his running talent after the president of the Celtic Harriers Running Club at the time, Stewart Banner, suggested that the rugby team train with his <b>runners</b> to get <b>fit.</b> Banner became Fiasconaro's trainer.|$|R
6000|$|In {{some places}} the hind wheels are taken off, and sledge <b>runners</b> are <b>fitted</b> to the hind axletree. This is an {{excellent}} plan; it has the further advantage that the wagon settles down into a more horizontal position than before. I have seen timber carried on a wagon down a steep hill by separating the front wheels from the hind ones, lashing a trail (see [...] "Travail" [...] below) or two short poles to the fore axletree, and resting {{one end of the}} timber on the hind axletree, and the other end on the trail.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a new system}} for analysis of walking and running gaits. The system {{is based on a}} network of wireless nodes with various types of embedded sensors. It has been designed to allow long-term recording in outdoor environments and was tested during the 2010 "Sultan Marathon des Sables" desert race. A <b>runner</b> was <b>fitted</b> with the sensory network for six days of the competition. Although technical problems have limited the amount of data recorded, the experiment was nevertheless suc- cessful: the system did not interfere with the runner, who finished with a high ranking, the concept was validated and high quality data were ac- quired. It {{should be noted that the}} loss of some of the measurements was mainly due to problems with the cable connectors between the nodes and batteries. In this paper, we describe the technical aspects of the system developed, the experimental conditions under which it was validated, and give examples of the data obtained with some preliminary processing...|$|R
5000|$|The former {{blockade}} <b>runner</b> {{was then}} <b>fitted</b> {{out at the}} New York Navy Yard for blockade duty off the Confederate coast. No logs for the ship seem to have survived, and no other documents have been found which record the date of her being placed in commission by the Union Navy. However, {{we do know that}} her active service began on or before 13 June 1863, for on that night Adela - commanded by Acting Volunteer Lt. Louis N. Stodder [...] left the navy yard, bound for Key West, Florida, to join the East Gulf Blockading Squadron.|$|R
60|$|The yard of the Vaughan resembled that {{of other}} large collieries. It was a large space, black and grimy, on which lines of rails were laid down in all directions; on these stood trains of waggons, while here and there were great piles of coal. In the centre rose up a lofty {{scaffolding}} of massive beams. At {{the top of this}} was the wheel over which a strong wire rope or band ran to the winding engine close by, while from the other end hung the cage, a wooden box some six feet square. At the corner of this box were clips or <b>runners</b> which <b>fitted</b> on to the guides in the shaft and so prevented any motion of swinging or swaying. So smoothly do these cages work that, standing in one as it is lowered or drawn up, only a very slight vibration or tremor tells that you are in motion. Near the square house in which stood the winding engine was another precisely similar occupied by the pumping engine.|$|R

This device {{will be included in}} the new test rig and will be used to test the effect of the jet control technique for swirling flows in hydraulic turbines. For the available pump is necessary to replace the impeller with Francis turbine runner and guide vanes. Loading the turbine runner will be made with an electrical generator, heaving maximum 10 kW and 3000 rpm. As a result, is necessary to found optimum parameters for <b>runner</b> design and <b>fitted</b> dimensions for to fill the available space by impeller replacement...|$|R
60|$|What a sight met my eyes! In {{the front}} stood the negro, {{grinning}} {{from ear to}} ear; for he deemed every disaster that occurred on <b>runners</b> a <b>fit</b> subject for merriment. Who ever did anything but laugh at seeing a sleigh upset?--and it was consequently quite in rule to do so on seeing two overgrown boys roll over from a hand-sled. I could have knocked the rascal down, with a good will, {{but it would not}} have done to resent mirth that proceeded from so legitimate a cause. Had I been disposed to act differently, however, the strength and courage necessary to effect such a purpose would have been annihilated in me, by finding myself standing within three feet, and directly in front of Anneke Mordaunt and Mary Wallace! The shame at being thus detected in the disastrous termination of so boyish a flight, at first nearly overcame me. How Guert felt I do not know, but, for a single instant, I wished {{him in the middle of}} the Hudson, and all Albany, its Dutch Church, sleds, hill, and smoking burghers included, on top of him.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} still more to him. A ten years' widower, without issue, {{he was the most}} {{eligible}} and most pathetically sought-after marriageable man in all Hawaii. A clean-and-strong-featured brunette, tall, slenderly graceful, with the lean <b>runner's</b> stomach, always <b>fit</b> as a fiddle, a distinguished figure in any group, the greying of hair over his temples (in juxtaposition to his young- textured skin and bright vital eyes) made him appear even more distinguished. Despite the social demands upon his time, and despite his many committee meetings, and meetings of boards of directors and political conferences, he yet found time and space to captain the Lakanaii polo team to more than occasional victory, and on his own island of Lakanaii vied with the Baldwins of Maui in the breeding and importing of polo ponies.|$|R
30|$|Since {{scientific}} data about endurance and ultra-endurance athletes following a vegan diet is limited the NURMI Study {{will be the}} first study to assess this issue considering a bigger sample size. The NURMI Study aims to provide a large data set comparing respective subgroups of omnivorous, vegetarian and vegan runners ranging from epidemiological aspects, dietary and training habits, in-race dietary consumption, and performance measurements. Large numbers of participants will allow to discriminate between and, identify associations with, different dietary patterns and level of training status as well as to detect differences in running performance between subgroups of omnivores, vegetarians and vegans. To make sure to assess <b>fit</b> <b>runners</b> only the NURMI Study focuses on runners who are at least capable of coping the half-marathon distance as the primary inclusion criteria.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 Athletic workout {{clothing}} {{is designed to}} help the wearer stay comfortable, cool, and dry. There are several different styles of athletic apparel available at retailers and each individual has a preference as to what is comfortable for him or her. Comfort of clothing has traditionally been related to the fabric feel and thermal comfort of the individual. However, comfort can be defined with numerous other variables; such as fit, the environment, and the style of the garment. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} is to understand how <b>runners</b> perceive the <b>fit,</b> skin sensation and thermal comfort of three style treatments of running pants. In each treatment, the textile, environment, and fit of the pant was controlled. The three pant treatments were Style A: fitted pant with 0...|$|R
5000|$|Toyota {{designed}} the engine for performance; the valve angle {{was a relatively}} wide 50 degrees, {{which at the time}} was believed to be ideal for high power production. Today, more modern high-revving engines have decreased the valve angle to 20 to 25 degrees, which is now believed to be ideal for high-revving engines with high specific power outputs. The first generation 4A-GE is nicknamed the [...] "bigport" [...] engine because it had intake ports of a very large cross-sectional area. While the port cross-section was suitable for a very highly modified engine at very high engine speeds, it caused a considerable drop in low-end torque due to the decreased air speeds at those rpms. To compensate for the reduced air speed, the first-generation engines included the T-VIS feature, in which dual intake <b>runners</b> are <b>fitted</b> with butterfly valves that opened at approximately 4,200 rpm. The effect is that at lower rpm (when the airspeed would normally be slow) four of the eight runners are closed, which forces the engine to draw in all its air through half the runners in the manifold. This not only raises the airspeed which causes better cylinder filling, but due to the asymmetrical airflow a swirl is created in the combustion chamber, meaning better fuel atomization. This enabled the torque curve to still be intact at lower engine speeds, allowing for better performance across the entire speed band and a broad, flat torque curve around the crossover point. During rising engine speed, a slight lurch can occur at the crossover point and an experienced driver will be able to detect the shift in performance. Production of the first-generation engine model lasted through 1987.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} stride frequency on ventilation in different subject populations, the ventilatory responses to walking and running at similar metabolic loads were studied in 29 males. Ten of the males were well-trained, highly <b>fit</b> <b>runners</b> (HFR), ten were well-trained, highly fit cyclists (HFC), and nine were healthy low-fit males (LFM) who did not engage in any form of regular exercise. All subjects completed two separate exercise bouts, a level run and an uphill walk, at 90 % of their ventilatory threshold. Stride frequency was found to increase by 49 % between the walk and run trials. Minute ventilation (V̇ E), tidal volume (VT), breathing frequency (f), end-tidal CO 2 tension (PETCO 2), end-tidal O 2 tension (PETO 2), and inspiratory time (TI) were all significantly different (P 2, PETO 2, and TI were significantly different. Only PETCO 2 and TI {{were found to be}} significantly different between the walk and run trials for the LFM. These results suggest that stride frequency affects ventilation to varying degrees dependent upon the subject population and that the mechanisms for the hyperpnea of moderate exercise operating in each of these subject populations involve a complex interaction of many factors...|$|R
5000|$|The {{idea for}} the {{original}} Ironman Triathlon arose during the awards ceremony for the 1977 Oʻahu Perimeter Relay. Among the participants were representatives of both the Mid-Pacific Road Runners and the Waikiki Swim Club, whose members had long been debating which athletes were more <b>fit,</b> <b>runners</b> or swimmers. On this occasion, U.S. Navy Commander John Collins pointed out that {{a recent article in}} Sports Illustrated magazine had declared that Eddy Merckx, the great Belgian cyclist, had the highest recorded [...] "oxygen uptake" [...] of any athlete ever measured, so perhaps cyclists were more fit than anyone. Collins and his wife Judy Collins had taken part in the triathlons staged in 1974 and 1975 by the San Diego Track Club in and around Mission Bay, California, as well as the 1975 Optimist Sports Fiesta Triathlon in Coronado, California. A number of the other military athletes in attendance were also familiar with the San Diego races, so they understood the concept when Collins suggested that the debate should be settled through a race combining the three existing long-distance competitions already on the island: the Waikiki Roughwater Swim (2.4 mi./3.86 km), the Around-Oahu Bike Race (115 mi./185.07 km; originally a two-day event) and the Honolulu Marathon (26.219 mi./42.195 km).|$|R
