The cows were housed in a naturally ventilated barn with cubicles and a slatted floor, were fed ensiled forages and feed supplements, and each day were allowed 8. 5 h of grazing. The experiment was a balanced randomized block design, replicated 3 times. The experimental factor was the bulk milk urea level, which was adjusted to levels of 15, 35, and 55 mg of urea per 100 g of milk, respectively, by changing the level of nitrogen fertilization of the pasture, the herbage mass and grass regrowth age, and the level and type of feed supplement. Ammonia emission from the barn was measured using sulfur hexafluoride as the tracer gas. Ammonia emission generally increased upon an increase in adjusted milk urea levels. A dynamic regression model was used to predict ammonia emission from bulk milk urea concentration, temperature, and a slurry mixing index. This model accounted for 66 % of the total variance in ammonia emission and showed that emission increases exponentially with increasing milk urea concentration. At levels of 20 and 30 mg of urea per 100 g of milk, ammonia emission increased by about 2. 5 and 3. 5 %, respectively, when milk urea concentration increased by 1 mg/ 100 g.

Data were collected and relationships developed between (i) herbage production, herbage N content and fertilizer input, (ii) N utilization by cattle and N intake, (iii) soil mineral N accumulation and non-harvested N from fertilizers and urine, and (iv) soil mineral N and nitrate concentration in the upper groundwater. Validation of the model shows good agreement with measured data from farms and monitoring programmes. Calculations show that even on dry sandy soils nitrate concentrations of 50 mg 1 − 1 in the upper groundwater can be realized {{by a combination of}} <b>restricted</b> <b>grazing</b> during the growing season, housing earlier in the season and reduced fertilizer input. The effects of stocking rate, ratio dairy cows:young stock, milk production level, supplementary feeding, drought and urine scorch are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|A {{community}} called [...] "Clatsop Plains" [...] {{was established}} and incorporated in 1870, {{primarily for the}} purpose of <b>restricting</b> cattle <b>grazing</b> along the sea ridge. This grazing was destroying the ridge grass and plants that prevented sand from blowing onto the nearby farms. As incorporated originally, [...] "Clatsop Plains" [...] extended from the Skipanon River to Seaside. An actual town eventually came into being about a mile north of Seaside, and was later absorbed into Gearhart. However, its early proximity to Seaside is probably why Seaside itself was sometimes referred to Clatsop Plains.|$|R
40|$|Leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) is an exotic, deep-rooted, {{perennial}} weed native to Europe and Asia. It was first {{reported in the}} United States in Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1827, where it likely established from contaminated soil left from ship ballasts. This invasive weed quickly spread westward across North America, accelerated by multiple reintroductions from contaminated crop seed including oat (Avena fatua L.), smooth brome (Bromus inermis Leyss.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) brought by European settlers. Leafy spurge is now abundant on the northern Great Plains of the United States and the prairie provinces of Canada, where it often forms stands dense enough to displace native plants and <b>restrict</b> cattle <b>grazing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nonylphenol (NPs) and {{nonylphenol}} ethoxylates (NPEOs) {{enter the}} environment {{during the course}} of land-application of sewage sludge (biosolids). These xenoestrogens have been previously reported in biosolids at concentrations as high as parts per thousand, g/kg (dry weight). Here we examine their residence time and potential for migration during runoff events from pasturelands that received biosolids (anaerobic and aerobic/lime stabilized). Biosolid aggregates (> 0. 5 cm) were randomly collected for analysis from these fields at 50 and 175 days after application. Concentrations from each set were compared to the original material. Minimal mineralization was observed 50 days after application, but was substantially greater at 175 days for NPs and NPEOs. Surface runoff created by means of applying artificial rainfall to the biosolids treated and control pasture-plots were compared. Greater levels (P < 0. 05) of NPs and NPEOs were observed for the treated plots (range 1. 69 to 5. 35 µg/L). A stronger correlation (R 2 = 0. 562) between NP concentrations and PtOC (particle organic carbon) was also observed compared to DOC (dissolved organic carbon) (R 2 = 0. 125) and TOC (total organic carbon) (R 2 = 0. 252), indicating that NPs were more associated with runoff solids. Although not conclusive, during the first 50 -days after application grazing animals have the greatest potential to be exposed to NPs and NPEOs with burdens continuing at a minimum up to six months thereafter. (U. S. regulations <b>restrict</b> <b>grazing</b> up to 30 days after application.) It also appears that these xenoestrogens have the potential to migrate with runoff from biosolid-applied fields during rainfall events...|$|R
40|$|Outcomes of {{competitive}} mycelial interactions determine saprotrophic fungal community composition and are regulated by biotic (e. g. invertebrate grazing) and abiotic (e. g. climate) factors. Selective grazing can moderate {{the effects of}} elevated temperature on fungal interactions. In natural systems, however, patchy and aggregative distributions of invertebrates exert unequal grazing pressures on competing fungi. We explored whether restricting grazing to the territory of one fungal competitor affected the potential of Oniscus asellus (Isopoda) to control the outcomes of interactions and mediate responses to elevated temperature. <b>Restricted</b> <b>grazing</b> prevented the dominance of any one fungal species {{in the majority of}} interactions and, indirectly, altered the influence of warming. The location of grazer restriction was, however, only important during certain interactions. Selective pressures reflected feeding preferences, but grazer location determined the extent of selective grazing pressure exerted. Aggregation of macro-invertebrate grazers appears important in maintaining multi-species assemblages of wood-decomposer fungi in a changing climate...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of digital dermatitis (DD) in dairy cows has increased considerably {{over the last}} 10 years in The Netherlands, resulting in a current prevalence of 30 % in cows kept in cubicle houses. Our objective was to evaluate a diversified sample of cow- and herd-related risk factors for DD in dairy cows housed in cubicle houses with different flooring systems. Associations were analysed in random-effects logistic-regression models using 2134 cows (37 herds) and 2892 cows (47 herds) in the pasture and housing studies, respectively. At cow-level, the odds of having DD were increased {{in the case of}} lower parity and lactation. Important risk factors at herd-level were: <b>restricted</b> <b>grazing</b> time, fast rise in concentrate amount after calving, feeding by-products, herd trimming only at long intervals, and introduction of dry cows into the lactating herd before calving.

30|$|Within the Mara ecosystem, {{where the}} tourism ‘product’ demands {{international}} acclaim, a new conservation model has emerged under {{the premise of}} wildlife conservation and community empowerment/prosperity. Having been experimented elsewhere in Kenya (e.g. Laikipia) and more broadly (e.g. Namibia), this new model, termed a conservancy, {{can be defined as}} a commons institution (Hoole and Berkes 2010) whereby individual landowners or communal resource users pool lands to create a singular trust where benefits from wildlife and tourism development are shared by participants (Sorlie 2008). In the Mara, this model has resulted in a leasing arrangement whereby Maasai landowners agree to limit resource use by physically moving off the land, <b>restricting</b> <b>grazing</b> and cultivation activities and adjusting other land uses that may conflict with wildlife conservation. The landowners then partner with local, national and/or international tourism operators, who pay for exclusive access within the conservancy boundary and all tourism infrastructures. Rather than a commons resource institution, the Mara conservancy model appears more like a business partnership, where Maasai landowners are directly linked to private enterprise. They agree to vacate portions of their land and forego grazing rights in key conservation areas in exchange for monthly, guaranteed payments by leasing ecotourism operators, independent of tourist volume. The emergence of conservancies in the Mara, a story unto itself, largely falls within three distinct drivers as interpreted by research participants: (1) the historical failures to protect user rights and re-distribute tourism rents to adjacent communities (e.g. wildlife associations); (2) the emergence of new business and/or profit-seeking interventions and opportunities that improve the quality of tourist experiences in a period of overused, aesthetically degraded national parks (e.g. demand to ‘save’ the tourism industry from overcrowded mass tourism); and (3) a growing sense within domestic and international discourses of the urgency to conserve un-fragmented landscapes for the conservation of charismatic mega fauna (e.g. the sense that after privatization, as in other areas of Maasailand, rangelands are divided, fenced, turned to crops, and otherwise undesirable for wildlife and associated tourism).|$|R
30|$|In Chepareria, {{enclosures}} {{were established}} to provide dry-season grazing reserves (Makokha et al. 1999; Kitalyi et al. 2002). Initially, enclosures were only used as dry-season fodder reserves while livestock were grazed {{in the open}} range during the rainy season. However, the continuous establishment of enclosures in Chepareria has reduced the available communal land, hence <b>restricting</b> livestock <b>grazing</b> within individual enclosures only. With reduced communal and individual land holdings, the need to diversify and complement sources of household livelihood, particularly from land use among enclosure owners, is gaining momentum. While the dominance of livestock-based management regimes in our study reaffirms previous studies which report that enclosures in African rangelands were mainly established for livestock grazing (Gaani et al. 2002; Nedessa et al. 2005; Napier and Desta 2011), we have also observed agricultural diversification of land use among enclosure owners to include crop cultivation, contractual grazing and fodder/grass seed production.|$|R
30|$|The {{rangeland}} management projects were not successful either. Notable among the failed projects {{in this regard}} is the Southern Rangeland Development Unit in Borana, which tried to introduce water into dry places. This led to the removal of the traditional clear distinction between dry season and wet season pasture in Borana. As a result, the movement of herds is greatly <b>restricted</b> with herdsmen <b>grazing</b> all the year round in the vicinities of their permanent settlements (Hogg 1987; Helland 2000; Ayalew 2001). This has resulted in a process of resource depletion in the area (Hogg 1987).|$|R
