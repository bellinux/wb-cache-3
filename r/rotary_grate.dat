5000|$|In 1906, the {{engineer}} Curt von Grueber established a {{company for the}} design and sale of Kent mills in Berlin. Curt von Grueber Technisches Bureau - the forerunner of Loesche GmbH -was a manufacturer of cement and phosphate mills. In 1912, the company began manufacturing its products in its own manufacturing facility, initially in Berlin-Hohenschönhausen and later in Berlin-Teltow. Its range of products included Maxecon [...] mills, Hauenschild <b>rotary</b> <b>grate</b> kilns, {{and all kinds of}} machinery for cement production, including crushers and screw conveyors.|$|E
40|$|Mass {{burning of}} the medical waste is {{becoming}} attr active in China because Chinese government has banned landfilling of medical waste. Many advantages {{can be found in}} this method, such as reduction in waste vol-ume, destruction of pathogens and transformation of waste into the form of ash. However, the medical waste with high moisture in China is not suitable to be trea ted in the present direct mass burning incinerators. In this paper, a novel integral incinera tor is developed with combining a f eeder, a <b>rotary</b> <b>grate,</b> a primary com-bustion chamber (PCC) and a “coaxial” secondary combustion chamber (SCC) into a unique unit. Its capa-bility is 10 ton/day. As the air excess level in the PCC was only 40 % stoichiometric ratio, the PCC acted as a gasifier. The 1. 0 excess air ratios in the SCC preserved the purpose of full combustion of flue gas. Tempera-ture and pollutants concentration in the SCC were m easured to understand the combustion behavior of vola-tile organics. Emission concentrations of pollutants before stack were also tested and compared with the China National Incineration Emission Standard. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Medical waste {{constitutes}} one of {{the waste}} streams that should be dealt with special priority due to its potential negative impact on public health and on the environment. Incineration {{is a process that}} is widely used for the treatment of medical waste. However, self-supporting combustion of medical waste cannot avoid releasing many hazardous pollutants into our environment. The most favored solutions are firing additional fuels of high calorific value and direct purification by air pollution control devices (APCD). This process entails not only large first time investment but also an increase in the operation cost. A novel incinerator is proposed for better utilization of energy of the incineration process. Its originality is essen-tially due to combining a feeder, a <b>rotary</b> <b>grate,</b> a cylindrical gasifier and a “coaxial” secondary combustion chamber into a unique unit. The structure of the incinerator as well as the principle of the incineration process is presented in this paper. A full-scale trial of the novel incinerator with APCD was carried out from March to May 2008 to investigate how the distinct configuration influenced the incineration process. Data on PM, CO, NOX,O 2 were recorded by a continuous emission monitoring system during the study period. Heavy metals and PCCD/Fs were also sampled and measured. Measuring results were compared with the China and U. S. EPA guidelines. The concentrations of contaminants were below their respective limits in emission control standards. Results from testing the novel medical waste incinerator confirmed that this technology has a good suitability for neutralization of medical wastes and purification of flue gases.
