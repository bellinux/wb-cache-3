5|$|Persona 4 {{takes place}} in the fictional, rural Japanese town of Inaba, which lies among {{floodplains}} and has its own high school and shopping districts. Unexplained murders have taken place in the small town, where bodies are found dangling from television antennas and their cause of death being unknown. At the same time, <b>rumor</b> <b>has</b> begun to spread that watching a switched-off television set on rainy midnights will reveal a person's soulmate. The game also follows the main characters into the TV World, a fog-shrouded realm filled with monsters called Shadows, which can only be accessed through TV sets.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Wind River Indian Reservation, the U.S. Cavalry constructed Fort Brown on the reservation lands, which was subsequently renamed Fort Washakie. During the late 19th century, the fort was staffed by African-American members of the U.S. Cavalry, better known as the Buffalo Soldiers, including the second African-American graduated from the United States Military Academy, John Hanks Alexander. Chief Washakie is buried at the fort, which is located immediately east of the forest boundary. <b>Rumor</b> <b>has</b> it that Sacajawea, the Shoshone Indian who provided invaluable assistance to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is also buried here, but it is now considered that this is unlikely and that her actual burial place was Fort Lisa in North Dakota.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the group's existence, the {{individual}} members have ostensibly attempted to operate under anonymity, preferring instead to have {{attention focused on}} their art output. Much outside speculation and <b>rumor</b> <b>has</b> focused on {{this aspect of the}} group. In public, the group appears silent and costumed, often wearing eyeball helmets, top hats and tails—a long-lasting costume now recognized as its signature iconography.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{specific}} nat called an ouktazaung that is said to guard treasure. <b>Rumor</b> <b>has</b> it that this ouktazaung lures men to them, similar to a siren, in Greek mythology. If the victim is caught by the ouktazaung it takes her place and the ouktazaung can roam free, but only for twenty years, after which she must return to her treasure. A village will traditionally also have a spirit which is the patron of their village; {{this is called a}} Bo Bo Gyi.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1980s, a {{widespread}} rumor regarding flashing headlights was spread mainly through fax, and later on the internet. The rumor stated that various gangs across the United States carry out an initiation wherein the initiate drives around at night with his headlights off. Whichever driver flashes his headlamps {{in response to the}} unlit car becomes the target; to complete the initiation, the prospective gang member must hunt down and shoot, kill, assault, or rape the target. The story was widely spread by many government organizations, including the New Mexico State Police. This <b>rumor</b> <b>has</b> been proven an urban legend.|$|E

25|$|Although the <b>rumor</b> <b>has</b> long persisted {{that the}} bodies were taken to Dachau and burned there, they were {{actually}} incinerated in a crematorium in Munich, and the ashes scattered over the river Isar. The French judges suggested that the military condemned (Göring, Keitel and Jodl) be shot by a firing squad, as is standard for military courts-martial, but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges, who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were not worthy of death by being shot, which {{was considered to be}} more dignified. The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} in his youth, Cătărău crossed the Russian border into the Kingdom of Romania, {{swimming}} the Prut River at night. He was promptly arrested by the Gendarmes, but vouched for by philanthropist Gheorghe Burghele. Burghele took Cătărău into his house, and gave him his first lessons in standard Romanian. He then enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, claiming to have suffered repression {{at the hands of}} Russian authorities, and therefore qualifying for a Romanian refugee scholarship. His dossier included forged papers, according to which he had been studying at Odessa University (a parallel <b>rumor</b> <b>has</b> it that Cătărău was actually being pursued for fraud in his native Bessarabia). After obtaining his visa, Cătărău became involved with the cell of Bessarabian exiles, including anarchist Zamfir Arbore and his Milcovul Society.|$|E
25|$|RIT Public Safety is {{the primary}} agency {{responsible}} for protection of students, staff and property as well as enforcement of both college policies and state laws. Officers are NYS Licensed Security Guards who possess an expanded scope of authority under NYS Education Law, and many Officers have prior law enforcement backgrounds. <b>Rumor</b> <b>has</b> also circulated that the department is pushing for Peace Officer authority, however no official action has been made at this time. Public Safety Officers operate both a dispatch center and various types of patrol units on campus and at off campus holdings (such as The Inn and Conference Center) and also manage the Call Box System. Activating a call box will automatically place the user in touch with an Officer in the dispatch center who will direct Patrol Officers {{to respond to the}} location; if necessary, Officers will summon the Monroe County Sheriff's to respond as well. As the college does not have 24/7 on campus crisis intervention counselors, {{in the event of a}} mental or behavioral health incident during hours where a counselor is not available, Public Safety Officers are also trained to act as mediators until an on-call counselor can be summoned.|$|E

25|$|Settlement of {{the area}} did not begin in force until after the American Revolution. The early {{settlers}} cleared the land for farming. Much of this land is still farmed today. John Koch, {{one of the first}} to farm the area in the 1790s, opened the Blue Ball Tavern in 1811. This tavern served travellers on the Carlisle Pike between Carlisle and Sunbury. The tavern offered food, drink, and a sleeping loft. It became a gathering spot for locals as they discussed the news and gossip of the day. The Blue Ball Tavern served as a rest stop for messengers who travelled between Carlisle and Sunbury during the War of 1812. <b>Rumor</b> <b>has</b> it that the tavern was where the plans for the creation of Perry County were made in 1821. The tavern was closed in 1841. A farmhouse was built in 1865 on the foundation of the tavern. Some recycled boards and hardware from the tavern were used in the construction of the farmhouse which currently houses the Blue Ball Tavern Museum and a library that are operated by the Perry County Historical Society.|$|E
500|$|Sixteen {{months after}} the release of Sweet Sixteen and after giving birth to her son, McEntire transitioned into 1990 with the release of <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It. The album's [...] "sound and {{production}} were almost entirely pop-oriented", according to Kurt Wolff of Country Music: The Rough Guide. Although <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It was an attempt to receive critical praise, many reviewers found the album to be [...] "predictable". Stereo Review mainly found the recording displeasing in some places, but the reviewer also believed she [...] "still leaves most of the competition in the dust", calling the album [...] "glorious". <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It eventually sold three million copies by 1999, certifying triple-platinum by that year. It was prefaced by the single [...] "You Lie", which became her fifteenth number-one single on the country chart. In addition, the album's cover of Bobbie Gentry's 1969 hit [...] "Fancy" [...] and a new track, [...] "Fallin' Out of Love", became Top 10 hits on the same Billboard country chart.|$|E
500|$|Also {{in early}} 1996, Nu Millennia Media {{released}} Self Portrait, which included five of Walker's songs in an interactive CD-ROM format and 30 minutes of video footage. He then released his fourth album, 1997's <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It, which he co-produced with Stroud. Its title track, the first single, became his sixth and final No. 1 single that year. Other singles from the album included the number 18 [...] "One, Two, I Love You" [...] and the Top 5 hits [...] "Watch This" [...] and [...] "Then What?" [...] at number 4 and number 2, respectively. The latter also reached number 65 on the Hot 100, making {{for his first}} entry on that chart since [...] "What's It to You." [...] As with his three previous studio albums, <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It was certified platinum. Larry Stephens of Country Standard Time gave this album a mostly-negative review, calling the songs [...] "cookie-cutter" [...] outside [...] "I Need a Margarita". Thom Owens of Allmusic also {{thought that it was}} formulaic, but said that Walker was [...] "able to make even mediocre material sound good", rating it three stars out of five.|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} appearances from Lovato's Sonny with a Chance co-stars Allisyn Ashley Arm, Doug Brochu, Sterling Knight, Michael Kostroff, Brandon Mychal Smith and Tiffany Thornton. The video {{begins with}} Lovato being interviewed on {{a talk show}} called <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It with Benny Beverly (Brochu). After introducing her to the audience, Beverly asks Lovato {{what it is like}} to be a star. A video is then shown to the audience, which serves as the main portion of the clip. In Hollywood, Lovato walks past a [...] "Be-seen section," [...] and bumps into a stranger on the street, which a paparazzo (Knight) takes a picture of. A woman then reads a tabloid magazine with Lovato and the [...] "mystery man" [...] on the cover. The video then cuts to Lovato and the Sonny with a Chance cast at a red carpet event, with paparazzi taking pictures of Lovato wearing Converse sneakers with a dress. Lovato is then shown on the set of a commercial for her perfume, in a pink wig with makeup being applied to her. She is uncomfortable and eventually refuses to cooperate, which angers the director (Smith). The video then cuts back to <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It with applause from the audience and ends with Beverly praising Lovato.|$|E
500|$|McEntire's {{music has}} been {{described}} to not only be built upon traditional country music, but also expand into the genres of Country pop, Mainstream pop, Soul, and R. At times, her music has often been criticized for moving away from traditional country music. Many music critics have often called her music to be [...] "melodramatic", [...] "formulaic", and [...] "bombastic", particularly after her 1988 album Reba. Studio releases such as Sweet Sixteen, <b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It, It's Your Call, and Starting Over have often been described by these terms.|$|E
500|$|One of his {{earliest}} conversations on the film's casting {{was with the}} actress Jennifer Aniston. She was talking about actors she had worked with who she loved, and two of her favorites were Gyllenhaal (The Good Girl) and Mark Ruffalo (<b>Rumor</b> <b>Has</b> It). While researching the film, Fincher considered Jake Gyllenhaal to play Robert Graysmith. According to the director, [...] "I really liked him in Donnie Darko and I thought, 'He's an interesting double-sided coin. He can do that naive thing but he can also do possessed. In preparation for his role Gyllenhaal met Graysmith, and videotaped him to study his mannerisms and behavior.|$|E

500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, <b>rumor</b> <b>has</b> it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him to come down and be part of it. It was several months ago, and he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There is no doubt about it. This man I loved so much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would kill, that if Val came back, if it was trouble for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E
