40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was performed to}} investigate the transmission response of a two-row perforated double <b>ring</b> <b>pile</b> (DP). The tests were conducted in unidirectional waves with different wave conditions and pile porosity that varied from 0. 0625 to 0. 48. From the experimental results, {{it was found that}} when the pile porosity increases, less wave energy was attenuated, resulting in higher wave transmission coefficient, Kt. Furthermore, Kt was found to be decreasing when the wave steepness increases for all porosity values. Moreover, higher water depth has higher Kt especially at low relative depth range between 0. 1 and 0. 15 with Kt being more than 0. 3 at a water depth h ≤ 0. 27 m and Kt was more than 0. 60 when h ≥ 0. 3 m. Tests on spacing B and model width W were also investigated. Wider spacing (B ≥ 0. 5 D) resulted in lower wave attenuation, whilst wider model of more than one row generally attenuated more wave energy as expected. However the percentage of attenuation of the model system with more than two-rows tends to be ineffective, thus indicating that the test model with a width W> 2 D has less influence in attenuating waves. An empirical equation to predict transmission coefficient was also derived based on statistical analyses using independent wave parameters namely relative depth (h/L), wave steepness (Hi/L), relative model spacing (B/L) and model porosity (). A multiple linear regression analysis was used to model the relationship of these variables. Comparisons of transmitted wave performance by other researchers were also analyzed...|$|E

These simulations examined the outcome of collisions between gravitational aggregates, or rubble piles, with the collision speed, mass ratio and coefficient of restitution being the variable parameters. The outcomes proved to be very dependent on collision speed and the coefficient of restitution, and less dependent on mass ratio. These results demonstrate a complicated collisional environment for icy bodies in planetary rings, and shed light on important assumptions made in previous models, most importantly those of complete accretion.

5000|$|A {{part of the}} James A. Roberts {{design for}} the {{original}} Bull Ring Shopping Centre included a 12 storey circular office block. This was revised to 25 storeys, abandoning plans for a rooftop restaurant and a cinema. The design was approved and construction began on the 81 metre (265 ft) building in 1961. It was constructed with aid of a tower crane located {{to the side of}} the reinforced concrete central core. Due to its proximity to a railway tunnel, the main load was built on to a twin <b>ring</b> of <b>piled</b> foundations directly beneath the circular structural core. The floors are supported by the core and perimeter columns. When opened, the podium had shops and its own work of art, [...] "The Rotunda Relief" [...] at Lloyds banking hall, a circular mural designed by John Poole. [...] The building construction was unique at the time, possibly due to the lack of construction space, and was mostly built at ground floor level then 'jacked up' one floor at a time. This allowed the plant room and boiler house, located on the top floor, to have their equipment installed at ground level, making access easier than having to crane the equipment once the building was complete. The supports for the hydraulic pumps used to jack up the building started to shift towards the New Street Station railway lines so the building's planned height was never completed.Completed in 1965 as an office block at a cost of £1 million during the post-war rebuilding of the Bull Ring, it was initially much derided and considered a [...] "dead building". However, suggestions in the 1980s that it should be demolished when the Bull Ring was again redeveloped met with equal, if not greater, hostility from the local populace.|$|R

5000|$|The Tor is a {{prominent}} landmark {{for a wide}} area. It consists of a natural outcrop enveloped by a giant man-made ring cairn and was {{thought to have been}} a religious focal point. Craig Weatherhill in [...] "Cornovia: Ancient Sites of Cornwall & Scilly" [...] calls it [...] "A natural formation of weathered granite, 5 m high ...is surrounded by a massive <b>ring</b> cairn of <b>piled</b> stone 30 m in diameter and up to 1.2 m high. The natural formation was evidently intended as a focal point. No excavations have been recorded at this site, so it is not known how many, if any, burials were associated with this presumably Neolithic or Bronze Age site" [...] Christopher Tilley has estimated the height of the cairn on which the outcrop stands to be 3 m. The granite outcrop is reminiscent of the Cheesewring and made of individual blocks on underlying outcrops formed by erosion along horizontal fractures in the granitic mass. Aerial photography has revealed more about the layout of the structures on Showery Tor and it stands out as the only natural formation to have been used in this way by the cairn designers.|$|R
50|$|The Sand Island is an {{artificial}} island constructed by placing sand within a closed <b>ring</b> of sheet <b>piles</b> {{driven into the}} bed of the river. Two islands were constructed for each pier (one for each of the cylindrical caissons) with the caissons being 28 ft in diameter at the base. The pier on the sloping mud bank also used this method with rectangular caissons. Hornibrook is quoted as stating:"...as far as I am concerned the idea is an original one....The idea came to me one morning about 3 o'clock. I was so much taken up with it that I {{got out of bed and}} commenced to design a scheme to carry out the piers for the Grey Street Bridge."The use of Sand Islands was highly successful and very accurate, and overcame the problem of requiring the cutting edge to be placed directly on dry ground. The material was dredged out of the centre of the caisson and the cylinder progressively sank; however it was necessary to ensure that the caisson was fixed securely to rock and it was therefore essential to ensure man-access into the cylinder. This was achieved by using an air-lock system, but as the men worked under high pressure they could possibly suffer from the bends and an hospital air-lock was located at the surface for repressurisation if required. The foundations for the bridge were very deep, and the experience gained in the construction of this bridge, and later the Story Bridge, was considered of great value and to be a major achievement.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} numerical {{and theoretical}} investigations on the bearing {{capacity of a}} single pile in sand under axisymmetrical loading conditions. An extensive literature review for the existing theories is presented. The published reports showed {{a wide range of}} discrepancies exists among previous theories developed to predict bearing capacity of a single pile in sand. A numerical pile load-testing program was carried out using finite element technique to cover a wide <b>rang</b> of <b>pile</b> geometry and sand states. Mohr-Coulomb criteria were used to model the sand behavior. Linear strain quadrilateral elements were employed to model soil and pile. A chain of slip elements was placed around the pile to model the slippage between sand and pile. The numerical model was validated against field load tests data. The numerical model was then used to analyze stresses influencing the pile behavior in sand and to establish the pile failure mechanism. The stresses and coefficient of earth pressure acting on the pile shaft were reported. A new failure mechanism was developed which varies with: pile geometry, coefficient of earth pressure, shaft roughness and angle of shearing resistance of sand. A theoretical model was developed to predict the ultimate bearing capacity of a single pile in sand, utilizing the proposed failure mechanism. A data analysis procedure was employed to develop the new model parameters predictive formulas. An approximate method to predict the coefficient of earth pressure acting on the pile shaft was developed and used extensively in the theoretical model. A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the varying parameters of the theoretical model. The theoretical model incorporates salient features previously omitted in conventional bearing capacity theories: treating the bearing capacity of a single pile in sand under axisymmetrical conditions, adopting the punching shear failure as a principle failure mode, and accounting for the interdependence between skin friction and tip resistances. The theoretical model showed that the average unit skin and tip resistances increase, but at a lower rate below the critical depth. These findings concur with the recent research conclusions, which indicate that the average skin resistance tends to increase with depth. A computer program "G-Pile" was developed to facilitate the massive mathematical calculations of the theoretical model. The computer program "G-Pile" was used to produce data for charts of the factors needed to predict the bearing capacity of a single pile in sand. A design procedure is proposed and verified against field test results, good agreement was achieved. Recommendations are given for future research...|$|R

Pipe heights from the top surface ofa dummy bomb were set at 200 mm, 700 mm, and 1700 mm, respectively in order to measure the effect of stand-off distance which reduced the feed back of radiative heat flux to the dummy bomb. Radiative heat flux were also measured at O. 1 m, O. 27 m, a. 71 m, 1. Im, 1. 27 m, 1. 71 m, 1. 9 m, 2. 91 n from the pipe at the same horizontal level of the dummy bomb. Temperatures in the dummy bomb and on surface, as well as in a flame along the flame axis (center line ofthe flame) were measured. Dimensionless flame height, HaJD, and dimensionless tlame width, correlated well by 1 / 3 power ofdimensionless heat release rate, Q* 1 I 3. Radiative heat fluxes to the dummy bomb were also estimated using the view factor, and center-line temperature, assuming translucent and mufti- <b>ring</b> flame configuration <b>piled</b> up.

40|$|Groups of piles are {{commonly}} used as high capacity foundations. It is recognised that the load distribution among piles in a group will vary and {{it is thought that}} the inner piles are likely to make a relatively small contribution to the total load carried. The essence of the research undertaken is to establish the relative effectiveness of pile groups with either no inner piles (perimeter group) or a single central pile (target group) when compared to the more commonly used grid group arrangement. Pile groups in which the central piles were omitted were used for the Cannon Place redevelopment in london and provided the impetus for the research project. The main research technique used is geotechnical centrifuge modelling. Samples of overconsolidated kaolin clay were prepared and tested on the centrifuge at City University london. This provided a firm clay into which pile groups could be installed {{in a wide variety of}} arrangements. Three or four different pile groups were located in each centrifuge model and loaded to failure using a strain-rate controlled load actuator. The individual model piles were made of 5 mm diameter aluminium rod placed in holes pre-drilled in the consolidated kaolin prior to the centrifuge test. All piles extended to a depth 250 mm in the clay giving an lId ratio of 50. The ranges of pile groups tested are linear, circular and square perimeter, circular and square target and square grid. Single pile tests provided the reference pile capacities used to normalise the data from the 23 centrifuge models tested. The experimental work was complemented by a parametric numerical modelling study using the finite element programme Abaqus. This gave insight into the pile-soil interaction and permitted a more meticulous analysis of the soil stresses and displacements. In addition, the numerical modelling enabled extension to the original variables tested as part of the centrifuge experiments and the soil shear strength and lId ratio were varied. The pile groups failed in one of two ways: either as individual piles with the piles settling into the ground with no noticeable settlement of the soil surrounding a pile, or as a block with the soil contained within the outer <b>ring</b> of <b>piles</b> settling by the same or xxiv similar amount as the piles. The change from block failure to individual pile failure often occurred at a pile centre-to-centre spacing of about two pile diameters though variables such as number of piles, the presence of a target pile and the strength of the soil all had an effect. The efficiency of a pile group is defined as the load capacity of a pile group expressed as a ratio of the number of the piles in the group multiplied by the load capacity of a single isolated pile. It was demonstrated that a grid group arrangement was the least efficient of the groups tested, whereas a perimeter group arrangement could achieve higher efficiencies of greater than unity and the inclusion of a target pile could further enhance the group efficiency. It has been shown that a target group comprised of 17 piles (16 piles plus one central pile) has a significantly higher efficiency than a 5 x 5 grid group comprised of 25 piles, such that the capacity at lower settlements is the same for both groups...|$|R
40|$|Negative skin {{friction}} (NSF) {{is a common}} problem {{to be considered in}} designing pile foundations located in consolidating ground. Failures of foundations due to either NSF induced compressive axial force (Dragload) or excessive pile foundation settlement (Downdrag) has been widely reported in the literature. The results of eleven centrifuge model tests, numerical simulations and simple analytical solutions were reported which were undertaken to achieve four objectives: first, to investigate response of piles subjected to NSF with different pile tip location with respect to end-bearing stratum layer, and secondly, to study the effect of pile shapes on development of negative shear stress on pile shafts, and thirdly, to investigate and compare behaviour of floating piles subjected to NSF with shielding by either a sacrificing ring or a group of sacrificing piles, and finally, to look at the effect of axial live loads on load transfer mechanism along piles experiencing locked-in NSF [...] In this study, larger downdrag is developed on floating piles and neutral plane (NP) is located lower towards pile tip with stiffer end-bearing layer. Neutral plane locations on a single pile can be estimated by a simple analytical approach considering displacement compatibility, cavity expansion at the pile tip and vertical force equilibrium of piles. It is found that depth of NP increases with increasing end bearing stiffness of pile, interface friction angle and surcharge. Axial load effects on load transfer mechanism of piles with different pile tip location with locked-in dragload are investigated. For single floating piles with Y= 0. 25 D and Y= 1. 00 D, the amount of measured axial load requires to completely overcome the dragload was about 1. 75 Pmax and 1. 44 Pmax, respectively. Unlike single pile, amount of axial load required to eliminate NSF for pile group can be as large as more than 4 times Pmax for the floating pile group. To study the effect of openness of pile sections on load transfer mechanism of NSF, centrifuge and three-dimensional numerical modeling of conventional pile shapes, circular, rectangular with aspect ratio = 2 and H-pile were carried out. Vertical shear mechanism predicts that external shaft friction induced on piles with close sections is insignificant. Only a little reduction in σv̕ result. On the other hand, large reduction in vertical effective stress is experienced by the soil element located at the pan area of an H-pile (open section). Fairly good agreement with centrifuge tests results is made with the analytical prediction by vertical shear mchanism and numerical simulations. The shielding effects on dragload and downdrag are represented quantitatively using two dimensionless terms, Pr and Wr, respectively. The measured Pr of the center pile surrounded by a sacrificing ring with 0. 50 L, 0. 75 L and 1. 00 L length was 42 %, 54 % and 67 %. Correspondingly, measured Wr of the center pile surrounded by a sacrificing ring with 0. 50 L, 0. 75 L and 1. 00 L length was 15 %, 25 % and 50 %. This shows that shielding effect on dragload increase gently with an increase in sacrificing ring length, while the shielding effect on downdrag increase exponentially with an increase in length of the <b>ring.</b> For center <b>pile</b> shielded by means of a group of 3 x 3 sacrificing piles in full length measured Pr and Wr are 47 % and 43 %, respectively. Moreover, the sacrificing ring only occupy one-forth of the material weight of a group of sacrificing piles for the same spacing and provide better shielding effect. Numerical simulations of the centrifuge model tests on center piles revealed that the observed shielding effects on a center pile are attributed to the stress transfer from consolidating soft soil to sacrificing structures. As consolidation proceeds, the relatively stiff sacrificing structure "hang-up" soils, leading to a significant reduction in the σv̕, σh̕ in the soil and thus NSF on center <b>piles.</b> Sacrificing <b>ring</b> provides a better distribution of material to give a larger surface area for hanging up soils. Soils neighboring the center pile are enclosed or isolated by the relatively stiff ring so that stress transfer from far field to the enclosed soils is negligible. This leads to the enhanced reduction in NSF along lengths of the sacrificing ring...|$|R
