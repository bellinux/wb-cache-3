50|$|When Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert first {{described}} the <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> from a South African specimen in 1783, he named it Fringilla ardens, assigning it to a genus of Old World finches. In 1829, William John Swainson created Euplectes, {{and moved the}} widowbirds and bishops from Fringilla into this new genus. Traditionally, Euplectes is thought to contain two clades, with the bishops in one clade and the widowbirds in another. However, molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> is actually a long-tailed bishop rather than a true widowbird. In captivity, they have been successfully bred with southern red bishop, yellow-mantled widowbird, fan-tailed widowbird, and black-winged red bishop.|$|E
50|$|Sarah Pryke is a {{behavioural}} {{and evolutionary}} ecologist. A {{graduate of the}} University of Natal (South Africa), with a PhD from Göteborg University (Sweden), she {{is best known for}} her research on the evolution of sexual signals in the <b>Red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> and more recently research on maternal effects and the evolution of alternative reproductive strategies in the Gouldian finch.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} Eastern and Southern Africa. While their habitats are varied, {{they are often}} found in open grasslands, agricultural areas, clearings in forests, and on slopes with limited tree coverage.|$|R
50|$|The diederik cuckoo is a brood parasite. It lays {{a single}} egg {{mostly in the}} nests of weavers, {{especially}} the village weaver and the bishops in the genus Euplectes. For example, it has been recorded in <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds</b> are not {{considered}} to be globally threatened. They have a very wide range and are found commonly in many regions. They can be found in Kruger National Park, located in South Africa, with a large population of an estimated 2000 individuals. Additionally, the species is found in South and Central Mozambique with approximately 11,000 individuals.|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} the {{molecular}} phylogeny of bishops and widowbirds published in 2008 found that it formed part of a clade along with the fire-fronted bishop (E. diadematus), black-winged red bishop (E. hordeaceus), northern red bishop (E. franciscanus), southern red bishop (E. orix), Zanzibar red bishop (E. nigroventris) and <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> (E. ardens). An alternate common name is Gierow's bishop.|$|E
50|$|A clear {{pattern of}} success emerged, with males with the {{elongated}} tails {{being the most}} successful, followed by the control (normal tail length) males, followed by the males with shortened tails. The result indicated that the long tail is favored by sexual selection through female choice of mates. Female preference for long tails is also seen in the <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird.</b>|$|E
5000|$|During prenuptial moulting, {{prior to}} the {{breeding}} season, the males replace their non-breeding feathers. Males that hold territory have shorter tails and carotenoid collars that are 40% larger than nonbreeding floating males [...] [...] The red collar is for male-male competition, while female choice is based on tail length. [...] Tail length is negatively correlated with carotenoid signal. [...] Also, looking at body size and condition, this accounts for 55% {{of the variation in}} tail length. [...] Body size {{may play a role in}} the variation of size and redness of both territorial and floater males.Female preference for long tails was first observed in long-tailed widowbirds, and then subsequently observed in Jackson’s widowbird and the <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird.</b> Tail length explains 47% of the male’s reproductive success, indicating the strength of this sexual ornament. [...] Tail symmetry, however, does not have an effect on mating success. In the <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> there is a strong trade-off between carotenoid coloration, which is an agonistic signal and tail length, which is an epigamic signal, directly attracting females. These are both costly ornaments that are maintained through multiple receivers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds</b> feed on {{seeds of}} sorghum and other grass seeds. They also feed on nectar, small berries, and insects, {{specifically}} ants, caterpillars, and termites. They often form large roosts, with between 50 and 100 individuals, which feed {{together on the}} ground. These roosts included breeding males. They are often formed with association with other species, like red-billed quelea, fan-tailed widowbird, southern red bishop, white-winged widowbird, and yellow bishop.|$|R
50|$|The {{orange-breasted waxbill}} {{is found in}} {{grassland}} and savannahs south of the Sahara in Africa. It has an estimated global extent of occurrence of 10,000,000 km2. This species is also introduced to other countries, e.g., Kuwait. Its diet consists mainly of seeds, insects and shoots. The female usually lays between four and six eggs in an oval-shaped nest made from grass. These nests are often the old nests of <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} {{characteristics and}} patterns of nest distribution, and their putative costs and benefits to breeding females, in polygynous <b>Red-collared</b> <b>Widowbirds</b> (Euplectes ardens). <b>Red-collared</b> <b>Widowbirds</b> differ from most other Euplectes species, in that male nestbuilding is reduced to simple nest-rings used in courtship; females alone position and build nests in the territories. Females used only 37 % of available territory area for nesting and aggregated at the centers of territories, possibly {{to take advantage of}} male vigilance from prominent central perches or to avoid harassment by neighbors. However, irrespective of territory size or number of females on the territory, females maintained relatively even spacing, with nests 15 m apart. Nest predation rates were higher (28. 2 % day− 1) during the nestling period than during incubation (14. 6 %), but independent of the number of actively nesting females on a territory. During synchronous nestling stages, however, birds nesting close to other birds incurred higher predation costs. Females may, therefore, centrally clump their nests on a territory but maintain enough distance between nests to reduce nest predation. Females choosing unmated males (monogamous) received no greater costs or benefits than females settling with mated males (polygynous). Taken with our earlier finding of strong female preference for longertailed males (Pryke et al. 2001 a), our results here suggest that females may gain indirect genetic benefits of higher-quality offspring without incurring the high costs of sharing territories...|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> (Euplectes ardens) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Ploceidae. Red-collared widowbirds are found in grasslands and bush clearings in Eastern and Southern Africa. They {{are known for their}} long tails and {{brilliant}} red badges, both which act as sexual ornaments. They are often associated with other widowbird and bishop species. They are polygynous, where males acquisition of territory is an important determinant in their access to mates. Red-collared widowbirds have a wide range and there is little concern in terms of conservation status.|$|E
5000|$|To {{explain the}} {{existence}} of multiple handicap signals, multiple receiver hypothesis has been proposed. [...] In an environment, rivals and mates potentially assess different signals, thus making more than one ornament maintain stable condition-dependent signals, reflecting different qualities or associated costs. These signals are maintained because they target different receivers and reflect different aspects of fitness. This is extended to explain increasing complexity of signals, where different receivers are receptive to {{different aspects of the}} same signal. In the case of the <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird,</b> the elongated tail addresses female choice, while the red carotenoid badge addresses aggressive male competition over territory.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> {{has one of}} {{the highest}} {{measured}} plumage carotenoid concentrations in birds. [...] There is a high presence of lutein and zeaxanthin in the feathers, which is consistent with their high dietary consumption of grass seeds. There is a carotenoid basis of ‘redness’ observed in the bird, and studies suggest that its color production is due to enzymatic conversion of dietary pigments into red keto-carotenoids, a costly process. [...] The red collar functions as a dominance signal, which was supported experimentally through manipulation of the badges. The experiment showed that red-collared males dominated orange males, which in turn dominated brown and blue collared males. [...] Furthermore, with additional manipulation of badges, males with enlarged red, enlarged orange, and reduced red collars obtained territories, while those with reduced orange and blackened or removed collars failed to establish or maintain territories. Lastly, males with reduced signals defended smaller territories, had more intruders, and spent more time, thus increased cost, on aggressive interactions. Collectively, these observations led to the conclusion that redness, and to a lesser degree size, indicate dominance status and fighting ability in male contests.|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{to other}} <b>widowbirds,</b> male <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds</b> have both {{seasonal}} and sexual dimorphism. Males are about 25 cm in length while females are only 13 centimeters. A similar trend is seen with weight, where males range from 20 to 26 g and females are only between 16 and 22 grams. During non-breeding seasons, the male plumage is brown, while in breeding season, October to April, they have black plumage {{with a long}} tail, approximately 22 cm, and crescent -shaped carotenoid based chest patch. [...] There is significant variation in brightness, hue, and chroma of the carotenoid badges. [...] In contrast, females and subadults, like nonbreeding males, are streaky dull brown with a short tail, approximately 4 cm. Nonbreeding males, however, retain their black tails, while females and subadults' tails are dark-brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} {{moulting}} in birds is as follows: First, the bird begins to shed some old feathers, then pin feathers grow in {{to replace the}} old feathers. As the pin feathers become full feathers, other feathers are shed. This is a cyclical process that occurs in many phases. It is usually symmetrical, with feather loss equal {{on each side of}} the body. Because feathers make up 4-12% of a bird's body weight, it takes a large amount of energy to replace them. For this reason, moults often occur immediately after the breeding season, but while food is still abundant. The plumage produced during this time is called postnuptial plumage. Prenuptial moulting occurs in <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds</b> where the males replace their nonbreeding plumage with breeding plumage. It is thought that large birds can advance the moult of severely damaged feathers.|$|R
50|$|Typical of {{polygynous}} species, male <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbirds</b> do {{not provide}} parental care. In fact, the only resources males provide are potential nest sites in their territories. They are different from other Euplectes species in that the males use only a simple nest ring in courtship and the females build and position the actual nests. The nests are usually oval in shape and the females line the nests with grass. Females continue {{to add to the}} nest during the incubation. Old nests are often occupied by zebra waxbills. There are usually between 2 and 4 eggs in a clutch, each egg being greyish or blue-green, with brown speckles. The incubation period, done only by the female, is between 12 and 15 days. Females also do all of the feeding, primarily via regurgitation, during the nestling period for the offspring, which is between 14 and 17 days. The nests are commonly parasitized by Diederik cuckoos.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{males are}} able to {{increase}} their reproductive success faster than females {{by being able to}} fertilize eggs faster than females can produce them, males also at a disadvantage when it comes to mating because of sexual selection. Females usually choose males that are 'charming' and those who display sexual ornaments. In a study of long-tailed widowbirds, males with longer tails were sexually selected over those with shorter and less impressive tails. In birds such as the <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird,</b> males who display their sexual ornament during courtship are generally paired up faster and attract more females than males who display shorter tails during courtship. [...] Males are often sexually selected based on their physical characteristics and what they have to 'offer', for example, male peacocks with flamboyant colored tails are sexually selected over those with dull and less elaborate tails. Sexual selection of males by females also leads to male-male competition. Unlike females who invest a lot prior to mating, males do not invest as much when generating their sperm, however this increases competition amongst males for female investment. High sperm competition also means a greater variance in male success—the best competitors will have better success in mating than those who fail to mate. The best sperm competitors will less likely be inclined to care for their offspring upon mating because they have the ability to produce offspring elsewhere. Males with the greatest size, strength, or best developed weapons achieve the greatest mating success. In other cases, males may have a higher reproductive success if they have better access to resources than other competitors. For instance, female hanging flies mate with a male only if he provides a large insect for her to eat during copulation and North American bullfrogs protect ponds and small lakes where females come to lay their eggs.|$|E
40|$|Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} (FA) {{may provide}} a direct test of whether sexual selection via "arbitrary traits" or "good genes" {{is responsible for the}} evolution of epigamic traits, because FA is an epigenetic measure of stress during development. However, tests of the FA hypothesis have yielded equivocal results, and the debate between arbitrary traits and good genes continues. The FA hypothesis predicts a negative relationship between ornament size and asymmetry. In non-ornamental traits, a U-shaped relationship between trait size and asymmetry is expected. We tested these predictions in the <b>Red-collared</b> <b>Widowbird</b> (Euplectes ardens) by examining the relationship between size and asymmetry in the length of the tail, tarsus, and wing. We found no significant linear or second-order polynomial relationships between trait size and asymmetry. Furthermore, no relationship existed between asymmetry and two indices of body condition. This suggests that the tail is not a reliable signal of male quality in the <b>Red-collared</b> <b>Widowbird.</b> However, we argue that the assumptions of the FA hypothesis are too simplistic for this conclusion to be drawn {{with a high degree of}} confidence. Received 13 May 1998, accepted 20 August 1999...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{displays}} often involve {{several different}} ornamental traits. Yet most indicator models of sexual selection {{based on a}} single receiver (usually a choosy female) find that multiple handicap signals should be unstable. Here we study reasons for this contradiction, analyzing signal function, signal content, and trade-offs between signals in the polygynous <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> Euplectes ardens. Males have both a long, graduated tail and a red carotenoid collar badge. Territory-holding "residents" have slightly shorter tails than the nonbreeding "floaters," but their carotenoid collars are 40 % larger, and they have (on the basis of reflectance spectrometry and objective colorimetry) a 23 -nm more long-wave ("redder") hue than floaters. This corroborates experimental evidence that the red collar is selected by male contest competition, whereas female choice is based almost exclusively on male tail length. Tail length is negatively correlated with the carotenoid signal, which together with body size and condition explains 55 % {{of the variation in}} tail length. The trade-off in tail length and carotenoid investment is steeper among residents, suggesting an interaction with costs of territory defense. We propose that the "multiple receiver hypothesis" can explain the coexistence of multiple handicap signals. Furthermore, the trade-off between signal expressions might contribute to the inverse relation between nuptial tail elongation and coloration in the genus Euplectes (bishops and widowbirds) ...|$|E
40|$|Although sexual {{selection}} for elaborate signals {{is well documented}} in numerous species, the extreme diversity in signal design and expression in many taxa is largely unexplained. This thesis explores phylogenetic, mechanistic and ontogenetic explanations for divergence in two classic condition-dependent signal traits in the African widowbirds and bishops (Euplectes spp.); elongated black tails (in widowbirds) and patches of bright yellow or red carotenoid coloration (most prominent in bishops). A molecular phylogeny of 33 Euplectes subspecies (representing all 17 species) was derived using parsimony and Bayesian analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. A consensus tree, or {{a sample of the}} most probable Bayesian trees, was then used in parsimony, likelihood and Bayesian reconstructions of ancestral signal states. Specifically, the discrete presence of a nuptial tail (i. e. prenuptial tail moult), continuous tail length, and discrete as well as continuous reflectance-based measures of carotenoid colour hue were analysed. The proximate basis of interspecific colour variation was investigated using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analyses of feather and plasma pigments in five Euplectes species. Finally, the relative importance of nutritional and metabolic constraints behind differential occurrence of C 4 -keto-carotenoids, and thus red plumage color, in Euplectes, was tested by diet manipulation in a yellow and a red bishop species. Results show monophyly of the genus Euplectes, but not of ‘widowbirds’ or ‘bishops’. Most notably, the <b>red-collared</b> <b>widowbird</b> E. ardens belongs to a clade of short-tailed bishops and not to the ‘true’ widowbirds. Extant Euplectes furthermore derive from ancestors in which breeding males had short (not prenuptially moulted) tails and yellow colour signals. Nuptial tail elongation and red coloration have since evolved at least twice in distinct lineages, possibly as convergent responses to early established and directional {{sexual selection}} for increasingly exaggerated quality advertisements. This provides an interesting contrast to several recent findings of labile ornament evolution in birds and other animals. Three different pigment profiles were identified in Euplectes feathers. Yellow colours primarily depend on dietary yellow carotenoids, while red hues result either from addition of metabolically derived red C 4 -keto-carotenoids, or from high concentrations of dietary and derived yellow pigments. A possible genetic constraint on colour evolution was also identified, as the southern red bishop E. orix, but not the yellow-crowned bishop E. afer, can manufacture red C 4 -keto-carotenoids (α-doradexanthin and canthaxanthin) from yellow dietary precursors (lutein and β-carotene). Combined with previous work on adaptive signal functions in Euplectes, the phylogenetic and proximate analyses in this thesis provide an unusually complete picture of avian plumage diversification, and a useful framework for further exploration of both genetics and ecology of avian colour signalling...|$|E
