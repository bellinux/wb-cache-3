5|$|Marjorie Bowen's 1929 novel Dickon set {{the trend}} for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly {{influential}} was The Daughter of Time (1951) by Josephine Tey. {{in which a}} modern detective concludes that <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> is innocent {{in the death of}} the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel Crown of Roses (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel The Sunne in Splendour, attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel The Murders of <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> was guilty of these and other crimes. A sympathetic portrayal of <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> is given in The Founding, the first volume in The Morland Dynasty series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.|$|E
5|$|Set in the Middle Ages, {{the series}} is written as an {{alternate}} history. It opens on 21 August 1485, {{the eve of the}} Battle of Bosworth Field, which in {{the series is}} won not by Henry Tudor (as in reality) but by <b>Richard</b> <b>III.</b> <b>Richard</b> <b>III,</b> played by Peter Cook, is presented as a good king who doted on his nephews, contrary to the Shakespearean view of him as a hunchbacked, infanticidal monster.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhumation}} and reburial of <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> {{began with}} the discovery of the king's remains within the site of the former Greyfriars Friary Church in Leicester, England, in September 2012. Following extensive anthropological and genetic testing, the remains of <b>Richard</b> <b>III,</b> the last English king killed in battle, were ultimately reinterred at Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.|$|E

5|$|<b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> (2 October 1452– 22 August 1485) was King of England from 1483 {{until his}} death in 1485, at the age of 32, in the Battle of Bosworth Field. He was the last king of the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty. His defeat at Bosworth Field, the last decisive battle of the Wars of the Roses, marked the end of the Middle Ages in England. He is the subject of the {{historical}} play <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> by William Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|The project {{gained the}} backing of several key partners—Leicester City Council, Leicester Promotions (responsible for tourist marketing), the University of Leicester, Leicester Cathedral, Darlow Smithson Productions (responsible for the planned TV show) and the <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> Society. Funding for the initial phase of pre-excavation {{research}} came from the <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> Society's bursary fund {{and members of the}} Looking for Richard project, with Leicester Promotions agreeing to pick up the £35,000 cost of the dig. The University of Leicester Archaeological Services—an independent body with offices at the university—was appointed as the project's archaeological contractor.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Richard's corpse {{was taken}} to Leicester and buried without pomp. His {{original}} tomb monument {{is believed to have}} been removed during the English Reformation, and his remains were lost for more than five centuries, believed to have been thrown into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by the <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> Society on a city council car park on the site once occupied by Greyfriars Priory Church. The University of Leicester identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. Richard's remains were reburied in Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015.|$|E

5|$|Often, Underwood's {{thoughts}} {{throughout the}} series {{are presented in}} a direct address to the audience, a narrative technique known as breaking the fourth wall. Immediately prior to starring in House of Cards, Spacey had starred in a production of William Shakespeare's <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> as <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> of England, a character {{that serves as a}} partial basis for both Urquhart and Underwood. His last name is derived from Oscar Underwood, who served as the first Democratic House Minority Whip from about 1900 to 1901. His few vices include smoking cigarettes and playing video games; when the Secret Service cuts off his online gaming service after he becomes Vice President, he takes up creating model figurines.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 2012, the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, in {{association}} with the <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> Society, announced that they had joined forces to begin a search for the remains of King Richard. The search for <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> was led by Philippa Langley of the Society's Looking For Richard Project with the archaeological work led by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS). Experts set out to locate the lost site of the former Greyfriars Church (demolished during Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries), and to discover whether his remains were still interred there. By comparing fixed points between maps in a historical sequence, the search located the Church of the Grey Friars, where Richard's body had been hastily buried without pomp in 1485, its foundations identifiable beneath a modern-day city centre car park.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 2012, the {{excavators}} {{announced that}} they had identified Greyfriars church and two days later that they had identified the location of Robert Herrick's garden, where the memorial to <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> stood in the early 17th century. A human skeleton was found beneath the Church's choir.|$|E

5|$|<b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> was {{followed}} by another adaptation, the comedy, Love Makes a Man, which was constructed by splicing together two plays by John Fletcher: The Elder Brother and The Custom of the Country. Cibber's confidence was apparently restored {{by the success of}} the two plays, and he returned to more original writing.|$|E
5|$|The unpopularity of Henry VI's {{counsellors}} and his belligerent consort, Margaret of Anjou, {{as well as}} his own ineffectual leadership, led to {{the weakening}} of the House of Lancaster. The Lancastrians faced a challenge from the House of York, so called because its head, a descendant of Edward III, was Richard, Duke of York. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, Edward IV, led the Yorkists to victory in 1461. The Wars of the Roses, nevertheless, continued intermittently during his reign and those of his son Edward V and brother <b>Richard</b> <b>III.</b> Edward V disappeared, presumably murdered by Richard. Ultimately, the conflict culminated in success for the Lancastrian branch led by Henry Tudor, in 1485, when <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> was killed in the Battle of Bosworth Field.|$|E
5|$|Warwick had no sons. The elder {{of his two}} {{daughter}}s, Isabel, married George, Duke of Clarence. His {{younger daughter}} Anne had a short-lived marriage to King Henry's son Edward of Westminster, who died in battle {{at the age of}} 17. She then married King Edward's younger brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, who later became King <b>Richard</b> <b>III.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> Society {{remained}} {{interested in}} discussing the possible location of the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, John de la Pole married twice; {{his first}} {{marriage}} was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and <b>Richard</b> <b>III.</b> It brought him eleven children, the eldest of whom, John, would eventually be named heir to <b>Richard</b> <b>III</b> in 1484 and die in battle in the Yorkist cause. John de la Pole, though, generally managed {{to steer clear of}} involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses. Although he was politically aligned to the House of York, by virtue of his marriage, he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne. De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance—even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in attempt to gain the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also note}} Flagg’s penchant for evil. Tony Magistrale, author of Stephen King: The Second Decade, Danse Macabre to The Dark Half sees Flagg as a Shakespearian villain {{comparing}} him to Iago, Edmund and <b>Richard</b> <b>III,</b> contending that Flagg is an antihero. Magistrale believes that Flagg’s evil {{is based on}} his ability to replace peace with conflict and unity with destruction; although he seeks power, it is merely a resource to achieve a greater level of destruction.|$|E
