50|$|An {{alternate}} design, {{called the}} wound rotor, is used when variable speed is required. In this case, the rotor {{has the same}} number of poles as the stator and the windings are made of wire, connected to slip rings on the shaft. Carbon brushes connect the slip rings to a controller such as a variable resistor that allows changing the motor's slip rate. In certain high-power variable-speed wound <b>rotor</b> <b>drives,</b> the slip-frequency energy is captured, rectified, and returned to the power supply through an inverter. With bidirectionally controlled power, the wound rotor becomes an active participant in the energy conversion process, with the wound rotor doubly fed configuration showing twice the power density.|$|E

40|$|Helicopters {{are complex}} and {{expensive}} aircraft {{with a level of}} technology that is immature compared to fixed- wing counterparts. Helicopters suffer from vibratory loads stemming from the main rotor and exhibit control and stability problems in the low-speed flight regime. Operating a helicopter near the limits of its flight envelope may result in unacceptable high structural loads which adversely affects wear and tear of drive train components. Conservative safety regulations lead to high operating cost where a significant part can be attributed to maintenance. Manufacturers and operators therefore strive to make helicopters more capable and reliable in an effort to reduce operating cost. Structural load alleviation offers an attractive option to achieve this goal by reducing component damage accumulation and subsequent required maintenance. This thesis investigates structural load alleviation in the tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train of the UH- 60 Black Hawk. The Black Hawk provides a compelling case for load alleviation research because of its ever growing operational weight and resulting increase of drive train load levels. Furthermore, the lifetime of the UH- 60 is to be extended so that it will fly for many years to come. Current research and applications of rotorcraft structural load alleviation focus on the main rotor but less attention is given to tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train components. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap by investigating manoeuvres that result in critical dynamic loads in the UH- 60 tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train. A survey of pertinent literature and interviews with helicopter pilots indicate that pedal inputs for left-hand turns in hover lead to high dynamic loads in the UH- 60 tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train. A flight simulation model is constructed that offers the novel capability to predict dynamic loads in tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shafts. This model consists of an available high fidelity engine model and existing rotor models coupled by a multi body dynamics tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train model with properties that are based on component measurements and CAD drawings. Experiments are conducted to determine the relation between manoeuvre aggressiveness and dynamic loads in tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> shafts. Based on the results a manoeuvre load alleviation control strategy is devised to reduce dynamic loads while ensuring applicable Level 1 handling quality requirements. Application of this control strategy will decrease dynamic loads during left-hand yaw manoeuvres in hover. Furthermore, the results highlight what reduction in loads can be achieved for varying levels of manoeuvre aggressiveness. These findings may aid in the design of flight control systems that incorporate tail <b>rotor</b> <b>drive</b> train load alleviation objectives...|$|R

40|$|The REDT (Rotor à Entraînement Direct par Turbine – Direct Turbine Driven Rotor) is a {{new concept}} for {{helicopter}} <b>rotor</b> <b>drives</b> developed by Sagita in Belgium. It works without any mechanical link between the engine {{on one side and}} the rotor drive on the other side. It uses a fuselage-mounted compressor that powers two contra-rotating rotor-mounted free turbines. These free turbines drive a pair of contrarotating rotors that are fitted with rigid hingeless main rotor blades. This novel rotor drive eliminates the need for either mechanical transmission or a tail rotor. The aim of the REDT concept is to lower the maintenance costs and the accident rate, as well as to extend the flight envelope towards much higher airspeeds compared to classical helicopters...|$|E
40|$|Compact, {{ultra-high-speed}} self-bearing permanent-magnet motors {{enable a}} wide scope of applications including {{an increasing number}} of optical ones. For implementation in an optical setup the rotors have to satisfy high demands regarding their velocity and pointing errors. Only a restricted number of measurements of these parameters exist and only at relatively low velocities. This manuscript presents the measurement of the velocity and pointing errors at rotation frequencies up to 5 kHz. The acquired data allows to identify the rotor drive as the main source of velocity variations with fast fluctuations of up to 3. 4 ns (RMS) and slow drifts of 23 ns (RMS) over 120 revolutions at 5 kHz in vacuum. At the same rotation frequency the pointing fluctuated by 12 μrad (RMS) and 33 μrad (peak-to-peak) over 10000 roundtrips. To our best knowledge this states the first measurement of velocity and pointing errors at multi-kHz rotation frequencies and will allow potential adopters to evaluate the feasibility of such <b>rotor</b> <b>drives</b> for their application...|$|E
40|$|Three {{electronic}} respirometers, two {{of which}} have been recently introduced (the Birchover respiratory flowmeter and the Wright respiration monitor), and one a prototype model (Spiroflo) have been laboratory tested in conditions designed to simulate possible modes of clinical use. It was found that the accuracy of the Spiroflo and Wright instruments were acceptable, but the Birchover was limited in its application and became less accurate in the variations of use described. Monitoring of ventilation is of importance in both clinical anaesthesia and intensive therapy. Several electronic ventilation monitors have become avail-able recently. Each consists of a gas flow trans-ducer head and a meter for the display of minute volume and, in some cases, tidal volume. To test their suitability, three of these instruments have been assessed under a variety of conditions simulating both the normal and the extremes of clinical use. MATERIALS The units evaluated were the Wright respiration monitor, 1 the Spiroflo electronic respirometer, 2 and the Birchover respiratory flowmeter. 3 The Wright respiration monitor and Spiroflow operate on the same principle: mass flow past a vane causes the vane to rotate at a speed propor-tional to the gas flow rate. A transducer converts the rotation of the vane into a train of pulses whose repetition rate is, to a first approximation, linearly proportional to gas flow. The vanes are designed to give a response to gas flow in one direction only, allowing the heads to be used in a tidal air stream without the need for one-way valves. The flow head of the Wright respiration monitor (fig. 1) has been developed from the Wright respirometer (Wright, 1955). Gas flows through tangential slots in a stator ring (B) after entering through the inlet mount (A). It rotates the two-bladed rotor (D) and leaves through the outlet mount (C).
