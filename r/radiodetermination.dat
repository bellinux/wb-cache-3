50|$|A <b>radiodetermination</b> station uses {{reception}} of radio waves {{in order to}} determine the location of an object, under the condition that this thing is reflecting and/or transmitting radio waves. This designation may also be the collective name of any radar set in general, up to target location, illuminating, acquisition and tracking, as well as radar sigh, altimeter and precision-guided munitions or bombs.|$|E
50|$|Radiolocating is {{the process}} of finding the {{location}} of something through the use of radio waves. It generally refers to passive uses, particularly radar - as well as detecting buried cables, water mains, and other public utilities. It is similar to radionavigation, but radiolocation usually refers to passively finding a distant object rather than actively one's own position. Both are types of <b>radiodetermination.</b> Radiolocation is also used in real-time locating systems (RTLS) for tracking valuable assets.|$|E
40|$|Geostar is {{currently}} constructing a <b>radiodetermination</b> satellite system to provide position fixes and vehicle surveillance services, and {{has proposed a}} digital land mobile satellite service to provide data, facsimile and digitized voice services to low cost mobile users. The different system architectures for these two systems, are reviewed...|$|E
40|$|The Geostar (Trademark) system {{began its}} initial {{operations}} in 1988 {{and was the}} first domestic satellite system to provide regular service to mobile users within the United States.

40|$|The {{regulatory}} process for licensing mobile satellite systems {{is complex and}} can require many years to complete. This process involves frequency allocations, national licensing, and frequency coordination. The {{regulatory process}} {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the <b>radiodetermination</b> satellite service (RDSS) between 1983 and 1987 is described. In contrast, each of these steps in the licensing of the mobile satellite service (MSS) is taking a significantly longer period of time to complete...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{communication}} {{via satellite}} {{is now available}} to mobile users who were previously largely excluded from the benefits of satellite technology. The Senior Vice President of the Geostar Corporation describes the characteristics and advantages of their <b>Radiodetermination</b> Satellite Service (RDSS), based on new satellite system design and spread spectrum technology. RDSS has low-cost, handheld equipment and is particularly useful for fleet control and maritime and aviation safety. The future success of RDSS development will depend on decisions taken by international regulatory agencies, particularly at Mobile WARC in 1987. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the U. S. FCC has {{developed}} the regulatory {{structure for the}} provision of mobile services via satellite. In May 1989, the FCC awarded American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC) a license to provide the full range of domestic mobile satellite services in the U. S. At that time, the FCC reaffirmed the U. S. mobile satellite industry structure and spectrum allocations that had been adopted previously. Also in May 1989, the FCC authorized the Communications Satellite Corporation (COMSAT), the U. S. Signatory to Inmarsat, to provide international aeronautical satellite service via the Inmarsat system. Earlier in 1989, the FCC permitted the use of Ku-band satellites to provide messaging and tracking services. In the mid- 1980 's, the FCC established the <b>Radiodetermination</b> Satellite Service and awarded licenses. Among the mobile satellite matters currently facing the FCC are whether additional spectrum should be allocated for domestic 'generic' mobile satellite services, the regulatory structure {{for the provision of}} mobile satellite service on an interim basis before AMSC launches its dedicated satellites, and whether to authorize a low earth orbit satellite system to provide mobile data service...|$|E
40|$|The ILO Convention 164, article 7 [1], {{states that}} all {{countries}} that have ratified the convention shall have a pre-arranged system that ensures telemedical assistance on a specialist level around the clock. Seafarers shall be trained {{in the use of}} the system, and doctors who provide advice shall have knowledge of the special circumstances prevailing on board ships. Likewise, the EEC Council Directive 92 / 29 [2] requires that all member nations shall have one or more centres that provide telemedical assistance to ships, and “some of the doctors ” shall have been trained in the special circumstances on board ships. According to “List of <b>radiodetermination</b> and special service stations ” [3], issued by Union internationale des télécommunications, there are 22 countries in Europe that have one or more centres providing telemedical maritime assistance service (TMAS). In the autumn of 2007 The Norwegian Centre for Maritime Medicine contacted the 18 centres with available addresses and asked some questions regarding the organisation, the frequency and nature of contacts, accidents and deaths [4]. Only 6 centres responded. This is not the place to go into details on the responses, but only to...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{domestic}} and international regulatory and policy milestones since 1982, when NASA filed its petition with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish the U. S. domestic Mobile Satellite Service (MSS), are described. In 1985, the FCC proposed to establish MSS services and allocate spectrum for such service. In 1986, the FCC allocated L-band spectrum for MSS. In 1987, at the Mobile World Administrative Radio Conference (MOB WARC- 87), despite U. S., Canadian, and Mexican efforts, the WARC did not adopt a multi-service, generic MSS allocation. In 1989, the FCC licensed the first MSS system. After two decisions by the U. S. Court of Appeals, the FCC's licensing actions remain intact. The FCC also has permitted Comsat to provide international aeronautical and land MSS via the Inmarsat system. Inmarsat, however, may not serve the domestic U. S. market. In 1991, the FCC accepted applications for MSS systems, {{most of which were}} non-geostationary proposals, for operation in the <b>Radiodetermination</b> Satellite Service (RDSS) bands, and the VHF and UHF bands. In 1992, the FCC proposed rules for non-geostationary MSS systems and applied a negotiated rulemaking procedure to each. Also in 1992, the U. S. position for flexibility in existing MSS bands and for additional worldwide MSS allocations was adopted in large part at the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC- 92) ...|$|E
