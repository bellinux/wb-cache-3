5|$|In June 2010, Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} an {{extension}} of the Bergen Light <b>Rail</b> <b>to</b> Sotra was to be made part of the extension plans in the period until 2040. For the light <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> use existing infrastructure, a bridge would have to be chosen. The road project has been criticized by environmentalists because it uniformly bases growth in transport to the archipelago based on cars, and lacks any plans for inclusion of public transport, whether by light rail or as bus lanes. Criticism has also been raised against the Norwegian Public Roads Administration being responsible for planning the public transport, as they have failed to produce efficient public transport systems in Bergen.|$|E

5|$|The state's iron-mining {{industry}} was established {{with the discovery}} of iron in the Vermilion Range and the Mesabi Range in the 1880s, and in the Cuyuna Range in the early 20th century. The ore was shipped by <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> Duluth and Two Harbors, then loaded onto ships and transported eastward over the Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|A bromine {{extraction}} {{plant was}} opened in Amlwch in 1953 by Associated Ethyl (soon renamed Associated Octel, and later {{part of the}} Great Lakes Chemical Corporation). Chlorine produced at a plant in Ellesmere Port was brought by <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> Amlwch, which was used to extract bromine from sea water. The resulting ethylene dibromide was taken from Amlwch by rail as well. The company built a light railway through the town to Amlwch station, and a marshalling yard for exchanging freight wagons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bought at}} the auction (it is {{believed}} by Barwicks of London) by December 1935, Lew was working for Sidney Castle, the dismantler of the railway. This work was completed by July 1936 and in September, Lew was moved by <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> Swansea and loaded onto the S.S. Sabor destined for the port of Pernambuco (since renamed Recife), Brazil. Most of the relevant shipping records were destroyed in World War II, Lew then vanished from history and despite several attempts, {{no trace of the}} locomotive, or evidence of its fate, has so far been found.|$|E

25|$|A sleeper is a {{rectangular}} object {{on which the}} rails are supported and fixed. The sleeper has two main roles: to transfer the loads from the <b>rails</b> <b>to</b> the track ballast and the ground underneath, and <b>to</b> hold the <b>rails</b> <b>to</b> the correct width apart (<b>to</b> maintain the <b>rail</b> gauge). They are generally laid transversely <b>to</b> the <b>rails.</b>|$|R
5|$|As of 2013 {{there were}} plans to install 1million tonne per year wood pellets {{pelletizing}} plants at Morehouse Parish, Louisiana, and Gloster, Mississippi, {{which would be}} shipped by road and <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> the port of Baton Rouge, Louisiana then shipped in 50,000-tonne cargo ships to UK. In the financial report for 2013, Drax announced that an additional 2million tons pelletisation capacity was being considered, likely {{to be built in}} the US.|$|E
5|$|Denver's {{early years}} as a major train hub of the west are still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at {{historic}} Union Station, where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> tour the city. Union Station will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, {{at the completion of}} FasTracks.|$|E
5|$|Finished in Java, Beebe and {{his crew}} sailed north from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to begin {{exploring}} Malaya. After Malaya, the next portion of their expedition took them to Burma, where they arrived in Rangoon and traveled by <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> Myitkyina. In Burma Beebe succumbed temporarily to a bout of depression, and it was several days before {{he was able to}} resume working or continue the expedition. He attributed his recovery to the pile of penny dreadful novels he discovered in his bungalow at Pungatong, which he then read constantly for the next few days.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rails</b> <b>to</b> Trails is an {{approximately}} 5 mile scenic {{walking and}} biking trail {{that runs from}} Great Hollow Lake in Wolfe Park, and continues to the Newtown Town line where it currently ends.

5|$|Many of the {{prisoner}}s were marched {{to the city of}} Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were marched to the river Scheldt and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. The prisoners were then sent by <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Mass transit {{accounts}} for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> travel, {{partly because of}} the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development has increased in recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.|$|E
5|$|SM U-16 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> Pola where she was assembled and launched on 26 April 1915 and commissioned on 6 October. U-16 sank one ship in November 1915 and seized another in December. While operating in the Adriatic {{off the coast of}} Albania in mid-October 1916, U-16 sank an Italian destroyer acting as a convoy escort. U-16 was sunk in the ensuing action, but sources are not clear on the exact cause of her sinking.|$|E

5|$|SM UB-15 was {{constructed}} in Germany and shipped by <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> Pola, where she was assembled and launched. She was commissioned into the German Imperial Navy in April and sank an Italian submarine in June. The boat was handed over to Austria-Hungary and commissioned as SM U-11 on 14 June. In early 1916, U-11 fired on a British submarine, but missed. After {{the end of the}} war, U-11 was handed over to Italy as a war reparation and scrapped at Pola by 1920.|$|E
5|$|Service on {{the subway}} system is {{occasionally}} disrupted by flooding from rainstorms, even minor ones. Rainwater can disrupt signals underground and require the electrified third <b>rail</b> <b>to</b> be shut off. Every day, the MTA moves 13 {{million gallons of water}} when it is not raining. Since 1992, $357 million has been used to improve 269 pump rooms. By August 2007, $115 million was earmarked to upgrade the remaining 18 pump rooms.|$|E
