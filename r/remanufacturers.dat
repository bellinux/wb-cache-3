50|$|Remanufactured, compatible, OEM and {{refilled}} {{toner cartridges}} {{are available from}} a variety of sources across the world. While compatible and OEM cartridges can be purchased off-the-shelf, smaller <b>remanufacturers</b> may refill an empty cartridge supplied by a customer. Larger <b>remanufacturers</b> collect old, empty and unused cartridges for recycling. On average, up to 90% of components from old cartridges can be salvaged and used in remanufactured cartridges, while the other 10% is broken down for recycling. <b>Remanufacturers</b> will put together countless cartridges (OEM and compatible) and sell to the retail market at discounted rates.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper adds to {{the growing}} {{literature}} of market competition related to the <b>remanufacturer</b> by analyzing the model where the <b>remanufacturer</b> and the manufacturer collaborate {{with each other in}} the same channel. This paper investigates a single-period deterministic model which keeps the analysis simple so as to obtain sharper insights. The results characterize the optimal remanufacturing and pricing strategies for the <b>remanufacturer</b> and the manufacturer in the collaborative model...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{choosing}} an appropriate channel for the marketing channel structure of remanufactured fashion products. To be specific, we consider a <b>remanufacturer</b> who has two options for selling the products: (1) provide the remanufactured products to a manufacturer, then the manufacturer sells both new products and the remanufactured products to customers, and (2) sell the remanufactured products directly to customers. Because of the relatively low acceptance of remanufactured products and environment consciousness of customers in developing countries like China, we model the two scenarios as decentralized remanufacturing supply chains, with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader and the government offering subsidy to the <b>remanufacturer</b> to incentivize remanufacturing activities. We find that the subsidy can incentivize remanufacturing activity regardless of the <b>remanufacturer’s</b> channel choice. A “too high” or “too low” subsidy makes the <b>remanufacturer</b> compete with the manufacturer, and an intermediate subsidy results in cooperation between the two members of the remanufacturing supply chain. Meanwhile, if the customers’ acceptance for remanufactured products is higher, the <b>remanufacturer</b> {{will be more likely to}} compete with the manufacturer. However, the <b>remanufacturer’s</b> optimal channel choice may be inefficient in the sense of social welfare and environmental protection...|$|R
40|$|The paper investigates {{interactions}} in a two-period closed-loop supply chain {{consisting of a}} single manufacturer and a single <b>remanufacturer.</b> In the context of recycling and remanufacturing by the <b>remanufacturer,</b> the manufacturer and <b>remanufacturer</b> choose different production strategies. By comparing the costs, profits and equilibrium quantity of supply chain members in decentralized and centralized models, {{we focus on the}} conditions under which the <b>remanufacturer</b> chooses to sell the remanufactured products and compete with the manufacturer. Different cooperative strategies can affect closed-loop supply chain decision-making. The article analyzes the impact of each cost and recycling rate on the productions and profits of the manufacturer and <b>remanufacturer,</b> and compares the total profits of members between two models. The sensitivity analysis of the models shows that the centralized model can be an effective way of achieving greater efficiency in terms of the overall supply chain. This study provides insights into the remanufacturing theory, which might guide remanufacturing operations and strategies...|$|R

50|$|Rebuilding {{is an old}} {{name for}} remanufacturing. It is still widely used by {{automotive}} industry. For example, the Automotive Parts <b>Remanufacturers</b> Association (APRA), have the new term in their name, but to be safe on their own website use the combined term 'rebuild/remanufacture'.|$|E
5000|$|Refilling {{cartridges}} {{either by}} the end user, or as a service, is claimed by most printer manufacturers and toner <b>remanufacturers</b> to be harmful to both the quality and reliability of the prints, the cartridge {{as well as the}} life of the printers.|$|E

30|$|The {{advanced}} remanufacturing-to-order (ARTO) system deliberated on in {{this study}} is a product recovery system. A discrete-event simulation model was developed from the view of <b>remanufacturer</b> for remanufactured items sold with one-dimensional non-renewing Money-back Guarantee warranty policy, in which, an End-Of-Life product is subjected to preventive maintenance action when the remaining life of the product reaches a pre-specified value so that the <b>remanufacturer’s</b> expected profit can be maximized. Experiments were designed using Taguchi’s Orthogonal Arrays to represent the full recovery system and observe their behavior under different experimental conditions. In order {{to assess the impact of}} warranty and preventive maintenance on <b>remanufacturer</b> total cost, pairwise t tests were carried out along with one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey pairwise comparisons test for each performance measure of the ARTO system.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} impact of advance notice of the product returns {{on the performance of}} a closed loop supply chain when lead-times exist. Our closed loop supply chain consists of a manufacturer and an external <b>remanufacturer.</b> The market demand and the product return are stochastic and correlated with each other. A proportion of the sold products in the market are returned to an external <b>remanufacturer.</b> After a predetermined time period, the used products are converted into "good-as-new" products to be used to meet the market demand, together with the newly manufactured products. We quantify the benefit of the manufacturer obtaining advance notice of product returns from the <b>remanufacturer.</b> Furthermore, we demonstrate that the (re) manufacturing lead-times and some parameters in the product return rate can {{have a significant impact on}} the manufacturer's performance...|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the inner}} {{diameter}} of the valve guide and the outer {{diameter of the}} valve stem may become worn. In the 1980s, many U.S. production engine <b>remanufacturers</b> began reaming valve guides, rather than replacing them, {{as part of their}} remanufacturing process. They found that by reaming all the valve guides in a head to one standard size (typically 0.008 in. diametrically oversized), and installing remanufactured engine valves having stems that are also oversized, a typical engine head can be remanufactured in much less time. Since the reaming process leaves the valve guide with a much better surface finish and shape than typical replacement guides, and since the oversize valves often have chrome plated stems, <b>remanufacturers</b> also discovered that valve train warranty issues are virtually eliminated.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) modified to support design for remanufacture. The results of the waste-stream analysis of an automotive <b>remanufacturer</b> were used for this FMEA. The <b>remanufacturer</b> waste stream was assessed to determine factors that impede the reuse of parts. The use of the modified FMEA allows consideration of factors such as ease of detection and repair of failure, in conjunction with contribution to the waste stream of each failure mode, to develop priorities in design for remanufacture...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{determining}} the optimal retailer order quantities from a manufacturer who makes new products in conjunction with ordering remanufactured products from a <b>remanufacturer</b> using used and unsold products from the previous product generation. Specifically, we determine the optimal order quantity by the retailer for four systems of decision-making: (a) the three firms make their decisions in a coordinated fashion, (b) the retailer acts independently while the manufacturer and <b>remanufacturer</b> coordinate their decisions, (c) the <b>remanufacturer</b> acts independently while the retailer and manufacturer coordinate their decisions, and (d) all three firms act independently. We model the four options described above as centralized or decentralized decision-making systems with the manufacturer being the Stackelberg leader and provide insights into the optimal order quantities. Coordination mechanisms are then provided which enable the different players to achieve jointly the equivalent profits in a coordinated channel...|$|R
40|$|Remanufacture {{involves}} the production-batch disassembly, cleaning, repair or replacement of parts, and reassembly of products for reuse. Parts that cannot be reused by the <b>remanufacturer</b> enter the waste stream, examination of which reveals insights about remanufacture difficulties. Extending beyond our previous study of automotive products, the <b>remanufacturer</b> waste streams of electrical motors, toner cartridges, valves and telephones were analysed to support product design that facilitates remanufacture. The {{results of this}} research are presented in a format that allows a designer to determine {{the relevance of the}} products studied to products being designed...|$|R
50|$|In Canada, {{the common}} law {{doctrine}} of exhaustion provides that a purchaser of a patented product benefits from an implied licence to use, repair, and resell that product. The doctrine applies only {{in the absence of}} any restriction imposed by the patentee or licensee. Although the doctrine applies to repairs, it does not apply to <b>remanufacturers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, the Automotive Parts <b>Remanufacturers</b> Association (APRA) {{realized}} that communication problems can arise when {{people from different}} countries with different language skills talk about remanufacturing. Certain terms can have different meanings as definitions between countries and individuals vary. In 2013, APRA was able to solve these communication problems by publishing a common translation list in many different languages in order to unite all those who deal with the automotive industry.|$|E
50|$|Remanufacturing is, at least, {{refilling}} a cartridge with toner. The term {{implies that}} the cartridge is also refurbished, with worn or damaged parts replaced. The remanufacturing process, {{and the quality of}} the toner, differs between <b>remanufacturers.</b> A poorly remanufactured (or newly manufactured) cartridge may leak, malfunction, or damage the printer. Printer manufacturers use a toner designed to be suitable for their printers; remanufactured and third-party cartridges may use a generic toner which is less well matched.|$|E

5000|$|Opponents {{claim that}} since empty prebate {{cartridges}} are [...] "owned" [...] by Lexmark; and since Lexmark expressly forbids the remanufacturing or recycling of the cartridge by {{anyone other than}} themselves; and since third party <b>remanufacturers</b> cannot therefore remanufacture the empty cartridges; and since the majority of cartridges are never returned to Lexmark, {{the result is that}} the prebate program actually ensures fewer cartridges are recycled and customers are more often required to purchase brand name OEM cartridges.|$|E

50|$|Component parts, such as inks, toners, {{wiper blades}} and tools were {{exhibited}} {{in the early years}} of the expo. The visitors were mainly <b>remanufacturers</b> looking for technical work around solutions, components and parts to use in the remanufacturing process. There were also many companies displaying their remanufactured, compatible supplies for sale to dealers, distributors, wholesalers and stationery stores.In 2010, due to the increasing cost and logistical difficulty in obtaining used, empty cartridges, also called cores, to remanufacture, some companies in China started to make new-built cartridges using injection molding technology to replicate the appearance and functions of the OEM products. This sector of the industry has expanded in China, with new-molded, finished products being manufactured more cheaply, in some cases, than it would cost to collect and refurbish a used, empty OEM manufactured cartridge.|$|E
30|$|The {{actions to}} make a failed item {{operational}} depend on whether the failed component(s) are repairable or not. In {{the case of a}} repairable component, the <b>remanufacturer</b> has the option of repairing or replacing it by a remanufactured working component if available. If not, a new component will be used to rectify the claim. In case of repairable components, the characterization of subsequent failures depends on the type of repair (e.g., minimal repair, imperfect repair and so on). Similarly, {{in the case of a}} non-repairable component, the <b>remanufacturer</b> can use a remanufactured working component in the replacement to make the item operational.|$|R

5000|$|The {{enforceability}} of an EULA {{depends on}} several factors, {{one of them}} being the court in which the case is heard. Some courts that have addressed {{the validity of the}} shrinkwrap license agreements have found some EULAs to be invalid, characterizing them as contracts of adhesion, unconscionable, and/or unacceptable pursuant to the U.C.C.—see, for instance, Step-Saver Data Systems, Inc. v. Wyse Technology, Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.. [...] Other courts have determined that the shrinkwrap license agreement is valid and enforceable: see ProCD, Inc. v. Zeidenberg, Microsoft v. Harmony Computers, Novell v. Network Trade Center, and Ariz. Cartridge <b>Remanufacturers</b> Ass'n v. Lexmark Int'l, Inc. may have some bearing as well. No court has ruled on the validity of EULAs generally; decisions are limited to particular provisions and terms.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This paper mainly {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of adversarial risk analysis (ARA) in the pricing strategy with remanufacturing. We hope to obtain more realistic results than classical model. In fact, the classical Stackelberg model believes that since OEMs are the monopoly position, they know the pricing strategy of <b>remanufacturers</b> in the second period. However, the development of remanufacturing industry shakes OEMs ’ monopoly position and makes <b>remanufacturers</b> become stronger and stronger, so, in fact, OEMs don’t know the pricing strategy of <b>remanufacturers</b> in the second period. Hence, the classical Stackelberg model isn’t suited for reality. In this paper, we suppose that the OEMs don’t know the pricing strategy of <b>remanufacturers</b> and recovery cost and only know their own information. Based on these assumptions, we predict the pricing strategy of <b>remanufacturers</b> from OEMs ’ point. Furthermore, we build OEMs ’ own pricing strategy based on the predicted the <b>remanufacturers</b> ’ pricing strategy, which is called OEMs ’ 1 -order ARA model. Similarly, we look ourselves as <b>remanufacturers</b> and forecast OEMs ’ pricing strategy. Based on the forecasted OEMs ’ pricing strategy, we create the <b>remanufacturers</b> ’ own pricing strategy. Simulated results make us find ARA model gets more profit than classical Stackelberg model. Design/methodology/approach: In order to gain more actual research, we apply adversarial risk analysis to the pricing strategy with remanufacturing. As OEMs, they don’t the recovery cost and the pricing strategy of <b>remanufacturers,</b> {{so they have to}} analyze and predict the pricing strategy of <b>remanufacturers</b> and based on this predicted the pricing strategy of remanufacturer...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to analyse}} the benefit {{provided}} by interested parties in remanufacturing including manufacturing companies, original equipment manufacturers and customers. Existing studies examining Produc-Service System (PSS) focus on relationship between two parties, either between OEMs and customers or between <b>remanufacturers</b> with customers. This study attempts {{to fill the}} gap by investigating how the PSS offers benefit to OEMs, <b>remanufacturers</b> and customers. Methodology: This research used case study method to examine the practice of PSS in remanufacturing companies. Qualitative approach was employed to analyse emerging problems in the case companies and the researcher collaborate with the involved parties to create new knowledge. Thus, this process can offer theoretical insights as well as practical insights. Findings: All parties involved in PSS consistently gain benefit from adopting the practice. From the perspective of <b>remanufacturers,</b> the major benefit of <b>remanufacturers</b> adopting PSS is that it can help reduce the uncertainties regarding time, quantity and quality of returned cores. Due to reduced uncertainties, <b>remanufacturers</b> gain benefit from higher profitability and more environmental friendly products. These benefits provide multiplier effects to both customers and OEMs. Practical implications: This study offers benefits to managers {{in the sense that it}} provides guidance for managers of <b>remanufacturers</b> to better manage remanufacturing operation so that it becomes more environmentally friendly and economically profitable. Originality/value: It is the first time that the benefits of PSS to support remanufacturing are viewed from integrative perspective – i. e. manufacturers, <b>remanufacturers,</b> and customers...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a closed loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a manufacturer and a <b>remanufacturer.</b> The market demands and the product returns are stochastic and are correlated with each other. The used products are converted into “as-good-as-new” products and used, together with new products, to satisfy the market demand. The remanufacturing process takes time and is subject to a random yield. Remanufactured products are pushed into the manufacturer’s inventory. It is assumed that the manufacturer exploits the order-up-to policy to determine its brand-new production quantity. We compute {{the benefit of the}} manufacturer obtaining advance notice of the product return quantities from the <b>remanufacturer</b> and demonstrate that the lead times, random yields and parameters describing the returns play a significant role. The interesting and counter-intuitive result is that increasing the lead time at the <b>remanufacturer</b> can increase the benefit. It is also shown that Bullwhip is generated even if both the demand and the return processes are a white noise process. Analytical results suggest that there is a fundamental underlying trade-off in a CLSC, which could be a barrier against the spread of CLSC...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: An {{electronic}} product recycling not only needs the waste treatment company, but also involves recycler and <b>remanufacturer.</b> It is significance for increasing subsidy modes and promoting waste recycling {{to research the}} effect of government subsidies for recycler and <b>remanufacturer</b> on the equilibrium of closed-loop supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: In view of service competition, we build a Stackelberg model which contains an original manufacturer, a recycler and <b>remanufacturer</b> and further obtain the equilibrium decision of closed-loop supply chain. Based on this strategy model, we analyze how two different subsidies to utilization rate of raw materials, the service level and the demand of product affect on the terminal decision. Findings: We compared the two different subsidy ways in closed-loop supply chain. Subsidy to utilization rate of raw materials {{has no effect on}} the whole market demand for {{electronic product}}; and subsidy on utilization rate of raw materials has no effect on the whole market demand for electronic product.

30|$|In today’s global environment, {{technology}} is constantly evolving. Being {{able to stay}} up-to-date {{with the very latest}} technological advances can be extremely hard to accomplish. As a result of these changes and developments in technology, which often come unexpectedly, consumers are frequently tempted to update their devices to the very latest model. The result is that the life cycle of a product is becoming shorter and shorter than before. Manufacturers attempt to respond to consumers’ concerns involving environmental issues as well as the more governmentally stringent environmental legislations by establishing facilities which include the minimization of the totality of waste relocated to landfills by recovering materials and components from returned, or End-Of-Life products and reuse them to build a remanufactured product, and/or novel components. With the rapid growth of interest in remanufactured products’ market, offering warranty for remanufactured products and components is becoming a necessity for <b>remanufacturer</b> in order to meet customers’ requirement and as a marketing mechanism. During that process, maintenance policies are of great importance {{in order to reduce the}} warranty cost on the <b>remanufacturer.</b> In this paper, an optimization simulation model for remanufactured items sold with one-dimensional non-renewing money-back guarantee (MBG) warranty policy is proposed from the view of <b>remanufacturer,</b> in which, an End-Of-Life product is subjected to upgrade action at the end of its past life and during the warranty period, preventive maintenance actions are carried out when the remaining life of the product reaches a pre-specified value so that the <b>remanufacturer’s</b> expected profit can be maximized. Finally, a numerical example and design of experiment analysis are provided to demonstrate the proposed approach.|$|R
