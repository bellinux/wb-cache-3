5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely understood and had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, in much the same terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E

50|$|This {{reason for}} using the {{dissipation}} factor instead of the ESR is, that film capacitors were originally used mainly in frequency-determining <b>resonant</b> <b>circuits.</b> The reciprocal value of the dissipation factor {{is defined as the}} quality factor “Q”.

5|$|The basic {{technical}} {{reason for this}} difficulty is that the frequency response of a simple filter approaches a fall of 6 dB/octave far {{from the point of}} resonance. This means that if telephone channels are squeezed in side-by-side into the frequency spectrum, there will be crosstalk from adjacent channels in any given channel. What is required is a much more sophisticated filter that has a flat frequency response in the required passband like a low-Q <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit,</b> but that rapidly falls in response (much faster than 6dB/octave) at the transition from passband to stopband like a high-Q <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit.</b> Obviously, these are contradictory requirements to be met with a single <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit.</b> The solution to these needs was founded in the theory of transmission lines and consequently the necessary filters did not become available until this theory was fully developed. At this early stage the idea of signal bandwidth, and hence the need for filters to match to it, was not fully understood; indeed, it was as late as 1920 before the concept of bandwidth was fully established. For early radio, the concepts of Q-factor, selectivity and tuning sufficed. This was all to change with the developing theory of transmission lines on which image filters are based, as explained in the next section.|$|E

25|$|The Q of an {{individual}} reactive component depends on the frequency at which it is evaluated, which is typically the resonant frequency of the circuit that it is used in.

25|$|While {{carrying}} out a complete ab initio (that is, first-principles) modelling is now computationally possible, {{it has not been}} widely applied yet. Thus, a phenomenological model is accepted as being an adequate method of capturing experimental behaviors.

25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{applications}} of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first radio wave generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit,</b> these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating {{in the same area}} their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} circuits of most electroshock {{weapons are}} fairly simple, based on either an oscillator, <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit</b> (a power inverter), and step-up transformer or a diode-capacitor voltage multiplier {{to achieve an}} alternating high-voltage discharge or a continuous direct-current discharge. It may be powered {{by one or more}} batteries depending on manufacturer and model. The amount of amperage generated depends on what stunning capabilities are desired, but without proper amperage calculations, the cause and effect of high voltage is muted. Output voltage is claimed to be in the range of 100 V up to 6 KV; current intensity output is claimed to be in the range of 100 to 500 mA; individual impulse duration is claimed to be in the range of 10 to 100 µs (microseconds); frequency of impulse is claimed to be in the range of 2 to 40 Hz; electrical charge delivered is claimed to be in the range of 15 to 500 µC (micro-Coulomb); energy delivered is claimed to be in the range of 0.9 to 10 J.|$|E
25|$|In a dual {{resonant}} solid-state Tesla coil (DRSSTC), {{the electronic}} switching of the solid-state Tesla coil {{is combined with}} the resonant primary circuit of a spark-gap Tesla coil. The resonant primary circuit is formed by connecting a capacitor in series with the primary winding of the coil, so that the combination forms a series tank circuit with a resonant frequency near that of the secondary circuit. Because of the additional <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit,</b> one manual and one adaptive tuning adjustment are necessary. Also, an interrupter is usually used to reduce the duty cycle of the switching bridge, to improve peak power capabilities; similarly, IGBTs are more popular in this application than bipolar transistors or MOSFETs, due to their superior power handling characteristics. A current-limiting circuit is usually used to limit maximum primary tank current (which must be switched by the IGBT's) to a safe level. Performance of a DRSSTC can be comparable to a medium-power spark-gap Tesla coil, and efficiency (as measured by spark length versus input power) can be significantly greater than a spark-gap Tesla coil operating at the same input power.|$|E
25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (<b>resonant</b> <b>circuit,</b> tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray parasitic capacitance between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E

500|$|A stub {{is a short}} {{length of}} {{waveguide}} connected to {{some point in the}} filter at one end and short-circuited at the other end. [...] Open-circuited stubs are also theoretically possible, but an implementation in waveguide is not practical because electromagnetic energy would be launched out of the open end of the stub, resulting in high losses. [...] Stubs are a kind of resonator, and the lumped element equivalent is an LC <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit.</b> [...] However, over a narrow band, stubs can be viewed as an impedance transformer.

500|$|An iris {{is a thin}} {{metal plate}} across the {{waveguide}} {{with one or more}} holes in it. [...] It is used to couple together two lengths of waveguide and is a means of introducing a discontinuity. [...] Some of the possible geometries of irises are shown in figure 5.

[...] An iris which restricts both directions is equivalent to a parallel LC <b>resonant</b> <b>circuit.</b> [...] A series LC circuit can be formed by spacing the conducting portion of the iris away from the walls of the waveguide.
