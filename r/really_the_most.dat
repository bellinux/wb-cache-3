500|$|Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] "The series' most {{multifaceted}} (if {{not most}} engaging) narrative so far", and graded {{it with a}} B. David Sims gave the episode an A, writing, [...] "George is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> revolutionary character: he's often repulsive and pathetic, but here these are traits we heartily enjoy and sympathize with and want more of... The best thing about this episode is that Jerry almost immediately getting with George's ex-girlfriend creates no drama in the group, though it would on almost any other sitcom." ...|$|E
500|$|Welch D. Everman, {{author of}} Cult Science Fiction Films, pointed to several homages {{in the movie}} to science fiction and horror films of the 1950s. The title itself is a {{reference}} to the Jack Arnold film The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), and the final scene when a radio report advertises another trip to Saturn, thus hinting that another accident could occur, was a common device in 1950s horror films. One difference, noted by Everman, is that in the 1950s films, government cover-ups and secret agendas were often ascribed to the good of the general public, whereas The Incredible Melting Man, like many late 1970s films of its genre, suggested otherwise. Variety described the script, in addition to its horror elements, as [...] "a human story attempting to leave a moral message as to whether society or the horrible creature it is chasing is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> destructive".|$|E

2500|$|In some scenes, {{the glow}} in the pupils of replicants' eyes creates a sense of artificiality. This effect was {{produced}} by cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth shining a light along the optical axis of the camera. According to Ridley Scott, [...] "that kickback you saw from the replicants' retinas {{was a bit of}} a design flaw. I was also trying to say that the eye is <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important organ in the human body. It's like a two-way mirror; the eye doesn't only see a lot, the eye gives away a lot. A glowing human retina seemed one way of stating that". He considers the glow to be a stylistic device only, but Brion James (Leon) suggests that pollution was the [...] "cause" [...] for the glow.|$|E
2500|$|I've seen proof, {{black on}} white, that Herr Dr. [...] {{has not yet}} severed his {{connection}} with the anti-Semitic movement...Since then I've had difficulty coming up {{with any of the}} tenderness and protectiveness I've so long felt toward you.

After I read the name Zarathustra in the anti-Semitic Correspondence my forbearance came to an end. I am now in a position of emergency defense against your spouse's Party.

2500|$|The {{final season}} is {{generally}} regarded by fans and critics as {{a return to}} form for the series. Varietys Josef Adalian said that [...] " [...] is once again in great creative shape." [...] He added that [...] "the scripts are snappy, the plots make sense, the acting's solid, [...] the music is appropriately indie" [...] but criticised Fox for [...] "throwing away" [...] the show by giving it the Thursday 9:00p.m. timeslot. Buddytv.com praised the season premiere, saying [...] "this episode is the best OC episode since the show's first season. The absence of Mischa Barton character of Marissa Cooper {{is the best thing}} that's happened to The OC in a long time. The cast is now exceptional from top to bottom and the show is, at least in the first episode, much darker in tone than the first three seasons. This is a good sign." [...] Later in the season, Buddytv.com lamented that [...] "The OC is winding down, in all likelihood, and it's a shame. The show is hitting its creative stride just now, in its fourth season, and no one cares." [...] Critic Alan Sepinwall said of the premiere, [...] "Damn. That was... not bad. No, better than that. That was good. Confident, in character, funny on occasion (any scene with Che), genuinely touching at others (the comic book store intervention), <b>really</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> like itself the show has felt in a long time, maybe even going back to season one." [...] In a review of a later episode, Sepinwall related that Season 4 was a [...] "resurgent season" [...] and that [...] "every [...] "O.C."
