40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{fabricating}} environmentally stable superhydrophilic <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> is reported here. An ultrathin silica layer coated on the wool altered both the surface roughness {{and the surface}} energy of the fiber and endowed the <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> with excellent water absorption. The process of coating silica sols was dependent on an acid solution of low pH, which influenced the electrostatic interactions between nanoparticles and wool fibers. The morphology and composition of silica-sol-coated <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> were characterized {{by a combination of}} SEM, TEM, EDX, FTIR, and XPS measurements. The possible mechanism and size effect of silica nanoparticles on the hydrophilic property of <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> were discussed. The washing fastness of the superhydrophilic <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> in perchlorethylene and water was also evaluated. This study shows that <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> modified by optical transparence, chemical stability, and nontoxic silica sols are promising in constructing smart textiles.

Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) {{was used to}} evaluate its particle size and size distribution. The <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> was treated with Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite then dyed with CI. Acid Orange 74 (AO 74). The Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite pre-dye uptake was compared to conventional dyeing of wool. The existence of Ag/TiO 2 nanocomposite on <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> during acid dyeing increases the dye uptake.

40|$|The low {{abrasion}} resistance of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> compared with many man-made fibre fabrics {{is known to}} be a frequent cause of consumer dissatisfaction particularly in pure <b>wool</b> suiting <b>fabrics.</b> Accordingly this project was undertaken to attempt to improve the {{abrasion resistance}} {{in order to maintain the}} quality image associated with <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> and improve their market competitiveness vis-ä-vis other fabrics. Although several workers have discussed the effects of particular finishes on specific fabrics, very little systematic investigation of the effects of chemical treatments on the abrasion resistance of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> has been carried out. In the current study the difference in abrasion rates of woven <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> composed of different structures have been studied in relation to the abrasion resistance and other relevant physical properties. The work carried out in this thesis is divided into two parts. A review of the literature is followed by a description of the experimental work carried out. The review of the literature summarises current views on the general mechanisms and factors involved in abrasion processes for textile fabrics and the effects of selective finishing treatments on the abrasion resistance of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics.</b> In addition details of the abrasion testing conditions used in this work for determining fabric abrasion resistance have been described. The' experimental work is concerned with the changes in <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> abrasion resistance produced by the following treatments: (i) Application of polymer shrink-resist finishes by padding and by exhaustion treatments, (ii) Treatment with organic solvents, (iii) Treatment with ethylene glycol at- 1500 C, (iv) Deamination and esterification, (v) High temperature steaming (130 °C), (vi) Dyeing, (vii), Wet abrasion. Because of the great commercial importance of polymer shrink resist finishes for <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics,</b> the main objects of the experimental work were to establish the effects of a range of polymer shrink-resist finishes applied by conventional padding and exhaustion techniques on the abrasion resistance of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the mechanisms by which the abrasion resistance is improved...|$|R
40|$|Low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) {{treatment was}} applied to <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> {{with the use of}} a nonpolymerizing gas, namely oxygen. Properties of the LTP-treated samples including low stress mechanical behavior, air permeability, and thermal characteristics were evaluated in this study. Kawabata evaluation system fabric (KES-F) was employed to determine the tensile, shearing, bending, and compression strength properties and surface roughness of the specimens. The changes in these properties are believed to be closely related to the interfiber and interyarn frictional force induced by the LTP. The decrease in the air perme-ability of the LTP-treated <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> was found to be probably because of the plasma action effect on increasing the fabric thickness and a change in fabric surface morphology, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy micrographs. The change in the thermal properties of the LTP-treated <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> was in good agreement with the earlier findings and can be attributed to the amount of air trapped between the yarns and fibers. This study suggested that the LTP treatment can influence the final properties of the <b>wool</b> <b>fabric,</b> and also provide information for developing LTP-treated <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> for industrial use.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increase}} in the environmental protection consciousness of people, attention has focused on plasma technology because of its efficiency and environmentally friendliness. In order to improve the dyeing behavior of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics,</b> surface modification of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> was carried out using an atmospheric pressure (argon) low temperature plasma treatment (LTP). Morphology and chemical composition analyses of the treated wool fiber surface were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect on the surface properties of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> treated for different times was evaluated. The results showed that the coloration of <b>wool</b> <b>fabric</b> is improved with an argon atmospheric pressure low temperature plasma (LTP) treatment but the fabric has a lower color fastness to washing and rubbing.

40|$|The {{effect of}} plasma {{treatment}} using various gases {{on the end}} use properties of <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> was investigated. The results are summarized as follows: The etching by air plasma generated remarkable irregularities {{on the surface of}} the <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and the static friction coefficient tended to increase. However, the treatment softened the fabric handling. On the other hand, the plasma treatment using CF_ 4 and N_ 2 gas hardly changed the fabric handling in spite of a large weight loss of the samples. The CF_ 4 gas plasma treatment decreased the water absorbency of the <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> because of forming water repellent surface, while the plasma using either N_ 2 gas or air increased the water absorbency. The use of CF_ 4 gas in the plasma treatment improved the <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> to be proof against water and shrinkage without any change of the original properties such as fabric handling...|$|R
