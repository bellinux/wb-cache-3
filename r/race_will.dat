5|$|Reptile is a Raptor, a nearly-extinct bipedal {{humanoid}} race of reptilian {{creatures and}} loyally serves the series' recurring villain Shao Kahn in hope that his <b>race</b> <b>will</b> be revived. Reptile has {{been featured in}} almost every title in the series under the same pretenses, and until the 2011 reboot, {{he had yet to}} be rewarded for his efforts. Critical reception to the character has been positive, with many print and online publications commenting on his evolution since his debut as a hidden character.|$|E
5|$|While racing opponents, {{the player}} must {{successfully}} manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There {{are two types}} of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys {{over the course of a}} <b>race</b> <b>will</b> result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification.|$|E
25|$|In {{snowmobile}} water cross (racing on open water), the caution flag simply warns the racers {{that one}} or more racers have sunk and are in the water, however the <b>race</b> <b>will</b> continue as normal.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{snowmobile}} racing, the yellow flag is displayed at or before {{the point of the}} hazard. When a snowmobile racer crosses the yellow flag, the <b>race</b> <b>will</b> continue, however, the skis and track of the snowmobile must remain on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Better {{still may}} be {{individual}} genetic assessment of relevant genes. As genotyping and sequencing {{have become more}} accessible and affordable, avenues for determining individual genetic makeup have opened dramatically. Even when such methods become commonly available, <b>race</b> <b>will</b> continue to be important when looking at groups instead of individuals such as in epidemiologic research.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to safety}} {{issues such as}} aquaplaning, the race is not held in wet conditions. In {{the event of a}} rain delay, the <b>race</b> <b>will</b> be {{postponed}} until rain showers cease, and the track is sufficiently dried. If rain falls during the race, officials can end the race and declare the results official if {{more than half of the}} scheduled distance (i.e., 101 laps) has been completed.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the closure}} of Australian Network, Australia Plus, a new {{multi-platform}} international service was launched on 29 September 2014 as a replacement. The channel will continue to broadcast entertainment, sports, education and English learning shows from ABC through Asia and Pacific partners. Big events from Australia, such as Melbourne Cup, Sydney's New Year's Eve Fireworks and the Sydney to Hobart Yacht <b>Race</b> <b>will</b> also be featured on the channel.|$|E
25|$|The mass start races {{will be over}} 20 laps for men and 15 laps for women. There will {{be three}} {{intermediate}} sprints, at 5, 10 and 15 laps for men, and at 4, 8 and 12 laps for women. Race points will be awarded to the four first skaters at the intermediate sprints, and to the six first skaters at the final sprint. The accumulated points a skater collects during a <b>race</b> <b>will</b> decide the final ranking. For skaters who are tied in race points, including those who have failed to collect any, their finishing order will be break the tie.|$|E
25|$|The two athletes, {{after years}} of {{training}} and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay (Nigel Havers), Aubrey Montague (Nicholas Farrell), and Henry Stallard (Daniel Gerroll). While boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell learns {{the news that the}} heat for his 100-metre <b>race</b> <b>will</b> be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race – despite strong pressure from the Prince of Wales and the British Olympic committee – because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the Sabbath.|$|E

25|$|Athletics is also {{a popular}} sport in the city, with Sunderland Harriers Athletics Club based at Silksworth Sports Complex. 800m runner Gavin Massingham {{represented}} the club at the AAA Championships in 2005. On 25 June 2006, the first Great Women's Run took place along Sunderland's coastline. Among the field which lined up to start the race were Olympic silver medallists Sonia O'Sullivan of the Republic of Ireland and Gete Wami of Ethiopia, who eventually won the race. The race quickly became an annual fixture in the city's sporting schedule, with races in 2007 and 2008. In 2009, the <b>race</b> <b>will</b> be relaunched as the Great North 10K Run, allowing male competitors to take part for the first time, on 12 July.|$|E
25|$|At {{the one to}} go signal, {{the pace}} car will turn its lights off. At this point, any car that is ahead of {{the leader of the}} <b>race</b> <b>will</b> be waved around {{to the rear of the}} field. These cars are not {{permitted}} to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up double file for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will always start in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars > Cars 1 or more laps down > Free Pass Car > Wave Arounds > Cars who have received a penalty.|$|E
25|$|And {{so to the}} 1987 British Grand Prix, {{the event}} now firmly {{established}} at Silverstone. The first two placings were {{a repeat of the}} 1986 race at Brands Hatch, Mansell winning from his Williams-Honda teammate Piquet at 146.208mph and Ayrton Senna in the Lotus-Honda. The <b>race</b> <b>will</b> always be remembered the inter-team rivalry of the Williams pairing. Following a late pit stop in a bid to cure a vibration in the car, Mansell found himself 16.8secs behind Piquet with only 17 laps to go. But Mansell proceeded to eat into Piquet's lead – more than a second per lap – until with five laps to go the gap was only 1.6 seconds. With two laps to go Mansell slipstreamed Piquet down the Hangar Straight, jinked left and then dived right to pass Piquet into Stowe. To a tumultuous reception, Mansell {{went on to win the}} race.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Elliott {{sold his}} team to Ray Evernham and began driving the No. 9 Dodge Dealers/UAW-sponsored Dodge Intrepid the {{following}} year. The team found success in his first race in the No. 9 Dodge, as Elliott won the pole for the 2001 Daytona 500 and finished in the Top 5, bringing home a 5th-place finish, though the <b>race</b> <b>will</b> forever be remembered {{for the death of}} fan favorite Dale Earnhardt. Elliott finished his first season with Evernham Motorsports with two poles, five Top 5's, and nine Top 10 finishes, and one win at the Pennzoil Freedom 400 at Homestead from the pole. This was his first win in over seven years. He finished 15th in the final points standings. In 2002, he won four poles and went to victory lane twice; those wins included the Pennsylvania 500 {{and one of the most}} dominant victories in the history of the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway a week later He finished 13th in the final points standings. His last win, in what became his final full-time season, came in 2003 at Rockingham. A week later, Elliott came within a lap of winning his final race as a full-time driver (he would have been the only retiring driver to do so) in the 2003 Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Elliott led 189 of 267 laps and was on his way to victory, but a cut tire on the final lap allowed Bobby Labonte to score the victory (his last and most recent win to date). He still finished the race and maintained his ninth-place position in the final points standings, his best points finish since finished eighth in the 1997 standings. A few weeks later, Elliott announced that he was relinquishing the No. 9 car to Kasey Kahne and switching to a part-time schedule driving R cars for Evernham.|$|E
500|$|While the Green Book was {{intended}} to make life easier for those living under Jim Crow, its publisher looked forward {{to a time when}} such guidebooks would no longer be necessary. As Green wrote, [...] "there will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a <b>race</b> <b>will</b> have equal opportunities and privileges in the United States. It will be a great day for us to suspend this publication for then we can go as we please, and without embarrassment." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry Blackwell, Stone's {{husband and}} an {{important}} figure in the suffrage movement in the coming years, also supported the amendment. [...] His special interest, however, which he pursued for decades, was in convincing southern politicians that the enfranchisement of women would help to ensure white supremacy in their region. In 1867, he published {{an open letter to}} southern legislatures, assuring them that if both blacks and women were enfranchised, [...] "the political supremacy of your white <b>race</b> <b>will</b> remain unchanged" [...] and [...] "the black race would gravitate by the law of nature toward the tropics." [...] Stone's reaction to this idea is unknown.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the <b>race,</b> <b>Will</b> Power was {{the points}} leader, with 200 points, while Castroneves and James Hinchcliffe each had 164 points to place {{second and third}} respectively. The {{configuration}} was the [...] long track used in 2007 and 2008. It is a tight street course on which overtaking is difficult, and previewing the race, Tony DiZinno claimed it had [...] "often been a mundane race." [...] Four racers participating in the 2012 event were previous winners on the course: Castroneves, Dario Franchitti, Tony Kanaan and Wilson. In contrast, 11 of the 25 drivers have not participated in an IndyCar race at Belle Isle, and four of the drivers had only competed once: in the 2008 race.|$|E
500|$|Oxbow drew a {{favorable}} {{spot in the}} gate at post position six, his first good draw since his win in the Lecomte, and kept the same rider for three straight races {{for the first time}} in his career. At the start of the <b>race,</b> <b>Will</b> Take Charge veered in and brushed Oxbow, who broke third but took the lead within a few strides and soon led by one and a half lengths. Once in front, Stevens got Oxbow to relax, and they ran the first quarter-mile in 0:23.94, the half mile in 0:48.60, and three-quarters at 1:13:26. Despite the modest pace, what one sportswriter called [...] "lullaby fractions", described by Stevens as [...] "just walking the dog", the colt was one and a half lengths in front at the three-quarter-mile mark.|$|E
500|$|Various Heathen groups {{adopt the}} Norse apocalyptic myth of Ragnarök; few {{view it as}} a literal prophecy of future events. Instead, it is often treated as a {{symbolic}} warning of the danger that humanity faces if it acts unwisely in relation to both itself and the natural world. The death of the gods at Ragnarök is often viewed as a reminder of the inevitability of death and the importance of living honorably and with integrity until one dies. Alternately, ethno-nationalist Heathens have interpreted Ragnarök as a prophecy of a coming apocalypse in which the white <b>race</b> <b>will</b> overthrow who these Heathens perceive as their oppressors and establish a future society based on Heathen religion. The political scientist Jeffrey Kaplan believed that it was the [...] "strongly millenarian and chialistic overtones" [...] of Ragnarök which helped convert white American racialists to {{the right wing of the}} Heathen movement.|$|E
