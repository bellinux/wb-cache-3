40|$|The <b>rednecked</b> <b>cane</b> <b>borer,</b> Agrilus ruficollis (F.), is a pest of {{cultivated}} {{and wild}} blackberries in the Midwestern and Eastern {{parts of the}} United States. Feeding, mating, egg laying and development of A. ruficollis from larvae to adult only occurs on primocane, the first year vegetative growth stage of blackberries, {{and not on the}} second year fruiting stage called floricanes that die after fruiting. Damage from this pest is caused by the larva girdling the primocane and tunneling in the pith, causing the formation of a gall. Gall formation on the primocane increases the chance of winter injury and can also potentially reduce yields the following season. There is currently only one class of insecticide (imidacloprid) approved for use in managing the pest and no trap available for monitoring this pest. The research presented in this dissertation was to determine if other chemical classes of insecticides would provide equal adequate control of A. ruficollis as achieved by an application of imidacloprid and determine what visual and chemical cues act as stimulants for attracting A. ruficollis. An efficacy study of several insecticides only found that paraffinic oil (JMS Stylet Oil) provided a level of control of A. ruficollis similar to that achieved by the industry standard (imidacloprid). Paints that mimicked the spectral reflectance of blackberry leaves and canes of both primocane and floricane growth stages were applied to four dowel sizes (ranged from 0. 3 to 2. 5 cm diameters), covered with sticky Tanglefoot® and field evaluated for attractiveness to A. ruficollis for three years, with modifications to the trap each year. Commercially available green or purple plastic funnel traps covered with fluon were evaluated for attractiveness to A. ruficollis in 2014. In 2011, the greatest numbers of A. ruficollis adults were captured on one inch prism-shaped, vertical primocane mimic traps that reflected light at a peak wavelength between 540 - 560 nm (green). In 2012 and 2013, field tests demonstrated that the most A. ruficollis adults were captured on traps painted the same green color of traps used to monitor for emerald ash borer, Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire. The funnel trap testing in 2014 reinforced the previous findings that A. ruficollis is most attracted to the green color of emerald ash borer traps. In 2013, it was noted that colored traps usually captured significantly more A. ruficollis males than females (3 ̆e 2. 4 males: 1 female ratio). This indicated a need to determine if there was a chemical cue used by A. ruficollis adult females to find and select only blackberry primocanes and not floricanes. However, no differences were found in volatile compounds collected from blackberry primocanes and floricanes. Although peaks were identified, these collected volatiles did not stimulate antennae of A. ruficollis adults. Overall, this dissertation was able to show that certain green colors attracted A. ruficollis. Further research should be conducted to optimize trap design and determine if there is a pheromone or primocane plant odor that enhances colored trap catch of female and/or male A. ruficollis. A baited colored trap will improve the monitoring for this insect and timing of insecticide applications and lead to development of a mass trapping tactic that reduces the local density of A. ruficollis and lessen need for insecticide application...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to evaluate the potency of sugar <b>cane</b> top <b>borer</b> parasitoids whether the parasitoids {{are available from the}} released individuals produced previously in the laboratory or other species naturally exist in the field. The result showed that Trichogramma sp. which have been released did not attack sugar <b>cane</b> top <b>borer</b> eggs. Tetrastichus schoenobii and Telenomus rowani observed in the field were seemingly replacing the role of Trichogramma sp. parasitoid previously released in the area. Both the T. schoenobii and T. rowani attacked the sugar <b>cane</b> top <b>borer</b> eggs with parasitism of 34. 59 % and 24. 07 % respectively. Larval parasitoids were Elasmus zehntneri, Rhaconotus scirpophagae, Stenobracon nicevillei and Allorhogas sp. while pupal parasitoid was Isotima javensis. Larval parasitism was 0 - 41. 00 % averagely. The most dominant parasitoid was R. scirpophagae with parasitism of 18. 75 % followed by E. zehntneri with parasitism of 17. 25 % respectively. Total parasitism by all species were 37. 59 % in young plant and 23. 90 % in old plant respectively. Pupal parasitism on young and old plants were 13. 66 % and 8. 26 % respectively. Those parasitoids were available in the field naturally and performed important potentiality in the natural control of sugar <b>cane</b> top <b>borer.</b> Those above mentioned parasitoids need to be conserved by preventing the ecosystem suffering from any hazardous changes, which may afflict negative effects to the natural enemies...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} crops {{which had}} been commercial applied extensively majorly are the insect resistance and herbicide tolerance events. In this study, the Bt insecticidal gene Cry 1 Ab, the glyphosate-tolerant gene EPSPS, and the selection marker gene PMI were combined into a single transferred DNA fragment and introduced into sugarcane by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Thirty-three resistant plantlets were obtained after selection using a PMI/mannose selection system. Thirty of these resistant plantlets were PCR positive for the three target genes. Southern blot assay revealed that the copy number of the integrated fragment in the transformed plantlets varied from 1 to 7. ELISA analysis showed that 23 of the 33 resistant plantlets expressed Cry 1 Ab and EPSPS protein. Five single-copy and ELISA-positive transgenic lines were tested under laboratory and field conditions to determine their resistance to insects and herbicides, and also evaluated their agronomic characteristics and industrial traits. Results showed that larvae fed with fodder mixture containing stem tissues from single-copy transgenic lines were weak and small, moreover, pupation and eclosion were delayed significantly during voluntary feeding bioassays. None of transgenic sugarcane was destroyed by <b>cane</b> <b>borer</b> while more than 30 % of wild type sugarcane was destroyed by <b>cane</b> <b>borer.</b> For herbicide resistance, the transgenic plantlets grew healthy even when treated with up to 0. 5 % roundup while wild type plantlets would die off when treated with 0. 1 % roundup. Thus demonstrate that these transgenic lines showed strong insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance under both laboratory and field conditions. But in the field most of the transgenic plants were shorter and more slender than non-transformed control plants. So they presented poor agronomic characteristics and industrial traits than non-transformed control plants. Thus, {{a considerable number of}} embryogenic calli should be infected to obtain transgenic lines with potential for commercial use...|$|R

40|$|The entomopathogenic fungi of {{the genus}} Metarhizium have several subtilisin-like proteases that are {{involved}} in pathogenesis and these have been used to investigate genes that are differentially expressed in response to different growth conditions. The identification and characterization of these proteases can provide insight into how the fungus is capable of infecting a wide variety of insects and adapt to different substrates. In addition, the pr 1 A gene has been used for the genetic improvement of strains used in pest control. In this study we used quantitative RT-PCR to assess the relative expression levels of the pr 1 A gene in M. anisopliae and M. acridum during growth in different culture conditions and during infection of the sugar <b>cane</b> <b>borer,</b> Diatraea saccharalis Fabricius. We also carried out a pathogenicity test to assess the virulence of both species against D. saccharalis and correlated the results with the pattern of pr 1 A gene expression. This analysis revealed that, in both species, the pr 1 A gene was differentially expressed under the growth conditions studied and during the pathogenic process. M. anisopliae showed higher expression of pr 1 A in all conditions examined, when compared to M. acridum. Furthermore, M. anisopliae showed a greater potential to control D. saccharalis. Taken together, our results suggest that these species have developed different strategies to adapt to different growing conditions...|$|R

By SDS-PAGE, PFTI yielded a single band with a M(r) of 19 kDa. PFTI inhibited bovine trypsin and bovine chymotrypsin with equilibrium dissociation constants (K(i)) of 4 x 10 (- 8) and 1. 4 x 10 (- 6) M, respectively. PFTI retained more than 50 % of activity at up to 50 degrees C for 30 min, but there were 80 and 100 % losses of activity at 60 and 70 degrees C, respectively. DTT affected the activity or stability of PFTI. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of PFTI showed {{a high degree of}} homology with various members of the Kunitz family of inhibitors. Anagasta kuehniella is found worldwide; this insect attacks stored grains and products of rice, oat, rye, corn, and wheat. The velvet bean caterpillar (Anticarsia gemmatalis) is considered the main defoliator pest of soybean in Brazil. Diatraea saccharalis, the sugar <b>cane</b> <b>borer,</b> is the major pest of sugar cane crops, and its caterpillar-feeding behavior, inside the stems, hampers control.

It was evaluated larval and pupal period, larval and pupal viability, longevity, sex rate, pupal weigh, eggs per female, eggs per day, number of eggs per egg mass, egg viability and embrionary period; besides same were accomplished measurements in the caterpillars (bioassay I). Caterpillars of 17 days old (30) of each treatment were removed from the tubes and exposed to the parasitism of C. flavipes (bioassay 2). The egg-pupae period, sex rate, pupal period and viability, number of females, males, total of emerged adults and longevity were evaluated. The data were submitted to the multivariate analisys methods: cluster analysis, two-way and principal component analysis. Based on analysis, it was observed that the treatment of 100 ppm was the least harmful to the biology of the sugar <b>cane</b> <b>borer</b> larvae by groping to the control and did not influence negatively its biological aspects.

40|$|Mestrado em Viticultura e Enologia - Instituto Superior de Agronomia / Faculdade de Ciências. Universidade do PortoAmphicerus bimaculatus (Olivier, 1790), grape <b>cane</b> <b>borer</b> beetle, is a {{xylophagous}} beetle {{from the}} Bostrichidae family that feeds on the woody tissues of its host plants. When {{it comes to}} Vitis spp., this species can lead to substantial economic losses. In recent years in Palmela, Portugal, this problem has been of increasing concern, becoming urgent to gather more information regarding this pest as well as developing {{ways to deal with}} it. Black and white flight traps, along with transparent traps baited with or without ethanol, as well as a Lindgren funnel trap baited with α-Pinene were used to test for A. bimaculatus attraction. These traps did not capture any specimens, suggesting its ineffectiveness or that the sampling period did not match the flying period for this species. In line with this experiment, several specimens were collected on the field, by searching for damage on the leftover branches of vines from pruning, therefore confirming the biological agent responsible for the damage. The sampled specimens were taken to Instituto Superior de Agronomia, where they took part in several experiments. A subsample of these specimens were placed {{in the presence of a}} host. Several behaviors were observed, such as feeding, habitat and host prospection for breeding purposes and the first record of these species’ eggs is presented. It was also studied the color preference on a short range for A. bimaculatus for both female and male. Females did not show a preference in color, however in males some differences were observed, which may be explained by distinctive life motivators in both genders.

One hundred seventy-one F 2 genotypes from cross CML 131 (susceptible) × CML 67 (resistant) and 100 RFLP marker loci {{were used for the}} QTL analyses. 1 SWCB and 1 SCB resistance were assessed in F 2 : 3 lines by leaf damage ratings (LDR) after artificial infestation in field experiments with two replications at one subtropical environment in 2 yr. The method of composite interval mapping (CIM) was used for QTL detection. Estimates of genotypic (σ 2 g) and genotype × year interaction variance (σ 2 g) were highly significant for 1 SWCB LDR and 1 SCB LDR. Phenotypic and genotypic correlations between both traits were 0. 62 and 1. 02, respectively. for 1 SWCB LDR, six QTL were detected explaining 53. 3 % of σ̂ 2 g, with two QTL displaying significant QTL × year interactions.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of Eldana saccharina (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) was monitored in grids represented by plots in 12 nematicide trials in South African sugarcane fields. The trials encompassed {{a total of}} eight plant cane crops and 22 ratoon crops and were situated within commercial cane fields. Several measurements were made to characterize {{the damage caused by}} E. saccharina. These included the number of internodes per stalk, the percentage of internodes damaged and the percentage of stalks damaged. The mapping of E. saccharina infestation in plant crops of sugarcane showed that the borders of the trials were as infested as the centre, indicating invasion from outside the field plus internal spread within the field. Ratoon crops were less infested than plant crops. This could be explained by a shorter ratoon crop cycle and by the fields having areas that were more suitable for the borer than elsewhere. The location of these preferred areas could be predicted from one ratoon crop to the next but was not related to the distribution of the borer in the plant crop. This situation was thought to explain the apparent stabilization of E. saccharina infestation in ratoon <b>cane.</b> Because the <b>borer</b> was found at harvest only in stalks with more than 14 to 16 internodes, it appeared that the oldest shoots, or the shoots with the greatest growth potential, attracted the insect, possibly due to their higher nitrogen content, which would stimulate growth.
