5|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were {{approaching}} retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas {{was working on}} the MD-11, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X, to target the <b>replacement</b> <b>market</b> for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with winglets. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 flight deck, nose, and other elements.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, a 200-seat four-engine version, the B11 (which would {{eventually}} become the A340) was also under development. The B11 was originally {{planned to take}} the place of narrow-body Boeing 707s and Douglas DC-8s then in commercial use, but would later evolve to target the long-range, wide-body trijet <b>replacement</b> <b>market.</b> To differentiate from the SA series, the B9 and B11 were re-designated as the TA9 and TA11, with TA standing for [...] "twin aisle". Development costs were reduced by the two aircraft using the same fuselage and wing, with projected savings of US$500million. [...] Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, those of prospective customers; twinjets were favoured in North America, quad-jets desired in Asia, and operators had mixed views in Europe. Airbus ultimately found that most potential customers favoured four engines due to their exemption from existing twinjet range restrictions and their ability to be ferried with one inactive engine. As a result, development plans prioritised the four-engined TA11 ahead of the TA9.|$|E

50|$|Air {{conditioning}} and heating equipment is {{sold to the}} residential <b>replacement</b> <b>market,</b> the commercial market and residential new construction market. The <b>replacement</b> <b>market</b> has increased in importance {{over the past several}} years as a result of the aging of the installed base of residential central air conditioners and furnaces, the introduction of new higher energy efficient models, the remodeling and expansion of existing homes, the addition of central air conditioning to homes that previously had only heating products and consumers’ overall unwillingness to live without air conditioning or heating products. The mechanical life of central air {{conditioning and}} furnaces varies by geographical region due to usage and ranges from approximately 8 to 20 years. According to data published by the Energy Information Administration, there are approximately 89 million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the U.S. that have been in service for more than 10 years. Many installed units are currently reaching the end of their useful lives, thus providing a growing and stable <b>replacement</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E
40|$|Three {{aspects of}} the use of {{marketing}} models should be highlighted. First, marketing models are an aid to the decision maker, not a <b>replacement.</b> <b>Marketing</b> models often can help the manager make a better decision, but models do not make executive decisions by themselves. Second, marketing models have come to a point in their evolution where they should be viewed by managers as useful tools, not as academic curiosities. In particular, a model-building approach known as decision calculus seems well suited to operational needs of managers, especially those who have not yet used models. Third, model building in marketing covers a broad range of activities and models can be useful to managers in many different ways. Two cautionary points must be made. First, successful models need to be custom fitted to organizations and management problems. This collection should be used only as a foundation and must be coupled with considerable work to apply a model-building approach. Second is a reminder that models are difficult to implement...|$|R

40|$|Financial {{and real}} estate crises and “new ways of working” {{reduce the need for}} office space. As a consequence, office <b>markets</b> become <b>replacement</b> <b>markets</b> without a {{quantitative}} need for new office buildings: new buildings drive out bad buildings. In the Netherlands, currently 14 % of the office space is vacant, of which 60 % is redundant or obsolete. Office users, guided by the government, consider sustainable office space important for their image and status. Besides they want to be accommodated in high quality buildings that fit with their current and future need for space, taking into account expected shrinkage or further development and expansion. Quite often, new office developments were the response to these demands. Public opinion and emerging governmental awareness of sustainability oppose the construction of new office buildings in locations with a high vacancy level, while office users, real estate developers and investors crave for new office developments. Can redesign of existing office buildings answer to the demand for new sustainable office space? In former research we have revealed that location and building characteristics have a strong influence on office users’ preferences and decisions to move to other buildings. Knowledge about these characteristics is important when determining the potential future use of the existing office stock. Based on foregoing research, we propose new use of existing office buildings and delve into the measures that need to be taken in order to adapt existing buildings to new use.
