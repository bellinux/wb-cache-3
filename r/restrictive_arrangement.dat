40|$|The {{quantum theory}} of {{polarized}} light {{allows one to}} model scattering in the solar atmosphere for inferring its properties. This powerful approach has revealed two key long-standing problems in solar physics: the puzzling dilemmas between theory and observations in several anomalously polarized spectral lines {{and the need for}} inferring the ubiquitous weak chromospheric magnetic fields, which requires discriminating the Hanle effect in dynamic optically thick plasmas. However, the ever-present dynamics, i. e., the temporal evolution of heatings and macroscopic motions, has been widely disregarded when modeling and interpreting the scattering polarization. This has hindered a consistent theoretical solution to the puzzle while falsifying the Hanle diagnosis. Here, we show that the dynamical evolution is a keystone for solving both problems because its systematic impact allows an explanation of the observations from 'anomalous' instantaneous polarization signals. Evolution accounted for, we reproduce amplitudes and (spectral and spatial) shapes of the Ca I 4227 A polarization at solar disk center, identifying a <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangement</b> of magnetic fields, kinematics, heatings, and spatio-temporal resolution. We find that the joint action of dynamics, Hanle effect, and low temporal resolutions mimics Zeeman linear polarization profiles, the true weak-field Zeeman signals being negligible. Our results allow reinterpretation of many polarization signals of the solar spectra and support time-dependent scattering polarization as a powerful tool for deciphering the spatio-temporal distribution of chromospheric heatings and fields. This approach may be a key aid in developing the Hanle diagnosis for the solar atmosphere. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figures, published in ApJ...|$|E

Successive committees of enquiry have attributed {{this to a}} loss of competitiveness deriving both from poor production methods and laggardly innovation. An examination of innovation in ship design and construction and in marine propulsion highlights the declining British contribution in these fields.

40|$|Primary {{farmers and}} {{downstream}} agri-business are vertically coordinated via various governance structures, such as spot markets, vertical integration, or other hybrid forms. In this paper, {{we focus on}} one particular vertical coordination from, i. e., contract farming. The use of contracts {{as a way of}} organizing transactions between primary farmers and downstream agri-business is spreading in many agricultural sectors. One observation is that many <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangements</b> are adopted in agricultural contracts. The <b>restrictive</b> contractual <b>arrangements</b> specify issues/decisions ex ante, and/or move decision rights across fixed firm boundaries. What determines the extent and form of decision rights allocation in agricultural contracts? According to the literature on writing costs, GHM models and franchising, quality, reputation and uncertainty determine the completeness of a contract, while quality, reputation, specific investment and monopsony-oligopsony power determine the extent of decision rights allocation between farmer growers and downstream processors. We present the data on 12 vegetable and fruit contracting networks in China to test the explanatory power of the above-mentioned explanatory variables. We find that the extent of completeness of a contract and allocation pattern of decision rights varies substantially across different supply chains in China. Most firms have rights t...|$|R
40|$|Note:This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the economic significance of trademark protection. The analysis covers {{the implications of the}} trademark law to consumer information, advertising and product differentiation, competitive behaviour and industry structure in the producing and the distributive trades. The author argues that trademark protection is partly responsible for strong barriers to entry of new firms into an industry. Not only does it encourage advertising and other forms of differentiation, it also serves to enforce <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangements</b> such as exclusive distributorship, market sharing, tying, and resale price maintenance. It is also argued that through the above arrangements, trademark protection influences the structure of the distributive trades, hence their relative bargaining strength vis-a-vis the producers. The study shows further that although a trademark serves as a storehouse of information regarding a product's properties, the proliferation of trademarks may serve to confuse rather than inform the consumers. Finally, no reason has been found for associating “real" (as opposed to "fancied") differentiation with trademark protection...|$|R

5|$|During {{the latter}} part of Diệm's rule, a {{centerpiece}} of the rural pacification campaign was the large-scale construction of strategic hamlets, whereby villagers were compelled to move into fortified camps in an attempt to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, whereas a previous implementation of such principles in Malaya had been successful as the local communists were ethnic Chinese who were physically distinguishable from the anti-communist ethnic majority. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks, something many villagers found to their liking. General Lê Văn Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and it was decided to liberalize the system to try to win over the peasants. They forecast that they could reduce the insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangements,</b> citing more cooperative attitudes in Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài.

We make a significant distinction between these determinants depending on the components of debt issued: long-term or short-term forms of debt. Our results show that large firms {{are more likely to}} have access to long-term debt borrowing than small firms and that, due to supply constraints, small firms resort to short-term forms of debt. Firms with higher potential for growth prefer using less long-term debt as well as debt with fewer <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangements</b> in order to become more financially flexible. Firms with sufficient fixed assets can generate external finance more easily and at lower cost by using these assets as collateral, which supports the tradeoff theory. Firms generating high levels of profit, however, may choose to finance their investments using internal resources rather than by raising debt finance, which conforms to the pecking order theory. Our results also confirm the presence of the inertia effect and industry-specific effects, and are robust to alternative estimation techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives - To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} extent of restrictions on smoking at home, at school and in public places, and smoking uptake, smoking prevalence and monthly cigarette consumption by school students. Design - Cross-sectional survey with merged records of extent of restrictions on smoking in public places. Setting – United States. Participants – 17, 287 high school students. Main outcome measures – Five-point scale of smoking uptake; 30 -day smoking prevalence; monthly cigarette consumption among current smokers. Results – More <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangements</b> on smoking at home were associated with a greater likelihood {{of being in a}}n earlier stage of smoking uptake (p<. 05), lower 30 -day prevalence (p<. 001) and reduced monthly cigarette consumption (p<. 001). These findings applied even where parents were smokers. More pervasive restrictions on smoking in public places were associated with a higher probability of being in a earlier stage of smoking uptake (p<. 05), lower 30 -day prevalence (p<. 05), but not reduced consumption. School smoking bans were only related to a greater likelihood of being in an earlier stage of smoking uptake (p<. 05), lower prevalence (p<. 001) and reduced consumption (p<. 006), when the ban was strongly enforced, as measured by instances when teenagers perceived that most or all students obeyed the rule. Conclusions - These findings suggest that restrictions on smoking at home, more extensive bans on smoking in public places and enforced bans on smoking at school may reduce teenage smoking...|$|R

40|$|Antitrust {{issues have}} {{become one of}} the main concern of the world economy {{community}} and the United Nations. For many years, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has multiplied the meetings to discuss the relationship between transnational enterprises and international investment and has engaged in reflections on methods to avoid a decline in international investment. However, these meetings failed to resolve the fundamental issue of the impact of international antitrust principles on <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangements</b> between a foreign parent corporation and its local subsidiary, particularly where that subsidiary is in a developing country. If applied, multinational enterprises would be significantly deterred from creating and improving foreign subsidiaries because of rules denying them control of the buying and selling policies of such subsidiaries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the market power of a multinational corporation in the relevant markets, the degree of independence of the subsidiary, the purpose of the restraint and the relationship between the scope and duration of the restraint and any legitimate purposes for it. This article explores two essential antitrust liability decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States aimed at enforcing the policy of American antitrust agencies in refraining them from challenging arrangements between closely affiliated firms, except in special circumstance. In addition, the author analyzed the basis of the Antitrust Guide for International Operations issued in 1977 by the Justice Department and its impact on the activities of a multinational corporation. The proposed approach set out in this paper calls for rules against restrictions on subsidiaries to deal only with basically commercial decisions, such as what the subsidiary should manufacture, where it should be located, and how it should be managed. Nevertheless, this article found that intra-corporate restrictions should be treated at the international level, not as never being a restrictive business practice or always being a restrictive business practice, but in terms of the rule-of-reason analysis developed in United States cases which analysis is closely approximated by the Common Market treatment of similar practices...|$|R

Administrative data and reviews of client records were used in this study to look at the choice of housing option and the change in level of care of 367 young adults who emancipated from the Lighthouse Youth Services Independent Living Program in Cincinnati, Ohio, during the five-year period 2001 - 2006. Given a range of housing options at the time of discharge, over half (55 %) chose an independent living arrangement, including 41 % who lived in their own place, either alone (28 %) or with a roommate (13 %). Only 21 % decided to live in someone else's home, including just 7 % with one or both birth parents, 10 % with some other relative, and 4 % with a non-relative. The remaining 24 % of youth were discharged from independent living to a more <b>restrictive</b> living <b>arrangement</b> (a. k. a., higher "level of care", including a residential treatment program, group home, foster care, or supervised independent living program) (11 %) or whose whereabouts were unknown (13 %). The outcomes of this study suggest that, when presented with a choice of housing options, most of this county's emancipating foster youth would prefer to live on their own, rather than to return to live with their families of origin.

40|$|This Article {{proposes to}} {{modernize}} the archaic procedures states use to authorize marriages so as to provide legal flexibility, promote efficiency, and enhance individual choice. Almost universally, states require couples 2 ̆ 7 presence within their borders, however briefly, for a ceremony. After considering the historical and policy rationales for this requirement and finding them either obsolete or incoherent, we propose that states offer marriages to those outside their borders. Such distance marriages could occur via video-conference, using the internet or even telephone, with readily available safeguards to prevent fraud. This simple reform would allow certain couples who cannot marry under local law to import the trappings of an official marriage ceremony in 2 ̆ 2 real time, 2 ̆ 2 as well as assure access to the legal tie for any couple facing a barrier of physical separation. Our proposal builds upon the historical and present-day precedent of proxy marriage and legal principles such as choice of law for multi-jurisdictional contracts and corporate formation. With this reform, states {{would be free to}} compete over marriage procedure efficiency and experiment with alternative regulatory goals or menu options, such as enabling greater disclosure about personal or health histories, permitting more <b>restrictive</b> prenuptial <b>arrangements</b> (as with certain states 2 ̆ 7 development of 2 ̆ 2 covenant marriage 2 ̆ 2) or tying access to certain distance marriages to advance agreement to accept jurisdiction for marriage dissolution. Finally, our proposal would allow same-sex couples (and other couples unable to marry under their home jurisdictions 2 ̆ 7 laws) easier access to marriage authorization and the ability to perform wedding ceremonies before family and friends.

40|$|Controversies often arise at the {{interfaces}} where {{intellectual property}} (2 ̆ 2 IP 2 ̆ 2) law meets other topics {{in law and}} economics, such as property law, contract law, and antitrust law. Participants in the debates over how to mediate these interfaces often view each interface as a special case deserving unique treatment under the law. The doctrines of copyright and patent misuse are cases in point: they graft select antitrust principles onto copyright or patent law, {{even though there is}} an entirely distinct body of law - antitrust law - designed to deal with the putative concerns about competition that allegedly give rise to misuse. In this essay, we argue that a better approach for mediating disputes at the periphery of IP law focuses on what we term the 2 ̆ 2 basics 2 ̆ 2 - or core principles and features - of each area of law, and rarely requires specialized frameworks. For example, according to our 2 ̆ 2 basics matter 2 ̆ 2 approach, {{there is no need to}} create special doctrines or approaches to address issues relating to matters such as price discrimination or <b>restrictive</b> licensing <b>arrangements</b> involving IP. Rather, analyzing the legality of such arrangements simply requires one to look to the basics of substantive IP law, antitrust law, and what some people call the 2 ̆ 2 general law 2 ̆ 2 - property law, contract law, and the like. Applying the basics of each area of the law gives us a workable - and more predictable - framework of analysis than creating one - with more specialized approaches, such as the doctrines of copyright or patent misuse, using the basics results in easier to apply rules for resolving disputes that transacting parties can better understand and rely on in advance. By reducing legal uncertainty, the 2 ̆ 2 basics matter 2 ̆ 2 approach facilitates the ex ante coordination necessary to promote innovation through the commercialization of the inventions, symbols, and creative works that are protected by patents, copyrights, and trademarks - the entire goal of IP law and an important goal of antitrust law...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} public assistance for the Parisian laboring poor and the political turmoil of {{the first years of}} the French Revolution. It examines the immediate connections between the expansion and contraction of welfare benefits for the poor on the one hand and the rise and fall of insurgency on the other. ^ The work of both historians and social workers serves as a point of departure for the study. The second chapter shows the rapidly developing destitution of the able-bodied poor in 1788 and 1789, and the failure of the ancien regime authorities responsible for assisting them to respond effectively to their needs. The third chapter details the role of the Parisian poor in the rising disorder of the early days of the Revolution. At the same time, Chapter III {{describes the}} initial efforts of the new revolutionary authorities, who took over the responsibilities of the royal government and rapidly increased the number of men receiving assistance in public workshops (ateliers de charite). The fourth chapter considers the systematic expansion of public assistance which had begun only haltingly in the summer of 1789. It also explores the changing pattern of the conditions under which relief was given. Chapter V describes the unique institutional arrangements (ateliers de filature) for able-bodied women. From archival records, an in depth portrait of the recipients, the female laboring poor, emerges. Historians have rarely studied the female laboring poor, and the socio-economic data presented in this chapter offers many new insights into their origins and occupations. Similarly Chapter VI describes the men enrolled and the various aspects of their life in the ateliers de filature such as work projects, wage rates, occupation, and crime and fraud. The last chapter studies the use of the public workshops for men to restore order. It summarizes the imposition of <b>restrictive</b> relief <b>arrangements</b> when the public workshops were closed. ^ The period from 1788 through 1791 demonstrates a complete cycle of relief giving from social crisis and liberalization to the return of order and the contraction of benefits, and it amply demonstrates that changes in welfare policy have a political dimension. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the evolving policies and institutional arrangements in the Canadian agri-food industry; specifically {{an analysis of}} differential development between the dairy and beef livestock sectors. Moving beyond the pluralist and other alternative explanations {{for the development of}} marketing boards, an integrative theoretical framework which incorporates a broader conceptual and theoretical approach was adopted to investigate the role of producers, agribusiness and the state in the agricultural policy-making process for each agri-food sector. Two specific periods of conflict were examined, which represented significant attempts to introduce a marketing board as a means to resolve a crisis that was afflicting each industry. Using a dual content analysis approach, this thesis examined the background papers to (i) the Ontario Milk Industry Inquiry Committee, and (ii) the Commission of Inquiry into the Marketing of Beef and Veal, {{in order to determine the}} interests of each of the participants to the Inquiry, in relation to the policy recommendations and the legislative response.;From this investigation, it was discovered that the policy outcomes from each period of conflict were directed towards the combined interests of large scale efficient producers and agribusiness firms. In the dairy industry, large scale producers were advocating a joint proposal that would protect their own interests, while large scale processors were demanding the complete overhaul of the rigid and <b>restrictive</b> institutional <b>arrangements</b> that were maintaining inefficiencies in production and processing activities, and limiting the investment of capital. The state 2 ̆ 7 s response to the crisis was to introduce 2 ̆ 7 enabling legislation 2 ̆ 7 for the complete rationalization of the dairy production process. In the beef livestock industry, producers were divided on the type of marketing system that would resolve a severe cost-price squeeze.

The state 2 ̆ 7 s response was to modify the beef marketing system through the introduction of import quotas and stabilization payments. In both agri-food industries, the state response to the interests of capital, suggests that the institutional arrangements in the Canadian agri-food industry deserves more critical examination...|$|R
40|$|This report {{argues that}} the Commonwealth has failed {{to work with the}} Northern Territory to provide {{accommodation}} and other support services, other than accommodation in a maximum security prison, for people with intellectual disabilities who are unfit to plead to criminal charges. Overview Four Aboriginal men with intellectual and cognitive disabilities were held for years in a maximum security prison in the Northern Territory despite being found unfit to stand trial or {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity.   If two of these men had been found guilty they would have received a sentence of 12 months. Instead, they were imprisoned for four and a half years and six years respectively. The Australian Human Rights Commission conducted an inquiry into whether this involved any breach of human rights by Commonwealth. The Commission found that there was a failure by the Commonwealth to work with the Northern Territory to provide accommodation and other support services, other than accommodation in a maximum security prison, for people with intellectual disabilities who are unfit to plead to criminal charges.   There was an obligation at international law on the Commonwealth to act.   This obligation was consistent with domestic obligations undertaken by the Commonwealth to the Northern Territory.  The need for action was well known and had been well known for many years.   Specific administrative measures to take this action were provided for by legislation.   The failure to act was inconsistent with or contrary to the complainants’ rights under articles 9 (1) and 10 (1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and articles 14 (1), 19, 25, 26 (1) and 28 (1) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.   In particular, it was contrary to their right not to be arbitrarily detained, and their right as people with disabilities to live in the community with choices equal to others. In the case of Mr KA and Mr KD, the failure to act was also inconsistent with article 7 of the ICCPR and article 15 of the CRPD which prohibit inhuman or degrading treatment.   Mr KA was subject to regular restraint including being strapped to a chair and the use of shackles when outside his cell, seclusion and use of tranquilizers.   Mr KD was subject to regular seclusion and use of tranquilizers.   The prison environment in which they continue to be detained is inappropriate for people with their disabilities. The Commission made the following recommendations: 	The Commonwealth provide a copy of the Commission’s findings to the Northern Territory and seek assurances from the Northern Territory that it will take immediate steps to identify alternative accommodation arrangements for each of the complainants so that Mr KA and Mr KD are no longer detained in a prison and Mr KB and Mr KC are progressively moved out of held detention. These arrangements should be the least <b>restrictive</b> <b>arrangements</b> appropriate to each individual and should include a plan to progressively move each of them into the community along with necessary support services. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to establish an appropriate range of facilities in the Northern Territory so that people with cognitive impairment who are subject to a custodial supervision order can be accommodated in places other than prisons. This range of facilities should include secure care facilities and supported community supervision. The number of places available in these facilities should be sufficient to cater for the number of people who are anticipated to make use of them. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to ensure that people with cognitive impairment who have not been convicted of an offence are detained as a measure of last resort, for the shortest appropriate period of time, and in the least restrictive appropriate environment. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to ensure that when a person with a cognitive impairment is detained under a custodial supervision order, a plan is put in place to move that person into progressively less restrictive environments and eventually out of detention. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to develop model service system standards for the detention of people with a cognitive impairment. 	The Commonwealth cooperate with the Northern Territory to ensure that when a person with a cognitive impairment is detained he or she is provided with appropriate advice and support, including the appointment of a guardian or advocate. The Commonwealth did not directly respond to these recommendations, on the basis that it considered that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to inquire into the complaints. As this decision can be reviewed under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth), this is the only statement the Commission will be making on this matter...|$|R

It is widely known {{that a significant number}} of these ‘irregular’ migrants pay various types of brokers (often labelled, accurately or otherwise, ‘human smugglers’) at least at one stage – either to enter the country or to escape it. As a non-signatory to the UN Refugee Convention, Indonesia does not permit local integration. While a substantial part of these migrants are detained in the 13 immigration detention centres scattered around the archipelago, many roam freely, looking for opportunities for onward migration. Due to the <b>restrictive</b> border protection <b>arrangements</b> between Australia and Indonesia and a number of bilateral intelligence measures for deterring ‘unwanted’ migrants, human smugglers have been gradually forced to adapt strategies, routes and prices. According to much of the available data, most human smugglers are not Indonesians but foreigners who have been lingering in Indonesia for many years. This article demonstrates, moreover, that these foreigners depend upon local contacts to successfully carry out their risky business. Most often, the Indonesian counterparts are solely facilitators or handymen, but in a number of cases Indonesian authorities have also been involved in this highly lucrative business...|$|R
40|$|Increased fuel costs, {{heightened}} {{environmental protection}} requirements, and noise abatement continue to place drag reduction {{at the forefront}} of aerospace research priorities. Unfortunately, shortfalls still exist in the fundamental understanding of boundary-layer airflow over aerodynamic surfaces, especially regarding drag arising from skin friction. For example, there is insufficient availability of instrumentation to adequately characterize complex flows with strong pressure gradients, heat transfer, wall mass flux, three-dimensionality, separation, shock waves, and transient phenomena. One example is the acoustic liner efficacy on aircraft engine nacelle walls. Active measurement of shear stress in boundary layer airflow would enable {{a better understanding of how}} aircraft structure and flight dynamics affect skin friction. Current shear stress measurement techniques suffer from reliability, complexity, and airflow disruption, thereby compromising resultant shear stress data. The state-of-the-art for shear stress sensing uses indirect or direct measurement techniques. Indirect measurements (e. g., hot-wire, heat flux gages, oil interferometry, laser Doppler anemometry, small scale pressure drag surfaces, i. e., fences) require intricate knowledge of the studied flow, <b>restrictive</b> instrument <b>arrangements,</b> large surface areas, flow disruption, or seeding material; with smaller, higher bandwidth probes under development. Direct measurements involve strain displacement of a sensor element and require no prior knowledge of the flow. Unfortunately, conventional "floating" recessed components for direct measurements are mm to cm in size. Whispering gallery mode devices and Fiber Bragg Gratings are examples of recent additions to this type of sensor with much smaller (m) sensor components. Direct detection techniques are often single point measurements and difficult to calibrate and implement in wind tunnel experiments. In addition, the wiring, packaging, and installation of delicate micro-electromechanical devices impede the use of most direct shear sensors. Similarly, the cavity required for sensing element displacement is sensitive to particulate obstruction. This work was focused on developing a shear stress sensor for use in subsonic wind tunnel test facilities applicable to an array of test configurations. The non-displacement shear sensors described here have minimal packaging requirements resulting in minimal or no disturbance of boundary layer flow. Compared to previous concepts, device installation could be simple with reduced cost and down-time. The novelty lies in the creation of low profile (nanoscale to 100 m) micropost arrays that stay within the viscous sub-layer of the airflow. Aerodynamic forces, which are related to the surface shear stress, cause post deflection and optical property changes. Ultimately, a reliable, accurate shear stress sensor that does not disrupt the airflow has the potential to provide high value data for flow physics researchers, aerodynamicists, and aircraft manufacturers leading to greater flight efficiency arising from more in-depth knowledge on how aircraft design impacts near surface properties...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{a new policy}} {{involving}} normalisation, integration, equality and deinstitutionalisation of mentally retarded (MR) individuals has been accepted in Sweden. Consequently, many institutions have been closed and an increased {{number of people with}} MR are now integrated into the Swedish community. The general aim of this thesis was to investigate if a greater degree of independence for MR adults influenced the prevalence of oral diseases. Material and methods: The caries incidence and prevalence, number of remaining teeth, incidence of tooth mortality and inter-proximal bone loss were investigated in a group of MR adults, aged 21 - 40 years, all with protracted, regular preventive dental care. The studied variables were related to living arrangements and degree of MR, and were followed during 8. 5 years (Papers I, II and VI). Incidence and reasons for tooth mortality were studied during 10 years in institutionalised MR individuals (Paper III). In connection with the closing-down of an institution for MR adults, the changes of oral hygiene habits, sucrose intake and oral microbiological flora were studied in the new integrated living (Papers IV and V). Results: Less <b>restrictive</b> living <b>arrangements</b> and mild forms of MR were correlated to a high caries prevalence in persons with MR. After 8. 5 years, the caries incidence had decreased in all subjects, but persons with mild MR and those who lived integrated still had a higher caries prevalence than other MR adults. With the exception of subjects with Down syndrome, the interproximal bone loss during 8. 5 years was similar or lower compared to normal Swedish populations. Institutionalised MR subjects had lost an average of 3. 72 teeth during 10 years. Periodontitis was the main reason for tooth mortality. Persons who cooperated well with dental treatment and those who used neuroleptics lost fewer teeth during the 10 -year period compared to other MR individuals. The proportion of subjects with high levels of mutans streptococci and subjects who showed growth of P. intermedia/P. nigrescens decreased after deinstitutionalisation, and less subjects consumed sucrose frequently. The oral hygiene routines, and the levels of lactobacilli, P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were not influenced by the change in living arrangements. A simplified saliva sampling method, involving licking directly on the bacteria culture, was developed to count lactobacilli in saliva when delivering whole saliva was impossible. Conclusions: Less restrictive living and a mild degree of MR were correlated to a high caries prevalence. Subjects with poor ability to cooperate with dental treatment and those with Down syndrome have an obvious risk of deteriorated oral health. However, compared to normal Swedish populations, the MR subjects studied in this thesis had, after several years of regular dental care, satisfactory oral health...|$|R
