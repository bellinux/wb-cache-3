40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes –Part 1 Numerical simulations Leaks occasionally occur in flange joints in plastic pipelines, predominantly large dimension ones. Such pipelines are normally {{of importance for}} e g water supply, and repair is expensive. A better understanding is vital since a clear background is missing for the existing design and mounting recommendations, which also are differing. Analysis of plastic flanges {{is more complicated than}} for metal ones since the material is time dependent, and much softer than the backing rings and bolts. The aim of this work was to be able to assess on one hand if presently standardized flange geometries mean smaller safety margins when the size of the pipe is increased, {{and on the other hand}} if the instructions for mounting have to be improved. First, an analysis was made by manual calculations, without consideration of the time dependent properties of the material, in order to assess the stresses just after tightening of the joint but before pressurizing and start of service time of the pipeline. The manualanalysis is of course misleading for assessment of the compression stresses in the flange surfaces over time, although it seems that such calculations often are used for design. The value of the manual analysis was mainly that it showed that the nominal stresses aresimilar for different sizes, except for the 630 mm pipe where they are significantly higher. Further it was established that pressurizing of the pipe means a moderate influence on the flange stresses and bolt forces, 10 - 15 %, and that the bolt and backing ring are much stiffer than the plastic flange, meaning that it is mainly relaxation that is responsible forunloading of the joint over time. Computer simulations (FEM) were then made of both the tightening and the service phase for a set of geometries, and with a material model including time dependent properties of the plastic parts of the joint using material data from in-house experiments. Although the computer simulations are approximate too, they give a much better impression both of the principal function of the joint and of the magnitude of the stresses over time. It appears that the geometry of the flange joint means that the contact is lost over large parts of the flange surfaces already at pressurizing and that a triangulardistribution of pressure covering a part of the flange surface corresponding to the width of the backing ring is developed over time which should be sufficient to keep the joint tight. The effects of gaskets and profiled, softer, backing rings are clarified, and it is indicated that re-tightening is an efficient way to improve the function of the joint over time. Further, it seems that there is no significant difference in behaviour, as regards flange pressure, between SDR 11 and SDR 17 geometries. So, the FEM investigation has revealed that intuitive thoughts about reasons for inferior functioning of large size flange joints in plastic pipes are not well founded. The most efficient way to improve the joint is to increase the bolt force and to keep it up,by re-tightening or by flexible backing <b>rings.</b> <b>Gaskets,</b> soft ones, may be beneficial for reducing unevenness of the plastic joint surfaces...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{accelerating}} gradients of 15 - 25 MV/m with the superconducting cavi-ties in the TESLA Test Facility, considerable effort is put into preparing the cavities and the auxiliary components to avoid field emission due to particle contamination. The particle cleanliness has to be preserved throughout the whole assembly procedure of the cavities. Most crucial is the mounting of the flange connections which have to be UHV-leaktight with the cavities immersed in superfluid helium. In the present design, the niobium cavities are fabricated with Nb sealing surfaces with a thickness of 3 mm. Split stainless steel <b>rings</b> and spring-type <b>gaskets</b> (Helicoflex) are used to provide UHV-tight connections to the stainless steel counter flanges. This design has several disadvantages. The gaskets can not be prop-erly made “particle-free ” and {{the handling of the}} split flanges may contaminate the cavities during assembly. Moreover, the sealing surfaces of the Nb cavities get quite soft during the 1400 ˚C heat treatment, which often results in leak problems due to plastic deformations. An alternative approach are NbTi-flanges directly welded to the Nb cavities. They should allow an easier assembly of the counter flanges. Various types of spring-less gaskets are under investigation and the results will be presented. ...|$|R

Next, some simulations under the optimized structure parameters are given as a reference for the mask design of the rotor wafer and electrode plates. As two key components, the process flows of the rotor wafer and electrode plates are described in detail. All the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photos show that the fabrication process is effective and optimized. Then, an assembly model is designed for the static capacitance adjustable MDTG, whose static capacitance can be changed by rotating the lower electrode plate support and substituting <b>gasket</b> <b>rings</b> of different thicknesses. Thus, the scale factor is easily changeable. Afterwards, the digitalized closed-loop measurement circuit is simulated.

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent <b>gasket</b> and retaining <b>ring</b> (retaining ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap <b>ring</b> and <b>gasket</b> into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new <b>gasket,</b> the snap <b>ring</b> loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket installation tool.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{hydrothermal}} moissanite cell for in situ experiments at pressures up to 1000 bar and temperature to 850 Â°C. The original moissanite cell presented by Schiavi et al. (2010) was redesigned to allow precise control of fluid pressure. The new device {{consists of a}} cylindrical sample chamber drilled into a bulk piece of NIMONIC 105 super alloy, which is connected through a capillary to an external pressure control system. Sealing is provided by two gold <b>gasket</b> <b>rings</b> between the moissanite windows and the sample chamber. The new technique allows the direct observation of various phenomena, such as bubble nucleation, bubble growth, crystal growth, and crystal dissolution in silicate melts, at accurately controlled rates of heating, cooling, and compression or decompression. Several pilot experiments on bubble nucleation and growth at temperature of 715 Â°C and under variable pressure regimes (pressure oscillations between 500 and 1000 bar and decompression from 800 to 200 bar at variable decompression rates) were conducted using a haplogranitic glass as starting material. Bubble nucleation occurs in a short single event upon heating of the melt above the glass transition temperature and upon decompression, but only during the first 100 bar of decompression. New bubbles nucleate only {{at a distance from}} existing bubbles larger than the mean diffusive path of water in the melt. Bubbles expand and shrink instantaneously in response to any pressure change. The bubble-bubble contact induced during pressure cycling and decompression does not favor bubble coalescence, which is never observed at contact times shorter than 60 s. However, repeated pressure changes favor the diffusive coarsening of larger bubbles {{at the expense of the}} smaller ones (Ostwald ripening). Experiments with the haplogranite show that, under the most favorable conditions of volatile supersaturation (as imposed by the experiment), highly viscous melts are likely to maintain the packing of bubbles for longer time before fragmentation. In-situ observations with the new hydrothermal moissanite cell allow to carefully assess the conditions of bubble nucleation, eliminating the uncertainty given by the post mortem observation of samples run using conventional experimental techniques...|$|R
