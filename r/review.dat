This study assessed the quality of systematic <b>reviews</b> and meta-analyses of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) for allergic rhinitis in children, published since 2000. Eligible <b>reviews</b> were identified by searching Medline/Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from 2000 through 2008. Methodological quality was assessed using the assessment of multiple systematic <b>reviews</b> instrument. Ten systematic <b>reviews</b> were included, one of which was published in the Cochrane Library. Eight <b>reviews</b> gave some details about the search strategy. None of the <b>reviews</b> included measures to avoid selection bias. In 60 % of the <b>reviews,</b> the methodological quality of the included studies was (partly) assessed. Four <b>reviews</b> pooled the results of individual studies, neglecting clinical heterogeneity. Three of the 10 <b>reviews</b> provided information about sources of funding or grants from industry. Of the 10 <b>reviews,</b> the six <b>reviews</b> with the highest overall score scored 5 - 8 points, indicating moderate quality. Systematic <b>reviews</b> are useful to evaluate the efficacy of SLIT in children. Although more <b>reviews</b> have become available, the methodological quality could be improved. SLIT for children could be promising, but methodological flaws in the <b>reviews</b> and individual studies are too serious to draw definite conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess how}} {{information}} about adverse events {{is included in}} systematic <b>reviews.</b> Study Design and Setting: We included all new Cochrane <b>reviews</b> published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic <b>Reviews</b> (CDSRs) and all new <b>reviews</b> (2003 - 2004) in the Database of Abstracts of <b>Reviews</b> of Effects (DAREs) in Issue 1 2005 of The Cochrane Library. Results: More than half of Cochrane (44 / 78) and DARE (46 / 79) <b>reviews</b> assessed drug interventions. The rest assessed surgery (Cochrane [12]; DARE [10]), psychosocial, educational, or physiotherapy interventions (22; 23). Seventy-six percent (59 / 78) of Cochrane <b>reviews</b> mentioned adverse events as an outcome compared with 48 % (38 / 79) of DARE <b>reviews.</b> Most <b>reviews</b> mentioning adverse events were of drug interventions (Cochrane [41 / 59]; DARE <b>reviews</b> [29 / 38]). Considering <b>reviews</b> that mentioned adverse events, 95 % (56 / 59) of Cochrane <b>reviews</b> included only randomized trials and 73 % (43 / 59) included an analysis of adverse events. For 10 Cochrane <b>reviews,</b> adverse events had not been reported by the included trials. In contrast, 58 % (22 / 38) of DARE <b>reviews</b> mentioning adverse events included only randomized trials, the rest included both randomized and nonrandomized studies. Conclusions: Most Cochrane <b>reviews</b> of drug interventions considered adverse events. This {{was not the case}} for DARE <b>reviews</b> and for Cochrane <b>reviews</b> of nondrug interventions.
