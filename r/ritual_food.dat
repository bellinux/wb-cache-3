50|$|The Lacandón have {{sometimes}} gone into nearby towns {{to participate in}} Catholic mass or other rituals performed by priests.

The priests repeatedly tried to {{emphasize the importance of}} monogamy in their religion, which may have led to the initial general non-acceptance of the religion. Polygyny was seen by the male Lacandón as a way to ensure labor and economic power, retain <b>ritual</b> knowledge in <b>food</b> preparation, and maintain fertility among wives at different times. Interestingly, the Christian religion provided somewhat of a break for Lacandón women because {{there was no need for}} the exhaustive process and knowledge base of preparing <b>ritual</b> <b>foods</b> for ceremonies. Because of this, and their exclusion from the traditional ceremonies other than cooking, many Lacandón women asked their husbands to convert to Christianity.|$|R
