5|$|A partial {{recreation}} of the Kowloon Walled City {{exists in}} the Kawasaki Warehouse, an amusement arcade that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The designer's desire to accurately <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere of the Walled City {{is reflected in the}} arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.|$|E

30|$|In this work, an {{adaptive}} replication framework is suggested {{to allow a}} consumer to pass requests to a specific replica {{in the same way}} as in the passive replication case. However, when the target replica fails or becomes overloaded, <b>the</b> framework <b>replicates</b> <b>the</b> original service into another server during runtime and then forwards the consumer’s requests to the new replica automatically. Notably, the suggested framework considers only <b>replicating</b> <b>the</b> target services without <b>replicating</b> <b>the</b> incoming requests.|$|R

Despite the fact that the McLaren team had dominated on the Monaco set up of the circuit, Ferrari were better on the Canadian set up.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of his time in San Francisco, Johnson was unable to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> success of his rookie year, as his production dropped significantly in the following two seasons. He played in seven games in 1955 before suffering a shoulder injury against the Los Angeles Rams, and finished the year with only 19 carries for 69 yards and one touchdown. He was traded to the Detroit Lions following the 1956 season in exchange for fullback Bill Bowman and defensive back Bill Stits.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of folk instruments, other bands in the genre resort to using {{keyboards}} to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> sound of folk instruments. This includes the aforementioned Storm, Empyrium and Finntroll {{as well as other}} acts like Midnattsol. Bands that supplement a folk instrument like the violin with keyboards include Skyclad, Mägo de Oz, and Tuatha de Danann.|$|E
50|$|Rehm et al. (1979) <b>replicated</b> <b>the</b> {{procedures}} used in Fuchs and Rehm's (1997) study and evaluated {{the effects of}} self-control therapy against a behavioral assertion skills training program.

5000|$|The legacy (v. 7.0.3 and earlier) Final Cut (Pro and Express) {{interface}} {{was designed}} around non-computerized editing work-flows, with four main windows that replicate tried-and-trusted methods of organising, viewing and editing physical tape or film media. The browser, where source media files (or clips) are listed, <b>replicates</b> <b>the</b> editor's traditional film [...] "bins" [...] or stacks of videotapes. The Viewer, where individual media files can be previewed and trimmed, <b>replicates</b> <b>the</b> source monitor of older tape-based systems. <b>The</b> Canvas <b>replicates</b> <b>the</b> [...] "program" [...] monitor in such systems, where the edited material is viewed. The Timeline, where media are assembled into a sequence, <b>replicates</b> <b>the</b> physically edited film or master tape of earlier systems. There {{is also a}} small Toolbox window and two audio-level indicators for {{the left and right}} audio channels.|$|R

5|$|Large {{particle}} accelerators can <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> conditions that prevailed after the early {{moments of the}} universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement {{of the details of}} the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into high energy regimes. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.|$|E
5|$|Oxidation states above +2 in an {{uncharged}} {{species are}} extremely rare, although a cyclic mercurinium(IV) cation, with three substituents, {{may be an}} intermediate in oxymercuration reactions. In 2007, a report of synthesis of a mercury(IV) compound, mercury(IV) fluoride, was published,|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.|date=2007|volume=46|issue=44|pages=8371–8375|doi=10.1002/anie.200703710|pmid=17899620}} but later experiments could not <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> synthesis. In the 1970s, there was a claim on synthesis of a mercury(III) compound, but it is now thought to be false.|$|E

5|$|A Marvel One-Shot {{featuring}} Peggy Carter was in {{the works}} for some time before Atwell signed on to star in it, reprising her role from the Captain America films. D'Esposito, co-president of Marvel Studios and an executive producer on the feature films, aimed to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> period setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, while also giving the short a more modern, superhero feel. The film was a more ambitious production than previous One-Shots, with more action scenes and visual effects required than previously. Several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films also appear, including Cooper reprising his role of Howard Stark.|$|E
5|$|After bartering, {{he sells}} them {{the formula for}} liquid trellium-D, and also informs them that the Xindi {{recently}} visited a merchant nearby. Archer meets the merchant, Zjod, a slaver who tries to sell him a female called Rajiin. Archer refuses and leaves, but Rajiin chases after him. Following a fight between Archer and Zjod, the away team leave with Rajiin, and Archer promises to return her to her home planet. Later she approaches Archer in his quarters, and as she nears him she puts him in a trance, and he no longer remembers her visit. Meanwhile, T'Pol and Tucker attempt to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> chemical from B'Rat's formula but the first attempt fails.|$|E
5|$|Carnivàle {{interiors}} were filmed at Santa Clarita Studios in Santa Clarita, California, {{while the}} show's many exterior scenes were filmed on Southern California locations. The scenes of fictional California town of Mintern, where {{the stories about}} Brother Justin and Iris in Season 1 were based, were shot at Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills. The carnival set itself was moved around the greater Southern California area, to movie ranches and to Lancaster, which were to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> states of Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico. The permanent filming location of the carnival in Season 2 was Big Sky Ranch, which was also used for Brother Justin's new home in fictional New Canaan.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a heteroscedastic linear regression model with replication. To estimate the variances, {{one can use}} the sample variances or the sample average squared errors from a regression fit. We study the large-sample properties of these weighted least-squares estimates with estimated weights when <b>the</b> number of <b>replicates</b> is small. <b>The</b> estimates are generally inconsistent for asymmetrically distributed data. If sample variances are used based on m <b>replicates,</b> <b>the</b> weighted least-squares estimates are inconsistent for m = 2 <b>replicates</b> even when <b>the</b> data are normally distributed. With between 3 and 5 <b>replicates,</b> <b>the</b> rates of convergence are slower than the usual square root of N. With mss 6 <b>replicates,</b> <b>the</b> effect of estimating the weights is to increase variances by (m- 5) / (m- 3), relative to weighted least-squares estimates with known weights...|$|R
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front of a blue screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
5|$|Heartstrings, {{like the}} first record, was very much {{influenced}} by film, and is recognized for its cinematic quality. Juanita indicated that they deliberately made the album {{to sound like a}} soundtrack to a movie. Howling Bells along with the production team watched Paris, Texas and Blue Velvet, in an effort to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> mood, emotion, and atmosphere of these two films in particular. Other films that {{played a significant role in}} the making of Heartstrings include, Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde, Klute, , Nashville, Pleasantville, The Last Picture Show, and Vivre sa vie.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Citizens Force was reorganised to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> {{numerical}} designations of the AIF {{units and}} perpetuate their honours and traditions. As a result, the 12th Light Horse Regiment was re-raised in the New England region of New South Wales and headquartered at Armidale. In re-forming, the regiment drew lineage from the Citizens Forces' 12th (New England) Light Horse, which had existed {{parallel to the}} AIF light horse regiment and had remained in Australia during the war. This regiment, through a complex series of reorganisations, traced its lineage to the 6th Australian Light Horse Regiment, which had been raised in 1903 and perpetuated units that had contributed personnel to fight in South Africa during the Boer War.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, the astrologer and {{psychologist}} Michel Gauquelin {{stated that}} {{though he had}} failed to find evidence that supported indicators like zodiacal signs and planetary aspects in astrology, he did find positive correlations between the diurnal positions of some planets and success in professions that astrology traditionally associates with those planets. The best-known of Gauquelin's findings is based on the positions of Mars in the natal charts of successful athletes and became known as the Mars effect. A study conducted by seven French scientists attempted to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> claim, but found no statistical evidence. They attributed the effect to selective bias on Gauquelin's part, accusing him of attempting to persuade them to add or delete names from their study.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a cult named SAMPLE {{launches}} a heist to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> Flying Pussyfoot incident via a twin cruise ship named Exit and Entrance {{only to be}} thwarted by Claire Stanfield and Chane Laforet's descendants, Claudia and Charon Walken with Jaccuzi Splot and Nice Holystone's descendant, Bobby Splot along with his gang with unwitting aide from another faction called Mask Makers led by Huey's descendant Luchino B.

5|$|In September 1969, Cheyenne {{prototype}} #10 (s/n 66-8835) underwent {{wind tunnel}} testing at NASA Ames Research Center, {{to research the}} half-P hop and drag issues. The engineers {{did not realize that}} the fixed mounts used to secure the aircraft in the wind tunnel would not allow the helicopter to move relative to the rotor, as it did in flight. As a result, there was no natural damping of the rotor pitching motion. The remote controllers' lack of sensory feedback from helicopter compounded the situation. During high speed testing to <b>replicate</b> <b>the</b> half-P hop vibration, the rotor oscillations quickly accelerated out of control and struck the tail boom, resulting in the destructive breakup of the helicopter.|$|E
