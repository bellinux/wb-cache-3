40|$|One of the {{simplest}} and most popular antennas is the half-wave dipole, {{so it is not}} surprising that it was one of the earliest 1 feed antennas for a parabolic dish. A dipole antenna has a simple radiation pattern that most hams are familiar with – in free space, it looks like a donut with the dipole through the hole. If it is near ground or a reflector, the pattern in the plane perpendicular to the dipole (Hplane) is distorted to emphasize radiation away from the reflector. The distance between the dipole and reflector influences the shape of the radiation in this plane, while the shape of the radiation in a plane parallel to the dipole (E-plane) does not change significantly. Thus the pattern might be adjusted somewhat by varying the <b>reflector</b> <b>spacing.</b> Figure 6. 2 - 1 shows the radiation pattern calculated using NEC 2 for a dipole with a simple rod <b>reflector</b> <b>spaced</b> 0. 24 λ, which can also be described as a 2 -element Yagi-Uda antenna. The radiation patterns in the H-plane is much broader than the E-plane, and the front-to-ratio is poor, only about 10 dB. These two factors result in the mediocre efficiency shown in the lower plot in Figure 6. 2 - 1; a calculated dish efficiency of about 66 % would probably result in about 50 % efficiency in practice. We can also see that the dipole feed is better for very deep dishes, with best f/D around 0. 25. The calculated phase center is 0. 06 λ behind the dipole (toward the reflector). An intuitive phase cente...|$|R

Sedimentary facies have been interpreted from seismic facies identified on the profiles. The interpretations are based on relection characteristics and structural features of the seismic facies. The following reflection characteristics and structural features are used: <b>reflector</b> <b>spacing,</b> amplitude and continuity of reflections, internal reflection configurations, attitude of reflector terminations at a facies boundary, body geometry of a facies, and the architectural associations of seismic facies within each basin. The depositional systems are reconstructed by determining the paleotopography, bedding patterns, sedimentary facies, and modes of deposition within the basin. Muir Inlet is a recently deglaciated fjord for which successive glacier terminus positions and consequent rates of glacial retreat are known. In this environment the depositional processes and sediment characteristics vary with distance from a glacier terminus, such that during a retreat, a record of these variations is preserved in the aggrading sediment fill. Sedimentary facies within the basins of lower Muir Inlet are correlated with observed depositional processes near the present glacier terminus in the upper inlet.

40|$|Surface errors on {{parabolic}} reflector antennas degrade the overall {{performance of the}} antenna.

As for space applications, circular polarizations are usually used in spaceborne antennas. With circularly polarized feeds, {{there exists a}} beam squint phenomenon in offset reflector antennas [2]. The squint angle, which is manifested by a small beam shift of the radiation pattern in the plane perpendicular to the principal offset plane, can significantly affect the beam pointing accuracy. As {{one of the most}} widely used space antennas, cable mesh reflector antenna has attracted much attention due to its advantages of large diameter, light weight, and reasonable cost [3]. Similarly with the smooth solid reflectors, the beam squint phenomenon can also be observed in offset cable mesh reflector antennas with reflecting mesh leakage [4, 5]. The beam squint angle should be taken into account for space applications such as satellite communications, deep-space telemetry, and radio astronomy [2], which concentrate more on beam pointing accuracy.
