It does not cover every topic related to criminal forfeiture, nor all of the exceptions and nuances that apply to the topics that are discussed; rather, it covers only those matters on which there was a significant development in the case law in the past year. Thus a basic familiarity with federal criminal forfeiture procedure is assumed. The article begins with the law on the scope of criminal forfeiture and the seizure and <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> prior to trial. It then continues more or less chronologically through the trial, sentencing, ancillary proceeding and post-trial phases of a criminal forfeiture case. Except in instances where it is necessary to refer to the leading case in a given area for purposes of comparison or context, the citations are limited to the cases decided in 2005 and early 2006...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my thesis {{is to examine the}} case law made by the Czech courts related to {{environmental}} issues and to formulate general conclusion from the analyzed case law. My goal was also to prove whether the considered case law is contradictory, or not. I browsed many judicial collections, legal journals etc. and I paid attention to equal or not equal decision making in similar matters. My study concerns on the issues which are solved by the courts either contradictory, contrary to the past, in a new perspective or even surprising for its different reasoning in comparison to the doctrine. The thesis firstly deals with the role of the courts in the environmental protection, than it focuses on the basic issues of environmental law, in particular at the right on a healthy environment and the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> right. A special part of the thesis is devoted to the administrative proceedings with a potential impact on the environment and the effectiveness of legal protection provided by the courts. Finally, the thesis deals with the judge made law related to the protection of nature and landscape as well as other spheres of environment. The judge made law in environmental issues is essentially uniform, but in certain question it is contradictory. There is a significant tension between the doctrine and [...] ...|$|E

The {{attempt was made}} to compare the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine that was developed in England and is still used in the common law countries, on one the hand, and the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules on the other. Therefore the development <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine in England is described, as well as the modifications <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine in South Africa. Also it is given an overview <b>of</b> the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules. As far as the English and South African law is concerned, the historical developments and applicable principles <b>of</b> the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade doctrine are emphasised, whereas the main aim in the German part is to give an overview about the codified <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade rules. While comparing the common law doctrine and the German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade law it is emphasised that in the common law countries the reasonableness and public interest plays an important role, whereas in German <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade law, on the other hand, the payment of compensation is an important matter.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the article {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between a so-called "garden leave" clause and a post-termination <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade clause in employment contracts, in view of the decision in Vodacom (Pty) Ltd v Motsa 2016 3 SA 116 (LC). The Labour Court grappled with the question of whether the enforcement of the garden leave provision impacts on the enforcement <b>of</b> a post-termination <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade clause. Enforcement of both these types of clauses may be problematic. It can result in unfairness if an employee ends up being commercially inactive for a long period. The author argues that garden leave has a direct effect on the enforcement of a post- termination <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade clause. Accordingly, a <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade will be enforced only if the employer's proprietary interest requires additional protection beyond what is achieved under the garden leave clause...|$|R

Also on April 17, La Nación reported that on March 10, Federal Judge Adolfo Ziulu, in response to a complaint by the tax authorities, had issued a <b>restraint</b> on alienation <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> against Fariña in the amount of 314,686.52 pesos (USD 38,000). It was additionally reported on April 17 that Fariña had again been caught on hidden camera, this time on the Rial program, during which he had been recorded while the program was on a commercial break. Fariña said during this break that he did not talk about his business activities to his wife “because it’s a danger.” ...|$|R

50|$|Although general <b>restraints</b> <b>of</b> trade are unlawful, {{the court}} of the Queen's Bench, per Chief Justice Parker (Lord Macclesfield), held this <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade {{reasonable}} and therefore lawful. It was ancillary to a legitimate transaction (the rental or sale of the bakeshop business) and it was reasonably necessary to effectuate the main purpose. Its extent was limited to what was necessary to accomplish {{the main purpose of}} the transaction. If Reynolds reopened his bakery business, he would attract his old customers and deprive Mitchel of the benefit of his bargain with Reynolds, which included the goodwill of the business (i.e., the habit of the customers to continue to buy baked goods at the same location). Although a <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade without a good reason to support it is presumed unlawful, the court ruled, the presumption can be rebutted and overcome by facts such as those present here: the <b>restraint</b> <b>of</b> trade was necessary and ancillary to a lawful transaction.|$|R
