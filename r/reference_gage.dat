The area experiences intensive {{water resources management}} and ecosystem monitoring due to its strategic role as the principal water supply for New York City. Study focusWe analyzed average daily flows in nested and non-nested pairs of gaged watersheds in the Catskills to assess whether daily flow in ungaged watersheds can be calculated based on watershed area ratios. New hydrological insights for the regionWatershed area ratio {{was the most important}} basin parameter for estimating flow at upstream sites based on downstream flow. The area ratio alone explained 93 % {{of the variance in the}} slopes of relationships between upstream and downstream flows. Regression analysis indicated that flow at any upstream point can be estimated by multiplying the flow at a downstream <b>reference</b> <b>gage</b> by the watershed area ratio. This method accurately predicted upstream flows at area ratios as low as 0. 005. We also observed a very strong relationship (R 2 = 0. 79) between area ratio and flow–flow slopes in non-nested catchments. Our results indicate that a simple flow estimation method based on watershed area ratios is justifiable, and indeed preferred, for the estimation of daily streamflow in ungaged watersheds in the Catskills region...|$|E

50|$|A {{first step}} in the {{rational}} production of optics was a modernization of the workshop methods.  This was accomplished with some resistance from Löber and the other employees who preferred to remain with their traditional methods.  The plan was to measure every individual property of each lens element before an objective was constructed to allow precise reproduction of the optical system.  The D objective, for example contained 5 lenses.  Each was composed of glass with a specific index of refraction, with exact curvatures, of a specific focal length and exact spacings.  Löber had already investigated one requirement using glass <b>reference</b> <b>gages</b> to compare the curvature of lens surfaces using the phenomenon of Newton’s rings.  Fraunhofer had arrived at the same solution long before but the procedure had remained a trade secret of his workshop.   Abbe constructed a series of new measuring apparatus to measure focal lengths and refractive indices.  The result of all of this effort was clear by 1869.  Outwardly the microscopes had hardly changed, but due to the rationalization of the work flow more microscopes were produced with the same personnel.  Prices were reduced by 25%.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Energy has {{constructed}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) {{to develop the}} technology for the disposal of radioactive waste from defense programs. Sandia National Laboratories had {{the responsibility for the}} experimental activities at the WIPP and fielded several large-scale Thermal/Structural Interactions (TSI) in situ tests to validate techniques used to predict repository performance. The instrumentation of these tests involved the placement of over 4, 200 gages including room closure gages, borehole extensometers, stress gages, borehole inclinometers, fixed <b>reference</b> <b>gages,</b> borehole strain gages, thermocouples, thermal flux meters, heater power gages, environmental gages, and ventilation gages. Most of the gages were remotely read instruments that were monitored by an automated data acquisition system, but manually read instruments were also used to provide early deformation information and to provide a redundancy of measurement for the remote gages. Instruments were selected that could operate in the harsh environment of the test rooms and that could accommodate the ranges of test room responses predicted by pretest calculations. Instruments were tested in the field prior to installation at the WIPP site and were modified to improve their performance. Other modifications were made to gages as the TSI tests progressed using knowledge gained from test maintenance. Quality assurance procedures were developed for all aspects of instrumentation including calibration, installation, and maintenance. The instrumentation performed exceptionally well and has produced a large quantity of quality information...|$|R

It was developed specifically to measure thickness of wet (uncured) insulation applied to Space Shuttle structures; thin probes penetrate wet insulation to substrate, and <b>reference</b> surface on <b>gage</b> is then positioned against outer {{surface of insulation}} to measure its thickness.

40|$|The {{responses}} of river runoff to shifts of large-scale climatic patterns are of increasing concerns to water resource planners and managers for long-term climate change adaptation. El Niño, {{as one of}} the most dominant modes of climate variability, is closely linked to hydrologic extremes such as floods and droughts that cause great loss of lives and properties. However, the different impacts of the two types of El Niño, i. e., central Pacific (CP-) and eastern Pacific (EP-) El Niño, on runoff across the conterminous US (CONUS) are not well understood. This study characterizes the impacts of the CP- and EP-El Niño on seasonal and annual runoff using observed streamflow data from 658 <b>reference</b> <b>gaging</b> stations and the NCAR-CCSM 4 model. We found that surface runoff responds similarly to the two types of El Niño events in southeastern, central, southern, and western coastal regions, but differently in northeast (NE), Pacific northwest (PNW) and west north central (WNC) climatic zones. Specifically, EP-El Niño events tend to bring above-average runoff in NE, WNC, and PNW throughout the year while CP-El Niño events cause below-than normal runoff in the three regions. Similar findings were also found by analyzing NCAR-CCSM 4 model outputs that captured both the CP- and EP-El Niño events, representing the best data set among CMIP 5 models. The CCSM 4 model simulates lower runoff values during CP-El Niño years than those in EP-El Niño over all of the three climatic regions (NE, PNW, and WNC) during 1950 – 1999. In the future (2050 – 2099), for both types of El Niño years, runoff is projected to increase over the NE and PNW regions, mainly due to increased precipitation (P). In contrast, the increase of future evapotranspiration (ET) exceeds that of future P, leading to a projected decrease in runoff over the WNC region. In addition, model analysis indicates that all of the three regions (NE, PNW, and WNC) are projected to have lower runoff in CP-El Niño years than in EP-El Niño years. Our study suggests that the US water resources may be distributed more unevenly in space and time with more frequent and intense flood and drought events. The findings from this study have important implications to water resource management at regional scales. Information generated from this study may help water resource planners to anticipate the influence of two different types of El Niño events on droughts and floods across the CONUS...|$|R
40|$|Many of {{the legacy}} {{reference}} datums on our flood control projects, hurricane protection projects, river <b>gages,</b> <b>reference</b> pools, flow lines, flood stage, etc, are not referenced to the federal National Spatial Reference System (NSRS), and as such cannot be easily incorporated into hydrologic, hydraulic, flood inundation, and risk assessment models, or related to regional reference datums being used by other local. state, and federal agencies. The methodology used to shift historical or legacy survey data (e. g., NGVD 29) to NAVD 88 (the current epoch in CONUS) will vary depending upon many factors such as time, funds, accuracy requirements, etc. The most accurate (and costly) method is to re-observe each and every benchmark used for an old survey of interest. Even {{with the establishment of}} new elevations we can only estimate the changes that have taken place between then and now. The relationship between the surveyed features and the control marks may have also changed due to subsidence, settlement, or NSRS readjustments. Generally there are four methods to determine the datum/epoch shift. a. Field Measurements with Known Historical Elevation(s) : This method will yield the most accurate values based on the historical reference bench marks. The reference bench marks will need to be recovered and occupied/surveyed using OPUS, RTK, or othe...|$|R
