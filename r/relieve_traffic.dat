5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, State Senator Jeff Van Drew {{introduced}} {{a plan for}} an extension of Route55 into Cape May County where the South Jersey Transportation Authority would build the road. In {{order to reduce the}} impact on the environment, the freeway would have been elevated. The extension of Route55 would have been tolled. This effort followed two years of failed attempts for a feasibility study to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> on Route47.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the {{twinning}} of the skyway, the QEW was widened {{to eight}} lanes between Burlington Street in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway2) in Burlington, and to six lanes {{north to the}} Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, changeable message signs and traffic cameras were added {{to create a new}} traffic-management system called COMPASS. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built {{at the same time to}} <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> on Beach Boulevard. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{had begun}} on September 22, 1966, and the {{interchange}} was {{to replace the}} intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86 million. The eight-lane freeway was projected to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena. Completion of both the interchange and SR 109 was planned for early 1969. The ramp from south I-5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968, with {{the remainder of the}} project to be completed in summer 1969. The entire project was completed in September, with the road scheduled to open in October; just a few months before, the routing of SR 209 had been determined. The routing of SR 109 was officially added to I-8 in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the general}} public felt that tolling made the highway a luxury rather than its {{original}} purpose of <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> on Highway401, Highway 407 ETR has had average daily trip counts of over 350,000 vehicles in June 2014.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{function}} of the A 559, besides <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> at the A 4 interchange, is to connect the Cologne-Bonn Airport to Cologne proper. The airport is along the A 59, one junction south of the A 559's southern terminus.|$|R
5|$|SR750 was {{established}} in 1937, ran from SR257 to its junction with SR 315. In 1997, SR750 was extended eastward from SR315, crossing Olentangy River and US 23 via Powell Road, then following Polaris Parkway around to a new eastern terminus at I-71 in the far northern end of Columbus. Ten years later, a new interchange was built for Gemini Place at I-71, north of SR 750. The interchange would <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> in the area. The next year, SR750's westernmost portion was re-routed to the south, onto an all-new alignment that brought its western terminus {{in line with the}} intersection of SR257 and County Road 126 (Glick Road), after an expansion to the Columbus Zoo. In September 2013, a slope stabilization project began for SR 315, and turn lanes are currently being added for SR 315 and SR 750's intersection.|$|E
5|$|A four-lane divided bypass of Urbana was {{constructed}} for MD 355 in the 2000s. The {{primary reason for}} constructing the bypass was to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> heading through the community {{brought on by the}} construction of numerous shopping centers in the area, and the costs for constructing the bypass were entirely paid for by the developers of an area shopping center. The proposal for the bypass called for two roundabouts to control traffic. The first portion of the road opened in late 2005 from MD 355 south to a roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. On October 30, 2008, construction began to build the connection of the bypass to MD 355 south of MD 80. The bypass was completed by January 2009, at which point MD355 was realigned onto it and the former alignment became MD355 Bus. In 2013, maintenance of the bypass of MD355 around Urbana was transferred from the developers to the state.|$|E
5|$|East of Williamstown, US 322 {{follows the}} Black Horse Pike, a turnpike between Camden and Atlantic City {{that was created}} in 1855. Pre-1927 Route 18S was {{designated}} along {{the portion of the}} current route east of McKee City in 1923, with the US 40 designation along this portion following in 1926. In 1927, Route 18S became Route 48 and Route 42 was designated along the road between Williamstown and McKee City. US 322 was extended to New Jersey in 1936, running from a ferry dock on the Delaware River in Bridgeport east to Williamstown, where it followed Route 42 and U.S. Route 40/Route 48 to Atlantic City. In 1938, Route 55 was legislated along US 40/US 322 in Atlantic City while in 1939, US 322 between the ferry dock and Route 44 (now US 130) became Route S44 and the route between there and Route 42 became Route 51. In 1953, the state highway designations were removed from US 322. After the Commodore Barry Bridge opened in 1974, the old approach to the ferry dock became Route 324. In 1960, a freeway was proposed for US 322 in Gloucester County, running from the site of the Commodore Barry Bridge to Williamstown. This $59.6 million proposal was canceled by the 1970s due to diversion of funds to mass transit. Subsequent proposals for freeways in 1983 and 1995 also failed. A bypass of Mullica Hill was completed in 2012 for US 322 in order to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> through that town; the former alignment is now unsigned US 322 Bus.|$|E
50|$|The neighbourhood’s Main Street, Shuafat Road, was {{previously}} part of route 60. In the 1990s a new route {{was built to}} the east of the neighbourhood, a dual carriageway with 3 lines in each direction, <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion along the road.|$|R
25|$|Huddersfield Corporation {{built an}} inner ring road, {{part of the}} A62, in the 1970s. The area within the ring road now defines the town's central {{business}} district. The ring road <b>relieves</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion in the town centre where many roads are pedestrianised.|$|R

25|$|To <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion, Buckley {{proposed}} charging cars a fee {{to enter}} the central city and creation {{of a network of}} bike lanes. He opposed a civilian review board for the New York Police Department, which Lindsay had recently introduced to control police corruption and install community policing. Buckley finished third with 13.4% of the vote, possibly having inadvertently aided Lindsay's election by instead taking votes from Democratic candidate Abe Beame.|$|E
25|$|In their report, the Hansen team {{argued that}} the earlier studies were based on {{incorrect}} assumptions and thus failed to consider other approaches to solve Singapore’s transport problems. Rather than a MRT system, the Hansen team recommended a high performance all-bus system coupled with feeder routes and motorcar restraint. Even if Singapore were to develop a MRT system, the team suggested that only one line be built as they believed {{that this would be}} sufficient to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion and allow the bus system to function.|$|E
50|$|The neighbourhood’s Main Street, Beit Hanina Road, was {{previously}} part of route 60. In the 1990s a new route {{was built to}} the east of the neighbourhood, a dual carriageway with 3 lanes in each direction, <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion along the road.

50|$|In Singapore, {{community}} centres {{are distinct}} buildings that are officially {{designated by the}} government of Singapore.

Enrichment and grassroots organization are their functions like most other community centres, but <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion concerns by placing community centres nearby is also another reason.|$|R
50|$|The {{road was}} built between 1979 and 1980 {{to connect the}} eastern end of Highway 101 and to {{accommodate}} nearby truck (mainly B-Train) traffic from the nearby Burnside Industrial Park, <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> {{from the center of the}} former town of Bedford and the steep hill entering the town. The posted speed limit is 90 km/h (55 mph).|$|R
25|$|The Metro Green Line {{opened in}} 1995. Its {{right-of-way}} was planned from conception {{to be entirely}} isolated and protected, running in the median of Interstate 105, the Century Freeway west from Norwalk, connecting at Rosa Parks Station with Metro Blue Line, then further west to Los Angeles International Airport, and then south on elevated tracks to Redondo Beach. The Century Freeway, named for Century Blvd. the equivalent of 100th St., was the world's first freeway built to bypass and <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion from another freeway – the 91, Artesia Freeway.|$|E
25|$|Planners {{conceived}} the parkway {{in the mid-1980s}} as the East–West Parkway, {{an extension of the}} existing Wurzbach Road, to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> on I-410. The road, estimated to cost $90 million, was approved by the Texas Transportation Commission in 1988, to be built by the state but funded in part by the City of San Antonio. Construction began in mid-1994 on the section between Wetmore Road and Nacogdoches Road and opened in July 1996. and the eastern portion of the roadway opened on August 26, 1999, allowing traffic to bypass I-410. The west section was opened on July 24, 2002, its fourth section opened on December 23, 2013. In September 2015, the central stretch of the parkway opened to traffic, effectively completing the project after 21 years.|$|E
25|$|As proposed, {{the line}} would have {{followed}} the Willamette Shore Trolley (WST) right-of-way, extending from the current SW Lowell St. terminus down SW Moody Avenue and proceeding along the WST right-of-way to Lake Oswego, with a terminus near a shopping center at N State St. and North Shore Blvd. The WST alignment was thought to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion on Oregon Route 43, which parallels it and on some sections has steep hillsides {{where it would be}} cost-prohibitive to widen the highway. The route would have had 10 or 11 stations along the alignment and would be mostly double-track with two or three single-track segments where the alignment is too narrow to widen. Stops would be at Hamilton Ct., Boundary St., Pendleton St., Carolina St., Nevada St., Sellwood Bridge, Riverwood Rd., Briarwood Rd., 'B' Ave., and the terminus. Up to 400 park-and-ride spaces would have been included near the terminus.|$|E
50|$|The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has {{advocated}} opening Yokota {{to civilian}} flights {{as a method}} of <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> at Haneda and Narita Airport. Governor Shintaro Ishihara raised the joint-use proposal during the 2003 gubernatorial election, and Governor Naoki Inose made comments in 2013 that suggested joint use as a possible solution to cope with visitor demand during the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.|$|R
50|$|The 21.5 km North-South Corridor will {{stretch from}} Woodlands and Sembawang {{to the western}} end of the East Coast Parkway, <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> on the {{congested}} Central Expressway.

The Land Transport Authority announced that the NSC will be transformed to Singapore’s first integrated transport corridor featuring continuous bus lanes and cycling trunk routes, throughout the length of the route.|$|R
50|$|The Drežnik Viaduct is {{the largest}} and the most {{significant}} structure on the Karlovac - Bosiljevo 1 section of the A1 motorway, which carries the transit traffic between Zagreb {{in the north and}} Rijeka and Split in the south, and channels it away from the Karlovac city centre, dramatically reducing travel times between those cities and <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion from the D1 state road running through Karlovac, which was especially severe during summer seasons.|$|R
25|$|Efforts {{have been}} made to follow the {{examples}} of major redevelopment occurring in Astoria, Long Island City, Flushing, and Downtown Brooklyn. In 2005, the New York City Department of City Planning drafted a plan that would rezone 368 blocks of Jamaica in order to stimulate new development, <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion, and shift upscale amenities away from low-density residential neighborhoods. The plan includes up-zoning the immediate areas around Jamaica Station to accommodate passengers traveling through the area. To improve infrastructure the New York City Department of Parks & Recreation has agreed to create more greenery and open spaces to allow pedestrians to enjoy the scenery. At the same time, the city has reserved the right to protect the suburban/residential charm of neighboring areas. Several blocks will be down-zoned {{to keep up with the}} existing neighborhood character. On September 10, 2007, the City Council overwhelmingly approved the plan, providing for structures of up to 28 stories to be built around the main transit hub as well as residential buildings of up to 7 stories to be built on Hillside Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{criticism}} is that money is being spent on the rich {{at the expense of}} the poor. Critics contend that it does not serve any of the townships of Gauteng where the transport problem is severe and where the majority of the people live. However, supporters maintain that the train was never meant to be an alternative to mass public transport; instead, it was intended to reduce pressure on Johannesburg's overloaded highway system. Figures released by the Gauteng provincial government in 2003 indicated that the project would do little to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> on the over-used Ben Schoeman Highway (one of the major motivations for the project), as traffic volumes would be higher when the Gautrain was completed and operating at full capacity in 2010. Leftist political groupings like the SACP and labour movements like COSATU branded the Gautrain as a train for the rich and called on government not to proceed with the project. A national parliamentary oversight body, the Transport Portfolio Committee, held public hearings in November 2005 and subsequently advised Cabinet to scrap or postpone the project. However, National Cabinet decided on 7 December 2005 to financially support Gautrain.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, {{businessman}} {{and chairman of}} The Press, George Gould, proposed a variety of measures to <b>relieve</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion in Colombo Street and Cathedral Square, including a new bridge over the Avon River connecting Oxford Terrace with Durham Street south, and a new diagonal street from the Armagh Street / Manchester Street intersection to Gloucester Street near its intersection with Colombo Street. The latter proposal would have required the demolition of the Colosseum. Gould suggested this diagonal street be called Little High Street, {{in reference to the}} diagonal High Street further south in the central city. Only two weeks after Gould's proposal, a group of businessman led by Arthur Francis Stacey put a proposal for a new street with a Spanish theme to Christchurch City Council's town planning committee. The group had secured options on the Colosseum and on those two properties that separated the Colosseum from access onto Armagh Street. The plans had been drawn by Francis Willis, who had previously been employed by Christchurch City Council as their architect, but who had since 1924 been self-employed. Stacey and his business partners had formed a company called Regent Street Limited in 1929; other company directors were David Manson, Alexander Hamilton Forbes, and John Joseph Dougall. By February 1930, the project had been approved in principle by Christchurch City Council. The concept of a number of small shops all built as a comprehensive development was advanced for its time, and can be regarded as the forerunner of modern shopping malls.|$|E

50|$|As well as <b>relieving</b> <b>traffic</b> congestion, the Black Country Spine Road also {{opened up}} several {{square miles of}} {{previously}} inaccessible land around Wednesbury and Tipton. This allowed for commercial and light industrial development to take place and create jobs in an area which since the 1970s {{had been hit by}} de-industrialisation and unemployment. Unemployment figures in some of the area surrounding the Spine Road are still relatively high, but the businesses set up along the route have no doubt been an asset to the local economy.|$|R
